												Note: Review done after finishing the game on 'Captain Difficulty'.First, the scores I give this game:Story-line: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 9/10Audio: 10/10Controls: (KB&Mouse) 5/10Target audiance: Masochists.EDIT:Since people were devastated by the scoring I gave, I will explain my scoring ""scale"":10 - Up there with the best of the best!9 - Very good!8 - Good.7 - ""Ok"", could be better, but it's ok.6 - ""Acceptable"". It's not bad, but at this point it's not really good either.5 - Mid-point. Barely passable. Barely. I can ignore it if the rest is good enough.[ The rest of my scale was not used, so I will not add it. ]What's important to understand is, when I judge a game, I do so taking into account *when* the game was created. Obviously, I don't expect older games to have graphics on par with resent ones, for example.Pros:Challanging:Smart ♥♥♥ me thought to myself, ""Hey, I've got about 15 years of RPG experience, I'll just go straight for 'Captain' difficulty! How bad can it be?""...I was an idiot. Bound by Flame, on Captain, proved to be one of the most challanging games I've ever played, by far.Every enemy in this game has it's own mechanics, which encourage a different approach, and on this difficulty, every minion you encounter might be the one that will kill you.This is one of those rare games where you'll find yourself saving, after defeating even the lowliest of minions.It does make winning feel a whole lot greater.Graphics:While the graphics are not 'Crysis level', they are pretty good, certainly enjoyable.Audio:Great soundtrack, enjoyable to the ear. Comes in complete contrast to the horrifying screams of frustration you will release.Choice:You have a decision-based system here that does have an impact on the game, if not 'world-changing'.It's not really like, say, Mass Effect, but it's nice. Crafting:The game has a minimal crafting system, not much at all, really,  but just enough as a side-feature to support a game with other focuses.You can use it to create certain consumables, as well as to break items into matirials, and use those matirials for both creating consumables, and upgrading your gear.Half-Way-Between-Pro-And-Con:It's worth mentioning that the story-line in the game is nice, I like it, but it does feel like a... Summed up version of a bigger story-line.Cons:The AI:The AI that ""helps"" you in the fights, your partners... How do I put this... They are stupid.They are beyond stupid. And mostly useless.They put themselves in danger often, and can't really hold their own for very long.Fighting-controls:This is my one main issue with this game. The controls, at least when using a keyboard&mouse, are horrible for fighting.It's not game-breaking at all, it's very duable, you just need to learn how it works, it's just very very annoying.Conclusion:Highly recommended. Briliant game that is, without a doubt, worth a buy.If you enjoy RPGs so hard you want to comete genocide, this game is for you.I hope this is helpful. I am dead tired, superbly happy after finally defeating thew last boss and finishing it, but primarily tired.Ziv.			"

												In Bound by Flame you'll control Vulcan, a mercenary in a world where the Lords of Ice seek to destroy humanity and seize power through their undead and demonic armies. Events see you becoming the host of a demonic entity that promises you great powers if you let it take some control over you and said powers might be the only thing that'd defeat the Lords.While not an horrible game Bound by Flame is sadly plagued by several cliches in its story and characters while sporting a combat system that is a bit too clunky for the challenges you'll be facing.PROS:-most character and monster models are pretty detailed, the hero character stands out as his/her armor and weapons change depending on what you equip and what upgrades you craft-great soundtrack-if you accept its influence the gradual changes in the hero's body and voice as the demon takes over are quite interesting and well represented-lots of weapons/armor to find or buy, all of them can also be upgraded-good amount of skills/skill upgrades to choose from when you level up: you'll have three main ""classes"" (warrior,dual-wielding ranger and caster) and can spend points wherever you wish while freely switching between each during combatCONS:-dull story, lots of cliches in the plot-dialogues are, for the most part, just boring and drawn-out: there's also a few attempts at humour that are way out of place-companion characters are unoriginal (elf archer, somewhat evil female witch etc) -story decisions don't matter that much and you'll still be visiting the same locations with only a few quests changing slightly-world graphics are pretty average and boring, colors feel a bit washed out and lights are too harsh-animations are ok in combat but look quite wooden during cutscenes-level design is boring and uninspired, most consist of a few areas connected my corridor-like paths, there's also little in the way of embellishments leading to them looking bare-voice acting is quite weak overall-companion AI is bad, they seldom dodge and are happy to stay in AOE damage: enemy AI can also sometimes act up-combat system is decent per se, but you'll be asked to face several enemies at once and go through parries/attacks/interrupts with good timing if you want to live: sadly while the enemies attack quickly the controls don't feel responsive enough to make things work well-combat difficulty is a bit all over the place requiring silly workarounds by using the enemy AI against itself to make things easier: last boss is also laughably hard unless you use a certain strategy to beat it-little variety in enemy types and models

Bound by Flame feels like a missed opportunity to be honest as, while the premise sounds interesting, the plot itself is so similar to many other games/movies to soon become uninteresting: things are made worse when said plot is delivered by poor voice actors behind characters that are quite flat and nondescript.A generic and dull story might be forgiven if the game gave you a good time during combat but sadly it falls flat even there: you'll often face too many enemies at once and their attacks can frequently interrupt yours or stun you thus leaving you unable to defend yourself, this'll be a quick death on anything but the easiest difficulty level. Some spells or abilities also take too long to cast considering how quickly you're supposed to react, 3 seconds to cast a war cry as a warrior? No thanks.So to make things easier you can-and it's actually encouraged- cheat the enemy AI by pulling one of a group or, if it fails, fighting a bit and then retreating until they disengage so that you can wait for health/mana to recharge and attack again. This isn't really fun and clashes with the sense of grandiose that a supposedly badass, demon-possessed hero'd be feeling.I can't recommend the game as I feel there are way better options if you're looking for a good story, good combat or both: as said it's not horrible and it works for the most part but it's so generic, dull and frustrating that even on sale I'd recommend it only for someone desperate for an action RPG fix and willing to overlook its many blemishes.

												(TLDR? This review is also available in video format below for your convenience.)Developer Spiders is a small studio that isn’t lacking ambition, after what was considered a major disappointment with Mars War Logs, they’ve tried yet again to craft a title whose quality is equal to its ambition with their new fantasy action RPG; Bound By Flame.Set in the kingdom of Vertiel, a region besieged by a massive undead army that’s invading from the north. A group of mages known as the Red Scribes think they’ve found a way to combat this threat and are fast at work performing a ritual. You assume the role of Vulcan, a member of the Freeborn Blades, a mercenary group that has been hired to protect the Red Scribes while they conduct their research. Things are quickly interrupted as a Deadwalker army attacks their position and amidst the carnage, something goes wrong with the ritual resulting in Vulcan becoming possessed by a Fire Demon. The Demon talks to you throughout the game, offering advice or seeking to manipulate Vulcan; ultimately playing a part in the game’s moral choices as listening to the Demon can make your character appear more demonic, bolstering magical prowess at the expense of your character’s well-being or you can choose to ignore the Demon and preserve Vulcan’s humanity. Regardless of your decision, it’s clear that Vulcan is the only one able to stand up to the Ice Lords, a group of warmongering necromancers that control the vast undead armies.Upon starting the game, you’re greeted with a brief character creation screen which only gives you a few very limited options in terms of designing your character before being awkwardly thrust into an awful tutorial section. This tutorial simply acts to highlight all of the flaws of Bound by Flame along with constant interruptions explaining the game’s various mechanics. You’ll immediately notice a lack of pacing, awkward dialogue and voice acting as well as an unmatched feeling of linearity. This leads to a very poor first impression, however gritting your teeth and pushing through this period of misery has its rewards as the game shows signs of competency later on.After completing the tutorial, the half-baked writing immediately improves giving rise to an interesting narrative with surprisingly strong character development. Similar to The Witcher 2 and other titles, you’re faced with moral decisions that can have an effect on the game however these changes are fairly minor comparatively but still add some elements of re-playability. The decisions aren’t cleverly thought out or morally ambiguous like The Witcher 2, instead there’s generally a clear good and evil answer. This still did well to hold my interest and watching Vulcan gradually lose his humanity in favor of becoming more demonic and powerful was a welcomed addition to the game.Along with Vulcan, there are several companions that accompany him on his journey. These characters have been greatly improved from Mars War Logs, each having their own developed story however their proficiency in combat remains the same, often dying very quickly and doing very little to aid Vulcan. The option to romance these characters also exists depending on which gender you made Vulcan however there is little development between characters and much less chemistry making romance seem like it was only added to cover all of the features offered by superior RPGs like Mass Effect and Dragon Age.Not content to simply borrow the moral choices featured in The Witcher 2, the combat is more or less identical, with two different primary melee attacks along with traps and magic. Parrying and dodging also plays a vital role. The combat while simple is quite satisfying and requires a bit of skill and timing to master. While nowhere near on the level of Dark Souls, it’s still quite solid for an RPG. The RPG elements are surprisingly deep as well, offering three different talent trees along with an in-depth crafting system. There’s a warrior stance that has Vulcan don a 2 hand sword which boosts his parrying and defensive abilities while his ranger stance equips 2 daggers, drastically increasing his speed and stealth capabilities. The third talent tree is directly related to the Demon inside of him, which consists of boosting his magical prowess and fire abilities. Playing on the normal hawk difficulty will provide a reasonable challenge and despite being simple, the combat is definitely the highlight of the game. It isn’t without flaw though as parrying or dodging an attack perfectly will result in Vulcan performing a counter-attack which can sometimes be a detriment to dodging or running away in general. Despite this, the combat is still satisfying and I never felt bored throughout its brief campaign.The soundtrack is quite unusual, focusing on a lot of vocal chants mixed with percussion. It still fits the game well and adds to the overall experience. The rest of the audio is hit or miss though, particularly the voice acting. Some characters play the part well, while others are abysmal. It’s hard to tell whether it’s the actor’s fault or just the writing in general as the dialogue can be laughably bad at times. It’s inconsistent in general, particularly the tutorial which almost made me stop playing the game entirely while at other times, I found the narrative, setting, and characters to be engaging. This inconsistency is even apparent in Vulcan’s personality as he can sometimes act like a jerk with no rhyme or reasoning behind it. It leads me to believe that Spiders suffers from having one or two incompetent writers or maybe it’s just a case of poor translation. If this wasn’t enough, the audio can glitch out at times, often causing characters to repeat the same line over and over again.The visuals and environments are well done. It’s just a shame that the game is extremely linear as the many sidequests are usually confined to a small area, leaving very little room for exploration. There’s also the odd graphical glitch, such as disappearing textures and pop-in. Despite the graphical overhaul, the facial animations are on-par with Mars War Logs as characters will simply move their lips while giving a blank expressionless stare.Borrowing from The Witcher again, the game tries to separate itself into acts. Upon arriving at a new location, Vulcan will be given a host of sidequests to complete while simultaneously progressing the main story until he completes the area and moves on. Unfortunately, the game is rather short for an action RPG, running around 15 hours if you complete all of the sidequests. The poor writing rears its ugly head once more before the game's credits roll, as there’s quite a bit of buildup, and without spoiling anything, the game ends rather abruptly when there easily could have been room for another 10-20 hours of content. Ultimately, Bound By Flame is greater than the sum of its parts and certainly an improvement over Mars War Logs as it features a solid narrative, refined combat system and deep RPG elements. It’s a step in the right direction, although once again a bit too ambitious a project for Spiders to handle. Although it has many flaws, it is still an enjoyable experience but let’s just hope they hire some better writers next time.

												I generally hate it when people reduce a work in any medium down to what it bears the most obvious similarities to. It strikes me as doing a disservice to the work, and more to the point, as being critically lazy. The problem when discussing something like Bound by Flame, then, is that you really can’t get around doing so, because it is very deliberately meant to be a low-priced spin on Dragon Age. It’s got enough of its own merits that it comes off as a homage or a work by fans rather than a deliberate case of follow-the-leader, with a surprisingly funny script, although it completely loses focus as you move into the third chapter, and a combat engine that has some genuinely interesting ideas built into it. The problem is that it’s not quite done yet, although there’s enough here that a theoretical sequel could be something special. The player in Bound by Flame is Vulcan, a build-your-own hero in the Bioware tradition who has given up his or her previous life to serve as a demolitions specialist in a mercenary company called the Freeborn Blades. The Blades, as the game starts, are one of the only surviving organized groups in the world of Vertiel, which is currently under siege by an army of undead led by the Lords of Ice. Most nations have fallen, with the elves left as the last civilization standing, and all the Lords have to do is cleanup. The Blades are hired to provide security for another organization, the Red Scribes, as they conduct a ritual that’s meant to provide some last chance at survival, if not victory. Vulcan’s in the wrong place at the wrong time as the ritual concludes and ends up as the unwitting host of a previously-unknown entity: a demon with powers over flame. The central ethical issue in Bound by Flame is how much free rein you’re going to give the demon. The more power you get from it, the more it changes Vulcan’s body; soon your skin darkens to black, you sprout horns, and you end up with parts of your body constantly on fire. If you side with the surviving humans and try to save as many of them as you can along the way, you deny the demon. If you listen to its advice and ignore all other concerns in the name of gaining enough power to challenge the Lords directly, you give the demon what it wants. The demon’s abilities represent one of three skill trees that are available to you. The Warrior tree uses a single two-handed sword and focuses on damage resistance, sheer power, and delivering massive damage with a few slow swings. The Ranger tree combines stealth and rapid attacks into a sort of swashbuckler option, sacrificing damage resistance in favor of dodges and counterattacks. Finally, the Pyromancer tree provides you with ways to set the undead on fire. You can switch between the three skill trees at will and improve each one point by point every time you level up. Each has an ultimate ability that’s unlocked when you invest at least 24 points into it, and heavy investment in a single tree makes the game a very different experience. In practice, you’re going to be a Warrior or Ranger with occasional points spent in Pyromancer, and both approaches are intuitive and reasonably fun with a little practice. The enemies telegraph their attacks far enough in advance that you can figure out ways to deal with them, and you have a number of alternate options like explosive traps and a crossbow that you can use to help even the odds. If anything, the skill trees are too top-heavy. If you try to spread your points around, the early areas will prove difficult. You really want to improve Burning Weapon as fast as you can, because even standard enemies tend to have tons of health, and whatever you can do to whittle them down is worth doing. In fact, one of the major criticisms I have of Bound by Flame is its difficulty. The combat system feels pretty good once you get used to it, but any enemy with the ability to knock you down can easily kill you, and there won’t be much you can do about it. Some kind of rapid recovery or roll would go a long way towards removing the frustration.You can have a companion NPC with you for most of the game, but they’re usually not a factor aside from absorbing a few stray hits; enemies usually mob your companion straight away and kill him or her, then turn to you once they’re done. You have to work around that tendency for companions to be worth a damn. They all seem to have a death wish, and it’s rare that they survive even a simple fight. In short, Bound by Flame feels like it’s harder than it needs to be. Standard enemies are tough enough to kill you in a few lucky hits, bosses can send you flying or corner you with little difficulty, and it’s rare that a death feels fair. The graphics don’t necessarily impress strictly from a technical standpoint. You won’t be wowed by intricate detail or uber-authentic realism. You might even find the dark, forbidding world oppressive. Even so, there are many who will appreciate such an atmosphere, as the ambiance fits the action perfectly, and the style is what you’d expect from a fantastical, medieval-type adventure. The sound fluctuates between some generic hack ‘n slash combat effects and an inspired soundtrack that really takes shape during dangerous encounters. On the plus side, I don’t usually notice the musical score in such games, but I definitely noticed this one. It ratcheted up the intensity a few notches, and it’s not overly repetitive. The voice acting is largely forgettable, but overall, the audio and graphics work together to present the player with a world that demands our attention. All in all, Bound by Flame is a really fun game taken down only by its not-so-great story and voice acting. If that’s something you can get past to play a good action RPG, then this is surely a game you should have no qualms about picking up. If you’re more inclined to wince and shudder at poor dialogue and acting, then I suggest you give this one a pass.			"

												Here's a simple pro's and con's list for those who want to know right away if it's their cup of tea...Pro's-Decent voice acting on the most important npcs -Very challenging on even the ""normal"" difficulty in combat-Can decide whether to be ""good"" or ""evil""-Excellent music-Interesting enemy types and companions -Decent graphics Now the cons...-A wee bit short (only took me 15 hours doing everything for 1 playthrough)-Some wanky animations and non-lazy animations (ex. many people in the towns don't even move...they look frozen)-Cut Scenes can have clipping issues and the hero killing enemies sometimes looks weird to say the least-End boss can be a MAJOR PAIN (make sure you stock up on healing and mana potions)-Romances in the game are very shortDespite all these pro's and con's all in all the game is at the very least a solid 7 out of 10 when all is said and done...Worthy of your time if you like action RPG's that have challenging combat with a decent storyline...pick it up if you see it for $20 or less!

												So, I'll start out by saying there is no way this game is worth the £29,99 price tag that it has currently - at most it should be £20 and even that could be said to be pushing it. The graphics look pretty good to be honest, yes you may need quite a beefy rig to play them on full, but they are well worth it. The actual game play represents a classic Action Game, consisting all of the usuals, heavy attacks, blocks, swipe attacks, as well as your magic abilities. The combt system can feel a little clunky to begin with, but once you work out the timings on when to block and parry attacks, it's OK. I would say the mainstory is a little short for the price tag. I finished the game in just under fourteen hours. I would highly recommend you finish the majority of the side missions as to get a few levels advantage over the story, as some of the end bosses are quite challenging. That being said, the bosses in Bound by Flame have a very Dark Souls'esk feel to them. You have to work out the best stratergy to take them down, often resulting in a number of failed attempts before it finally clicks. All in all, this is a pretty good game, but I would wait until sale season starts before you pick it up since it is certainly not worth the full price tag.			"

												Bound by Lies, I had high hopes for this game. Me and a friend of mine saw it pop up on steam a while ago and pre ordered it. **SPOILERS**The review will have some plot points as its one of the many issues with this game.We were so disapointed, il let him make a review if he wants so I will tell it all from my perspective. The trailers have lied, the combat isnt adaptable or planned etc. Its broken. As a Warrior I found it boring and repetative, then with some enemies having the ability to not be stunned or blocked you come across enemies that chain stun you in a corner and kill you. Over and over. But I got over that, I carried on playing and found plenty of other flaws.The ability of choise is an illusion, there are basically 2 options, become a demon and kill everyone you care about or stay good and I can assume not kill everyone. I became a demon and after that the game was basically set in stone. I had the odd decision to make, weather its to kill 1 boss and let others be killed or help in a battle. But it dosent seem to matter, the game is on rails and basically makes the decision for you and you companion is now screwed over, runs off and vows revenge. Which he tries to get but fails miserably, you dont even have the option to try and talk people down like in Mass Effect or get told the ""Good"" or ""Bad"" options, you get streamlined down a boring story that makes no sense. The characters are not likeable at all, you dont really care about who lives or dies, I just found myself frustrated that I couldnt prevent mit if I decided.They also said that the classes are different and theres different ways to play the game, the only tallent tree I didnt fill was the Rogue tree and that was because it was pointless. II filled the warrior tree and used all of its 4 abities that were generic and boring, I had the Pyromancy tree half done so I gave my weapon flames and that was about it really. From what I could see and heard from my friend Pyromancy is just throwing fireballs running out of Mana then giving your weapon fire and going into melee to be diisapointed as you suck in melee but have no other choise. I dont really have much more to say on this since I didnt play it to its full extent. One positive of this game is that its incredibly pretty, they have done a fantastic job with the graphics and the design of the weapons and armor is great, you really do feel like a badass when you upgrade your gear through a very simple yet effective crafting system. Thats a couple of positives but you get the idea.In summary, dont buy the game now. Its a badly thought out poor quality rpg that forces you to make decisions that in the end dont matter, get it when its on sale. I finished the game in 13  hours and for £25 I was upset about this. Id say its worth £10 max. My friend playing Pyro finished it in 7. I dont knkow if its me sucking taking that long or Pyros just easier.Hope this was Helpful.			"

Combined with the script losing cohesion at around the halfway point, Bound by Flame has an unfinished, generally unpolished feel that sometimes makes it a frustrating game to play.It’s entertaining enough despite its faults that it’s worth checking out. If Spiders gets the chance to put together a sequel, with a more cohesive story and another pass or two on the combat system, this could be the start of a fun series.Recommended "

												Pros:+ Cool Idea+ Decent Graphics+ Some interesting and somewhat conflicting moral choicesCons:- Sub-par voice acting and horrible dialogue- Zero character development of horribly flat characters- Seriously nothing attached me to the companions. Couldn't have cared less if they died.- Clunky and somewhat awkward combat system- Short plot with very little narrative (basically wanting you to focus on the ""possessed by a demon"" idea to distract from the skeleton bare plot and narrative)- Obscure and very selective character relation mechanics- Unorginal, cliche ideas (literally feels like the storyline and numerous character models were pulled from Dragon Age and other fantasy RPGs)- Generally inconsistant with itselfI apologize - I really have very little to say that's positive about this game. I discovered the game prior to its release and was insanely excited from what I saw. Fast forward 6 months-1 year and discovered it again in a Steam Sale and bought it at almost full price (which I rarely do). 13.5 hours is all it takes to get to the end boss, even with doing every side quest I could get my hands on. It is a very linear plot and I found myself rather disappointed at every turn with what the developers could have done with such an interesting and unique game idea. I had to force myself to sit down and try and get through the game to the end so I feel I had gotten some of my money's worth back, and, well, barring that... I can at least give a review for the game. I wouldn't recommend this game to hard-core/serious RPG players, seeing as it lacks in these very qualities that I had hoped/expected from it. If you're looking for a good soundtrack, the music isn't bad and the art is creatively inspired, if somewhat repetitive. I can't say much more than I don't recommend this game. I got to the final boss, exited out of the game, and immediately uninstalled it, having no desire to play this game again. If you're looking for a pass time and this game is on-sale for +75%, feel free - otherwise you're being cheated out of your money.			"

Enjoyable but rather one-sided action-rpg.Bound by Flame is an action-rpg developed by Spiders Entertainment, the company that recently gave us The Technomancer. The game was released in May 2014 to subdued critical acclaim: currently it stands at 65% positive user-reviews on Steam and it only received a 56% score at Metacritic. Judging by those figures, it wouldn't seem like a game worthy to give a thorough playthrough, but in the end I am very glad I gave it a proper try.The developers at Spiders, a small- to mid-size company, surely have been specializing in action-rpg's over the past couple of years. And their experience does show in Bound by Flame. At first sight, and during its first minutes of playing, the game doesn't feel special, or even good, at all. The story is once more one about the player having to save the world, this time against a horde of deadly Ice-Lords. The only twist is that as the protagonist you are possessed by a demon, and that by giving in or resisting to that entity, you can influence character development and playstyle (but only to a certain degree).The story itself is by no means original and got only a couple of interesting twists during the 30 hours or so that my playthrough lasted. The different characters, most of them companions or allies in your combat against the evil Ice Lords, are hardly fleshed out at all – most of them are drawn inside the well-known lines of knight, archer or mage without any real personality. Happily, there are a few exceptions, such as an hilariously funny undead king, who peppers the latter part of the game with some wonderful lines which made me laugh out loud. This kind of black humour was an unexpected element of the game, and definitely helped me to get past some of its more repetitive parts.Character development is pretty well done: by leveling up, one can spend attribute points, which can be put into one of three perk trees. One is warrior-like, focusing on two-handed combat, the other one is perfect for a more agile character, and finally there is a magic skilltree which unlocks both defensive and offensive fire magic. In combination with craftable weapons and armor, this offers a kind of rpg-light experience – not on the highest or deepest level, but still enjoyable nonetheless.The one department where Bound by Flame really shines, is in its smooth and very intuitive  combat. Playing with an Xbox 360-controller, the combat proved to be both exceptionally fluid and very rewarding. Running into battle without thinking would mostly result in a quick death, so a plan of action and some preparation was often needed. Good use of the available means – skills, potions and quick actions such as parry or jump back – turned out to be essential on several occasions, and learning to use them as efficiently as possible was very rewarding indeed. Several boss-like characters offered quite a challenge; some of them even drove me close to the point of giving up, but I'm glad I persisted. Neither graphically or in its audio department does Bound by Flame shine, but it doesn't drop any major points here either.All in all, this game is more than the sum of its parts: the extremely well implemented combat manages to lift it to a higher level, and although there is nearly not enough variety in environments or in enemies, it managed to hold my interest right to the end.Recommended to everyone who likes challenging action more than the role-playing in an a-rpg.

												Bound By Flame is a step forward for the developers since their slightly above average Mars: War Logs, it's clear that they have learned quite a bit since then. The story is interesting, the combat feels fluid but lacks heft - making it unnecessarily challenging due to bad design, and the skill-system is sufficiently deep.The character creation is a bit lacking with only 5 variations of heads/hairstyles but they get props for adding a female option.While it is certainly not a AAA game or the best game of the year with the graphics being dated and especially lip-syncing being poor - it is a decent game for fans of Action RPGs like The Witcher or Kingdoms of Amalur.Here's gameplay:

Basic InformationTitle:  Bound By FlameDeveloper:  SpidersPublisher:  Focus Home InteractiveGenre:  Role Playing GameGeneral ImpressionAn interesting RPG with beautiful graphical details that shine even through its several gameplay flaws. The combat is troublesome at times, the controls not as responsive as you'd expect and the AI has its moments of uncertainty. But the game's story is its main focal point. It's got an intriguing moral dilemma to it: How far will you go to win? The Evil path seems easier and the demonic influences upon yourself are hard to resist. And yet playing the Hero once again is a challenge worthy of any RPG player. Don't expect a Dark Souls type of difficulty but enjoy the game nonetheless. I still hope for a sequel, but sadly it never sold well enough and was always received with a lukewarm reception.Strong Points+ Beautiful graphics.+ Great storyline and characters.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- A few bugs and glitches.- Combat and the  AI are too unpredictable.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												How did this happen!How can an Action RPG game with Wonderful Music, Stunning Visual, Beautiful Character, Unique background, Cool Cut scenes, Choice and consequnce system, Interesting Talent system, Craftable/Recyclable ingrediant/item/potion and the coolest skeleton ever(Praise Mathras). Only got 67% approval rating?This game is the very first ARPG Spider studio ever made. Honestly it's not bad at all. It's like a Witcher 2 on discount and I like combat in here better then Darksoul even.(it's not a button masher! you have to time everything). (Edit 2: Ya.. and my review is getting chewed alive because of that dark souls comment.. Anyhow since I only play the tutorial stage of it.. i should really don't say this comment. O.. well i will leave it here just for laugh)Spider Stuido ventured out and tried many many different things for this game. Most of the ingrediant worked but just like a pot of stew. With a few minor flawed ingrediant and a drop of Rat goo would ruined the entire Stew!(game).Minor flaws 1: Not all idea are implemented. There is day and night system that you can rest to change time for events to happen. Much like FF: Lighting return or Baldur's gate series. But through the entire story.. you don't need to rest once. And there is only 1 event and 1 subquest that require you to go out at night.Craftable items are very interesting but you can only craft to upgrade weapons but you cannot create weapons and armors from parts.. and There are very few different type of items that you can use to craft.. It's like less then 10 types of ingrediant in the entire game. And every single type of monster in the entire game drop 1 of those 10 types of items.There are 3 different class and for Warrior class you can use 3 different type of weapon.. Sword, Axe and Hammer. But there are not too much difference between them. Even animation looks almost the same.Minor Flaw 2:Character development. The scripting of most of the story and general background is really good. But sometimes I cannot tell if it's being rushed or the story teller is drunk some time.You can feel this is a really big world with an impending unstopable army that dread upon it at the very beginning of the game. There are interesting clan of people and some really fun and unexpected event twist.. That's all good but with the 4 major partner that you have that help you on your journey are really messed up. 2 male and 2 female that you can start a small romance with much like mass effect series. And 2 other part time partner including Mr.Mathras that travels you with certain quests. There are just not enough character development for a few character to make plot change reasonable and sometime it makes you scratch your head because there are too many question marks on it. Why do my girl suddenly romance the knight and elf? No hints about that's coming ever!Minor Flaw 3:Partner AI.. Well. The enemy AI was well done.. They know when to block.. when to counter.. when to run and they even ran to call help sometimes. They fight smart and why cannot my Partner fight smart? Most of the time.. My partner just tanks 1-2 enemy and dies within a minute and buy me just enough time to kill some archers.. The combat modes and order doesn't really help. Setting on defense mode just make them live at least a bit longer so it's recommended. And finnaly the Rat Goo that ruined this great meal. It's short coming are just too short! Literally!This game is too short.. I am running 2 games at same time to get all achievements. 1 female human route on captain difficulty and 1 male demon route on vulcan difficulty. Together I finished both game back to back in just a little over 30 hours! That's including all the goofing off at easy difficulty to find all dialoge options and side quest and all the death on hard difficulty...It almost seems I finnaly got into the fun and core of the game and it suddenly ended! I am sure if another player skips all the guide and just rush though the yellow story event marker all the time and ignore all the side quest.. This game can be done in less then 6 hours! Level really doesn't mean much other then it gives some skill and talents points. You stuck on 100 hp and mp unless you finish specific quests.Over all did I enjoy this game? Yes I did for a few days.. Am I satisfied? No I am not.. IT could been a triple A title if they just made the story 3 times the current length and fix a few flaws...That's all i am gonna say.. 7.0/10 Recommended for quick Action game Lover.. RPG lovers may love and hate this game at the same time..Edit 1: My review is too long... I just had too much to say and I had to trim it down 3 times so it can fit...			"

												I can definitely see ""The Witcher"" influence in ""Bound By Flame""; if only they had taken more points from that game's design.""Bound By Flame"" is not fun, period. The combat feels clunky and I often find myself unable to execute an action because my character has not finished the animation from the previous attack. This makes it feel as though my character is drunk and unable to react quickly, The devs advertise ""strategic combat"" but it just ends up being button mashing. The counter/parry system is basic, nothing new.The graphics are quite good, with environments and NPCs being highly detailed. Animations however, particularly facial ones are quite stiff and jittery. The lip syncing is very poor, often with characters' mouth animations stopping mid sentence or finishing before the audio. At one point, while I was in a conversation with a character an NPC was spawned about 2 metres away from where I was. It was very noticable as he just appeared in mid-air and fell to the ground where he proceeded to stand and perform his normal animations. Fortunately this has only happened once, but it greatly detracted from the immersion.The voice acting is average, however I was not pleased to hear modern American colloquialisms such as ""I got"" instead of ""I've got"" in some of the characters' sentences.The story itself is fairly interesting, however it is nothing we haven't seen before and it is not enough to make up for the other problems this game has.I am maybe being too harsh on this game as ""Spiders"" are a small studio, but I have to give an honest recount of my experience with this game. In short, I  do not  recommend ""Bound By Flame"".			"

Bound by Flame is a Third-Person, Story-Driven, Action-Oriented RPG developed by Spiders & published by Focus Home Interactive, the very same duo that conceived Mars: War Logs.You are thrust into the harshness of Vertiel as Vulcan, powder master of the Freeborn Blades. The Blades along with the Elves & the Red Scribes fiercely stand as the last bastion of civilization against the might of the seven Ice Lords & their Deadwalker minions who seek to plunge Vertiel into an everlasting Ice Age. You – Vulcan – stand on the precipice of Vertiel. Will you be able to stem the frozen tide?Before embarking upon your journey, you will be met with the character creation screen. The options present are few but include the ability to change hair/face type in addition to customizing your character’s name. The option to choose gender is also present. Vertiel is a harsh & unforgiving land with varying environments, from tree-filled swamps to death-ridden sewers. The environments are linear, disjointed & feel claustrophobic at times despite much of the game taking place in outdoor locales.There are three unique skill trees – Warrior, Ranger & Pyromancer, which allow you to customize your playthrough. There are several different weapon types as well. Ultimately, you’ll have to allot skill points according to which weapon you desire to use throughout. While there is some wiggle room in the ability to customize your character, it is somewhat limited as to variability. Also present is a feat system that grants a wide array of bonuses to crafting, health/mana, exploration etc., depending on how feat points are spent. The combat feels fluid & rewarding upon dispatching your enemies into the afterlife. The boss fights are of particular note, as they are quite difficult & well-thought out in their construction. The final boss encounter was a personally euphoric experience. Even the most battle hardened will experience difficulty here.As you adventure throughout Vertiel you will encounter foes & allies alike. Foes will become friends & friends will become foes, instigated by war’s untimely wrath. Certain allies will be able to join you on your adventure & assist you in battle, providing everything from damage absorption to the critical heal that will permit the eventuality of victory. Unfortunately, their use is highly variable & they become almost useless in certain drawn-out encounters. Bound by Flame has an in-depth crafting system, enabling the crafting of potions, traps & even weapon/armor upgrades to slay the most formidable of foes. Much time can be wasted perfecting each piece of equipment to desired playstyle. The dialogue in Bound by Flame is its Achilles’ heel. It does not suit the fantasy environment in any capacity whatsoever. The facial animations are equally as poor. Coupled together they provide a major drawback for any player seeking an immersive fantasy experience. The art style & graphics provide a suitable backdrop. Other than being simply existing as a medium for the story to unravel, they don’t provide much in the way of eye candy. There is also a literal plethora of cut scenes rendered with the in-game engine. The majority of them can be skipped however, if heart longs for battle.   Olivier Deriviére, creator of the soundtrack, also creator of the soundtrack to Remember Me, pulls no punches in creating a phenomenal score that exudes both wonder & excitement. Getting lost in the different bits & pieces of it are a certainty & a joy.In conclusion, Bound by Flame is a mixed bag in the RPG genre. It flourishes in its strengths but continually stumbles upon its mistakes. Despite its drawbacks, Bound by Flame is note-worthy & very much worth a try for fans of the genre.7/10			"

												Ok, if I would have a top for my RPGs this game would make it there somewhere, not on the top but still somewhere near the top.Now let me expalin why, considering the bad reviews.  Very good story line, wich manages to keep you in the chair for hours making you wonder what will come up next(very interesting). voice acting, characters seem credible and entertaining.9/10  skill tree, upgrading a skill will realy make you feel the difference.10/10 difficulty, don't really know why but the game reminds me of dark souls somehow, not even close to its dificulty BUT the game will be quite a challange even on hawk(normal) difficulty.Try to go higher to Capitan(hardest) and be ready to face a real challange and feel the need of smashing your keyboard against the monitor, hehe. After playing rpgs like Dragon Age Inquisition and other rpgs, this game remids me how a rpg's supposed to be a challange.So yeah, you won't get away with the stuff you do when killing minions when fighting bosses, oh dear..hell no.10/10/10  your choices will make a substantial difference on the storyline, and the game appeals to your morality from time to time(wich is awesome I think 9/10)  armors and weapons are freaking awesome, each one has different designs and can be upgraded to suit your need(poison resistent, fire resistent + many many more+ each one has a different design.To be honest the armor sets in this game make it in the top three armors from any rpg I've played.Pure awesomeness.10+/10 Good  graphics, keep in mind that the game was released in mid 2014, BUT you will not run in any problem if you are after the graphics, they look very good.9/10  interface + crafting system.Very minimal BUT on point. Very little place to improve unless adding something.8/10 enemies are not dumb and if outnumbers you are ♥♥♥♥ed.8/10 one of the very few rpgs that requires using all kind of weapons(heavy two-handed swords, quick daggers, traps and magic acording to different situations) 8/10-only gave it an 8 because on the missing ability to dodge while using two-handed.  music is good, not dissapointed at all.8/10 Neutral/Bad   sometimes companions can act real dumb while fighting and can be quite unuseful(and somethimes they will save you sorry ♥♥♥).7/10 there is no dodging while using two-handed sword and  you won't have time to evade attacks that are targeting an aoe(area of effect) so your parrying won't do ♥♥♥♥.4/10 - wich could be the thing that bothers me most in the game.                  Overall the game is good, and I would totally recomand it. If you enjoy true RPGs please do buy it. Oh yeah, in case you're wondering what's up with the bad revirews I can give you an answer. The game's not easy, and the unpacient unseazoned teenagers will give it a thumbs down. Don't you mind that, if you are a rpg person, and enjoy a challange wich comes along with a good story and fun gameplay please buy it with confidence. Game's not perfect but there is no such thing is it? "

												Hello all,After exhausting all the Dark Souls games and trying out the Lords of The Fallen I am giving a try to another action rpg - a game called Bound By Flame.This game was released in 2014 and for this year the graphics I think is quite good. First off, I do not understand metascore critics score of 56/100! This is ridiculous as this game should be easy at least what Lords of The Fallen with a score of over 70.Where it comes to Steam reviews it is a bit more accurate.I started this game without much hope for a good experience and the beginning did not let me down. It felt really mediocre with single-path-map being on trails. Tutorial was poor and not interesting. What I quite liked though was the voice acting and dialogue. Then it was only better and I was pleasantly surprised with a quick and intuitive combat system that has a lot to offer (Combat styles from Wither; cross bows; pushes; ripostes and lots of different attacks); it started to be even more interesting when the plot introduced the Demon part of your protagonist that will take control over you in a degree you decide it to. So you can become a demon. Something new there.So far I think this game is worth to give it a try but it is faaar from perfect. I will be keep playing it and the below points are what I have noticed after few hours of gameplay:Pros:-	Action rpg with more stress on RPG part – more quests; better dialogue with more options (all in all more story/rpg focused than any of the DS or LOTF-	Dialogue – good voice acting, quite funny at times (made me laugh few times already), harsh language-	Combat system – fast, intuitive and attracts your attention to game. I do really like dual dagger thief mode. That is the first game I started to play as a thief. I always prefer bulky fighters in heavy armors.-	Demon part taking control over you – speaking to you and commenting on NPCs behaviour – that is quite funny-	Being able to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you like to-	Difficulty (I started on the highest difficulty level – captain I think it was called) – quite challenging, especially if you run out of pots. I also like that 3 hits can kill you and you have very limited amount of life.-	Enemies variety is quite good so far-	Character is very fast when sprinting what helps to get through the boring looting parts of the game-	No stamina – as much as it is unrealistic I do kinda like it -	Story is nothing extraordinary but it does attract your attention-	Character development – intuitive and quite fun-	Graphics is quite good and performance is very good with 60fps on QHD with everything maxed outCons:-	You can choose your protagonist name but everyone will still call you Vulcan. That is a bit odd and I do not like it. They shouldn’t have let players to change the name.-	Not able to hit any NPCs…… I have always hated that…-	NPC that you cannot speak to – people-trees that make the world empty-	Level design is just really bad – just limited path connected with each other - levels feel really empty and not interesting too-	Boundaries everywhere – you just feel limited all the time; levels are just paths; cliffs are basically walls-	Enemies respawn too quickly-	I do not think this game has any replayability -	Immortal companions-	Looting the map and secrets feel as a chore not as an adventure-	In this game you are literally grounded and unable to jump at allConclusion:So, I do recommend this game to try it out especially when it is on sale for couple of quid (I have purchased it for £2.79 I think). It is not a great title but it does have a lot of nice things to offer (Funny, harsh dialogue, demon  quick fighting system and not too bad story that will keep your attention for at least one play through)RATINGs:Bound by Flame: 6+/10Lords of The Fallen: 6+/10DS 1: 9/10DS 2: 8/10DS 3: 9/101st UPDATE: 26 hours sank into the game already and I have come to the conclusion that the game’s strongest and at the same time the weakest point is its story. Why? Well, I think this is a good story, quite surprising and interesting with some well-done plot twists. Atm I am really hooked on it but on the other hand it is also very disappointing. Thus the game offers you some choices (there is even a proud window coming up with a  message: In this game choices matter) but this is not entirely true. The game lies to you, as whatever you decide there is only one outcome.  -	Example no.1: Choice – (Spoilers)  fight a small boss and absorb its power or ignore a small boss and save the people by opening gate – I decided to ignore a boss and save people – the game made me to fight the small boss anyway (as one of the NPC shouted to get a boss attention). -	Example number two - (Spoilers)  Choice – Help elven king in battle or ignore the king and go to Worldhearth – I told the Elven king I will not help him and go to Worldhearth directly – The game told me then that I will go to the with an Elven King to some point and then split apart. Well, you end up helping Elven King anyway when you arrive to the city-	Example no.3 – (Spoilers) you have a friend and a boss – The Captain and the protagonist just decides to kill him like a traitor and complete ♥♥♥♥. You can just watch it – the game will not you even decideThe only choice that felt as it mattered was to let the inside-demon to take more control of you.On top of that the fighting system has got repetitive already. What I still like though is the difficulty level. It is about right on captain – a lot of challenge, even few of the lesser mobs have chance to kill you and the bosses are a challenge most of the times  – furthermore later in the game you even fight some of the bosses you defeated earlier in game as a normal foes.Also I do not like stupid and unnecessary restrictions this game has – like: I cannot enter that room because I did not yet do this, that and the other. Whats worse - this restrictions are really presented as word of wisdom tout of the mouth of protagonist. Or: You cannot leave that room  as you have not made a decision yet. Because of that you feel very restricted.UPDATE 2: 40.9 hours on record and I reached the last boss. To be perfectly honest my total true time would be no more than 20 hours as I have got my game minimized a lot and game’s time has been counting. In some games it would not record on steam but this one seems to measure time whether I play it or not.So back to the point: I reached the final boss and I must say the Captain difficulty is a catwalk up until the final boss fight. I tried maybe 10-15 times and could not even got his life down to half on 26th level. Extreme damage, speed and life makes him unbeatable unless you try like 100-200 times. This is ridiculous – I have also made some research and I am not the only one, I wonder if any of the game’s creators ever beat that boss? Well, at least I have got a life and have given up on this game. I like the plot and stuff but this just killed the game for me and I have a feeling I wasted a good day out of my life.Thus I cannot recommend this game any longer so I have changed my rating from 6+ to 4 and switch it to not recommended.

												I'm a just say the pros and cons, and some other things.Pros:*Animation of each swing feels/looks natural.*Actual changes to equipment and weapons (enhancements)*Interesting theme of overall scenary.*Easy enough to figure out crafting in gear/items/weapons in the very beginning.*Monster learns you. Attacking-wise, or atleast they know when to rush you when you start charging your attack, and aggro.Balanced in Comparison:*Lack of character customization, balanced by gear customization.*The controls are decent on both ends, prompting/accessibility-wise.*The general hate by the NPCS. Makes you actually feel like you don't care about them and -kinda- change your deposition of them. (Good for this game since you can do good or bad things in conversations and what not).*Don't get much money, but the equipment in shops are decently cheap.*Cramped routes, but atmospheric.Cons:*Most or some males look like your beginning choices, even your Captain.*Really only using swords/daggers. Traps, arrows, etc are more limited ammo till later on when you can afford them.*I know this shouldn't really matter, but it kinda does in my book considering you made the combat system, you should allow mistakes on both ends; monsters attacks going through their partners. Could just make them wait to attack like other games.[/noap]*How long conversations are that -can be- pointless. Like talking to a shop dealer.Depends:*I know swearing is a meh to some people in games, but it ruins the immersion for me, all the characters are free vocab and ehhhhhh, just doesn't sound right I guess.*Similar to Dark Souls, but probably a little easier. Still though, less life, less def, more loading save files.*Default face looks like a Spartan.*Gives you the option to name yourself, but uses default name throughout game.*Lots of random items found around a given map.*Some form of grinding for exp, maybe farming for items to use in crafts.

												This game is ok, teetering towards bad. The game has few redeeming qualitie. The combat system is rather boring and repetitive with there only being about 10, including bosses, enemy types all of which function rather similarly to each other with big ""get out of the way"" tells. When it manages to execute itself well, it feels moderately rewarding and is nice to look at, however there are a fair number of wonky hit boxes, awkward animations, and the staggerable archers that can shoot arrows behind them. The plot is rather uninteresting and full of that sort of cliche edginess to it with awkward vulgarity and do this or I will beat your skull in lines of dialogue. The characters are at times enjoyable, but for the most part lack any sort of depth or development, and your companions contributions to the battlefield little more than a distracting meatshield for a few seconds before them dying a brutal death and laying on the ground for the next 5 minutes of boss combat.All in all I would rate this game at 2-2.5/5. If you can get it cheap, it has enough charm to stomach a play through, but with the entire game, with the majority of side content completed, taking around 15 hours to complete, it certainly is not worth it's $40 price tag.Overall rating: 5.5/10			"

												I really tried to like this game but for some reason it just doesn't grow on me.Warrior and Pyromancer Skilltrees are completely useless against Bosses making the whole concept of the story meaningless as you're supposed to be at an advantage due to posessing the abilities of a fire demon. What use is your Pyromancy if it's crap and wont help you survive or help beat the bosses. It's good enough for trashmobs but fails at providing any benefit during boss battles.Higher difficulties aren't hard due to gameplay but due to enemies just STUNLOCKING you without you being able to do anything against it (If you're not in Ranger Mode, that is) You NEED to be in Ranger stance to even be able to survive Bosses due to the ""Dodge"" skill. Bosses will either Stunlock you to death or instantly break through your Parrystance and then Stunlock you to death. The Warrior and Pyromancer have NO MOBILITY skills at all so you have no way to react on AoE effects as simply running out of the ""zone"" is too slow and blocking it doesn't work. Neither of the skills in Warrior or Pyromancer tree are remotely usefull against bosses so if you're playing on higher difficulties any point you don't put into Daggers and Ranger are wasted.PS: There is no way to respec your points, at least there wasn't one by the end of ACT 2. So if you're the kind who loves to go into a game ""blind"" and who likes to ""experiment"" with skill trees, you're going to have a bad bad time.			"

												Short verdict: the game aims for AAA quality, but lacks in every aspect.Story: The main line is actually quite interesting: in dark times, when the last free elves and humans stand against the approaching hordes of undead warriors lead by powerful mages (Ice Lords), a simple mercenary is possessed by a demon, whose power was diminished by the very same Ice Lords, who drain their power from the very same source the demon does. The mercenary (and the player) has a choice – whether to surrender to the demon and become the most powerful being in the world or to try control the demon and its powers, preserving one's identity. However, in details, the story is far from perfect. There are serious plot holes. Some things happen without any decent explanation. Some events contradict the previous events. The dialogues are cheesy and almost all characters are very rude towards each other.Voice acting I guess, Spiders had a low budget.Romance There are potential partners you can romance in this game, if you complete particular sidequests. However, the romance is limited to an achievement you can unlock and the most ridiculous and stupid ''romantic'' cutscenes that are so out of context that I dare to say that this is the worst depiction of romance in all the history of videogames. Moral choices Again, the same thing. In the end your choices will determine, which of the four alternative endings you'll have and whether you'll preserve your human identity and whether... [well, one of the endings is so EPIC that I don't dare to spoil it for you]. However, before that, there are too many choices that you are offered, which really don't matter, as the consequences are pretty much the same. It's an illusion of choice and lame writing.Combat Some really great skills and concepts. HOWEVER, the way the combat system is implemented, is just horrible. Camera spinning, attacks that can't be blocked or parried, multiple enemies attacking you at once, knocking you down and not letting you to stand up – it's all there. With patience and right timing for VERY, VERY short windows of opportunity, you can beat this game. But, even on the lowest difficulties, the fights are just too long and tedious and, very often, annoying. The only good thing that makes the fighting less pain in the ♥♥♥, is that crafting is available even during a combat (but which is kind of stupid as a concept, right?) and the weapons don't need repairing. On the bright side and contrary to many other games, your companion actually is useful during the combat and might even save your life in certain challenging situations.Difficulty and level scaling First, the enemies are a bit too hard, then the enemies are a bit to easy, then the enemies are bit too hard again. And, by hard I mostly mean how very much attention you need to pay to what is happening around, how perfect your timing should be and how long the actual fight takes. But the BOSS BATTLES are a completely different story. They are especially hard, which is fine by me, they should be, because those are the bosses, BUT the final boss is just insanely hard. Unless, you have a large arsenal of bolts, traps and potions and crafting components to craft some more, you are screwed and you can't go back to buy/find some more. My complaint here is that the final fight is insanely hard even on the easiest difficulty. That is not my idea of what ""Easy"" is (Recruit difficulty) (which game explains as ""just the story""). And most other players would agree that the final battle was completely unbalanced compared to the rest of the game.(See more here)Level design. Mazes, mazes, nothing but mazes, multi-level mazes and then some mazes again. I don't know about you guys, but to me it's a bad thing. Especially because the map is static and has almost no functionality that one would expect in a modern game.Graphics This game was released in 2014, but it looks like something from 2008. Shame, though, 'cause, from the way the environment and characters were designed, I can imagine, that the original concept art was beautiful.Economy Except for the final stage, you're always short on money and crafting materials. It's especially painful during the final boss fight.As you can see from my and other reviews, there are numerous flaws in Bound by Flame, but, nevertheless, I still enjoyed it more than it annoyed me, so, all in all, I give it a ""thumb up"". It could've been a hit with more polish.But, as it is what it is, I give it: 6/10			"

												This has got to be one of the most annoying games I've played in years.It starts off all right, but as I moved through the story I ghot more and more frustated by the minut.ok anyway, good and bad things about the game.GOOD- the combat is more skill based than other games- the combat can actually be challenging at times, that's a good thing- the animations are smooth and so is the gameplay- the loot (for you loot ♥♥♥♥♥s) is easy to get, press e, boom. No going through bags and stuff, you just get it all.- the UI, inventory, quest management and so on is pretty well organised and easy to follow- the idea for the core of the story is not bad- swear words! I like swear words in computer games!- the voice acting is pretty good even if the actual text is really weakand that's it, I honestly can not think of anything else that's good about the game. (in my experience and from my point of view).THE BAD- it boasted player choice, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I can not count the amount of times I was given a choice, only for the opposite of what I'd chosen to be forced on me. Even when rescuing a guy who got lost in the sewars, I was forced to bring him back to camp before moving on in the sewars just a little further to complete a second quest that was close by- the conversations with NPCs are bad, terrible- it's a rip off of Dragon Age in many ways even going as far as having the ""suspicious witch"" (Morrigan)- there was a tooltip saying that it was important to shop when in town. I was looking forward to going to town, you never do.- speaking of which, nothing I found in shops was ever useful to me- the enemies are totally unbalanced (I don't mean too hard, I mean sometimes too easy and sometimes too hard). Not to mention the last boss who is ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous even if you switch down to easy mode. I had a harder time fighting 3 recruits than the Lord of Ice- the ""classes"" are forced on you, I wanted to play 100% warrior but leveled much higher and maxed that tree early on.- the story is really short, there are only 4 acts and there really aren't many hours of gameplay- the friends you take with you are entirely useless !! I mean totally useless, they do no damage at all to the NPC enemies, the only use in having them tag along is in tanking some of the lowbie mobs (for a short while before they die)- though the combat is the strong part of the game (imo) some aspects of it drove me mad. For example, it does happen that in the case of point and click fights I spam the mouse button. That usually isn't a problem but in this game, the commands are chained for a bit, so if the mob does something which requires you to use another skill, you have to wait for the chain of attacks which you spammed to finish. That was very annoying.- You'll probably finish the game in less than 20 hours even if you do all the side quests.. that's very short imo.Some people asked on forums whether this game was like Dark Soul, I haven't played Dark Soul yet, however I can tell you that on normal difficulty (Hawk), I died regularly in common fights. That's a good thing though, cause there is a bit of player skill involved in the combat.One last thing, I didn't put the graphics in either good or bad because even though they are not very good, they aren't very bad either. The environment is mostly cartoony than real but I guess that also means you get a high FPS and smooth gameplay.All in all, even though I bought this game with a 75% discount, I regreted it and would only recommend it for someone looking for a cheap RPG but who has really nothing else to play.PS The last boss is ridiculous, did I mention that?

												Bound by Flame is a 3rd-Person-RPG with many good ideas that are held back by the battle system. The game's biggest flaw is it's battle system - it brings with it a lot of frustration and could have been so much better. The battle system is action-based, similar to Hack-And-Slay-Games - just without all the fun. Blocking and parrying is very important in this game and, yes, if you do not learn it, you will be even more frustrated, but even if you master it, there is still one huge flaw - it is useless against multiple enemies and some attacks can't be blocked at all. Considering that you will be battling against at least 2 enemies all the time during the course of the game, you will be interrupted, knocked back and knocked down all the time from attacks you can't parry or block all at once because there are just.too.many of them. While you can improve your interruption resistance, it will still happen way too often. One fight in particular makes you go up against two bosses and 4 adds - so many projectiles and attacks mean you never find a way to attack and need to have a lot of luck to get a 1-second-break to maybe deal damage to one enemy. It is just not fun. No matter what armor you wear, you will receive at least 15 % of your HP in damage at ALL times on ALL difficulty levels (wtf?) which means you die quickly no matter what, especially when knocked down and unable to do anything.Taking aside the absolutely awful battle system, the game's story is serviceable and your good/bad choices during the game actually reflect upon your character and even the course of the story, similarly to Fable - that is something the game does very right. The voice acting is actually pretty good and the dialogue is very inappropriate at times - which totally fits within my humour. The graphics are alright - pretty cel-shaded and fitting. There is crafting too. Character progression is also nice - 3 skill trees are available to you and ""feats"" like crafting taking less materials and so on.Another good thing about the game is the soundtrack - especially the main theme is very pleasing to the ear and one of the best RPG tracks in my recent memory. Also you open EVERYTHING in this game by kicking it - even plants. It's hilarious.Sadly (or luckily?) the game is over after about 10 hours and you are left with a somewhat bitter aftertaste. The few good points - the alright story, good voice acting and funny dialogue - sadly do not cancel out the absolutely awful battle system that will leave you frustrated no matter what specalization you choose (Two-Handed-Weapon, Daggers or Pyromancy). Also, the difficulty levels (all 4 of them) do absolutely nothing - I found no difference between the hardest and easiest difficulty except the fact that I received about 10 % less damage which doesn't help the actual problem of the battle system (the constant interruption and barrage of enemy attacks) - yay for artificial difficulty levels.I can't recommend it because of the battle system, which hurts my soul as the game does a lot of things right...but if you are able to see past this huge flaw, you are left with an okay budget RPG with a good soundtrack and entertaining dialogue, that, while not being original and feeling somewhat cheap and bland at times, is over pretty quickly and has some neat ideas - that sadly never evolve past the idea stage.Long story short, the game serves as a perfect example of cramming too many things into a limited space, leaving an undercooked result where sometimes, just sometimes, you can see a glimmer of what it should have been through frustration and constant reloading. Pick it up for cheap if you want to try it out but lower your expectations.Personal Score: 4.5/10 - Below Average.			"

												Lets keep it simple.Dark Fantasy Story : 8/10RPG  Elements: 9/10Sound: 6/10Music: 9/10Gameplay:8/10If you are looking for a challenging and rewarding Dark Fantasy Action RPG, this is it. Wait for it to be on sale, hit the install, and have fun. The combat can be unfair at times, but this is not Dark Souls. The action combat is like Witcher & Gothic had a baby. The skill trees are great and very fun to test out. The voice acting is ....meh, but I have seen worse movies. The soundtrack is quite good, you won't be humming anything at work, but adds to the game. You can't compare this game to some AAA title. The effort and love put into this game shows at its core. Spiders had a story to tell and they had fun doing it. Enjoy!			"

												Picked it up during the Steam sale for £3.00 and gave it a run through.Combat - initially fun but can get repetitive. Enemies seem to be massive damage sponges for the most part. The game almost forces you to use traps and the crossbow at certain points in the game. The last boss was a massive difficulty spike compared to the rest.Story - Fairly generic fantasy storyline, some interesting concepts though.Graphics/Sound - Runs well and looks decent. Voice acting is fairly poor, some bad jokes along with a couple of funny ones. Characters don't seem to react to changing events sometimes during conversations.Gameplay - Fairly generic RPG gameplay with linear areas and quests. Some replay value for different choices and difficulties.6/10 - Reccomended if it's cheap. Based on one run through the game.			"

												This game is a very basic RPG; it’s not necessarily ground breaking, but its functional and its actually pretty fun if you don’t mind the bad voice acting.If you like games like Gothic (1,2), Two Worlds (1, 2), Venetica, Risen etc.... You will defiantly find some fun in this game.Please ignore the haters of this game, they are most likely newly RPG fans who just jumped in on the band wagon after The Witcher 3 and expect every single RPG to meet a crazy high standard.Please understand there are very small studios that also make great RPGs.Anyways, give it a try, the game isn’t even that expensive, and it’s not Buggy or Broken, it’s a great RPG.UPDATE 6-18-2016well i beat the game at around 20 hours, its pretty short and the last act of the game is very underwelming. It feels like they ran out of time and money towards the end. so they just ended it like that. Youll see what i mean...i still like the game for what it is,			"

												Imagine this: the entire world of Thedas/Vertiel is in chaos. A powerful force of evil sweeps the land, destroying all in its wake. The source of this evil? The Blight/Ice Lords. You are a plucky adventurer who goes only by her last name, Shepard/Hawke/Vulcan, and you are working with the remaining Grey Wardens/Red Scribes to push back the Blight/Ice Lords and save the world. ♥♥♥♥ happens! You assemble a team of friends to help you out. They include the adorably naïve and eager scholar Liara/Sybil and the scantily-clad and sharp-tongued sorceress Morrigan/Edwen.  And who could forget Thane/Randval, who tragically lost his family and is looking to go out with a bang by helping you save the day?    More ♥♥♥♥ happens! You bring the immeasurably important Arl Eamon/Prince Arandil back from the brink of death so that he can assist in the war effort. It is revealed that Morrigan/Edwen is tagging along for her own sketchy, witchy purposes – and if you don’t go along with them, she deserts you. You venture into the Fade/Worldheart, which is the source of all magic in the land. You make moral choices that make you look human or creepy and glow-y, and if you play your cards right you get to make out with one of your new friends. Hmm, is anyone else getting the strongest case of deja-vu?    Listen. I’m not saying that Bioware was the first to trot out the elements that I listed above, because obviously some of them are sci-fi and fantasy staples. However, mash together enough plot, setting and character types that happen to exist in extremely popular Bioware titles and package them in a story-driven RPG video game with a quirky adventuring team, choice-based elements, romance and a morality system and yeah, I’m going to go so far as to call Bound By Flame a Bioware knockoff.     Here’s the thing that sucks, though. Bound By Flame is like Bioware without all of the heart. It lacks the lore and the world-building, the depth and lovability of the companion characters, the PC customization, the choices that actually mean something. It offers absolutely nothing that Bioware hasn’t already done with infinitely more thought and grace. I may be able to make Thane and Randval sound the same on paper, but I actually give a ♥♥♥♥ about Thane at the end of the day. We see him engaged in a beautifully-written struggle to come to terms with the end of his life, his sense of morality and his relationship with his son. My interest in Randval does not extend beyond wanting to know why the ♥♥♥♥ he talks in the third person all the time. (While I'm on the subject of sad Russian man bun FenrisThane, how the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ did I end up romancing him?? I didn't flirt with him. The only thing I did was take him with me for the Concubine battles, but that's because I had developed the nuanced tactic of letting enemies wail on him while I backstabbed them, not because I thought he was dreamy!!!!!!!!)	But Charlotte! you say. Why did you reccomend this game if it is a tacky husk of much better games? Are there any good things about this game? Well, my friend, in spite of how objectively awful and unoriginal it is - and probably partially because of how objectively awful and unoriginal it is- I really, really had a lot of fun playing it. The combat is surprisingly fluid and engaging and some of the enemy designs were really cool. Maybe I'm in Bioware withdrawal and I just needed something to scratch that itch but I’ll be damned if I didn’t want to see how my ragtag group of allies was going to save the day, and I did grow quite fond of my foul-mouthed, sarcastic, tough-as-nails Vulcan. I don't know, man.			"

												:edit: I have shortened and made concise my original review. All the original points are still there its simply more easy to process.Combat: Combat is not fun for several reasons:1. Hit boxes for enemies are larger than they appear on screen. An enemy will swing at you, and you won't see them make contact with you but you will still take damage.2. You are very slow. When facing 4-5 enemies, your character isn't fast enough to get off an attack either with you longsword or your daggers. Your mana takes so long to respawn magic isn't much help either. All you can do is block...the parry ability (brought over from Mars: War Logs) is really the only thing you can do.3. You can only dodge when using daggers. And then you can only dodge directly backwards. No rolling away and behind your enemy like in Mars: War Logs. There's no real reason why you shouldn't have this ability. Its like when they took the ability to jump out of the new Thief game.4. All these things make combat a huge drag. You could run around constantly waiting for your mana to slowly recharge and then slowly wittle away at your enemies with magic but not only is this tedious but their ranged attacks, which stagger you to a ridiculous degree, make this even more of a pain.Dialogue:1. Terrible lip-synching. The characters just constantly wiggle the sides of their mouths. Creepy and awful.2. Terrible dialogue. Can't decide whether it wants to be fantasy dialogue, gritty Witcher style dialogue, or just plain awful. The characters will have lines that seem entirely out of character and out of place.3. Voice acting: Not as bad. Some characters are worse than others, especially the elf Sybil. Your merc captain sounds pretty cool but that seems about it.graphics: usually i ignore this if the gameplay/dialogue is great. But they aren't.1. Graphics are sub-par and blocky. Supposedly next gen, but obviously not. Far away land-scapes such as mountains look especially bad. THe only thing that saves it is the lighting (which is pretty great).Good things:1. Lighting. Helps keep scenes immersive where the dialogue and graphics might otherwise break it.2. Music. It's cool. I plan on buying the OST.3. Crafting. All the awsome crafting stuff you had in Mars: War Logs is directly transplanted in this game.What would make this game worth buying:1. A patch/mod fixing the combat. Adding a combat roll/dodge for both character types would eliminate the other frustrating elements of combat. Also, fixing the combat would eliminate the other problems I had with the game.2. A really good sale. At least 75% off.3. You want to support the developers...even though I don't like this game and would never recoment it without these reservations, I am glad somebody likes it so that Spiders doesn't go out of business.Why you should buy this gameMost of the people who like this game seem to really like Dark Souls. So if you like unforgiving, difficult, frustrating combat (call it a challenge if you want), then you will probably like this.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game (like everybody else xD). So I'll just point out what was good and bad. - soundtrack is probably the best thing in this game, - i love visual aspect of the game. I liked locations, character models, even menu and loading screens, quality is medicore though, - three skill trees: Fighter (2h sword), ranger (daggers + stealth), pyromancy. Good mix of pyromancy and ranger will turn hardest difficulty into walk in the park. Focusing on fighter tree will turn normal difficulty into nightmare. Swords deal little damage, and fighter skills are not really usefull (I sugest to leave sword for second playthrough), - I like how your decisions change story, ending and possibillity of wearing helmet (you can earn nice horns), - fighting mechanics and high difficulty is something that i really like, unfortunatelly game is even harder because of lack of polishing (you have too big hitbox, all enemies are bulletsponges, some spells can hit you even if visually you are out of their range), - variety of weapons and armor is rather small but upgrading method is great, - useless merchants - they have nothing interesting to buy and you won't sell anything (you will turn everything into crafting materials), - finall boss battle - a lot of people whine about it - it is really long and hard. And one mistake can force you to start from the beginning... But it's totally worth it. Treat whole game as preparations to it. Gather traps, arrows and health potions - you will use tham all in finall battle. - story is nothing special (but still entertaining), characters are nicelly written (especially Mathras), some dialogues are well written, some are terrible. Characters will give you ""personal"" quests. Completing them all + taking character to boss battles in last chapter will give you romance opportunity.BBF is definetelly worht playing.Not worth the full price though.			"

			Views: 20,763		

			Cosmic reviews Bound By Flame a new action RPG developed by Spiders and published by Focus Home Interactive. Thanks For watching!		

Hello I'm Cosmic and welcome to Bound by Flame a new action RPG developed by French studio Spiders and published by focus home interactive. Spiders themselves have worked on previous RPG's such as the underrated Of Orcs and Men, Bound by Flame however is arguably their biggest solo project to date and it's an ambitious one at that. I have been looking at the game for some time and been very interested to play it since RPG's are my chosen genre in video games, I hold RPG's standards of both gameplay and storytelling to very high standards so let's take a look at the game.Bound by Flame puts you in the role of Vulcan, the power master or demolition man of the legendary mercenary company the Freeborn Blades. The game gives you limited but good character creation while there are only a limited number of faces and hairstyles of the character each one has great detail. Another thing I do love is the ability to create a male or female character. On top of this, if choosing the female version of Vulcan it doesn't feel tacked on like in some other RPG's, in fact the female version of Vulcan was my personal favourite as she was very well voice acted, has specific romance options and ultimately was a complete and utter bad ♥♥♥.Bound by flame isn't an open world RPG like Skyrim, in fact its very similar in design to The Witcher 2. The game world is set into hubs, each hub will have a base camp or town and then has several surrounding areas, these aren't small areas, there’s plenty to see and explore and the each area is a lot bigger than what Deus Ex Human revolution had that used similar hub like level design. The world design is very nice, there’s a good variety of environments from humid swamps to the frozen north. The games graphics are great to look at, its a very pretty game and while it has its graphical flaws with some armor clipping and such, overall its a great visual experience and has nothing that breaks the immersion of the game.Lets talk about the combat of the game since you'll be fighting the deadwalker army a hell of a lot. Similar also to the Witcher 2 you have to buttons to attack, one for a quick attack, good for dealing with single enemies and the other is a area attack, useful for groups. Your version of Vulcan has several ways of dealing with enemies as well as a choice of weapons and fighting styles. First is the Warrior stance which uses Vulcan's two handed sword. The warrior stance is all about powerful damaging blows, ripostes, breaking the enemies guard and good sweeping area attacks. It's the slowest of the combat styles and depending on the weapon, the attack speed and damage will vary.Second is the Ranger stance which uses Vulcans dual daggers. The ranger stance is all about stealth, speed and dodging. You can only be in stealth in the ranger stance and attacking enemies unaware gives a huge damage bonus. The ranger stance is a good damage dealing, the speed of attacks can slice and dice your enemies however the attacks while there are more of them, they are weaker meaning heavily armoured opponents will require you to switch to warrior. Ranger stance is the only stance that allows you to dodge as the parrying with dual daggers against big ♥♥♥ swords isn't particularly effective. Which actually brings me to something that really annoys me about combat that I can't just roll or dodge in any stance. That being said there’s a fair amount of player skill involved in combat as riposting and parrying requires good timing. Perfectly timing a parry will invoke a riposte and often that riposte will critical hit causing devastating damage especially useful against tougher enemies.The last major part of combat is your spells and abilities, your demon allows you to wield the power of flame. There are various fire spells available to you but not only this you also as a powder master have access to traps and a crossbow. The allows for you to strategize and prepare for upcoming battles.All the combat stances can be upgraded through the path system. Once you gain a level you'll unlock points to place into the three paths available to you. The three paths are Warrior, Ranger and pyromancer. The path system gives you the means to customize your character to specialize in which ever fighting style you prefer. Like stealth and daggers, go for ranger, want a magic based character, go for pyromancer. The path has a variety of unlocks that allow your to augement your existing abilities and attacks as well and improving your character base stats. On top of the Path system are character feats, these are feats that you can purchase with feat points to unlock certain upgrades to things like crafting, alchemy, heath etc etc. You can also gain feats from certain choices in the game which will effect your characters stats.Let's move on to crafting, crafting is a major element of the game. Throughout the world you'll find resources to use to craft. Crafting in bound by flame is more like augementing. Any piece of armour or weapons have crafting slots in which you can craft a good selection of different items that offer different statisitcal upgrades and bonuses. For example if you wish to upgrade your two handed sword you can craft a selections of hilts and pommels each with different looks and attritubes. You can also recycle your old equipment for materials too, more powerful enchancements will require rarer materials so use your materials wisely. I really enjoyed customizing my equipment, armour customizing is particularly fun as it has the most expansive range of looks and bonuses. It's particularly important to add enchancements that suit your style of play, for example if your playing a character who focuses on magic, then armour upgrades that boost mana and mana regen is a good way to go.Now then lets talk about what is the biggest thing for me in this game the story. At the end of the day this is a story driven RPG and I have to say that without giving any spoilers the main story overall is told very well. The game has several endings depending on your choices in the game especially the choices you make with your own demonic possession. The story is well paced though in some places it does get a little disjointed by skipping little bits of information but it gets back on track well. It took me around 16 hours to complete my first playthorugh of the game, now that is a little short and there were plenty of things I missed especially with the companions. If this was a full $60 game I would say its well to short however, its a $40 title. Not only that but theres plenty of replayability as I discovered during my second playthrough, choosing different choices not only effects the ending but also events along the way too. It actually means that you can play the game twice and get two different set of events in some places. In all it means that in theory you could easily put 30 hours or more into the game which in my opinion, you certainly get your monies worth. The main story is strong in the game and there are some pretty bad ♥♥♥ moments in there too. The games voice acting is fantastic and I have to commend the voice actors as they did a great job on this one.Check out the Video review for more! Thanks for reading and watching.			"

												Ahhh, Spiders, probably one of the most underrated developers in recent years. My first experience with their work was with Faery: Legends of Avalon, their first game and one that I enjoyed despite its many flaws. After that I tried out their second game, Mars: War Logs and the huge leap in quality between the two impressed me beyong words, since it was a huge development from their first creation both visualy and in terms of gameplay and writing. Spiders is one of those developers I believe would produce an instant classic if they were not held down by budget constraints. Their ability to create worlds with immense depth and lore, their attention to detail and also their skill in writing and storytelling is commendable. Each one of their endeavors in video games is better than the previous one, which leads me to believe, and hope that, eventually, they will get the funding they deserve to blow our minds. For now, lets focus on their third game, Bound By Flame.   Bound By Flame is a third-person, Dark Fantasy action-adventourish RPG set in the war-torn world of Vertiel. You take the role of Vulcan, a member of the Freeborn Blades mercenary group, as you are drawn into a large scale conflict between the living and the Seven Ice Lords, a group of necromancer/mages who lead legions of undead and other demonic entities  similar to the White Walkers in Game of Thrones, as they attempt to encase the world in eternal frost. When a desperate ritual that would provide the living with a weapon against the Ice Lords goes wrong, Vulcan finds himself coinhabiting his body with a demon of fire, and becomes the sole hope of defeating the enemies once and for all. However, both the demon and Vulcan struggle for control over Vulcan's body, and the protagonist's decisions over the course of the story will play a definitive role in the outcome of this clash of wills. As far as the story goes, it is quite interesting and will probably keep you engaged for the 18+ hours that the game lasts. It gradually introduces you to the world and its various inhabitants, and succesfully fleshes out the setting.   In terms of gameplay, Bound By Flame is quite linear, featuring diverse areas that give you an open-worldish feel, but are technically big mazes filled with various enemies to kill and chests/points of interest to loot. Questing, killing and exploring provides the player with experience points, the most common currency in RPG's, that level up your character and provide points that can be allocated in any of the three skill trees the game provides, depending on what kind of combat style you prefer: The Pyromancer tree strengthens a variety of fire spells in Vulcan's disposal, the Ranger tree improves Vulcan's prowess with the twin blades and the Warrior tree increases his ability with the two-handed sword. Points can also be allocated in some aditional skills that are not combat oriented, such as receiving more materials when recycling an item (breaking down an item to scavenge specific materials and craft other items), or increasing the effectiveness of health and mana potions.   As mentioned above, the game features quests that are divided into primary and secondary. Completing quests provides huge experience rewards, and also useful items for your character. Primary quests are mandatory to complete in order to progress the story. Secondary quests are optional and the game can be completed without them. However, I do recommend taking on every available quest you find, since not only they provide additional experience needed in order to level up your character, but they also reveal fragments of the world's lore for you to piece together and get a better understanding of Vertiel and its inhabitants. For example, completing companion quests (the additional protagonists of the story) can lead to smaller storylines connected with those characters that reveal their pasts and tales they have to share. They can also lead to romantic involvement with said characters, so there you go! (I personally did not get romanticaly involved with anyone, not for lack of trying... Forever alone T_T).   Combat-wise, the fighting can take some time to get used to, but once you have mastered dodging and counter-attacking (it is not that difficult), every engagement with the enemy becomes a deadly dance of hacking and slashing from your part. That is not to say that battles in the game are easy. Especially if you are playing in higher difficulties, it will take all your focus and reflex skill to succeed in even the most trivial fights, so I would recommend starting at the easiest level.   In terms of presentation, the graphics and art style are very impressive, with high resolution textures and excellent lighting, although there is the ocasional low resolution texture here and there that smudges the overall quality. The animations are also quite decent, but they could have been more fluid, especialy in the way Vulcan runs.   In the sound department, the game truly shines. The music is amazing and gives off a feeling of epic adventure, featuring low, slow relaxing melodies whenever you are in the safety of one of your camps or in a village, and intense tunes whenever you are engaged in a fight, or any other dangerous situation. It dresses the game appropriately. The voice acting is also quite good, my only complaint being a few crude and childish lines spoken by Vulcan, although I think this is more of a writing problem rather than a voice acting one.   Concluding, I enjoyed Bound By Flame alot. I though the story was interesting, the battles, once I got the hang of them,  became very entertaining and the various characters I met, each with their own personality and quirks, provided me with various dramatic and comedict moments that kept me invested in them. Spiders moved one step forward with this game, and by the time I am writing this review, their fourth game is already out, Technomancer, and I hear that they have taken another step forward there as well. I believe it wont be long before these developers have the appropriate funding needed to provide us with a quality AAA open-world title, which is, I believe, what they really wish to do, judging from what they have created so far. For now, just enjoy the best they have to offer, and know that their best is actually quite impressive.			"

												A surprisingly stylish Rpg which kept me playing till the credits.I found the setting, soundtrack and combat to be fantastic. Graphically not a slouch either.You assume the role of a mercenary, male or female (your choice) in a famous band of cutthroats under the leadership of the ""captain"" who is seriously channeling Sean Connery. It starts off as an escort mission, guarding a group of priests to be more specific but quickly escalates when the Undead hordes arrive.You learn of 7 master sorcerers who are taking the world by storm and how there is no chance of fighting back....or is there?A ritual is started and by the end you will never be the same. The story takes off from there and its up to you how it will end. Will you resist the dark side or go full demonic?I found it to be very satisfying, only negative point I can think of was the length. It ends after 20 odd hours and I admit I'm spoiled and was expecting another huge epic journey. The main selling point of the game is the combat. Its right up there with the best games in the rpg genre. Its unforgiving and difficult  to start off with but once your past that learning curve it becomes very satisfying. Just make sure to grab the pyromancy talents as the game will be very hard without them. ps..Make sure you have at least 60 mana pots for the final battle, I had 105 which was unnecessary but i can't imagine fighting there without them.

												Rarely does a game catch me off guard but in a positive way such as this one did. Stepping in to the shoes of a mercenary has not been this fun since Bulletstorm (it was a blast to play I thought). Instead of stringing combos together with a gun, you have swords, axes, daggers, spells, and traps at your disposal. Not every fight has the same answers but you are more welcome to explore the complex combat system which is easy to quickly get a handle on.This was using a keyboard and mouse. The game boasts full controller support but I little luck really getting my PS3 controller working well or my Steam Controller. Given that the game also has a console experience possible, seeing updates to improve controller support outside of a Xbox 360 would be handy as the game has released on Sony platforms so it would not be a stretch.With three skills at your disposal, the warrior and ranger tend to offer players two alternate ways to play the game with fire mage complimenting them both equally. There are times when something just needs to burn and that is handy to not have to go just magic only. Bear in mind, potions to restore health and mana are sparse and should be used with care, not spammed. The crafting system offers a solution to this but letting you craft your own provided the resources are not being used elsewhere in a quest or upgrading gear or more. The game tends to hold you by the hand in terms of story to the point the named the main character Vulcan despite given you the option to enter your name in as whatever. It makes sense if you are trying to tell a cohesive story about a single character but either don't call him by name in the voice acting or just remove player choice of name. It wont kill us if we cant name a guy for the sake of immersion. Vulcan and the rest of his fellow mercenaries to tend grate with out of place profanities combine with made up words that insinuate curses. It feels like its aiming for shock value but just because they are mercenaries does it mean they can only express themselves with colorful language. Its a stereotype that seems out of place by today's standard of good writing.The game offers a bleak outlook against an ever growing army of undead controlled by 7 ice lords. An unfortunate accident thrusts you in to the limelight as a new tool against this overwhelming army, The cost could prove too great but the choice is out of your hands. Speaking of choices, you are only able to pick and choose one team member at a time. Given that stealth is never my forte (unless its accompanied by a Batsuit), I often choice a healer for a comrade to try to keep me up while I am hacking away at things in between fireballs. Outside of dialogue options and possible romance, there is little choices involved. They appear to always be your level and require no gear at all. You can change their stance to offensive or defensive. I think a dialogue wheel with more options would improve this. Give them a chance to attack their own target or always assist me would be good. A way to control at what percent of their life they run away would also be handy. Many times I tried to fall back to regroup but my caster is still just standing there acting like a tank and not a good one at that.What you do get with this game is an enjoying romp akin to Dragon Age and Kingdoms of Amalur but not quite as indepth. It just might scratch your itch until Inquistion. The game certainly has a lot to offer and is worth giving a shot. This game was played on a Steam Machine and ran beautifully is worth mentioning. The color pallette of the game gets quite diverse from area to area and having to re-tred your own footsteps because of quests and side quests will often leaving stopping to admire a new detail you might not have noticed before. Music is one of the game's strongest points which often erases the screeching left behind by some of the voice actors. Scotland does not exist in this worth as far as we know. The accent stands out a bit much in certain characters. If different characters should sound different, make their appearances reflect this. I am not expecting every one of them to be Troy Baker but him in at least one role would be a game changer.I give this game praise up and suggest you give it a shot of you like your action steeped in talent trees, crafting, and other rpg elements. A good time is certainly waiting to be bad. I hope to see more entries is this new world to explore.			"

												I would describe Bound by Flame as an arcade style action-RPG.At first glance the game might seem similar to Witcher but this is deceiving, Bound by Flame and Witcher are completely different games that try to do different things in different ways.Bound by Flame reduced some RPG elements to a bare minimum in order to create a very fluid action-oriented combat.The combat in this game is more similar to an arcade-RPG than to the usual RPGs we are used to.Personally i enjoyed the combat a lot. Just like Mars War Logs, the combat seems difficult and unfair at first but it quickly becomes addictive once you get into it.....IF you get into it before getting frustrated because you tried to play it like it was Witcher or Amalur.The combat reminds me a little bit of some of my fave arcade games like Knights of the Round, D&D Towers of Doom/Shadows over Mystaria.The skill tree looks very similar to other games but again this is deceiving. You have a warrior branch (2 handed swords, axes and hammers), a so-called ranger branch that specialises in daggers (no bows), and a magic branch that unlike usual games, is not self-sufficient, its intended more like a buffer than a caster.There is also a feat tree (every level you get two skillpoints and one feat point) where you can further improve your character in different ways.The so-called crafting is very basic but very practical, can be done everywhere (even in fights) as long as you have the needed materials that you can gather or loot from containers or defeated enemies. The amount and type of upgrades that you can insert on equipment depends on the ""level"" of the equipment, early armors and weps have very little options while later ones offer a great variety of interesting options.There are two secondary weapons that can prove very useful, the crossbow (very limited ammo used mostly for interrupting or poisoning) and the traps. These two weapons could become the only way out of difficult boss fights if you screwed up your character build (like investing points in both the ranger and the warrior branch which is a big mistake).The graphics are very good but there is too little variation.The story is good but its unpolished, many inconsistencies and loose ends.The decision-making that is supposed to change the story is very underwhelming as is the so-called seduction thing. This aspect was so much better in Mars War Logs.Also its a bit annoying how dialogue options are still there after they are no longer valid, not a big thing but still.All in all this is a very entertaining game if you are after an action-RPG with very fluid arcade-style action and a fairly good story.

												As far as action-RPGs go , this is an average game.  Not the worst, and no the best.   It is rough around the edges, but can also be great fun a times.  Combat is both frustrating and entertaining.  Dialogue can be charming , and then embarassingly bad.  The bottom line is I can only recommend this game, when it has a sale.  You can forgive it's shortcomings when you have paid less than half-price. "

												I was on the fence about buying this one, due to the huge variation in reviews, but it was on sale so I decided to give it a shot. Ultimately, it was worth what I paid for it, but it's definitely not the best game I've ever played. Overall: 6.5/10Pros: - Crafting. The system is simple, but interesting. You don't need to be at a shop to craft materials or armor upgrades, etc. I like that you can do it on the fly or even in combat, if you have enough gold/materials. Different than what I'm used to, but a refreshing change.- Leveling/Customization. I like the combination of skill points and feats. The skill trees behave pretty much like every other game, but each of them offers a pretty different playstyle. The feats are additional upgrades for your character, but you have to unlock them through gameplay (ie, kill x enemies with fire) before you can train them. The system was fairly straightforward, but I felt like I had a good amount of customization.- Meaningful choices. Although I don't care much about the story (in any game), I do like that the decisions you make have an effect on what happens during your playthrough. There is the big choice between taking the human path or the demon path, but your interactions with the NPCs also has an impact.- Combat. There is a decent variety of enemies (for the size of the game) and even on lower difficulties, you have to at least put some thought into what you're doing and how to tackle each fight. - Humor. Some of the dialogue in the game is very ""real"", complete with dumb humor and crude jokes. Although I skipped through most of it (again, not caring too much about story), there were a few parts (and one character in particular) that actually made me laugh. It was a small thing, but refreshing to see.- Music. The soundtrack for this game is great. I often found myself accidentally sitting on the main menu just to listen to the theme song for a few minutes.Cons:- Companions. I loved the idea of having companions to fight with me and the ability to choose who to take and what their combat style should be, but boy are they stupid. They would constantly get stuck on the environment and get left behind, and during battle they were usually nothing more than a temporary distraction, until they died. Still better than not having them, but the system could use some improvement.- Combat. Although some parts of the combat were good, there was a lot that wasn't. I had a lot of trouble using the lock on system properly, but I found I couldn't play very effectively without it either. Some of the enemies/fights seemed to be cheap and I didn't always feel like I ""deserved"" it when something went wrong, which was frustrating and disappointing. Overall, the combat was very punishing. - Difficulty. Not being in the mood to torture myself, I played through on Normal. Some parts of the game felt right, but the difficulty curve was definitely a bit off. The middle felt pretty good, but I definitely had a tough time at the very beginning and the last boss was very disproportionately hard compared to everything else.			"

												I have played through twice but both times on easy setting. I bought this game initally because of the opportunity it gives to play as female and the rpg character customisation and development is something I really enjoy. I also was hoping the story and romances would be good too. The charcter creation is basic, barely ok. Also I would recommend you not bother to change the name because Vulcan is the only name you get called in the game. I didnt bother changing my name in the second playthrough. I rather liked being called by name rather than 'friend, boss, hero or other generic title'I think the story was ok, definitely a few plotholes. The first part is very complete and well done and the last two chapters rushed and with bits missing. There was a lot of death in this game, I didnt like that my character ended up killing another main character who I wouldnt choose to kill under any circumstances.I liked the combat, I was glad I could mix it up a lot. I missed fast travel back to camp but I suspect that was never implented as the game would end up being really short. So going to and fro and fighting the same respawning enemies felt a little bit of a cheap way to level. (I got the feeling a large chunk of the story and game was cut out)I am glad I got the choice of endings and some other choices throughout the game (didnt like the 'heroic' choice option) but can live with it.I think the crafting and armour upgrades was well done. I liked the interface and the maps. I loved Mathras, his character was the star of the show. Randval was also well acted, and Sybil and that nasty sorceror lady. Female hero's voice and acting wasnt so good, not sure about male.I would give this game a 7/10 as I enjoyed it enough to play it through twice.			"

												Don't go in expecting something big like Dragon Age or some other big title. All in all, it is a short, sweet game. Combat can be fun if you know how and when to react to certain attacks other than just holding the block button down constantly. A lot of people are just salty because they can't get a handle on the combat for whatever reason.The story itself could be better, but I enjoyed it. My favorite character is totally a tie between the sassy female protagonist and Mathras.Don't buy it for full price, as I said it is a pretty short game. Probably pay 15$ at most. I bought it when it was about 6$.			"

												First of all, this game has more Action than RPG, nonetheless it has some good points on the RPG side too.Pro:- Quick, fluid and fun combat- 2 destinctive skill trees that feel very different when used (plus a third one that acts more or less as support)- Interesting Story- Fresh rather unused setting, even if it feels a bit ""standard"" at timesContra:- Really short game (for an RPG that is!) and only little replay value (2 playthroughs should get you to see everything there is... I did 3 playthroughts within about 32 hours, doing ALL sidequests)- The camera is at times problematic (as it is in nearly every 3rd person game...)- The scalable difficulty is ok-ish but the highest difficulty still feels a bit easy (this is just me! more a feeling than anything else)- Its strictly linear, even if there are something to discover here and there- It feels like one of the skilltrees is a lot stronger than the other one (this may only be because of my prefered play style)Tl;dr:If you look for the next sandbox/skyrim: This is not one.If you look for a action packed rpg (like Risen or Gothic, just quicker and way more action + less rpg  :P) then this is the one for you :)			"

												I'm dissapointed at this game that had so much potential, but the combat system is brutally hard - and not like, dark souls hard where the mechanics and gameplay make sense and feel good, where there's the thrill of excitement and the adrenalin of completing something.... but hard because the system doesn't make any sense, because it's slow, boring and painful. And that is the worst thing you want in a combat system. I like the menus, I like the customisation, I like the talent trees and skills a lot, but those need combat to work well. The HD textures are okay but no where near enough to justify the price, in the UK this is £30 on steam. I wouldn't even recommend it at 50% off. Maybe not even at 75% to be honest. As for the storyline - well, it's terrible. It's a poor storyline, with horrible voice acting (and a few okay bits, but mostly horrible), and terrible writing with awful one liners. Thoroughly predictable and gives absolutely no immersion/connection to the character. And all that would be fine in a game that's 80-90% combat anyway, if the combat wasn't the worst part of the game. Don't touch this at all, at least, not in it's current state.			"

												I knew this was no AAA game going in, and in did, in fact, have a *lot* of issues: poor mapping, nearly useless vendors and crafting (I never bought a single piece of armor or any weapons, all the vendors had was junk), bizarre plotlines that just dropped off/never went anywhere/made no sense, your companions have about as much depth as a child's wading pool, and there were many issues in the dialogue -incredibly vague dialogue choices (quite a few times I had no idea how to interpret some of the options) miscues on gender, audio not playing, hell, they mispelled the PC's name a few times.  The game was sometimes fun for what it was, but overall it was shallow and felt incomplete and rushed in so many spots.  And with the terrible, abrupt endings they made available, I will probably never trust or play another Spider game.  I know some people say endings like this are good because real life isn't always a happy ending, but screw that.  I game to escape my life for a while, forget coming out of the game more disgruntled than when I went in!  If you're going to pull what they did, at least make it feel meaningful!  At least it didn't depress me, I was never able to get attached to any of the characters - and I'm someone who ALWAYS gets emotionally invested in these things.  The game advertises that all your choices matter in determining whether you go demon or stay human, too, and that is absolutely not the case.  If you make one incorrect guess on a dialogue choice in one of three spots, you're screwed.  You can be a saint throughout the game and you'll still go demon.I also just noticed that I never encountered a couple of the mobs shown in the images on the game's store page, so either I was weirdly unlucky, they looked nothing in game like they're being advertised, or it was straight-up deceptive advertising.In the end, if the game still interests you and it falls below $5.00, it'd be an ok diversion for a weekend if you don't expect much.  At the full price of $30, though? Absolutely NOT worth it.			"

												Bound by Flame lets you embrace the demon inside, or if your boring a more “moral” and less awesome path.  My choices affected not only my story but more poignantly my appearance and how I built my character.  The combat works well enough and like your story has multiple paths you can follow.   I chose quick dagger attacks with riposte and fire, lots and lots of fire.   I even had groupies that aided me in battle and added to the story.  My favorite was the White Witch and her ability to curse my foes with detrimental effects.  Even though most of the time I used her as bait to hold the undead’s attention with her skimpy dress so I could more easily stab them in the back with a fire dagger she never once complained, bit of a masochist I think.  Oh and the crafting, it really affects the game, is easy to use and adds a nice level of management on top of the character building.  I built traps and potions, enhanced my equipment and weapons and recycled what I couldn’t use for useful components to craft with as my adventure progressed.Unfortunately Bound by Flames world is not very diverse or expansive.  There are only three landscapes to explore; a forest, ice city and an “otherworld” all made up of corridors.  But it looked good enough and held just enough secrets to peak my interest as I explored it.  My adventure was long enough for me to grow into a flamey badass and wreak havoc on the evil ice lords without becoming bored by the relatively small world and budget graphics, presentation and A.I.  Spiders did a nice job with this one, they used their limited budget wisely and created a captivating if brief and simple world to explore when you are in between AAA RPGs. "

												The apocalypse is already happening.The side you're on has already lost.The world is falling apart under the tide of the endless hordes of the deadwalkers.No way you're stopping that,All there is to be done is to make the best of the FUBAR situation.With assistance of an ancient demon who has been imprisoned inside your body.Well, ♥♥♥♥.PROS:+ apocalyptic setting+ great OST+ SOME companions(<3 Mathras)+ drawing strength from the demon slowly transforms the hero+ humourCONS:- combat is ABYSMAL, will drive you insane more often than not- artificial difficulty(stems from bad combat design)- some characters couldn't be more cliché- the last zone and the final boss are ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous for all the wrong reasons- THE DOUBLE SHIELD SKELLIES, ♥♥♥♥ THESE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥SOh, Spiders..you've done it again.BBF is, by far, one of the most POLARIZING gaming experiences I've ever had.On one hand, we have this grim world which has already gone to ♥♥♥♥.The cavalry isn't coming, no legendary heroes are left to defend the realm.Intriguing and unique premises.Love it.On the other hand, BBF's combat can destroy the seemingly awesome experience in mere seconds.The general feeling and flow of moves, parries, strikes, blocking- stiff, counter-intuitive, broken.This is how combat mechanics SHOULD NOT be made.Hate it.Ultimately, I'm recommending Bound By Flame, despite its glaring flaws.The journey is worth it..or is it?There's gonna be joy and there's gonna be pain.Good luck, Vulcan.

												Story could be better but it's still very good. And if there's something I love about Spiders games is that they're damn hard. This one isn't different. I also loved the bad mouthed hero (or villain, depending on your choices). And, of course, I loved the fact that your choices could change your appearance. Oh, and you can be an evil lady. With horns. And flames going through your body. And horns. I loved the horns. You can't wear helmets when you're evil though. Because, you know, the horns. But hey, who needs helmets anyways? I sure don't, all I need is hornsIMHO it's an awesome game, it has everything a RPG lover needs: choices, crafting, hard battles, companions etcOne thing I absolutely hated though: you don't dodge, you take a step back. Really?! Who the hell thought it was a good idea? It killed me. Really. I died a few times because of it. Hope you can properly dodge in Bound by Flame 2. Because I do hope we get a BbF2.

												I quite enjoyed playing it, tough i had to lower the difficulty at the end boss from hawk to recruit.Pros- This is a hard game, if you have no experience with any type of soul game or even RPG's, then please play on recruit.- Decent story, and the cutscenes are good aswell.- Interesting mechanics regarding the usage of traps, crossbowbolts and dodging.- It feels like all the decisions you make have impact on the story, that is before the end boss.Cons- Most of the voice acting was just meh- You require multiple playthroughs to get certain achievements, like doing the game 4 times for 4 achievements isn't fun- Some bosses were just annoying, forcing me to consume all potions i had to win the battle- In the end, if you choose for a sword build, it'll be useless for the final battleOverall i'd rate it a 6/10, pick it up during a sale or something :)PS: This game contains some really vulgairly wicked language :D			"

												With the positive, i have a few buts to adress. This game doesnt deliever a ton for $30 (corrected), the gameplay gradually slows down more and more as you get further in the game,  the game is pretty short, and the skill tree is pretty small.for what its worth i think the game was pretty fun until you got to the last area, but fortunately the game doesnt drag on too long after you start to lose interest, and the final battle is pretty awesome.So if your trying to be economical i wouldnt recommend this game, but if your desperate to find anything to preoccupy you for a little while (about 20 hrs), and have a bit of fun, this game is better than most.

												The story isn't Shakespeare and the gameplay not flawless.  The prologue is a little slow and the dialogue is cringy most of the time.  Make it through the first hour and there's a hidden gem here!This is one of the best RPG's I've played in a while.  People nit pick how corridor-y this games maps are - I'm guessing most of you have forgotten The Witcher 2???  The maps (and lack of world map) make this game look boring and small but it's really not.  Each chapter is a large area pretty much the same as The Witcher 2 played.  Plenty of loot everything (in containers) that's not bolted down (my fav type of RPG that's not stealth focused.)  And you'll want to loot EVERYTHING.  Remember back to scavenging for parts in KotoR - and a similar upgrade system but you create the add-on parts and they all have cosmetic effects as well as stats.  The combat is a bit clunky but if you pick a build type and stick to it combat gets fairly easy and cheesy unless you play on a hard difficulty - but it depends on if how you like to play.  Some choices matter and some don't.  Listen to all the dialogue as sometimes you'll miss that 1 important thing you need to do or know.  If you're a fan of Spiders the developer and don't own this - grab it, well worth full price.  If you're just looking for a game with decent RPG mechanics and a solid 12-20 hours of RPG gameplay similar to 10 years ago it's a must buy but wait till it's on sale.  Graphics 3/5Story 2/5Gameplay 4/5RPG fun factor 4/5Overall 3.5/5 - it'd be a solid 4 for me if the either the story was more compelling or the voice acting not so cringy.  But it's so scratching my itch for my need of an older (2000's) style RPG.  None of this customize his cheek bones but not his sword type RPG - this is pretty much dead opposite.			"

But it pretty sucks on control. I suggest to buy this game when it has discount,It's not worthed in a full pricebut still, i love this game!			"

												This game was overly hyped, big time. It is not Mass Effect in a medieval era, that game would be Dragon Age, where they did it right. This game offers the illusion where every choice counts. In order for the different choices to matter to the player, the game needs to stay consistent to the choice. In this game, you may make a choice, and the consequences of that choices are not explained at all, or the game may even go back on that choice completely.This game is just not good. The combat is the main reason, it is horrible. You are given 3 skill trees, and right off the bat you have every skill already unlocked in the game, except for the ultimates at the end of the tree. Those that have played RPGs know how not fun it is to already start off with every skill and only spend points to make them stronger. The combat relies heavily on timing of dodging and parrying but can be easily exploited or worked around. For the early player, most enemies will seem to take forever to die, and so you are just spamming the same button combo and animation over and over again until they die. By the end of the game I honestly got sick of fighting enemies so I just ran right past unnecessary ones.Storywise, the story makes honestly no sense. Im not going to spoil anything for those who mistakenly still want to play, but lets just say it ends on a very lackluster note.Final note: Do not buy this game for $40, ever. If the game looks interesting to you, maybe pick it up during a sale, but I would never spend more than $20 on it.			"

												Bound by Flame has a very mixed set of reviews and after completing the game I understand why.Short & Dirty version: 7.5/10, Nice plot, could have been a LOT longer, audio & voice acting is decent, combat is simple but fun and can be very hard sometimes other times you can sleep through it. Worth it at a discount so wait for a sale. 10+ hours of gameplay.Long review:The game was recommended to my by a friend who said it was decent but short. Give how long the tutorial went for I assumed he was lying but he wasn't. Out of the 7 evil boss villains... you fight one and either save or destroy the world.The first half of the game seemed too easy and then 2nd half of the game seemed almost too difficult. Not sure if I chose the wrong feats or mix of skills but suddenly it was a complete shift.It's a 3rd person perspecitive semi-open world sandbox style of game except that you are very limited it where you can go and what quests are available. You really do get railroaded with the do it the GOOD way or do it the RENEGADE way.The endings are of course limited based upon a single decision you make very early in the game. There seems to be a lot of depth to the world yet you don't really get a chance to explore that beyond a mere scratch from all the dialogue which can drag on sometimes.There are several different styles of combat but in the end it's basically melee using a two-handed weapon, ranged (magic or mundane) or stealthy duel knife attacks involving a lot of spring attacks. In the end it doesn't matter cause you can literally just shoot the bosses to death with poison crossbow bolts yet without even spec'ing into it.The leveling up system is very simple but makes sense and the crafting system is equally as simple but something I preferred as it let you create on the fly if you need something rather than having to go back and forth a lot.The audio is quite decent with an amazing soundtrack at times and at others quite out of place. The voice acting is decent enough with some characters being outstanding such as the 6000 year old Necromancer(who is an absolute laugh) to the generic Elf or Peasant. There is some in-game humour and a bit of a tongue in the cheek at times so you can tell the dev team didn't want to take the entire thing too seriously.Overall I liked the game but was very disappointed there was no final cut scene. A bit disappointing really. No payoff. Worth the $5 I paid though. If you get it, I hope you enjoy!			"

												Right so I got a couple of issues with this game so I'll just separated into categories:I. Gameplay/Mechanics-Good things:1. While the combat is difficult most of the time it feels more challenging than a chore2. The levelling system for each skill is a nice touch and it can really make a difference3. It's a fluid hack and slash comparable to high budget titles in quality such as Batman:GOTY4. I love that you can craft, upgrade, and even recycle weapons, and the way Bound by Flame does it is very good as ingridents aren't neither super rare nor super common and you can also make one use items yourself5. One of my favorite aspects of the game has to be the booby trap, because it does not only help you out a lot, but they can also be upgraded and relocated6. This is more of a pet peeve but one of the things I loved about this game was that the whole lighting of the rooms made sense and wasn't overwhelming to the eyes, also I love how your character just makes a flashlight out of themselves, while funny to think about, it's very functional7. The action menu, yeah the one that like makes you go like in slow mo, it's nice-Bad things:1. Your hitbox, in comparison to the enemies' is huge, like you could be meters away from an Ice Spirit and they'd still would hit you if they are using the ice wave spell... thing... yeah you know which2. The warrior stance is kinda useless? I mean it's very useful for when you are fighting enemies weaker than you, but in game there's no such thing unless you grind for three days straight you might be onto par with what you're facing3. The guardian flame and the fire wave spells are also pretty useless, since with the burning weapon you are inflicting the most damage in the same time and the fireball is the only long ranged attack that does a passable ammount of damage (the bow's not that good, prehaps not for me as I never actually used it but because I prefer up close combat)4. Merchants in general are over priced but like VERY overpriced5. No fast travel so you have to go from point A to point B facing the same respawning enemies6. Fire resistance sort of useless too7. You can only save different gameslots once you arrive to Valvenor I thinkII. Visuals-Good things:1. I love the loading screens, themselves make the whole wait worth it and are very stylish2. The cutscenes are very well animated, in fact better than the game sometimes, so I don't know if it's good or bad because sometimes it reminds me to PS1 and PS2 games in that aspect3. FINALLY AN ACTION GAME THAT HAS A PALLETTE THAT ISN'T JUST BROWN (although if anything it's very common throughout the game sooo)4. The in-game menus look very nice and contrasts very well-Bad things:1. Wierd lightning, like in dungeons and caves you can barely see anything, but in midday, specially in icy areas such as Steppes of Caraldthas and Blackfrost's Domain, the atmosphere is too bright2. The models look a bit clunky3. Reusing the same enemies, I put this on visuals because I feel they could've just given another model to certain enemies but keep the same mechanics working and it would be fixed, but like, it just feels dull, I mean they even reuse bosses as normal enemies later on, again, it's just due to aestheticsIII. Story/Dialogue-Good things:1. The characters, I mean personally I found myself liking the characters more than I did about the story2. Branching paths that determine your relationships with each character that also involves quests (though one flaw of this is that they can't really hate you unless you choose between Edwen or Rhelmar)-Bad things:1. The dialogues from time to time are very cheesy or flat out gritty mc edgy2. The lip syncing could get a little more work3. The story is very meh, but I feel as if this could also be a good thing, because let's say Sonic the Hedgehog, I mean sure the first games were like ""Dr. Robotnik wants to take over the world, go stop him"" they were safer that way, because no one actually plays it for the story, but more recent games for example Sonic '06 just complicates itself too much ""Sun god wants to take over the world but his daughter, the princess can't cry but if she would everything would be okay, also you are a hedgehog that rescues her and she kisses you but like not really anyways"" which is, to say the least bad. Though I do feel like this type of game would be fit to have a more complex story, although it's not all that swallow for quests add a bit to it4. The romance options aren't unisex. C'mon guys, this is 2016 (well at least it came out by 2014) but come on. It's a good game but why the f*ck can't I romance neither Rhelmar nor Randval with a male character? I spent ten f*cking hours or more trying to kill the two concubines with Rhelmar's weak *ss to ""assist me"". And what do I get???? Nothing. Like seriously guys, it's the twentiethfirst century y'all why can't I have a gay romance?5. Needs more MathrasLike I just hope you guys could like patch these things soon enough, or maybe even fix it with a sequel... well maybe not a sequel, itself the game's story feels complete, maybe a spin off or something			"

Bound by Flame is an incredibly enjoyable RPG that is without a doubt one of the best RPG’s I have personally every played. It isn’t without a few minor technical issues, but overall is a fantastic experience and is certainly one I would recommend to RPG or adventure fans alike. The game is designed as a challenge and a challenge you will no doubt receive, but if you really don’t want too much of a challenge, there is an easy mode, so it shouldn’t be too difficult to play if you are just there for the story. The decisions are weighty in the story and everything you do feels as if you impact the world somehow, which is something other RPG’s have failed to make me feel. If you are looking for something a little outside your comfort zone with the current RPG’s on the market, I would highly recommend Bound by Flame, and quite frankly it’s one of the best releases from 2014 thus far.+ Inspired story with weighty decisions.+ Responsive and realistic combat system.+ Nice aesthetic and well realised world.+ Fantastic and immersive soundtrack.+ Huge amount of customisation.+ A unique and well thought out experience.- Voice acting quality varies.- Some minor terrain glitches.Don't forget to check out my video review if you wish to take an in-depth look with me! :)			"

												To summarize: Yes, it's kinda like The Witcher, and it's kinda like Dragon Age, and it's kinda like a fanfic version of Dragon Age Inquisition like remember when there was a long wait for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, so everyone and their monkey's uncle wrote their own fanfic version of it and when it finally came out, some fanfics were better than the real thing -- well, this is that in game form.Imagine if Dragon Age Inquisition was about Iron Bull and his mercenaries absorbing the Inquisition because Bull was the Chosen One? That would be this game, right here.Much like Mars War Logs, the original-idea-to-borrowed-idea ratio is somewhat messy, but the ingenuity of the way some ideas are used, as well as an ask-no-quarter grimdark approach to the story compensate for it.If you're looking for an unhyped fantasy RPG to play that's going to fill a ""I wish BioWare would spend more time closing plot holes than SJW-chasing""-shaped hole in your heart, this would be this game, right here.Downsides disclaimer: The third act of the game has a rushed feel to it, as it doesn't quite end the story in the way you'd have expected it to if it were a AAA game, and not in a good sense, but the sheer path-less-takenuity of it was ample compensation for me.Also, it's more Witcher 1 than Witcher 3, if you get my drift. Hopefully, Technomancer will improve upon Mars War Logs, and whatever follows, will improve on this game.			"

												Bound by Flame is a classic bait-and-switch marketing title. While there is a tremendous amount of visual polish and the interface/HUD are well-designed to handle the myriad of abilities, information, crafting, etc. that the game contains, the game underneath falls far short of that presentation. Bound by Flame attempts to tap into the ""tough-but-fair"" gamer demographic, with punishing combat even on the easiest difficulty setting. Unfortunately, a limited moveset and HP-sponge enemies make every single encounter an obnoxious test of both the player's dexterity and patience. The crafting and resource management system does nothing to redeem this flaw - equipment can be upgraded in a variety of ways, but these upgrades have no discernible impact on the combat. Perhaps the most major flaw is the writing & voice acting: the dialogue is incredibly redundant, tropey, and delivered in either a tepid monotone or an exaggerated facsimile of genuine emotion. The lines are synced to animations in-game, which means that almost every conversation has long, awkward pauses while a character finishes waving their hands in the air.Perhaps graphically-oriented gamers with an enormous lust for grind will find this game entertaining, but for most there will be nothing to engage after an hour reveals the limited extent of the core mechanics.

												Bound by Flame is a fantasy-themed action role-playing game. Bound by Flame puts the player in the role of a victim of a demonic influence, where it's necessary to choose between the evil powers that are offered or rejecting them in favor of developing heroic talents. It’s a good thing that Bound By Flame’s combat is its strongest point, because almost every major in-game conflict is resolved through violence. Structurally, it’s largely linear; though smaller maps and quests can be explored and completed in different orders, it’s always constrained by narrow corridors and a fairly rigid plot. Thankfully though, it strikes a harmony between its entertaining combat system and thoughtful role-playing progression, giving it a consistent forward momentum that held my attention despite its inconsistent story and writing.

												The game is kind of a mess to be honest. It certainly has some cool ideas, but there are just so many things wrong with Bound by Flame. Its a low budget action RPG disguised to look like some triple A Bioware type game. I was pretty excited when I first bought it, and I foolishly thought that it WOULD have a more higher budget feel, but after a few hours of gameplay I soon saw this game for what it really was. It's not all bad, and I do commend Spiders for their effort. I think this studio has a ton of potential and could someday very well be the next Bioware or something. However, the negatives outwweighed the positives for me with this game. The combat is...kind of terrible tbh. Incredibly unbalanced. Making enemies way harder than they should be. The voice acting ranges from average to mediocre for the most part. The companions are completely usless and for the most part uninteresting. They either do very little damage, or heal very small amounts of health. The story itself is fairly short. Though it does have some kind of cool moments. I do like the choice system. The story centers around your character being possessed by a flame demon. Throughout the game, you can either give in to the demons will(making yourself take on the demons appearance in the process, which has its benefits as well its consequences) or you can choose to fight it and keep your humanity intact. Thats about the only cool part though in my opinion. The story itself is not aprticularly interesting. I know It says that I am not reccomending the game, but I do think Bound by flame may be worth a playthrough if you enjoy these types of games and are willing to overlook a lot of the rough edges. Its not the worst thing in the world. It certainly has its enjoyable moments. Just don't expect too much			"

												Bound By Flame... If you enjoyed the other games from Spiders and/or Cyanide then I'm fairly certain you'll enjoy this one too. I did, until it became horribly unbalanced. And this started early on. There are so many difficulty spikes, even on the easiest setting so near the end I had just to quit. There was no way for me to win the last boss fight without having to restart a savegame from a few hours before and in my opinion this game just doesn't deserve my time. I like a challenge, just like everyone else, as long as it's fair. But this game doesn't play fair. And that's when I draw the line.The graphics are a good combination of realistic graphics mixed with a bit of cel shading. It actually looks really good, which was one of the features that drew my attention. And the fact that I enjoyed most of their recent games. Of Orcs And Men was just amazing, for example, and it still is to this day very unappreciated by many people. The voice acting is a mixed bag with decent voice acting here and there, but the voice of the main character just doesn't sound right. His voice is way too high for a man that looks this rough. It's weird. And some of the writing definitely could've been better.The game itself should take you 10-12 hours to finish, if you do nothing but the main quest. I think it took me about 10 hours to get where I am, and I did everything but a few failed quests (total of 8 I think). So completing the entire game will take you 15 hours, maybe a little more if you want to search every corner of the maps. Which is a decent length for an action RPG.It's just a shame that they didn't fine tune the difficulty properly. It's the main reason why I will not recommend this game.Maybe if it gets fixed someday but I doubt it will. Play at your own risk.[Rating: 68/100]			"

												After playing this for several hours you immediately notice that while its fun, its also slightly clumsy even in controller. This doesn't take away from the fun factor but it can make combat a little awkward until you get used to the timing and switching between combat modes. Overall the game looks like alot of fun with alot of opportunity to grow if given the chance so, give it the chance people!

												This is my first game review, and I am writing it specifically because  this game has gotten so much hate.I really enjoyed this game, even if it is a bit rough around the edges. Buy it on sale and I promise that you will never have invested your money more wisely (for a game ;)  ).PROS:Fun action-rich gameplay!decent storyfunny voice-actingdecent graphicsCONS:high difficultygame is a bit shortcustomization options are a bit limitedThe core gameplay is lots of fun, hacking, slashing, casting, and all of it skill-based. Its difficult to learn, especially on the higher difficulty levels (if you are having hard time, play on easy, seriously). You cant just rush into a group of enemies and hope to survive, you have to master parrying and counter-attacking in order to really do well. Those moves need to be timed well against incoming attacks, which at first is pretty hard, but you get the hang of it. But once you do its lots of fun!! You also have some choices regarding weapons used and their customization, which is fun, but it doesnt change all that much for the gameplay, I guess it becomes really significant on the highest difficulty level when you need every advantage you can get your grubby little hands on, but I havent tried that yet.The story is pretty good too, with good voice-acting. The protagonist is pretty foul mouthed, which you dont hear that often in the big-title games, makes for a fun change. Downside is that the game seems a bit short, there are 3 hubs and the story keeps suggesting that there should be more, but you dont get to see it.All in all, its a fun game with a good amount of replay value. Although its a small studio production it also looks pretty nice. Im on my third playthrough and I think those 5$ were well spent!!			"

												Bound By Flame.It's a simple, decent game. The good: *Music- The music is great, very atmospheric fits the game, amazing soundtrack! Loved it.*Player Choice- Some choices aren't clear as to whether they're the good or bad, which is great, it would've been nice to have more player choice involved though, the possession system is nice, if only it had come into play more.*Visuals- Personally, I liked the graphics of the game, while it's not the most pristine looking game, it's certainly got a beauty to it. Certain character textures or models are great quality really pleasing to see.*Although they lacked depth, there was a lot of side-quests, quite a bit to keep you busy and engaged.*Loot and items - weapons and armours look great! the Meh: *Exploration would've been better if the world was much larger and had more things to do The Bad: *Only two main repeated environments you'll run around in, made up of corridors filled with enemies. Enemies also lack variation because of this.*Characters- Outside of followers are entirely forgettable, didn't care for anyone.*Follower AI- Followers are really dumb, it's nice to see that they get out of your way in tight corridors, but in combat they'll happily just sit there draw aggro and take a beating, or rush in to get themselves killed.*No option to go full Pyromancer, it's only used as a sort of utility/back up thing. That's sad.*Dialogue/Voice Acting/Lip Sync- Our character (Vulcan) sometimes goes over the top with being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and is often quite vomit inducing with what they say. Voice acting kinda grating at times. While none are fully convincing, some lip-sync instances were downright terrible.*Story- Nothing particularly shocking, quite average.  It's just enough to get you through the linear game. The UGLY: *Combat- versus one enemy it's ok-ish, but multiple foes and ranged foes really show how bad the system is. If you're expecting something similar to Dark Souls think again.For me, the worst part of this game is the combat, they had an interesting approach but fails in practice. I find it slow, clunky and borderline mindnumbing at times. Enemies have far too much health. So you'll just be there tapping the same buttons over and over, which is worsened because there are two main attack types, Heavy and a chargeable Area Sweep. Enemeis do insane amounts of damage which would be OK if we did more than shaving off a few pixels of their HP. It's very tedious combat especially at the higher difficulties and it got too boring and unrewarding for me to continue so I switched down. On recruit it's bareable, but still poorly done.Warriors have absolutely no way to properly avoid damage either, if the tempermental ""Guardbreak"" didn't work then an enemy's magic AoE is gonna knock you on your ♥♥♥♥. You cn't block magicThere's no way to move around the battlefield at a quicker pace, so while moving you're still vulnerable to attacks. Moving while blocking slows you down and changes the direction you're facing. God help you if you get knocked down into a corner, between the camera fighting the wall and other minion enemies being able to kick you before you get up is a real pain. Getting stunlocked in a corner by a Concubine's kicks was annoying because there was no way to quickly get away, and  even with the perk  getting up is so slow and enemies can knock you down, while you get up! Warrior weapon swings are so slow too, and don't do much damage.Rangers have no control over their dodge, it's always directly backwards, which as you can imagine, isn't always favourable in a combat situation. The dagger combat was worse than the Warrior for me. Stealth was just pffft.*Also the targetting camera is very finicky and sometimes it's just better to just not use it. *The last boss battle. I was just me doing whatever, completely clueless I wasn't even sure what was going on, all I knew was that I hated it.*UNSKIPPABLE INTRO CUTSCENE?! This is a minor thing, but still. It's irritable if you make a new character! Overall:  The game had a lot of potential. Although there are some minor things that will get in the way, I'd like to reccomend it. A great Sale-Game. Although for the best experience, I'd recommend the easy path. The combat is just not fun at all, really sours the game because it's so frustrating. Everything else; the game is really enjoyable. It's also a very short game.But still good job to the folks at Spiders!			"

												The role-playing systems that support the combat in Bound By Flame are simple, but quite effective. Your character has three skill trees, labeled Warrior, Ranger, and Pyromancer, but effectively serving as a slow sword, fast daggers, and spells. Combat stances can be toggled on-the-fly mid-battle, with your selection of fire spells being available in both. I found I spent most of the early game in the defensive Warrior stance, but finished the bulk of the campaign using the speedy Ranger daggers. Every progression choice felt like a viable play-style though, allowing me to find what I liked, and exploit it to the fullest.Much of Bound By Flame’s combat is built around timing and precision, like when you face opponents who carry shields on their front and their back. You’ll need to either hit them from their flanks with daggers, or best them with perfectly-timed blocks and counter-attacks. The notably responsive controls are up to the task, conveying the rhythms of one-against-many combat surprisingly well. The same can’t be said for some of the single-opponent fights though, which can be either predictable and easy, or downright cheap, though those are happily quite rare.

Bound By Flame creates a bleak fantasy world, which it attempts to fill with a grimy, cynical perspective and dark humor. Sadly, neither the writing or voice acting are strong enough to quite pull off these ambitious storytelling goals. Its mercenaries are unsurprisingly profane and written to be amusingly juvenile, but their bawdy insults and nasty jokes are only clever half the time.The other half they fall flat thanks to wildly inconsistent voice acting and writing, which often wind up being unintentionally amusing.On the plus side, much of the rest of Bound By Flame’s presentation worked well. I quite liked most of the music, particularly some of the arrhythmic, drum-based tracks used during more demonic battles. The character models and animations are strong as well, particularly on the smooth-running PC version. Bound By Flame has one huge strength: the harmony between its entertaining combat and role-playing systems.ound By Flame’s combination of progression and action ultimately make it greater than the sum of its parts.

												Sometimes a game comes along, from an independent, small-ish company, that trues and manages to introduce new, fascinating ideas and implement them as a staple of genre design for the future.Unfortunately, Bound by Flame is not such a game. It's actually quite the opposite. It doesn't create a new experience but rather it seems to want to emulate what it thinks an RPG should have. Like a child, swinging around a toy sword, claming 'that's what the people on Game of Thrones do'.From its first trailers, the game promised a rich storyline, fun and varied combat and the big choice between power to overcome enemies or maintaining your humanity. While I can't talk about the last one, it's safe to say that it fails on the first two. Dialogue and characters are bland at best, outright stupid at worst. Horrible writing, cheesy one-liners and a voice acting that makes The Room seem like Titanic make it a gruesome, facepalm-inducing experience. Coupled with the fact that the designers thought adding the f-word in the game would make it all better, makes it even worse. Most of the time any dialogue you have makes very little sense...i'm sorry... very little ♥♥♥♥ING sense. See what I did, writers? So no, that aspect falls flat on its ♥♥♥.What about the combat then? Well, you're in for a shock. That's a mess too. The biggest dismay of combat is its painfully slow pace. Enemies seem to have huge health bars, even the crappiest of scouts takes a number of hits to finally go down. Moreso, it lacks feedback. Whatever you hit won't react to the blow, won't be stunned or impeded unless the blow is specifically designed to (see the guard-dropping kick). However any attack on YOU will stunlock. So it will indeed feel like you're swinging a cardboard tube around. Want more? How about adding in a lock-on system that is horribly shoddy (lock on to an enemy, yet launching a fireball at another for no reason) ? Does that pique your interest? No? Who would've guessed...The music is okay, but becomes repetitive early on, having the same menu tune pop up almost every other cutscene. However the graphics are beautiful, with the grim exception of human faces and lip-sync.All in all, it's not a good game. Don't waste your money on something even Two Worlds or Risen can do a lot better!			"

												After having played both Mars: War Logs and Of Orcs and Men and having a great time with them both, I was looking forward to see what developers Spiders-Games could do with this one. Raising up the budget a bit, with smoother graphics and details, was this gonna do good or bad for the game?For me graphics isn't the first thing I look into when finding the next RPG I want to play, it's gameplay, story and atmosphere. Of course there has to be some good combat tossed in, but as I said earlier it's the forementioned things.I  started playing The Gothic (1,2,3) games in 2012, The Witcher 1 in 2011, and Risen this year, and that's the kind of games and atmosphere that do it for me. And I'm probably one of the few that actually loved Gothic 1 more than nr 2 (Though that's also up there as one of the greats ever) and preferred The Witcher 1 over The Witcher 2.So if you could relate to any of that, and feel for a very good, solid RPG, not made with an AAA budget, this one is definetley worth a try.For me, it was a throughout pleasant experience, and I will reccomend it for type of players like me.

												Oh boy, this game is rather cruel :( didn't except a whole lot of challenge, but now my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is torn asunder.Pros:- Great enemy design. (and lots of them)- Decent storyline. (not perfect, but better than Skyrim at least)- Nice character sheet that offers different playstyles.- Different companions that react differently to choices made by the player.- It looks pretty sharp graphics-wise.- Many weapon and armor choices.- Voice acting is mostly good.- Ran flawlessly on my machine. (no FPS-drops or chrashes)Cons:- Most bosses are very annoying and will pin you against a wall whilst happily ending your life.- Very limited options when it comes to attacks. (no combos or ugradable skills in that aspect)- In the start of the game your character attacks so damn slow it will hurt your soul (upgrade attack speed as soon as possible!)- Frost enemies in chapter 3 especially. (not much to explain, they slow you down to a ludacris degree making fights horrible and needlessly difficult)Decent RPG that won't make you cry or cüm.Personal rating: 6/10 Get it if there is a discount			"

												Just finished a first play through, but I completed it more out of stubborness than anything else!Controls feel like an exercise in frustration a lot of the time, and while there's a mix of combat skills and fire magic, frankly it becomes apparent very early on that the Ranger path is the only one worth taking at all.Story was decent if generic, characters interesting enough if also generic, dialogue was quite amusing in parts, but not enough to redeem it.Overall, I think I'd have to rate it 5/10. Certainly not the worst game I've ever played, but didn't quite live up to the potential for me.			"

												This game blew my expectations for it out of the water. I honestly thought this game was going to be some maybe boring middle ware crap, but I was very surprised. The amount of features, like crafting, that they put into the game is amazing for the price of it. The story is not all that great, I didn't expect it to be, but the setting is.It's like a dark but high fantasy setting with tons of magic and other things you'd expect from a fantasy setting. However, it's set apart by the design of the world you explore, the monsters and beings you encounter, the lore that has actual good writing and effort put into it, and just how it was made.The gameplay consists of standard stat building and other such stuff, but it doesnt let you minmax or munchkin easily, or at least I wasn't able to. I was very satisfied with the combat and how everything played out in it, it was very unqie but not too different as to where it would be off putting to get into.The characters are actually very well done, if a bit maybe 2 dimensional, but I'm not expecting an epic out of a 20 hour game with a few replays possible. That reminds me, the game is surprisingly replayable, what with at least 3 or 4 endings, multiple followers and choices with them, and how to build your character.The game itself is linear and soemwhat short, as I said about 20 hours. Though, as I also said, I didn't have super high expectations, so that may taint my opinion a bit. All in all, I thought how the game presented this was perfectly acceptable, I enjoyed every bit of it.Overall, this game is worth it at around $30 in my opinion even though I bought it on sale at around $20. I am very satisfied with my purchase and hope to see more games like this in the future.			"

												I fired up the game only for the Steam cards and forgot it open. I tried it later on and it feels a bit reminiscent of Dark Souls. It's rather simplistic, with silly names, dialogue and story (Your character is called Vulcan and at some point complains that he's burning, yeah, great name choice), however it's enjoyable if you don't have anythign else to play. The cutscenes are unskipable though, which can be annoying.			"

												I applaud Spider Studios for making absolutely stunning trailers/teasers for their games (besides Faery, but I digress). They really make Bound by Flame look like an A+ game. It's not. Spoiler Alert!Ever play a game where you're given lots of options as to how to win? Of course you have. How about a game where every enemy is overpowered and you're weaker than a newborn baby with a pencil? Probably. BBF offers these kinds of things, but don't be fooled: those options are invalid. Yes, you heard it here. Now, maybe it's my opinion, but you can most likely get through the game by mashing the left mouse button to attack when necessary and the Q button when getting attacked. As long as you select and build the Ranger skill tree. Explanation of the Main Part of the GameSpeaking of which, the game offers two types of ""classes"" to use. Warrior, of which wields one of three weapons: Two-handed sword, axe, or hammer. Ranger, of which uses dual-daggers and a crossbow. Sword offers highest attack speed, with no interrupt (a.k.a. knockback, which is actually important). Axe offers half of that attack speed and some interruption. Hammer offers almost no attack speed (so ridiculously slow that you might be able to work your nine to five job and get back in time to hit the opponent) and all the interruption in the world (if you can actually hit your opponent before their attack goes through, then you can stop all of it). As for Ranger? It's just dual-daggers that have all the attack speed and critical hits in the world, but literally no interruption. Oh, and they have a crossbow that is almost completely useless. Little mines/bombs are available, too, since your character is apparently a demolition expert, yet only has one type of bomb (I think I missed my chance with the other type). Lastly, your fire abilities, of which I only found like two or three to be useful.Now for why this is all useless. Slowly throughout the game, sword becomes useless, then axe becomes useless, then hammer becomes useless, then daggers become the God of all weapons. Without Ranger and bombs being built, you'll have trouble on the last boss, which plays completely differently from every other enemy you've encountered so far. So it's like a whole new game. Even mashing Q won't save you all the time, but it will most the time. Point is, you will not win the battle using Warrior. Then again, maybe if you spend an hour or two on him, you will?Do I recommend this game?There is so much more to say (since this game is pretty controversial), but that is the main thing I wanted to share. Even with all of the faults of the game, I had a lot of fun. For full price, it is not worth it. For half price, no. For less than ten bucks? Sure. Good time killer, fun hack and slash that isn't TOO difficult, hilariously bad dialogue and voice acting, and decent graphics.			"

												Bound by Flame, is, in short, a small developer's attempt at Dragon Age in my opinion.You are Vulcan, a mercenary of the Freeborn Blades cast into center stage in a fight for a world on the brink of destruction at the hands of seven evil Ice Lords when a ritual somehow goes wrong and you are possessed by a flame demon, of sorts.The combat in this game is as good as any tactical RPG I've ever played and in some ways it is better. It could be compared to that of the Witcher 2, but more fluid and with a few more options. It is actually VERY fluid, very responsive with it's stance dance between sword and dagger with some magic available for use in either stance on account of our uninvited 'guest'. The options for customising how your character functions through armor/weapon augments and skill trees are fairly broad, though I WAS left with the impression that the game had an unintentional 'better' way to do things. That being said, I believe the game is playable and beatable using any playstyle available within. The monsters... FEEL monstrous. Even on the second difficulty level I found that I would be easily killed by even a single enemy if I didn't use the block and dodge features given to me. And the bosses definitely feel bossy. Without careful manipulation of the boss mechanics, you WILL die. Painfully. The visuals leave something to be desired. On the highest settings the graphics were comparable to that of the console release of Dragon Age: Origins. Possibly even of slightly less quality. I often found choppy edges, armor and weapons clipping with each other. Even texture clipping in stationary environmental objects (come on, really?). There was definitely room for improvement here.The voice acting is hit and miss. It seems to fluctuate between great and averagely average. Some of it was downright awful, and the lip syncing is very badly done. Sometimes the characters' faces don't even move! There is only one character who's voice acting is consistently awesome, and it sadly isn't the player character. The game's text is plagued with grammatical errors and some of the subtitles are entirely missing. The thing most frustrating though is sometimes the audio files play twice, or don't even play at all. It doesn't happen often, but when it does you'll be facepalming every time.It is also worth mentioning that, as the game is a multiplat with THREE consoles releases, it seems to interface was built with a gamepad in mind and thusly, the game feels a lot more intuitive and responsive with a supported gamepad. It is definitely playable with a keyboard and mouse, but the learning curve is so steep that I honestly found myself digging out my wired XBOX 360 controller just to get into the game without having the obstacle of learning the somewhat obtuse keyboard layout, or having to remap everything.Overall though, I feel this game deserves a 7/10. The game has room for improvement, but with a good story, great combat and decent customisation, it has a lot to offer any RPG player.			"

												I do recommend the game, but please read this large con before buying the game : played this 90 minutes on the easiest game setting; 70 minutes of opening movies and interaction with the enviroment and npc's, 10 minutes looking thru the skilltree and weapon upgrade system. the other 10 minutes i was in combat with enemies. of these 10 minutes, i played dead 7 minutes. litterally ,,, on the easiest game setting, i was more dead as alive and restarting from previous checkpoint, in the middle of ♥♥♥♥ing combat only to die again, reset and die... like a loop...the game offers 4 difficulty settings, and the easiest one, is simply not easy enough for me.  not a good game for those of you who prefer a combat system, that is easy-going. start simple and build up.... this game will throw u right into the deep...----------------------------------pro's:Did love the fact that some parts of mission ""failed"" because i refused to talk to some npc's. this did not caused the game to reload a check point, it only mentioned that a part had failed, and new options became available....Did also love the abusive and agressive way the npc;s talk to you and to each other. if you dont like name calling, u will not like this game...

												Bound by Flame it's another game made by Spiders, the same studio that brought us Mars: Wars Logs. Although BBF it's more ambitious it shares some of the same problems of it's predecessor. The combat it's functional some issues like the targeting system which can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ especially during the final boss, and camera does not help either although that in only noticable when you fight a big group of enemies in a small area. You have 3 types of combat which you can choose from and you can switch between them anytime in battle making the fights a little more diverse. The Rpg elements are there by offering you different specializations (warrior, ranger and pyromancer) and it has also a solid crafting system although it can be a little stupid because you can purchase all the components when you want without going to a shop...The story it's decent, you are a mercenary that becomes possessed by a demon and now you have control this new power inside you while saving the world from the Ice Lords, along the way you have to choose if you want to resist the demon or let him consume you. There are lot of decisions that will change the outcome of the game as there are companions with their own personal backstories and beliefs.So there you have it, Bound by Flame is almost like every triple A rpg nowadays but with a big lack of polish. Go ahead Spiders, do another one.			"

												To cut a long story short, this game is fine.It's not too great, but you can play through it and it doesn't feel like a loss of time. There are a lot of different quests and a few side characters with their own backstories/romances (most of them can and will die at some point, depending on your choices). Although skills are not super balanced, you have 3 skill-trees to play with and some perks to increase your overall efficiency. There is also a simple crafting system that doesn't bring any new ideas to the game, but it's not excessive.So, imho the game is worth its price.			"

												Potentially outstanding RPG that fails in detailTake your average RPG. It starts with some redneck in a village or library, who suddenly finds himself in a middle of a quest to save the world. The guy has no experience, no motivation, no skills to survive, yet he presses on, driven by players desire for loot and motivated by an idea that he's the chosen one. A scenario that is impossible to swallow if you're at least 10 years old.Real life doesnt work quite like that. Bioware, that has set RPG staple has also set rules that doesnt leave a lot to work with. Mass effect, Dragon Age, Baldurs Gate, Neverwinter nights etc etc all start with basically the same tune, their only saving grace being masterfully written dialogue and intricate universe, that makes up for poor introduction.Bound By Flame actually challenges that scenario quite well, unlike Dark Souls for example, who chose to take their own path, BBF follows in Bioware footsteps, however with a much better concept. You are playing as a mercenary, someone, who’s life is battle and who doesn’t shy away from danger. Or adventure. You are not a loner - you are a part of a company with established hierarchy. Thus you don’t even have much choice on the matter. You get your orders and your orders go with the money. The region faces an invasion from a force that is believed to be invincible. Situation that sellblades usually thrive on. (which sadly is not quite capitalized on by developers)Invaders - the Ice Lords employ endless legions of undead to raze all in its wake. In a desperate attempt to turn the tide a group of mages summon a demon to this world. A demon, who takes control of your body.Now all that is not especially original, but that kind of stories just sell themself.  Its a rich soil if you just play by the bookMorally: Do you use this power for personal gain or greater good? Motive: Do you act quickly before the demon consumes you? Or do you try to tame the monster to do your bidding?Consequence: What is the price for power? To defeat a monster does one become a monster? And what comes after this?You know, you got a lot of storytelling problems solved by the ""demon"" twist.Unfortunately, story cannot handle even this basic clichés . The demon turns out to be some sort of a greenpeace fanatic. All this possession stuff doesn’t get you anywhere and there is barely consequence to it, nor satisfactory explanation. The story is shallow and unsatisfying, leaving more questions that answers. You character gruesome appearance, as the demon manifests and takes over his human body is barely noticed by npc's. Your gain in power is irrelevant to your choices thus there is no risk, no reward - no consequence to your actions. It ends up an aesthetic feature, which is a waste.Voice acting is often criticized but I found it bearable. In fact its not the voice that’s annoying, but sheer amount of chatter every other person is willing to do. No matter what, I just couldn’t relate to any of the characters, who just don’t get enough time, neither enough personality. Witch is a *itch, Knight is stupid, Healer is unhappy, Elf is righteous. Oh there’s also a lich that looks just like that guy from ""tales from the crypt"" and is sort of fun to have around.Don’t get me wrong : the game has it all. Loot, skill trees, crafting, chatter between characters, npc quests. Romance even. But somehow it just doesn’t feel right. The reason is quite the same. No matter what you say or do your companions will act the same, say the same. You will never experience that ""what if I picked another line"" feeling that forced you to reload Bioware games a couple of times just to hear it all.Concept is great, but storytelling is terrible.A lot of stuff seems to be raw and unfinished. For example background chatter is vaguely introduced in the beginning of game, but quickly disappears.The game is short. There are supposed to be 7 Ice Lords to defeat, but you only get to combat one. On the bright side I found some features satisfyingPC and Demon chatter - unfortunately demon is a little bit weird and talks way too much, but he's voiced nicely and at first it is thrilling to try to understand his motivation (well, until you do, afterwards it its a disappointment)Demonic appearance and Voice - transformation is handled nicely. Demonic voice and appearance look and sound intimidating. Unfortunately there is no one in game world to adore or tremble as NPC just fail to notice you're a horned burning creature.Early bosses re-introduced later in the game. Some might argue that a boss should have a unique feeling to it. While thats true I loved the experience how much more powerful I've become. That bosses that I used to struggle in early game were that much easier to beat later on, I could take even two at once and survive, while fighting off skeletal henchmen.That brings me to probably only things devs got ""almost"" right. Combat.Combat in this game is criticized as well, but I found it very rewarding once you've learned some tricks. There are two melee stances with a lot of defensive and offensive options: block, evade, guard crush, parry, counters, interrupts etc. The combat mechanic is hard to master and without mastering it you will get slaughtered painfully. Unlike most modern games if a monster knocks you down, the rest of the crowd doesn’t just stand there, but willingly rush to finish you before you can get up and defend. There is no invulnerability during attacks. If you're swarmed, you wont be able to strike, b/c your enemies will hit you before you reach them. Block to much – AI will guard crush you right away. Controlling combat space is difficult, fighting multiple enemies , even weak ones, is suicidal at harder settings. Overall combat feels very tough and feels very real. Every battle is dangerous and chaotic, there is no sequence that ""wins"" this monster, you are constantly threatened. It is difficult to break enemy line to get the archer without dying, but leaving him there is not an option as he will kill you quickly. It feels almost hopeless sometimes and is almost a matter of luck. The tools to beat your enemies are there, but they are so hard to master that battles feel ugly and stressful, like real combat should.  However this design, (that not everyone would appreciate, of course) is plagued by two terrible oversights that ruin the fun and thats been long solved in most games : potion abuse and monster kiting. Potions are not exactly easy to obtain since they are expensive and there are never enough components. But still they are pretty spammable to a degree (they take some time to activate, so you have to get some distance between you and enemy before using one) Some kind of cooldown or ""potion slots"" would solve the problem, but... (by the way you can craft stuff during combat. ""Hey big skeleton guy, would you give me some time, I gotta brew stuff"" so dont bother to stock up before atacking some boss. Small oversight, but there are infinite numbers of them, that just add to the impression)Monster kiting is a little bit dumb. Every group is attached to an area, once they get outside that area they just stop trying to hit you, turn their backs and go home. Huh? So yeah. Exploitable. I wont list a huge list of small stuff  (like the one with combat crafting) - there is never ceasing feel of awkwardness that accompanies everything that's going on. still it is forgivable, what is not, that a great concept has been reduced to blank and shallow story. The main disappointment with Bound by Flame is not its flaws, but that through them you can clearly see what kind of great game its aiming to be and its just killing the mood.			"

												Bound by Flame is ambitious, but doesn't manage to achieve the intended goal. A highly mediocre RPG, it remains enjoyable once you've got used to the rather quirky nature of it all. Environmental design is great and together with a day and night cycle and good music create a solid atmosphere. Combat is incredibly hit and miss, feeling sluggish and clumsy while in the warrior stance, but fast and relatively fluid while stabbing your undead enemies back to death in the ranger stance. The story in Bound by Flame can be summed up as generic, and feels disjointed as it rapidly skips through major events while suffering from poor dialogue. Bound by Flame is an incredibly flawed gem, but one that may just be worthy of your time if you enjoy these types of action RPGs and can forgive it for having glaring, glaring problems.

			It's been a while coming, but here is my Long, In-Depth Review. I cover basically every facet in detail. Thanks to Focus-Home Interactive for the review copy.		

This video clocks in at 45minutes, I try to cover basically every aspect, as I was told quickly afterwards I don't talk much of the actual combat itself, but there isn't really anything to it. I don't want this to just be me dumping my video on you all, but the script and review is like 9 thousand words, the video will be easier to take in. Still, to summarize, it's not good, it has tons of problems, but I would still recommend it on sale and if you don't take it too seriously. It can be fun.			"

Positives:- Quests: Decent and enjoyable. Never had the problem of being overburdened with shallow sidequests. It's pretty easy to fail them compared to other RPGs I've played if you aren't paying close attention, but I kind of liked that. Not many games dare to do that. - Pretty good sound track. There are some very memorable tracks in there.- Voice acting is good (except for the main female voice sometimes! Criiinge), one of the character's voices sounds like it came from one of the Divinity games. That was an extra plus point for me.- Combat difficulty: I know this won't be to everyone's liking but, I like games that don't let me mindlessly button-mash, and make me careful about engaging a group of enemies. It's very reflex based, and you have to pay close attention to what the enemy is doing and is about to do. It feels very rewarding when you've timed it right and earned your chance to attack. This way you don't feel completely powerless and weak. Neutral:- Choice options. Sometimes they were nice and felt significant. Other times choosing one thing didn't seem to make a difference (just a slight detail is different). -  Gameplay concepts: Interesting ideas, a lot of potential like in night & day rotation, possession and theme of fighting for your identity, crafting and traps, modding your weapons and armor. However, it falls a little short. Not enough development time? - Story. It had an interesting setting, but too much of a focus on the main villains. More could have been done to get players immersed in the world. Important cities and people, more narrative, more story about the adventure. Negatives: - Characters: A little cliché. One character in particular seems like a copy of a certain other character from the Dragon Age series, voice acting and all. Not enough time for the characters to develop. It's a shame, because I did develop some feeling near the end, but not enough to care greatly about them. - Graphical glitches and models get into strange positions sometimes. (Like when talking to a companion while sneaking, they end up with a very bad posture!)- Too short- Combat stances: You can switch between warrior (2 handed weapon) and ranger stance (daggers) in battle. I ended up completely ignoring the warrior stance at some point and just relied on ranger. I felt like this could have been developed a little better, to make it so that you would need to switch between the two depending on the situation, otherwise they should have just made it class based, imo. All in all, still an enjoyable experience. Not amazing, had some major dissapointments, but still kept me engaged. I know the developers don't comprise of a large team, but I can see potential. Would recommend getting it on sale.			"

												A massively underrated middle budget RPG. It's ugly as sin and the voice acting is laughable most of the time, but underneath that hideous mug lies a game with well executed tactical combat, a myriad of available companions to choose from, a fantastic crafting system for customizing your equipment, and one of the most underappreciated scores in recent years.There's no guff. No nonsense. No BS. Bound by flame is a bit of simple, well executed game design that was simply made on a limited budget and with limited time. Its a fine pick if you see it on sale.			"

												Is this the best game ever? No, but it is far from the worst. it is a fun RPG and i think people are to harsh on the game cause people have grown to have high standards for any game but especially RPGs. Now i bought this game on sale for $6 and if you can get it on sale i would recommend trying it out for yourself but i don't think it's worth $30. It is a fun game but there are some flaws to the game which make the game worse its combat is like a worse Witcher and the game is challenging and for that it makes the game much better the fights are pretty fun because a lot of the types of monsters have a unique fighting skill. So overall i would say it's a 6.5/10 or so i would say it's in the middle you can get worse RPGs but you can get much better aswell.			"

												The best trash game you will ever play. It's nothing special in almost every aspect, but it's all tied together so well and I have come out of it really enjoying myself due to the characters and overall atmopshere of the game.  The choices really matter, the challenge is definitely there, soundtrack is dumb but extremely endearing, best $6 sale game I have played. Wait for discounts on this one, and you'll be extremely satisfied. Spend $30 and you'll probably feel salty about the whole situation.			"

												Hey!! im not much into reviews because a persons enjoyment of a game is a pretty subjective thing. That being said their are soo many harsh and unfair reviews that i am making one to help balance things out. Note:Played origionally on ps4 The Bad: This game is by no means amazing. This game is not as polished or gritty or as well executed as dark souls. The story is meh and the voice acting is kinda lower end. The enviroments are also pretty linear. Companions are next to useless, especially on hire difficulty levels. a little too much fighting in corridors can make for some really annoying encounters. enemies retreating can fully regain all of their health. I would have loved to have a better dodge in this game but it does work. NO NEW GAME PLUS :(The good: This game is allot of fun!! ihave to say as a person who has completed demon souls, dark souls 1,2, half of 3 and bloodborne its nice to have a very similar game that isnt as hard and has a more casual relaxing feel to it. If you could enjoy lords of the fallen where every enemy and there dog has a shield, surely you will enjoy Boud by flame. It has a great appeal in the fact that it can be played by people of all skill levels (difficulty selection). I really enjoyed what they did with the ability to buff your weaspons and gear with passive and active stats. The ability to switch between fast and heavy weapons on the fly was really nicely done as well as the ability to pause combat by opening your arsenal wheel and selecting a plan of attack. The option to grind for xp and loot is an option (levels are linear soo you have to go out of your way to do this). DS vets will have a big advantage and less of a learning curve with this game as their reflexes and ability to asess situations will be a bit sharper than most peoples, so it is framiliar territory wich is satisfying. Music rocks!! Mouse and keyboard is FULLY functional wich is something that should be a given for a game playable on a computer (shakes head at dark souls). Weapons and gear all look nice and bad ♥♥♥. Boss battles allthough frustrating are fun and satisfying when you finally win. You wont die nearlly as much as u would in a souls game.If you decide to buy this (i would gladly play 30$ for it) just remember their is a tool for every job. Just because you want to use a broad swordd on an enemy doesnt mean you should even though it will be doable. i think this is where people get frustrated with the game. Make good use of your traps and majic (this is essential). This game is not perfect but it is allot of fun. Dont let the haters discourage you! They just wanted a DS carbon copy :p "

												   First of all, I want to say that I am a gamer for more than 15 years and have experienced many, many games. And RPG is my favorite genre.   So here we go. Bound by flame is a demonic fantasy world RPG with so big potential and so amazing universe. The game follows Vulcan (regretfully, although you are asked at the beginning of the game about your name, you are Vulcan...) pretty interesting character who has a demon inside him. The first bad thing that you will meet is the mediocre voice of the NPC's and of the main hero. There are some not that good jokes and insults along the way but if you don't really dig into it, you will be fine. The good thing though is that the voice changes as you choose what to be - a good hero or a bad demon.    The game takes you to pretty different quests and nasty creatures. The cool thing about this RPG is that it's pretty intense and you go along with people who helps you along the way. The bad thing is that the combat system is pretty hard and really, really hard to expert. The bosses are hard sometimes and if you jump directly to higher difficulties, you will be pretty annoyed, but there are much games with bigger expectations and budget and are a worse.    Given the fact that it's almost an indie project with a new, small studio developing the game, I really enjoyed it and I recommend it to RPG fans. I don't share with the general opinion that the game is not worth it. I hope that there are more projects like that one so you don't play all along the same thing everyday.  "

												While it's not the most amazing game in the world, it really is a lot of fun. I'm a huge RPG fan, so I like games ranging from Baldur's Gate to Neverwinter Nights to Dragon Age: Inquisition. I bought this game to try it out because it looked like fun, it was an RPG like Dragon Age, and, well, I'm a sucker for romancing NPC party characters, which it promised to let you do. It's got some flaws, such as your character being bland and cussing a lot as well as linear world settings and creatures spawning like they're in a dungeon and your character dying a lot due to stupid things like the battle AI and weird voice acting mixed with a limited amount of dialogue, but it's fun. I like talking to some of the characters and learning their back stories. I like the idea of deciding between being a messed up human with a demon inside you or turning into a demon. The storyline is pretty cool; drew me in enough to get 20 hours of gameplay out of me. I like the battle system where you get to choose three types of classes and then mix em all to beat up the enemies. I like that you can craft potions and items and do get chances to befriend/romance/enemy characters that you meet. It's quite a strange game. It's got it's flaws and it's got good things about it that set it apart from other games. As my husband calls it: it's an Indie Dragon Age and I kinda agree with it. Don't let reviews prevent you from trying out the game. I love it enough to consider playing it a lot more, so I think you should try it too if you love RPGs like me.			"

												So ive just finished the game myself and for me its an extremely mixed bag. SPOILER WARNINGS.COMBATThe combat system in general is actually pretty nice. It takes away from the standard hack and slash type games and goes for a more defensive style, but doesnt curb stomp you too hard if you dont get the learning curve right away. The best way I can sum it up is it feels like Dark Souls if it was easier. However dont let the review quotes fool you into thinking its much more in depth than it seems. When they say multiple combat styles, what they really mean is two: Warrior which focuses on blocking, counter attacking, using two-handed weapons, and kicks to stagger enemies and Ranger, using two daggers in quick rapid combos, dodging and a stealth mechanic. There is a third skill tree to go down, Pyromancy, yes fire type magic is the only kind you use in this game but it comes in several options for offense and defense so its in a way a varying utility tree.In essance, the combat system can be a bit rough, especially for new players. It punishes you for mistakes so either learn your mistakes quickly or change your strategy. As I said, it feels like a Dark Souls game where every hit you take counts, positioning matters, and good reaction times are keys to winning. The options for making your own play style are there, but honestly in my opinion, they feel unfinished. The weapons for Warrior stance are Swords which are quick but weak weapons, Axes are a bit stronger and have better crit rating but are slower, and Hammers which are the slowest but stagger enemies more often. Rangers are limited to using only daggers and you also come with a hand crossbow and trap bombs you can lay about. You are allowed to craft addons into your weapons and armor with materials, anything from increasing damage, crit rate, staggering chance, physical resistance, magic resistance, etc. So farming up materials is important. You are also allowed to take one companion with you amoung the ones you meet along the way, each of them having pros and cons so it really makes you have to choose wisely for the best one suited to the task.STORYThis was a very major point that could make or break the game.....and unfortunately for me it broke. The base of the story is that a group of mages grew so powerful they became the Ice Lords of Frozen Shadow, blanketting most of the world in ice and raising the undead into armies to take control of what little the humans and elves have left. Naturally this adds a sense of dread. Combined with the difficulty of the game, the feeling of this impending doom always looming over you really inhances the experiance of making every resource count. The undead have you and the little allies you have pinned in a corner and youll feel like a rat in a maze while a snake follows just behind.SPOILER WARNINGYou play as the explosive expert in a group of mercenaries called the Freeborne Blades and you have been hired by a group of scholar/mages called the Red Scribes. Your job is to protect them while they perform a ritual that could turn the tide of the war. Everything is quiet until, uh oh, the undead start to raid the temple and you have to defend it. Pretty much in a nut shell, the Red Scribes summon a fire demon and it chooses your body to be its host. After this happens, you and your company have to travel across the land to get them to the elven city. Inbetween there you meet several characters that become party members. Once you reach your goal, you find that the elven city has been taken by one of the Ice Lords and your role in the war isnt over just yet.Ok so here are the mega spoilers if you really wanna keep more to yourself.The game is always throwing at you and reminding you that there are several Ice Lords, but you only fight two depending on your ingame choices. This was incredibly game breaking as they build up that you are the savior of the land that wields the flame of the world itself to take down the ice lords, and you only have to really kill one of them before going onto the final boss. Hell, you dont even SEE the rest of them. All you get is their names and I dont know if this was suppose to be a set up to future games or not, but in my eyes its alot of story and build up for a whole lotta nothing. What happens when you beat that Ice Lord? What are the rest of them doing while you are doing that? Lots of questions and no answers leaves a player stranded on an island without even so much as a palm tree to sit under. Its barren and this is why I say it feels unfinished. So much wasted potential for so little a reward.SPOILER ENDAll in all, I thought the story was quite nice, the characters were alright but most could use some polishing up to make you really dig into them and their lives. There isnt much interacting besides doing some quests for them now and again and beyond that just talking about them or asking them questions on the situation. Nothing really holds you or gets you truely involved with them. Even the romance sections are lack luster so dont believe the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t review that says its like Mass Effect only in a differant setting. Its not even close by a long shot, but all I can say is it was a good try.GRAPHICS AND SOUNDThe graphics can be a bit annoying at times when it flares up in brightness from sun shining through the trees or a patch of ice with mist around it starts glowing white, and turning down the brightness makes everything darker so its up to the player. The textures are decent in my opinion, the facial hair was very nice by actually making it look scruffy and rough rather than just a smooth shape. The character design options are slim so youll have to make do with the best you can but in the end it feels good enough to get by. The music is very nice, though sometimes it can cut over the voice acting if you leave it at max. The voice acting itself feels alright, but again unfinished and needs polish. Some characters sound too stoic and others arnt expressing enough and it can kill immersion quite a bit. The sound effects such as hacking with your weapons was actually rather nice and I enjoyed them, it made it feel rough and real instead of the regular sleek sounds you normally think of with swords.FINAL JUDGEMENTWith everything I experianced from the story telling to the combat system, characters and game mechanics I would say it is worth getting, but never at full price as its not worth that much. I would say get it at at least 50% off or more, that way you are getting your monies worth. There is FAR too much story left out of the game and its alot shorter than your going to want it to be which leaves you disappointed. The multiple choices you make have some impact, but it doesnt feel like they have any weight to them so it will make you wonder what differance it really made and that takes away from the replay ability. You would probably play this game twice at minimum, the second time making all the opposite choices just to satisfy your curiosity but thats about it so dont expect anything really major, the game is far too short to carry anything substantial.My advice, buy at your own risk if you want a good challange, decent characters and story, and a good time killer just dont expect anything ground breaking or award winning as this game is sorely lacking in those departments.The short version: 6/10			"

												I enjoyed it but the combat is really infurating - literally hold block until you see a windows, normal fights can take forever just because of this stupid waiting game.A cool story though with a demon taking over your body (if you let it).Pretty good but only just above average.

												When you invest the time to master the challenging combat and explore the world, Bound by Flame is a solid romp with rewarding tactical action supported by rewarding boss battles and plenty of ways to see your choices reflected in the world around you. There are minor graphical glitches but overall the storyline is enjoyable and entertaining. I would consider this game very similar to Dragon Age. It's very linear but overall a quality RPG, especailly if you enjoy good story telling. The game offers about 20 hours of gameplay if you decided to unlock all the possible endings and romance sequences. I recommend this game especailly if you enjoyed Dragon Age.			"

												While Bound by Flame is not a AAA title, it does have a unique charm about it. I enjoyed playing the game and progressing through the story. The story wasn't fantastic but was enjoyable. The main character is forgettable, but it makes him feel more like the mercenary he is and not some fabled hero he isn't. The talent trees offered for different play style augmentations and allows you to build a custom character all your own. A lot of the talents weren't great, but there were some that were amazing.I enjoyed having to think some battles through and being required to change my play style for some encounters. One style does not fit all encounters. "

												Pretty damn good game overall. Yes there is issues with the combat that isn't fully explained that leads you to despair but if you work at it. It soon becomes easy to handle that most fights you'll dance around your foe and kill them off with very little damage to you. Voice actors as always are a bit hit and miss but not really a big problem as lots of games suffer that.The bleak setting reminded me of The Witchers games which I love and the dialogue can be hell of a funny and gritty to bring smirk or two when talking to NPC's. Party members fall into the same traps as other games in that their mostly meatshields for the most part in fights. The ending fight needs some work as the difficulty goes effing vertical on that fight compared to anything before it.Lovely atmosphere and setting with nice graphics around and never encountered a single bug in all my time playing it. Wait on a reduction and nab it then if you're not so sure on it :)			"

												Graphically the game delivers the minimum for a product which came out in 2014. Sometimes it is ugly, characters are not looking too good either, but creatures and environments have enough detail and quality. Performance could be better. Lights and shadows look good on ultra. The detail of distant objects is not really a concern as the game mostly takes place in closed spaces. The game cannot compete with any of the high budget titles, but it does an acceptable job.In terms of world design Spiders went on the same route as before. The world consists of multiple areas. These areas feature tight corridors with occassional open spaces which usually serve as an arena for bigger fights. Like in many other streamlined game movement is highly restrained, you cannot fall from cliffs or walk into tight places. Geometric collision therefore is pretty dull, most of the foliage and different type of objects along the way function as an invisible continous wall which prevents the player from wandering off the path. This method really cripples the sensation of exploration. Not every game needs a totally open world, but these extremely limited corridors are the worst. If you do not wander around in one of these hostile areas then you can find towns where you can talk to people, take on quests, trade and the usual stuff. These settlements are filled with people but they are just props without too much complexity. You can talk to some of them but only the important characters have anything to say. The main plot of the game is a pretty generic tale of war against an undead army lead by the ice lords and an unknown force that will help humanity face the threat closing up on them. That force is a demon inside the player's character. Whether it is good or bad is uncertain. Unfortunately, there is not a single aspect of the story which holds a candle for more profound ones. I have to mention that dialogs are poorly written and the cutscenes/conversations are cringeworthy sometimes. Story is not a strong part of the experience. What I would add to this section as a positive is the mood and design of the world. It is dark fantasy with less shiny armors and weapons. Pretty grounded. I really like this style, much more than those extravagant artistic color pallettes. I would say that the equipment design is good, with a couple kinds of armors and weapons with distinctive look. Almost every piece of equipment can be altered, reinforced with materials giving it even more variability.Unfortunately, there is something which is beyond the capabilities of the developer. Combat is simply a mess. It has the usual functions like light and heavy attack, parry, some kind of dodge and even a guard break kick. You can also switch between two styles one being faster while the other being stronger. Spells are also there. You can throw fireballs, defend yourself with a fiery shield, launch a wave of fire or enforce your weapon with flames. The combat still feels clunky and hard to endure. Parry feels overpowered and lazy, while the dodge move is only available in the faster stance, where it is still more a sidestep than an actual roll. Enemies are like sponges, while you can only take a few hits literally before dying. In combat life regeneration is present. I still do not feel comfortable enough during these fights to have any kind of fun. It is hard to see what attack comes up based on animations and sometimes the camera and target lock are acting weird too. I usually hold up my defence and wait for my partner to finish up the job. Because you can have someone beside yourself. As you can expect these companions are dumb as hell. You can give them basic orders like be defensive, aggressive or just let them figure out what is the best for the situation. They die quickly but respawn out of combat with full health. You can talk to them and they react if something in a conversation hits their ears. There are a bunch of them for every purpose like close and ranged combat or healing. With them enemies could be exploited as you can defend yourself for a long time while your companion can shoot them afair for example. Of course this is not that simple. Sometimes a foe goes and attacks your pal or he/she simply walks into the battle. With all that said I still hate this system. I tried so many games with so many types of combat but Spiders' is really one of the worst. It is always the same, never really improving. Not neccessary hard in a classic sense, just hard to control. For me raising the difficulty only helped. What is not helping is the fast enemy respawn. You simply cannot clear an area before some of them respawn. And believe me these areas are really not that big. The day/night cycle is also fast, maybe the respawns are tied to that. As the combat itself is boring and unintuitive these grindy battles are just a waste of time. Most of the time you are better off dashing through if you do not want to get a few extra experience points. I think that the leveling system is actually good. There are no basic stats like strength or dexterity but the player character has three development trees for each of the areas used in combat. These being slower and faster stance, and pyromancy. You can decide what you want to strengthen. There is enough opportunity to max out at least one of these trees. In addition there are pearks which can get you more health, item drop chance, extra weight limit, cheaper traps, etc. You get separate points for these while you still have to accomplish certain goals like opening 10 chests. This system is pretty basic but I never had too much problem with it in previous Spiders games. Last thing that I want to mention regarding gameplay is the dialog system. It is also basic but acceptable. Most of the time you have a menu with lore questions, a ""show your wares"" option for craftsmen and the occassional quest-related stuff. I mostly have problems with the writing not with the way conversations work. I did not talk about quests, but there is not much to say really, other than it is a simplified design. There are main and sidequests. Gather or kill stuff, speak to people, run back and forth.The music in the game is decent. It might have a few tracks that I would listen to outside of the game, but mostly they are there to enforce the atmosphere, nothing more. Sounds of the environment and effects are also pretty standard, they are there but nothing extraordinary. Voiceovers are varied. There are a few characters whose lines are well acted, their tone is just right, and of course there are those random people around the world who are really terribly voiced. As I mentioned the lines written are pretty stupid at times but I concentrate only on the quality of the voice acting here.Content-wise Bound by Flame is a somewhat shorter experience with pretty linear areas to explore. The number of available equipment while being decent with all the variations possible by modifications still not going to amaze everyone. I would not necessary think that either the story/world or the gameplay would worth a replay. In my opinion it is already good enough if you endured one playthrough. There is not enough new stuff for a restart.Overall, Spiders once again made a generic game with a generic story in a generic (fantasy) world with really unbearable combat. If you liked Mars: War Logs for example then you might going to have a good time. Personally, I hated the same things about that game. In the end I still feel that Mars had better combat (and maybe story and world design too). You can argue that we should respect and support smaller studios but I think that there is no place for such biased opinions when comparing games to each other. You cannot give a higher score to a game if it is worse no matter how much it costs or how little its budget was.MY OPINION: 6.5/10 (AVERAGE)Graphics: 7/10World Design: 6/10Gameplay: 6/10Sound: 7/10Replay Value: 6/10			"

Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam groupFew words about the gameQuite an enjoyable RPG game with nicely done mix of combat styles (warrior or ranger) with magic. Even though I didn't finished the game yet, it's fairly entertaining experience that I easily got involved into. Something that really surpriced me is that the game requires players choices to create their own moral path and it's done really impressively in here. Quite alot of enemy types and fine diversity of surroundings will keep this game attractive enough and when you will add its crafting system and skill tree, it's getting formed into a pleasant adventure game.Advantages - Splendid design of maps, enemies, weapons and armors - Skills tree is complex enough to create your own, unique style of gameplay - Story is interesting and nicely told - Outstanding music - Graphics are pretty good, not amazing, could be much better, but still good - You get to choose between being the good one or sacrificing your own soul to demon for sake of being ""better""Disadvantages - Fighting mechanics are as refined as you would expect it to be - Animations are not as good as they should be - As much as they took care of music, voicing in-game is simply poor - Enemies are literal punch bags that take bits of damage what makes it a bit annoying after a whileIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!

												Before considering thinking of this game as a full AAA title remember that it is a small developing team and it is only 2/3 the price of a new release. With that in mind, here is my review:Bound By Flame is not a great game. It is, however, a good one. It has an interesting story and combat that is for the most part fun and engaging, that is, if you use the Rogue fighting style as opposed to the warrior. There is a ton of cusomization options once you begin playing, but actual character creation is very limited. The game is usually very pretty and has a great lighting engine, but faces and lip syncing during cutscenes are aweful. When the you are actually playing the game, it looks fine, and sometimes even beautiful. As a full priced game this would not be worth the purchase, but at $40 (and any lower, if you are reading this at a later date) this is worth the purchase for a fun few hours(from 10-20), and can definitely be the game to tide you over until the next Dragon Age or Witcher title.

												This game might not be what ive expected, it has interesting features. I rushed main quest with a few importnt sidequests and at the end of my 11h hours of play, I have determined that this game cost unfortunately too much for what it is worth.Graphics are okay (let's not talk about lip sync) but a bit to much year 2000 according to the new RPGs who got out recently. The game is very generic, not much of an open world but the story still makes it enjoyable (Although we end up beating only 1 of the 7 Ice Lords) In my opinion, the ""Choice of good or evil"" is kinda false because first you cannot beat the game without those OverPowered fireballs critics on the bosses at melee range, and also with the few skill points we get to fill the trees, the ""ranger"" part is a bit left on the side since the stealth feature is  not so useful at all, nor the crossbow or even traps.i have beat this game with raw power and the demon's magic.Maybe 20 diff main weapons. Blunts and axes are not good enough compared to the swords wich makes em useless. I have seen 6 sort of crossbows and 7 sorts of daggers. Maybe 5 or 6 Sets of armor, wich doesn't have much difference between them. Returning to the main weaapon section, not enough emphasis on those ""unique weapons"" (Mjollnir, dragon's eye or something) and these ""unique"" ones weren't good enough to match my common sword found in a merchant.Teh craft feature is interesting but not enough exploited since i was able to sell some tainted items found randmly for 10k and i bought 200 of each potion, wich made the crafting completely useless at the half of the game since the crossbow and traps gives less DPS and less Interrupting than my Warrior Stance skills.Musics and Audios were pretty dam cool, the music in the BlackFrost mansion is quite cool with the chorus tone vocals.And at last, every bosses should have been as hard/long as the  last one. Gives more challenge. The bosses/mini bosses were completely and purely parry, critic, fireball. no features, no doppelganging, no mirror images, no doubles. And the 4 Concubines were a joke to handle.I feel like this game is n indie game that I would have bought for 20 bucks on featured steam sales, but i still enjoyed the game. good elements. good fights. tactical moving.And GOD. Please add some rolls in fight. In every bloody cinematics our protagonist rolls all over to avoid hitss and yet in fight i wasnt able to make a roll dodge or anything. not even when blocking/parrying. makes us hard to fight against those cold woman with 2 swords and 4 arms !This game wouldn't suffer of a faster paced action fighting though, i felt kinda slow at the very start !

												I want to like this game. I really do. I keep it installed, coming back to it when I have a couple hours to kill trying to beat that last part I got stuck on. And that's the problem: playing this game is an exercise in willpower. I'm not playing it because I'm having fun. I'm doing it because I just want to get through it.Bound By Flame isn't a terrible game. It's okay. Average. Good enough. If Dark Souls is throwing yourself at a wall and loving the masochistic rush of repeated failure because the final pay-off is just that awesome, this game is kind of like that. Except the pay-off is another ten minutes of 2003 stick-figure animation cutscenes with passable dialogue for a story that really feels like it should be better. Not to mention the slow-moving combat. You'll die numerous times just trying to figure out the timing for a parry, so you'll just start blocking and hitting when the enemies open up. Except there will be four of them and they all attack at a different times leaving you locked forever in the block. And don't expect your allies to help you. They have the durability of a wet tissue and similar attack power. I love the ideas and characters this story puts forth. Ice Lords slowly destroying the world with the Undead? Awesome! Mercenary that can seamlessly switch between two classes and shoot fireballs? Sweet! Demon-possession that slowly turns you more and more into the corporeal embodiment of a fire spirit? Sign me up! Unfortunately though, everything falls flat and leaves a hollow feeling once you actually see it. So in the end, the game is a passable RPG. That's it. If it's on sale and you got a bit of money to spend, give it a shot. Otherwise, pass on to another one.			"

												Well, despite the game being a lot of fun, the ending of Bound by Flame was kind of a let down. Just a couple sentences after the boss and a forced choice. No gameplay after the story(wasn't expecting it); no NG+(the game is short enough that it's not a huge issue). It could have been a much longer experience with a much larger game world; the backstory was there. Still, way better and more fun that I was expecting it to be.Having played through the game more than once now, I'm going to review further. The original review is above, the extra is below. The game has a few weird flaws that make the game harder than it probably should be, or maybe it has a broken stance that makes the game much easier due to shortsightedness. The warrior stance relies almost entirely on parrying to avoid damage, which is a block executed in a pretty tight timeframe that leads to a counter. There are several moves that are not blockable in the game, that can easily be dodged, even without the specific timing, by the other stance. Now, I don't know if they forgot to make block better in the warrior stance, or they overlooked how good dodging is by comparison, but the game is much, much easier when you play through wielding daggers in the stealth stance than it is playing through with heavy weapons in the warrior stance. That was painfully clear when I did a heavy weapon only run on Captain difficulty. Another thing is that the story doesn't really make it feel like my choices mattered outside of a different line of dialogue here and there. Almost all of the game was the same no matter what I chose to do. The one that sticks out the most is at the end of act II when you have to choose whether to ambush a specific deadwalker or go save the troops who are about to be ambushed themselves. No matter which choice you make here, you fight the deadwalker. the choice only changes which companion you fight it with, and alters an encounter later in the game. I was expecting, with so many choices, for there to be more divergence in the story depending on them. Having seen all of the endings, only one of them felt even remotely satisfying. the other endings leave much to be desired and bring about no closure at all. In spite of these flaws, I obviously spent a great deal of time with the game, and I felt driven to get all of the achievements(working on the last two now). I bought this game on a whim and I am satisfied with the purchase. I do still wish the story was a little more fleshed out, though. A sequel set in a more open would would be welcome.			"

												Bound by Flame is a 3rd Person Action RPG by Spiders Studios. You play as a mercenary who must save his land from a walking dead army through the use of powers granted to you by a demon.Bound by Flame is very rough around the edges, full of ""jank"" as some lovingly, or not so lovingly, describe. It is evident in myriad ways, from the dialog, to animation, to overall plot of the story. This is not some extremely polished AAA title, but it is not without its charm. Ultimately it had enough of that charm to keep me playing until I completed the story.The gameplay is similar to Legend of Zelda, or a very paired down God of War. There are no combos, kill streaks, or anything of that sort. You can parry, block and dodge attacks; choose from 3 main strong style weapons (axe, hammer, sword); try stealth mode with daggers; or use a small selection of fire-based spells to attack your enemies. Combat can go a little slow at times, with some enemies having a lot of health, and I found myself at times running around in circles so I could slowly heal or chug some health potions. Your companions are mostly useless, but the one that casts healing spells can come in handy at times. Overall, I wouldn't call the combat the game's strongest point, since it can get very repetitive. There is not much variety in types of attacks, and you will be battling the same types of enemies over and over and over.The graphics in Bound by Flame are impressive for a smaller studio. There are glitches here and there with the occasional floating piece of armor, but overall I liked the way the world looked. Some of the character faces are a little bland, but I liked the look of most of the enemies.The dialog and voice work was probably my favorite part of the game. There is a very peculiar sense of humor present in this game, with the hero never beyond dropping a witty one line when the option presents itself. I did find the frequent use of curse words to be quite funny, because who wouldn't want to drop an F bomb at an Ice Lord trying to take over your realm.The story is not something that hasn't been seen before. You can see bits and pieces of other works present in the plot, but overall it works. I was a little surprised when the game ended, because it seemed like everything was just wrapped up a little too quickly and there were still many threats that were discussed but never addressed. Also, the endings didn't really do enough to tell you what happened. Some major characters were just never mentioned at all. One ending just cuts to the credits without really giving you any idea of what was going to happen. That was disappointing.Overall, Bound by Flame is a game I can recommend, but just barely. I believe its short length works in its favor, because although there still seemed like there was much to do in Vertiel, there wasn't enough variety in combat and enemy types to keep me wanting to do it much longer. I enjoyed the ride for what it was, a campy 10-15 hour fantasy RPG.Grade: B-			"

												Okay, there are quite a few posts in discussions about the combat system saying it's too hard and companions are useless. I urge you to please not be put off by these. Some are correct some things they say such as the companion having trouble following you or the action and may remain stuck or wandering. If your companion has suddenly vanished while exploring, back track until you find him/her then just walk around at different angles while moving away from them until they resume to follow, failing that, find a door or a gap to go through and somehow they get teleported to beyond that crossing point (you may need to wander off then return to the door/gap to see your companion). This mainly happened in the swamp and around the final area called Black Frosts Domain. Tip for better companion fighting: They are a bit weak in the health department so you being the hero need to aggro and eliminate the stronger more deadlier enemies first, while your doing this your companion may thank you with a nice ice blast or if your lucky some mind control. If they do die and you find yourself a bit deep, run away and let them get back on their feet - you may be quick enough to revive your companion before the enemy you are fighting gets their health back. Now in terms of general combat, yes it is hard but you need to practice and I mean practice. Some fights you will not win unless you can use the Q key to dodge while in Assassin stance or use SPACE while in Warrior stance to parry. Timing is essential with these and with good practice you may not even be hit. Once you understand and have achieved this sense of timing then things become very rewarding when you beat a tough fight. Focus carefully on the skill tree as well, don't scramble your points. Try and focus on your preferred fighting style while utilising the best pyro branches for that style of choice. Do not forget about your other stance how ever, do feel free to try and balance the weaker stance out by going for what is needed, remember your main stance is your offensive stance. Hope this helped in some way in regards to the combat up roar, the game really is a nice one to play and has great choices for you to develop the plot/story. Graphics are not up there in the top of the list but some areas still look stunning and there are some errors with the subtitles like wrong words but after some time you don't pay attention to them. I rate this 8/10.			"

												So I just finished by first playthrough (female demon who rules both worlds) and I wanted to leave a review. First of all, I did not buy this game immediately due to the generally negative reviews, which is a shame because I really enjoyed the game once I started playing. I eventually bought it in the Spider RPG bundle sale on Steam, which also included Mars: Wars Logs. There are quite some similarities between the 2 games, most noticeably the crafting system and the art style. The gameplay is harsh, even on easy mode (recruit) I died a lot, but it is not as bad as with Dark Souls. I saved regularly and I could win most battles with my current skills, I just had to change my tactics a bit. Most people found the difficulity to be too hard, but I actually liked the challenge. The game was not unfair, it is quite basic that when you rush blindly at your enemies, there's a high chance you end up dying. And when a character promts you to fight him, you should save before attacking to keep your progress. The characters were enjoyable enough although they did not stand out too much from many of the other RPG's  I've played. Each of them followed an archetype and they did so succesfully, but it left little room for character development. My favorite is Edwen. She has ulterior motives for joinging you but at least she's not pretending to be someone that she's not (I'm looking at you Rhelmar, stop being a pain and please stop whining for once). My favorite part was the ability to transform into a demon. It was a very subtle change, rather than 'press A to turn into a demon', the change happened in diffrent stages  and other characters would comment on your charming physique. Not everything was without flaws though. There were some inconsistencies with the subtitles and voice-overs that were quite annoying. Calling me or my demon a 'he' while I played as a female, referring to me as 'Vulcan' while a picked a custom name. At one point the party reacted as if I killed somone, who was in fact very much alive. Also the enemies in the last arc were a pain to get through. Eventhough I was able to beat them, it took forever to get to the final battle. The respawning prtals didn't really help either.So my final verdict would be 7.5/10. I think the game is judged rather harshly and while it has a few flaws it is not a bad game. Besides you can play as a demon, isn't that awesome?			"

												Early impressionsIt's a mix mash of the games we love (Dragon age, dark souls, witcher eg.) It doesn't bring anything new to the table but spiders did a modest job of combining the different elements. The story’s decent and interesting enough. While not AAA material, it’s a step in the right direction for Spiders. If you are like me, trudging through rpg wasteland and awaiting big name releases, BBF should keep you entertained. Detailed impressions (Long read)Gender picking and customisation You can pick male or female, that's always nice. However, don't expect detailed customisation. Customisation is very limited and I mean limited. You can only choose from 5 preset faces and hairstyle for each sex.   Graphics Graphics are dated even on highest settings but passable. Cutscenes are a little jerky too and feel as though multiple scenes were just strung together to create the final one. But remember it’s not a AAA game. CombatCombat is a toned downed hybrid of Witcher, dark souls and Kingdoms of amalur. You run around, block hits before proceeding to hack away at your enemies. Blocking or dodging precisely when the enemies blade hits yours grants you an automatic counterattack. Combat is a little chunky at times and you will likely end up spamming the same attacks to finish off your prey. Dodge, attack and repeat. Similar to war logs, the radical wheel returns. Bringing up the wheel allows you to employ abilites and traps (Think witcher). Companions, Voice acting and conversations. THANK GOD for the much better voice acting. It is still sub-par but better than the ones they employed for Mars war logs. Companions are Bioware style. A total of 5 can be picked up. Conversations with your party are also Bioware style. Talk to them, discover more about them, agree or anger them. Nothing groundbreaking but they did a decent job. Much like all standard PRGs, you can learn more about the world if you bother to talk to NPCs.  Crafting and the world Crafting is where the game really shines. You can craft anything and everything. Don't like the handle of your sword? Craft one. Hate your spaulders or shin guards? Craft one. (Yes, armour is not a one piece suit). Every single armour and weapon customisation was modelled so enjoy the variety. The world is hub based much like Dragon age Origins but freely explorable within those boundaries. Materials for crafting are littered throughout the map, coated with a shiny gloss so give your eyes peeled.EDIT: After spending a considerable amount of time in the game, i think it's time to talk about the choices you can make.  The game does not shepard you into obvious colour coded choices (Mass effect) and decisions are significant, much like the original dragon age and mass effect. Every so often in the game, the demon within you surfaces and allows you to make a choice. Suppressing it or allow the demon to consume you are significant plot choices and WILL affect your story and companions. As a demonic being, you can undertake some absolutely appalling decisions and you will have to live with the repercussions.			"

												Not perfect by any means but a very decent and very interesting RPG from Spiders Studio. Middle Market games are almost exstint these days and Focus Home Interactive are one of the few (if not the only ones) that are giving small devs with small budgets a chance to shine. A VERY rare sight to be seen in the Modern Gaming Industry.A mix of Dragon Age and Fable, your choices influence yourself, your party as well as the rest of the world. Bound by Flame perhaps has the deepest weapon and armory customization I've seen in a long time and it is most welcome. Every weapon and piece of armor is unique and can be tailored to your needs as well as style. Combat can be a little clunky at times but Bound by Flame relies more on tactics rather than straight hack n Slash. Defintely recommeded if on sale.			"

												So far... This game has made me excited, angry, and sad. I've had to make difficult decisions that make me want to tear my heart out of my chest and I actually have to stop playing the game for a little while to take a moment to think about what just happened. The game is fairly challenging and has multitudes of options that you can fail or succeed. I absolutely love the game for it's story, armor customization, choices, and combat system. The game makes you work to progress and really think about your actions... So far, I've been on the verge of tears and any game that can make me do that, is a game I will gladly suggest to anyone.

												I remember not liking this game when I first played a few years ago, but having re-played it recently, it's actually a pretty good Action-RPG.Pros:■ Excellent soundtrack.■ Good graphics and environment design.■ Top-notch auto-save/checkpoint system; 	autosaves occur seemlessly and prevent you from losing anything longer than 3 or so minutes of progress.■ Easy-going crafting system;	you can augment your armor and weapons and can craft crossbow bolts and explosive traps.	If you take the Lucky and Snooper feats early in the game, you'll have plenty of resources for boss fights.■ Fun combat (depending on diffculty setting and playstyle);	On lower difficulties, it's pretty fun to cause havoc using the Pyromancer and Warrior skill trees.	On higher difficulties, the Ranger (stealth+daggers) skill tree is favored, and taking damage is very bad idea.■ Decent story;	the game isn't very long and the secondary characters aren't all that interesting, but the internal conflict between the main character and the flame demon is very entertaining, and the imagery and music for the final battle is great.Cons:■ On higher difficulties, enemies are damage sponges with insane damage outputs. (Thus, stealth, traps, and the crossbow are favored on higher diffculties.)■ Some of the other reviews on Steam complain about the controls; (I played it with a gamepad and never felt a problem).■ Lackluster side characters. (This definately isn't a BioWare game.)■ The voice-acting and writing can feel weak time to time. UPDATE: it's particulary bad for a female player character.At $30, I'd say the game is decently priced, but for sure snap it up if it drops to $25 or lower.			"

												Bound by flame is a game riddled with errors that make it difficult to play, let alone take it seriously.I would start with the ""voice acting"" which is laughable at first, but ruins the experience of a decent game. Then we talk about the fighting mechanics, which was one of the few good things about this game as it doesn't make fighting too easy nor too difficult. But then the surreal expectations will be thrust upon you as you have to almost single handedly clear out waves of enemies that take a quarter of your HP in one hit. As if that isn't bad enough? now there are random enemies that are randomly scattered and shoot at you from whichever crevice they hide in or throw you off as you're trying to doge attacks from a mob of 5 enemies that will kill you if you screw up once.I regret letting my friend talk me into this game. Please don't waste your money.			"

												This game is unfinished and lacks a lot of polishing. You can see all the basics but the lack is in the details. Also the end-boss is rediculously difficult compared to the rest of the game. The fights in general are quite lengthy because you don't really do much damage, even if scrape all the XP you can get and level-up. You pretty much fight the same types of enemies through the whole of the game apart from a few mini-bosses. The developers did Mars War Logs before this game and I quite liked that one. Not sure want went wrong here. Either they didn't have the ressources to do it properly or just didn't care. So all in all, a lot of potential but quite poorly implemented.			"

												Let me start by saying this game is mediocre in almost every regard. I bought this game after reading a review that called it a medival fantasy version of Mass Effect which is just an insult to the Mass Effect series. This game is nowhere near the standard of Mass Effect in any aspect of its gameplay or story.This games two biggest let downs are the wooden voice acting and the graphics that resemble a late PS2 or Xbox game. The voice acting is just terrible and does nothing for immersion and the worst part is, one of the worst voice actors in the game is that of the main character who just looks like an aging veteran warrior and sounds like a ridiculous american teenager.When it comes to combat this game is just about adequet but by no means great or even good. There is a noticeable delay after blocking or attacking that becomes quite annoying after a while and the camera either zooms out to far or zooms in so far that you can't even see whats going on mid combat. Having only played about 90 minutes I havnt seen a great deal of the story but what I did see was quite average. Nothing to write home about. It's obviously inspired by Game of Thrones in that its about a Northern Ice king with an army of dead soldiers marching south. Sadly though, the quality leaves a lot to be desired..All in all, this game is very average and not worth the rather large price tag. If you wan't to play this game i recommend waiting for a steam sale because its worth no more than $10,00 imo.All things considered, I give this game a 6/10 - Mediocre.			"

												If you are fan of Bioware games, where you live heroic story with moral choices and the game properly addresses you based on who you are (so no generic sex-less 'hero' approach), you will like this game. Sure, it is not absolute AAA title but it is enjoyable, with well written and spoken dialogues and decent cinematic cut scenes. You can play male or (yes! :-)) female demoness, either a warrior, rogue or a ""mage"", in this case my favourite - fire mage - and of course evil as these powers come from your demonic side. :-) My kind of tea. ;-) Combat is simple but quite fun and I appreciated simple crafting system which allows you the customization of your armor without the constant annoying micro-management and need to come to some crafting stations. You can 'recycle' and craft everything on the run, what is maybe not ""old school realism"" but I found it very convenient and it actually made me willing to bother with it - unlike ""oldschool systems"" which just ♥♥♥♥ me off. My only small complaint would be, that no matter what skill tree is your primary (in my case pyromancer mage), in ""heroic cut scenes"" the protagonist always uses sword for his or her killing blows. But all in all it is a good game, far better than the usual ""low budget trash"" and yet much cheaper than AAA titles. For people who like story-driven, moral-choices rpg with possibly (evil) female as your main character I can only recommend it, there are not many which are better.			"

												I didn't expect much from Bound By Flame, but, what I did expect, was not reached. The screenshots and other media for this game has been heavily photoshoped, like many other games out there, to lure people in with graphics that are not in the end product. Yes, I play this game on maxed settings and yes, I even went as far as to go into my control panel and enable every graphic enhancing application my graphics card(4GB GTX 770) could provide and still I got the graphical quality of a game made in 2009. Beyond that the minimal character creation options, terrible lipsyncing, mediocre voice acting and a rather boring combat style really shoved this game into the dirt for me. Personally speaking I feel like an idiot paying $40 for this game and would get my money but if I could, but, sadly I can't, so I will continue on in BBF and hopefully manage to suck it up long enough to get to the end. Who knows, maybe the story will redem the games more lack-luster properties.			"

												Criminally underappreciated and underrated. Meta and review scores are insulting - the game is way better than lots of modern AAA titles.Great: music, gameplay, story. Crafting system deserves a medal. Each weapon and armor has its own list of upgrades that actually look different. Your choices make difference and there are several endings. Combat is smooth and challenging, mostly skill based - you can't really grind and try again, you have to use different strategy or lower the difficulty which you can do at any time.Game is also not open-world. Its very linear and small, which is its best part - where other games make you run around and just lose time - this game just gives you concentrated fun. Good for gamers who value their time. 10-15 hours to complete.The game has its flaws but if you aren't picky you wouldn't even notice them: Voice acting gets better later on, deaths and strong enemies are to be expected and if you don't compare it to other games it wouldn't annoy you with similarities. Oh and play it with gamepad, its much smoother that way.Overall - highly recommended. On sale - must buy if you like challenging combat and enjoy learning from your deaths.			"

												Bound By Flame is... a mess. It's story, outside the initial premise is weak, the worldbuilding is weak, and the dialouge even weaker. Furthermore, the game is amazingly short, with only about 10 to 15 hours of play in it, and all of it is completly linear. And this is in an age when most in RPG's are at least 2 to 3 times that length.It's combat is unpolished and easily exploited against you, as many enemies, even the most basic, can kill you quite easily. This might have been a intentional choice, in order to make it apeal to the Dark Souls crowd, but the combat is difficult because all of two enemies (and occasionally a single boss character) can stun lock you until you die, or get bored and settle for 75% of your health bar. This might have worked if their was a decent block or dodge feature, but there really isn't, as the dodge function you are given only allows for jumps backwards, and you lose space to back up very quickly.All in all, while the games obvious budget constraints do give it some leeway, this is not a title I would recomend. The game, outside it's initial premise and it's visually interesting darkside curruption meter, is a bore. if you feel that you must try it, rent it for Xbox or PS4.			"

												With its so-bad-its-good dialog, semi-interesting plot and good rpg mechanics the game reminds me heavily of the original Witcher.Its let down though by its combat encounters - keeping the combat a challenge throughout the game is a great idea, but running in circles to heal while kiting a group of enemies is not fun.  Especially since the AI companions go down way to easily even when set to defend themselves.  When the AI does contribute the combat is actually a fun challenge, it just happens too infrequent. "

Like ordering the hamburger that looks like a culinary art-piece on the menu and then receiving an unsavory mess slapped between two buns, Bound by Flame unfortunately does not match up to what I hoped for when I saw the nifty trailers. Like the game’s own theme of inner duality between good and evil, it seems to be somewhat indecisive of whether it wants to be a good game or not.			"

Too short for a RPG and end was like a lot of boss fights which took a lot of time on Buffalo difficult lvl.What i really liked about this game it made me think about my choices and it was hard to make them. I dont remeber myself ever thinking so long about making a choice in a game.It surely has a vibe of Dark souls in its difficulty, true its easier because of saving.I wish good luck to developers they have the story telling aspect to a game but still needs improvment on other things.Raiting ""I allways knew it was going to be you Vulcan"" By Captain			"

												This game is certainly not as bad as people make it out to be. If you try to button-mash at this game you will die! You need to use stratagey and timing, both learning how your 3 skill-sets intertwine and your enemies moves and attack pattens.That said. the game is far from perfect and is in need of some SERIOUS late game balancing issues. There are 2 health upgrades in the entire game and once you've got them, that's it. I had them both before the first major boss in the game and was later running into that guy again as a regular enemy with friends. Your gear and health doesn't scale well enough for that kind of punishment. It doesn't help that most of the late game enemies have attacks that take off over half your health and are unblockable, and dONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THAT DAMN FROST CONDITION.There are 4 types of status effects in this game, 1 is pathetic; a ""dark"" effect that drains your mana for a few seconds, 2 are pretty much the same thing; two different types of poison and are well balanced. But then there's Frost, a condition that has lead to me being combo'd to death at least 15 times by now. Frost slows down every single one of your animations by a large amount while you're effected by it. This means your stagger animation (that is already a tad too long for weak hits IMO) is nearly TWICE AS LONG as before. Get hit, you're likely dead. Doesn't help that most of those unblockables I mentioned earlier cause Frost.I feel this game could have been so much better if it had just been beta tested more. The graphics aren't the best, but it's not about them at all (honestly, I couldn't care less about the graphics a game has, it's gameplay and story for me) and the voice acting is a bit subpar, but on the whole, it's not a bad game. Just be perpared to want to throw your controller out of the window towards the final areas of the game.			"

												You know, I always was between not purchasing or purchasing this game for the last year or so. While hearing people I trusted saying that the game was a fun ride, I still couldn't help, but be swayed away by the people slamming this game to the floor as if the game was a buggy, unfinished, abomination. So finally, I took the risk and got something in return.No build up to anything really, I just got something. Bound By Flame is a good game, a good game with at times a bad camera, unforgiving difficulty, voice acting that ranges from okay to absolutely atrocious, a somewhat cliched story, but still a good game. Yeah, that does sound like a laundry list that would make any game mediocre, but honestly, in some weird hipster way, it adds to the charm of the game and the gameplay is pretty neat too. Combat is not easy, the game really does require you to time your attacks and dodge accordingly. Set traps for enemies, healing yourself, using your NPC partners as punching bags where you can hide from your enemies; All play a crucial part whether you die in three hits or not. Fair warning, don't use the sword, you'll die quicker than you are supposed to. Focus all of your energy on both daggers and pyromancy, It'll do you some good. That's really about it, the combat is super solid, but also not the most amazing thing in the world. It makes you think a little bit though instead of completely going mental. Oh, last I forget, like some of the people mentioned in the reviews. The last boss is not easy. It really isn't. Its not completely insane, but it does test everything in your capacity. Pick it up, 40 bucks a little steep though, for 20 and less it's a steal.			"

There is nothing new here, but its done well. I can see the makers were aiming for the Witcher crowd with this title as it has all the halmarks of that game with about 1/8th of the polish that the witcher 3 has. Keep that in mind and @ 5$ on sale, this is a great title and a great time. I would pay 10 for this but not much more as it is lacking the polish and depth of a Grade A polished game.5/5 stars for a 5$ game.4/5 stars if this was a 10$ game.2/5 stars is this was a 30$ game.Would not pay 40+ for this.This is only my opinion though.Happy Gaming all!

												This is a good game if you go in with properly adjusted expectations.  In the age of Fallout, Witcher, Skyrim, etc., RPGs we often go into games labelled as RPGs expecting them to have more in common with their big brothers.  This is a very much linear RPG with choices that do make somewhat of a difference.  There are side quests and a basic crafting system for improving the swords you have.  I do have to warn you though that it is best played on easy (in my opinion).  Combat can be a bit clunky and enemies don't go down quickly.  I wouldn't call this a hack and slash RPG, more like a hack, slash, block, and counter RPG.  Player skill is important here and the simplest enemy can overtake you if you expect to go in swinging.In conclusion, at -80% off, I would indeed reccomend this game.  Gameplay is fun-ish, the story is engaging, and there are some interesting characters.			"

												The main character is an ♥♥♥, the combat is repetative as are the monsters you come across, and the environments are hideously colored (mostly shades of brown like the fecal matter this game is composed of). I would not recommend as Vulcan never increases in strength nor does he in likability. Also, curses are thrown in for flavor which instead only serves to make the poor writing even more painfully obvious. Another flaw with the dialogue is the character's venacular as it is not appropriate to the time that they are in. Waste of time and money.			"

However, with that I also personally dont find the work on the two handed weaponry but that could just be my personal preference.

I have not gotten far into the game but the story is interesting with plenty of Side quests at the first town (which is where I am at currently). It's not completely open world but has multiple areas that you can explore throughout the game. The crafting in the game is also well done allowing you to recycle weapons and armor from your inventory for a chance to salvage raw materials from the equipment to craft other items. This is my first game review and some people may be more critical about the game than I but in my opinion this is a great game that everyone that likes RPG style games should try.			"

												Is this a master piece? No. Still, it is a good game.  I found myself wanting to go back and play the game often enough. People argue that the story line is dull... I bet they never played dragon age series, so full of cliches yet one of the better CRPGs out there. Cliches kill a literary piece from becoming a masterpiece. In a CRPG it means, players get to satisfy their need for heroism.The combat was challenging at first but once you get the proper skill upgrades it becomes pretty easy up until the last boss. I think the developers wanted to send a message with that last boss, that it could have been much harder and they let us get off easy.Finished the game in 15 hours. Had fun along the way.

The combat is tough and engaging, the visuals are nice, monsters are inventive and cool-looking, and the storyline is standard, but bolstered by both the choice mechanic and some great dialogue.  One thing I'd like to give big props to Spider for is having the player choose between two plausible sides, no saintly-good vs maniacal-evil fake choices here.  Both sides make compelling arguements and there's no clear 'best' path.  Well done.			"

												Honestly, Bound By Flame has been an amazing game. Story is on point, always leaving you wanting more, visual quality is beautiful, they did a dark fantasy world well. One part that caught my eye quick was upgrading equipment. If you equip a breastplate it starts off as a breastplate only, but you can upgrade it to have shoulder guards, pouches and tassets. Not only do the upgrades increase the stats of the equipment, it actually changes the look of it. That I loved, not too many games include that small detail in when it comes to upgrading equipment. Something else that caught my eye, whenever you choose to release a little more of the demon within, it changes the features of the character slowly. Just helps show how releasing the demon within slowly consumes the humanity of the player.I can see how they got some ideas from The Witcher, which is just fine, another great game. Combat is smooth and fluid, easy to change from one stance to another quickly or stop part way through an attack to block instead or even jump back and cast spells. Not only is it enjoyable, it is a challenge also, normally most RPG style games just seem too easy. I would highly recommend this game to any RPG fan, I give it an easy 5 out of 5. My one and only complaint, I wish it was a little bit easier/quicker to aquire gold to spend at shops. Other than that I have no complaints.			"

												At first, the game actually got too annoying and I stopped playing it. But I recently came back and finished it, actually playing it from start to end two others time to get all achievements. A playthough is about 10-15 hours while getting 100% took me a total of 30 hours.The game is not that hard but even the easiest difficulty can be punishing. Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty much the same formula, can also get a bit repetitive but I personally liked it enough to play it three time. I was playing with a gamepad if it make a difference, not sure about the keyboard and mouse controls.The game is kind of short, it feels like the end could have been the midpoint instead, only three chapters and the last is shorter. It's enough to end the story but the ending don't tell much and the whole game bring some interesting lore that is never used.The music is great, most of the voice actors are pretty good and the characters are pretty diverse. The graphics are good, even though there is not that many different enemy types and areas. Don't expect the same quality as a big AAA arpg like Dark Souls or Dragon Age Inquisition but it's worth a try if you enjoy the genre and want something new.			"

Jon Snow possessed by Satan Vulcan fights the White Walkers DeadwalkersThat being said it's OK, but every mob has WAY TOO MUCH HP even at Hawk/Normal difficulty. I was tired of fighting common enemies for too long so I cranked it down to Recruit. Kind of forgettable characters minus Mathras - you can tell they were influenced by The Witcher, Game of Thrones, Fable, and Dragon Age but everyone is too cliché. I prefer the Game of Thrones RPG and Of Orcs and Men. This isn't so much a recommend as ""if you like the games and stories I mentioned a lot and want a short game to enjoy, give it a try if you get on sale"" kind of a review.Also the game is actually way shorter than my total play time. I just left it running in the background a lot to eat or clean or whatever.			"

												It's an awesome game. Much better than expected from the amount of negative reviews. No major complaints, either. Only gripes that come to mind are very minor ones. There's a few static NPC's, and the end fight can be a bit of a difficulty spike when not properly equipped.The story itself is pretty solid, and the characters are all good. Companions especially so, and each companion is useful in their own way. The combat is insanely fun, and the amount of choices in the game allow replayability. The combat itself is a reason to replay the game... it's very tactical and responsive based, and rewards the use of crafting for better gear and useful items (traps, potions, crossbow bolts). The three specializations in the game are great. The gameplay is well rounded, so the player can go all in or spread out among the specializations.  Sidenote: The soundtrack is absolutely amazing.For any RPG lover, or someone looking for challenging and rewarding tactical combat, Bound by Flame is definitely a good game to get.			"

												This is a great game. The dialogue between some of the characters is incredibly entertaining, and the live action combat combined with RPG upgrades results in a fun, yet skill-testing experience. Bound by Flame has quite a bit of replayability to explore: additional side-quests you skipped or failed in previous run throughs, different decisions during the storyline, upgrade different skills and builds, or spend time with different companions.I really enjoyed the crafting and upgrading system the game has because it reflects a simple, in-field experience. The decision by the game designer to minimize the needs of the crafting helps the game move along instead of getting bogged down by complex material requirements or blueprints. Allowing some items to be further customized helps to eliminate the ""trouser checking"" of some randomized item games, so I can get right back to playing. The balance is fantastic.I think I bought this as part of a bundle without much thought and starting playing it because I was looking for controller based games I could play while relaxing on my couch, so this caught me off guard. I wasn't expecting much and found a wickedly cool game I know I will come back to over and over.			"

												Disregard the hours on record; I had this game on an old account I lost, and it was one of the first I purchased again just to be sure it stayed in my library. It definitely does not deserve the mixed reviews. Yes, the combat can be challenging, but it's not Dark Souls. The combat is very smooth regardless of your playstyle, and all of the classes are feasible with the help of a companion (who comment about as much as pawns in Dragon's Dogma, but have as much personality as a Bioware companion). The dialogue can seem a tad modern for the medieval setting, to the point where I swear Matt Damon could play the P.C., but it's not bad enough to break your immersion. The good/evil paths give the story plenty of replayability and definitely make it worth the price regardless of whether or not it's on sale.			"

												2 hours into the game, and while it is not about to break the mould of RPG style sword swinging games, it is a more than adequate storyline thus far. The story, while I am sure it has taken elements from Novels'/Games that have come before, it conveys it in an entertaining way.The graphics are...surprisingly good; there is the occasional slip with lip-syncing, and the voice acting, while not Grade A quality, has a certain charm to it; much the way the Witcher Games do, though without such a prominent accent.I am not sure that the 2 way combat system works, and depending on your companion, you can just stand and block and let them take the damage, but as it is; I am playing on easiest and just enjoying the story. Fairly sure I got this through a bundle, £15, may be a bit steep given the competition, but definetly add this game to your wish list and keep an eye for it in the sales, a simple RPG that is easy to pick up and starts the main story off quickly.

												Great eurojank RPG, and I mean this in an affectionate way. It's clearly not an AAA game -the devs themselves call this a ""B"" game, but it has heart and it certainly uses its budget to the fullest.The graphics, while not technically cutting edge, are artistically beautiful.

The gameplaying is challenging and has some layers of complexity.Heartily recommended if you can get over the low production values.			"

												This game managed to quickly convince me that the outcome of a fight does not depend on lucky button bashing, or overpowered skills. Playing this game I was actually in control of how the character fights. It is an awesome mix of controls that allows players to actually play their way. Choose between fast paced melee, sluggish crushing melee, ranged attack and magical spells. You make actual choices in the game that changes who your immediate allies are. I was blown away by the game's ambitious take on a classic RPG genre. Whether your choices have long lasting end of game outcomes, I will not state for spoiler's sake.			"

												For my recommendation, it is under the presumption that game is on sale. At the time of my purchase it was $5.If you're looking for an incredible story to sink your teeth in for several hours, this may not be the game for you. Although it dabbles in something interesting concepts and provides player choices to alter the outcome of the game, the entire lore is a bit lackluster. The characters involved that attempt to drive the lore are also themselves bland and lacking true character development. Your potential followers hardly possess any characteristics that make them stand out from the rest of the npcs, and so it's hard to feel any real attachment to them. There are romance options in the game, but they feel rushed and simply misplaced in the context of the game.The game's saving grace is the combat. It is heavily reliant on parry/dodge/block mechanics, but that saves it from being a boring hack and slash game with no good story to fall on. Apart from most rpgs, if you take a hit you will take a lot of damage, but it's not much of a contestant to the likes of the soul series. The animations are fluid and feel as if the sword your swinging has some real weight to it.The talent trees have little to offer as there is not many skills to choose from. The crafting is simple, yet effective. Most weapons and armors have modifications which actually give different appearances along with different effects.As for the main attraction of the game, becoming demon or remaining human adds a fun factor to the game and gives it a bit of replayability.Overall, it is something to play when you have some time to kill and want a bit of a combat challenge.

												Bound by Flame is a action RPG settled in world devasted by the war, you belong to a group of mercenary escorting some schoolars called Red Scribes in attemp to find a solution to turn things down.The game is very well build around this, and pieces of the lore are scattered in portions of dialogs you can discover by talking and improving relations with your companions.It have strong characters like the captain, worried only about money and get paid in world about to brake without any place left to spend it, Ranvdal, a warrior that talks in third person (kind of hilarious), Edwen and Marthas are the most captivating characters, Edwen bc all the secrecy about her intentions and what is really true about her character and Marthas just have dark sense of humor.Great voice acting just give life to this story and characters, there are a few missing sounds but nothing really big, what really break all of this is the gameplay, Spider attemp in create a dificult game is commendable, even that there are some improvements over Mars War Logs, their combat mechanics lack important features that simply cant be desregarded to make everything else works.Their core combat is based on block & counter, wich work nicelly against 1 enemy, but you rarelly face 1, and since this powerfull possessed warrior cant dodge (it seem the Ranger is the only one that can do that and just backwards) you are left with messy combat system that you just want to get over with, specially if you made the mistake to start at higher dificulty, there are 1 boss battle that is hilarious, you have to kill the boss with 4 other enemys rushing at you (possessed friends you cant kill).Another thing is, for a warrior possessed by great flame demon, you are kind of weak in term of ability/combat, and not even with your skill tree full in any of the choices (Warrior/Ranger/Pyromancer) you actually feel strong, maybe bc the weapons lack weight/damage, abilitys lack damage/radious (but you look at your enemy abilitys or even some of your companions and you think, wow why cant i do that) and the daggers are just ackwards animations, its hilarious that almost at the end of the game, you still need a few minutes to kill a cannon fodder shielded undead bc of large pool of health in captain dificulty.Im even surprised by some comparations with Dark Souls, where?? Dark Souls is dificult game but you have all the tools at your disposal to master it, you have strong enemys, but so are your spells or weapons or whatever, everything works, you can go mage, archer or knight, doesnt really matter, on BBF on the other hand, in some fights you are forced to go ranger bc its the only one that can dodge backward if you plan your combat area well.BBF still a interesting game, but if you plan to have fun, go on lower dificulty and enjoy the story, this is one of those cases that Captain bragging rights doesnt really worth it tbh, and until Spider accept that for their core combat system to work well, need a dodge feature (since they insist in make enemys rush at you), its shame to see great potencial lost.

												Simply put, this game is a step in the right direction.If you want a game where you can feel godlike for simply swinging your sword and massacring all with your mighty gear, go to the kiddie pool and play Kingdoms of Amalur.If you want a game where you can feel godlike based on your skills and mastered timing but not so much your gear, then play this game.It has a simple yet effective combat system which can be intensely punishing to lazy people who need to have their hand held. Once mastered, combat is smooth in a way that feels similar to a slasher title such as ninja gaiden with an effective parry / dodge system. A friendly note that paying attention to your interrupt stat matters quite a bit.For a game created from the groundup by twenty people who designed their own engine, it is an ambitious project which attempts to push beyond some fairly deeply rooted genre trends. There is very little handholding within the game and some quests or even dialogue are easily missed depending on choices made during conversations. Rather than spelling out for a player what is a 'good' or 'bad' response, the fully voiced options allow you to choose based on short bits of what is actually being said.While players should be aware there is a fair bit of swearing within the game, it is in many ways refreshing to see a game buck the trend of 'sterile' dialogue for more colorful language.While there have been many complaints made about both the story and gameplay, I have yet to experience any kind of bug in either combat or general gameplay that has not been related to my own lack of ability. After beating the game on normal difficulty combat now feels so fluid and enjoyable that the idea of a higher difficulty is exciting rather than frustrating. Because the game engine is very responsive to your key inputs, button mashing is a very bad idea while timed blocks and dodges will make even the toughest fights a smooth and flashy victory.The overall story of the game is rich and focused, with a presentation much more in the flavor of a cinematic movie rather than a drawn out episodic tv series. Although I would have liked to have had more cinematics or involvment of other villains, the absence of these villans is explained well in context.All in all, the game is highly worth it for those prepared to test their abilities and their patience for learning each of the fights as they get progressively harder. For those interested in a shorter but very cinematic storyline, the easiest difficulty may offer less death.Many nods of the head can be found through the game in homage or appreciation of past RPGs such as Dragon Age and Darksiders to name a couple.On the downside, party AI leaves much to be desired although the allies prove to be very useful as distractions. There are a few small animation glitches in cutscenes which are easily overlooked as well. I am very glad I purchased this game to support a studio that is daring to craft an action RPG like this. The game pushes players out of the kiddie pool and out into the deep waters of hack n slash combat titles.			"

Beyond how short it is BBF is horribly shallow, the companions are cliche, the voice acting is horrible, the much toted combat system is equelly shallow and eventually just becomes >flame weapon, spam attack block repeat ad-infinitum. The plot is prehaps the worst offender it tells you nothing of the goals of the ""Ice Lords"" who are just about as corney as they come, one of them is even named ""chiller"" really...Chiller thats the best you could come up with, anyway you never learn why there conqouring the world with a undead army other then ""lol becauz theyr evul"".

												This is by no means a perfect game.  The combat definitely takes a while to get used to and can even be cheap at times, especially long range attacks from archers.  That said, it can be rewarding.  I would consider the combat a mix between the Witcher and Demon/Dark Souls series.  While in the Warrior stance, blocking and parrying is definitely your friend.  Using the Ranger stance will make the game easier as your dodge maneuver pretty much dodges anything in the game, and is pretty much required for the final boss which is a pain in the ♥♥♥.  The story is decent at best and some of the dialog is odd albiet hilarious at times.  The supporting cast is also interesting although in combat they really aren't much help except for being aggro so you can attack enemies.  In the end it was definitely an enjoyable game, especially as it wasn't a full priced game.  If you are a fan of games like The Witcher or Demon/Dark Souls I would say give this a shot, especially while on sale.			"

												I was very excited for this game. It was at the top of my wishlist for a long time, and I was so excited to get the email that it was finally on sale. I installed the game, hopeful and excited, and pressed begin. That was my first mistake. My second mistake was thinking that the game would get better. It didn't. From start to finish, this game was a major disappointment. There were many many things that bothered me about this game (such as the typos spread throughout the subtitles or the fact that you can name your character, yet you're still called Vulcan throughout the duration of the game), but some were just unbearable. The first was the dialogue. Doesn't seem like a big deal right? Wrong. Every conversation in this game, besides being boring, is tedious and way too long. I wasted more time in this game talking than actually playing. I literally pulled out my phone a few times and scrolled through my blog while waiting for conversations to finish. You just don't care. None of the characters are likeable, none of the stories are interesting, and you just find yourself trying to get through it as fast as you can so you can get said quest or event over with. The second thing that was frustrating was the combat. The concept was okay, but the execution wasn't. First of all, it takes a while to kill certain creatures. I found myself taking much too much time going after a particular monster, and then turning around and finding a bunch more. The warrior stance doesn't really do much damage. It's slow and each hit does minimal damage (and mind you I spent a lot of points in that category). The ranger position was okay, but to dodge you had to jump back, and it took longer than needed to reach the creature again for another hit, making the battle longer than it needed to be. Distance (whether with a crossbow or fire spells) didn't do enough damage to actually be worthwhile. I usually only used it when I needed to get a group of deadwalkers away from me. The biggest problem? Each creature required mastery of a specific stance to defeat it quickly and efficiently, and it just isn't possible to even out the stances and actually improve the skill. You have to pick one (maybe two) to focus on, and then when you fight someone who needs the other you don't have the skill needed. It's not that it's hard, it's just tedious, boring, and frustrating, especially when taking out a lot of creatures at once. Another thing that bothered me was the realism in the game. For example, in every boss battle, Vulcan has a cutscene where he/she is basically doomed, and then suddenly they gain the advantage and destroy the boss...and everytime I shook my head and thought, that would never happen. Not too big of a deal, but it happened often enough to be annoying.But probably the biggest flaw of this game is the character. First of all, Vulcan is a pretty much set in stone kind of character. The description gave the illusion of bringing in decisions made by the player or character growth, but there wasn't any. Vulcan is the same no matter how you play the game. And to be honest, I didn't really like him/her. Every time he/she opened his/her mouth I wanted to roll my eyes. I would've appreciated the option to control my character a bit more. Maybe have different personality options or give the ability to choose different paths. I couldn't even pick different dialogue options. There was no variety in the character, except in the concept of letting the demon take full control or fighting against it, which in the end didn't really do much except decide whether you slaughter your companions or not. Bottom line, this game isn't fun. I was looking forward to playing this game, but in the end, I couldn't even finish the very last act because I had no will to continue. The concepts were all good, and I'm very bummed that things weren't done the way they could've been. At least if the game was cheaper, I would feel better about my playthrough, but with the price I paid and the expectations I had, all I can say is this was a disaster.			"

												Bound by flame is an RPG created by Spiders Studio. The people who made the nicely borken Mars War Logs, of Orcs And Men, Faery... And others games I haven't played. Yet.First of all, I must precise i have nothing against imperfect games. On the contrary, I'm a big fan of Alpha Protocol, Binary Domain, and quite a few games of the same level of polishing. But Bound by Flame is not Nicely Broken. It's a pile of sharp glass shard waiting to tear to shred your lust for RPGs.The Dialogs, or why stupid can be fun.As much as they are tacky, the dialogs are nice, even if everyone involved seems more interested in dropping the best punchline than making sense. The writers were more interested in doing something fun than doing something coherent. It makes for a nice B movie vibe.The Story, or why convoluted doesn't mean deep.The story is what it is, which is not very interesting. Lords of evil destroying the world, or trying to conrolling it. Last remnants of humanity trying to survive and fighting them of. Everything is going to ♥♥♥♥, and your merry band of mercenary doesn't seem to give two ♥♥♥♥ about it.Elements are hidden only for the sake of mystery, and when you get all the piece of the puzzle, you realize some don't fit, and the box was half-empty to begin with.The Graphics, or why generic is a standard.It's kinda different while remaining the same. The kina that is realistic enough to be believable, but ""artsy"" enough that it won't ever seem really ugly. They play it safe, and they are right to do so. Bonus point for the ridiculous outfit of a certain female character.The combat, or why, god why ?You have a crossbow, a longsword, dual daggers and some fire magic. The melee combat is what you will use most. You have a normal attack, a less normal attack (boot to the face with le longword, combo with the daggers).And it sucks because :You can only dodge to the rear, and only while using the dagger. A perfectly timed dodge will trigger a counter attack (and you don't have the choice to NOT counter attack in this case)You can parry, but only will th longsword will let you counter attack.All magic takes time to cas, and you can easily be interrupted.And the character is rigid, and takes age to get back on his feet while knocked down.AND the fighting is grindy, extremely so, especially with bosses. And that's only in easy mode.One could make the argument that the game can be played for the story, whick while not being that good, is still fun to follow. But the combat is the main (and only) way to progress. And it's bad, painfully so. It's even worst than Mars War Logs. Clunky, Grindy, and even with what your character is supposed to be, you NEVER feel powerful.Avoid this game, those who compare it to Dark Souls are out their mind, it doesn't hold a candle to the From Software's game.

												*Edited* After going through the game I'd like to give a informed review.Pros:-Incredible dialogue, storyline (for the most part). The concept of having to make moral/ethical choices, especially revolving a demon that has possesed you was very unique to gaming. I enjoyed it very much.-In depth characters. I loved Mathras.-The gameplay was generally fun. It wasn't just a hack and slash, and reminded me of an easy version of dark souls II. You had to be quick and learn attack patterns to get through.-The graphics are beautiful. Everything ran perfectly smoothy, despite my laptop graphics card being three years old.-The crafting mechanism and skill trees were straightforward and easy to understand/work.Cons:-I know it's been said before, but the swearing really took away from the game for me. Some points reminded me of high school, where some kids thought it was cool if they could string along half a dozen swear words in one sentence. If it was used for emphasis, I can see its value. But not the way this game used it.-Gameplay mechanics were pretty ""unrefined"". There was still a lot of work to be done. For instance, there were many times where I would beat the enemies in an area, leave, and come back only to have them respond. But sometimes this didn't happen. Once, I completed a quest to save Sybil. I defeated the enemies in the area. There was the cutscene of bringing her back to health, and when it was over the enemies had respawned. This is also true with chests. There were several times where I looted the same chest 3-4 times!-Another gameplay mechanic, although I unlike the last point I think it was intentional. The companion feature was pretty messed up sometimes. If your companion died, all you needed to do was leave the area and they'd rise up at full health and appear beside you. It was a nice trick, but it seemed kinda cheap. And there were a few areas where the dialogue got rigged to where I was given the option to take two companions for a quest, but when I chose both, the first one vanished for good. Small bugs like that really gave the game an unpolished feel.-The lip syncing is pretty bad. But you'll get used to it after a while.-You can ""choose"" your name, but sometimes it will appear in the text and sometimes it'll appear as the default ""Vulcan"".-The game also seemed abnormally short, in some respects. Maybe if there was more variety, or if it was a little more ""open world"".-And I guess this wasn't such a big deal, but the loot/shop/gold was VERY unbalanced. At the start it was nearly impossible to find enough gold, buy proper equipment, or craft anything good. I remember sometimes before a difficult fight, I would go to the store and all I could afford was one single health potion. I had to do everything in my power to make it count, to make it last. Then, suddenly, you find yourself with 200+ of every resource, and can always afford the best equipment, craft the best upgrades, and STILL afford to buy 50+ health potions, making you practically invincible. Some rebalancing should probably take place.Overall, my verdict is that the game, while beautifully designed, is a job half done. If they spent 3 more months fine-tuning the system, working out the bugs, fixing the obvious and simple (might I add) glitches, this game would've been an 11/10 game. But for $40, when it's clearly obvious it was rushed to meet a deadline, rather than perfected into the work of art it could've been... $20 would've been worth it. But it is simply not a $40 game.

												I'm going to keep this short and simple (Ignore my time played, I spent lots of time in offline mode):This game is average but it has its merits.The games visuals are fairly good with varying texture quality but a nice vibe to the environments, mainly due to lighting.The story is actually quite intriguing, having to let an entitiy you don't trust slowly take over your body in hopes to save the world is kind of great (sometimes the story falls a bit short but the overall concept is nice), however the voice acting is laughable (don't even get me started on the lip syncing).The combat is unsatisfying and can sometimes get tedious but it still brings a bit of enjoyment. A big part of why the combat feels bland/boring is the lack of stagger/reactions from your enemies when being hit by your attacks. Whilst fighting, a huge lash of your blade to the chest won't even budge your enemy whatsoever which makes your hits feel weak and meaningless (and yes, I'm aware that there is a stat called ""Interrupt"" that adds a chance of interrupting enemy animations to your attacks but that's not what I mean. Even without having a specific stats your attacks should give visual feedback). I mean, you can walk up to a naked archer and whack at him with a giant two-handed axe and the archer won't even notice, he'll just keep firing 1000000 damage arrows directly at your face.The combat is difficult but not in a Dark Souls II way, it's mainly difficult because of how cheap your enemies are. You can't easily interrupt them and you often get swarmed with archers shooting a million projectiles at you whilst you try and fight off guys with annoying shields and other fast-attacking skeletons. I suggest playing in the ranger stance as the ""Dodge"" ability it provides actually allows you to win fights. Oh, and companions are terrible.After putting more time into this game I am unfortunately going to have to change my rating to a ""No"". This game is not worth 40 euros, heck it's not even worth 20 since it's basically unplayable. An ARPG with a terribly flawed combat system is basically rendered meaningless, since combat is all it had going for it in the first place.			"

												I thought this was a solid game before the worldheart boss fight. I can tolerate the not-so-well-written dialogues, but when the gameplay breaks down, there isn't much else left in this game to recommend. I don't know who designed the fight, but it felt like a forced SL1  boss battle. I guess some dev just thought ""lets put an unnecessarily hard boss here because we can"". So I'm leaving a thumbs down here because I can. I am not sure if the fight is optional, but it's awful, and this is from a Dark Souls fan. For anyone who is trying to play the game: remember to craft 200+ crossbow bolts before this fight.			"

												I kind of liked the game until I accepted to duel the Knight Randval while - unfortunately - didn't have a suitable save point before the duel. Being to low in level to beat him I got stuck dying again and again.Long story made short: The game should not stear the player into a cul-de-sac like that and destroy all achievements made thus far.It's ok to have some dangerous or difficult spot in the game that could be avoided and taken care of later. But the fun stops if have to try to defeat a totally superior opponent dozens of times with no way to improve while doing this.It's a pity. The story is nice and interesting.			"

												This game is incomplete. That is really all.You want to like this game, but you can't.The gameplay is oversimplistic, despite what the trailers will show the only thing you need is to be able to use your block/evade button at the right time and you will never really have to worry about being hurt save for AoEs.Crafting is always more than a step behind. It's simple -- get what you need and make it from a menu. Is it what you need, though? Not really. For example crafting traps? Can't say it's too useful. Sure, make yourself a minefield and lure things over to it. Done.But the biggest axe to grind is the story. When you say that a story has a beginning, a middle and an end? That summarizes the entirety of this game. Of course, trying to be fair here, the premise SOUNDS interesting and certainly has its attraction in that idea. Big undead army that's more or less unstoppable? Sure. Only thing that can stop them is a hero with demonic powers? Okay, I'll pay that. Your choices are always binary, though -- that is, one or the other. Do you take the option which gives the demon within a little more room or do you take the option which retains your humanity. And that's fine.... really, I mean it. But this is the part that makes it outright stupid-- your character's relationship with the demon? Almost non-existent.But the biggest part that you learn to hate about this game is that the story itself is just.... incomplete. Incomplete and poorly presented. That guy you saved? He died anyway. How do you find out? Because a text entry said so and one of your companions brings it up briefly. The undead army you're fighting is a big threat? If you say so! Why can't you belive they're actually a bad thing? Well, there's a lack of urgency. In games you need that feeling of urgency -- you need a choice to be difficult to make to make that decision have weight. You won't have that here because there's no real urge that pits things as being impossible for your protagonists to even do. It has so many plotholes most of which make absolutely no sense and lack crucial context. The demon within lacks a strong personality.Overrall, this game gets a big 'NO'. Why? It's incomplete. It's not a game that would be too bad had it cost less than $10 and even then, that would be overselling it. But for $40 you'd expect at least a complete story. I personally am not a person that likes to be too damning when it comes to games but look -- I'll make an exception here because I want the general public to understand that this game is not worth its price tag.

												It was a decent RPG game. Didnt seem like a lot of choice in the story depending on which path you took. For example, letting the demon take over a little bit in the beginning of the game, might cause some things later in the game to be a lot of no choice decisions. (demon will pick your choices for you or it felt that way).   The gameplay is ok, but it feels like your using a wooden sword on everything and all the other enemies, even just the basic minion little creeps, hit hard. Its like they tried so hard to make this game hard, that its just stupidly difficult, you'll find yourself dieing a lot at certain boss battles. (especially as a warrior, who's blocking and stun attacks are somewhat disappointing when you have stuff that cant be blocked or stunned). Crossbows felt so useless as well, i truly feel that the combat gameplay is the biggest con to this game.			"

												Is this a good game? Well, it has some good points: in terms of skill-lvl and feats I think it has a good approach. You lvl skills simply by lvling and getting skill-points, but for feats you need to do something extra (craft, for example). They are pretty easy to get, though: some extra challenge would have been great. Fighting has some potential, but.. It does not seem to have any actual combos and so in the end it becomes quite repetetive. Crafting is... Well, not sure if you can call it that: it's simply upgrading of stuff, which requires specific resources. Graphically it's not bad, but I've seen wayt better, especially in terms of lights and shadows: this one is very bright in some areas. In terms of sound: there are some good music tracks, but voice acting... Let's be honest, it's awful. Actors do not seem to have any passion and for games like this you need it, sot hat players will believe in the story, realte to it. And the story itself... Well, it reminds me of Demon's Forge in someway, but I liked Demon's Forge way more, even though it had its flaws as ewll: it had interesting fighting system, shooting system, humor in the dialouges, good voice acting. Inf act at first I though, that Bound By Flame will be similar, but only some points of the story are (also it's ""open-worldish""). Overall, I am amrking this as not recommended, and I give it... 6/10 I guess.			"

												The combat is not fun, not to make the dark souls comparison, but it is almost impossible to dodge your way out of incoming attacks. The tollorances for parying or dodging are just too slim to ever feel like you have mastered or even gotten a hang of the combat system. Combat becomes something you dread instead of something to look forward to.Other than that, the story and graphics are fairly nice, and the quests are fun enough (think the witcher 1), but the games combat system stops you from getting to the enjoyable parts.

												As of this review, I've put roughly 6 hours into Bound By Flame.Base Score: 6/10Skip to the end if you want a quick summary.Bound By Flame is a good game, but I personally think that it had the potential to be great. That's not to say you shouldn't at least try/ look into the game. It's a fun game with flaws that make it not so fun sometimes.As for specifics, the story is a fairly standard ""a gigantic evil is approaching and you're the only one that can stop it"" plot, but it does have it's fair share of unique twists to seperate it from others. I found myself interested, as the story differentiates itself in ways that I haven't seen before. That's not to say it's some groundbreaking new twist on the fantasy genre, but it didn't particularly remind me of any other game's story too much. The background lore that you can learn of is fairly interesting, but you don't really get to explore any of it. There is a nice variety of quest objectives, so it doesn't feel as if I'm doing the same thing over and over again. Character creation was also something that was rather disappointing, as there were only about 6 hair options and 4 facial options.The interactions with your companions are a bit weird and don't really flesh out well. Personally, I felt that it was a less developed version of Dragon Age Origins' companion system.While each companion is vastly different in the way that they talk and act, conversations seem a bit stunted, especially with the less than stellar facial capturing that leads to stiff looking faces. It was pretty annoying that I could only have one companion follow me at a time, but I really only used them for cannon fodder. The dialogue choices for the most part capture Vulcan's personality, and can be amusing at times. Despite all of my complaints, I found myself liking Vulcan as a character. The voice acting was average.Your companions themselves suffer from a case of the cliche. Rhelmar is the elf archer, Edwen is the sexy, dark, mysterious witch, Sybil is the innocent and naive scholar/healer, Randval is the badass warrior who is the last of his tribe, and I haven't met Mathras, so I can't pass judgement on him. Spiders definitely did a good job with determining how they react to situations and dialogue options, meaning that you need to watch what you say and how you say it. Based on your words and actions, you could end up losing followers.The combat is... bland. Playing as a ranger, I found myself in a monotonous playstyle pretty quickly: slash slash dodge repeat. Due to the fighting mechanics being a bit clunky, I found enemies far harder than they should have been. The fact that you don't have a grace period when you're knocked down means that you end up losing a good deal of health whenever you find yourself on the ground. All enemy attacks do crazy balls-to-the-wall amounts of damage, so even with upgraded armor and health I find myself dying after 4 or 5 hits. It's not that the game itself is fundamentally hard, the developers just messed up combat leading to an artificial difficulty. For instance, if you dodge while doing a combo, your character will jump right back into the combo, meaning that you step right into the attack that you tried to dodge. That isn't a problem if you time your dodges just right, but I'm stupid like that, so yeah.Graphically wise, I find the game okay. I don't usually put too much stock into graphics, so it doesn't really matter to me. BBF isn't a graphical masterpiece, but it's not a bad looking game either. Fairly run of the mill, maybe a bit outdated. The details were pretty impressive for a game coming out of a rather unproven studio though. The Witcher influence is pretty in your face, and I feel like there's a bit of Dragon Age too but that could just be me.While I mentioned earlier that the character customization was disappointing, the gear customization is not. There are countless upgrades that all have unique looks and unique traits that you can add. Each piece of armor, unless part of a set, looks different and provides a unique feel to your character. The same applies for weapons, which is a welcome change from games that just rehash weapons with different names for you to use.I did find myself liking the soundtrack, so there's that.Too Long; Didn't Read=+The main character's pretty cool, and his personality/dialogue choices change as the game progresses.+The story, while somewhat cliche, does a good job of investing you and provides enough unique spins to keep it fresh.+Nice quest variety+The customization/crafting of armor, weapons and upgrades is vast.+I like the soundtrack+Graphics are pretty good, if a bit outdated.-Choices affect Vulcan, the world around him, and your companions, but not by much.-Customizing the actual looks of your character is shallow: about 6 hairstyles (can't change the color) and 4 faces-Combat is clumsy and annoying. It gives enemies a harder feel than necessary.-Voice acting is meh, stiff facial recognition leads to conversations seeming off.-Companions are cliche and the ""tactical combat"" that was a selling point of this game consisted of enemies 3-shotting me and my companions being bad at being cannon fodder.Honestly, the game looks, feels, and is designed like The Witcher's little brother that tries to emulate him in everything he does but can't.As a final note, I may have ripped on the game for most of my review, but I enjoy it. It's story is nice, but having to plow through the horrible combat is a HUGE turn off. If the combat was a bit smoother, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs with a good story arc. As it stands now, however, it's a game focused on combat that didn't get the combat right (The combat is my main problem with the game. If it were better, I'd be able to overlook everything else and enjoy it for what it is). Buy at your own risk.			"

												'You already own Bound By Flame'I wish I didn't though.This is - and admittedly I only got a couple of hours into the game because the voice acting made me want to bite my keyboard in half - the worst game I have played in 2014, including a free rail shooter dragon nonsense with Games for Gold on XBL and 'Pay2Win the Gathering: 2015'. Maybe the plot gets better - wouldn't know, as unmemorable characters and ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting had me rolling my eyes so far back in my head that I could see my brain melting. Fantasy cliches can still be woven into a decent story, but this has no redeeming qualities. When you're questioning your motivations, along with every NPC lemming that aids you or arbitrarily hates you, it's not generally a good sign.Generally, I'm quite forgiving of graphics if a story is good, and can overlook a shallow story if the gameplay and scenery is interesting. On both counts, it's not. This actually reminds me of Kingdoms of Amalur in a way - I haven't a clue what that game was on about in the end, the Magical Kingdom of Whimsyshire while I saved the Rumpledumpins from the Trololodgers. Who knows. But the combat was mindless fun, and I put more hours into it than I thought I might (thought my total on Steam is inflated because I tabbed out of it for several days and forgot it was running, which says a lot about me). While I'm loathe to harp on at the writing continuously, it doesn't even have fun combat to back it up. It feels dated and clumsy, leaving two counts of 'f*ck this ♥♥♥♥' in the Con Column. There are better RPGs out there than this, and better coming up. If you still feel the need to soldier through it, wait for a sale. A bigger sale. The kind of sale that starts '0.xx'.I, however, have taken to using this game as the second option in 'Would You Rather?' People would rather mate with a ginger or let a Box Jellyfish sit on their face than finish this.(I honestly think it's one of Dante's levels of Hell, along with slow internet and British Netflix.)

Blocking is your only savior, but that falls short too if the enemies attack in a sequence that prevents you from letting go of the block button.  Cause once you do your smacked around.  If knocked down, enemies continue to pummel you as you slowly but surly get back to your feet, and in many cases knock back down before you even get up.  Very disappointed.

												Firstly I have recorded the entirity of my first playthough for youtube, the playlist is here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNzEgKaq7dj7x1jZM4PGdtgljJ2f84KmxMy decision to play this game was to compare Mars War Logs and Bound by Flames. Because just look at them they are so much alike as far as how they play and to a degree the story.Pros:- Visuals are nice.- Characters for the most part are well designed and though out.- The story is interesting up until the ending.- The dialouge and voice acting is for the most part good. Cons:- Ending is odd, something of a cop out from making the rest of the game.- Doesn't feel like you have much of a choice between embrassing the demon or using him up until the end. - Try to feel open world but the enviroments are not large enough to accomplish it.- The content snowballs, from spending a decent amount of time in the initial zones, to rushing through the last two zones.- Combat can be very frusterating, for all the wrong reasons. Most fights of any notability are just a matter of mashing the right button, doesn't so much feel like you are doging attacks or making a strategic decision. - Out of place feeling when the character are using curse words, it just doesn't feel like it fits, to modern for the setting of the game.Other Thoughs:- There are some bugs and oddities in the game. Sometimes the voice actor say one thing, but the subtitles say another.- Some character you never feel as though you know or care about.Overall I would recommend the game. Its not going to be the best that you have ever played, but it is decently fun and entertaining. After all that is the reason we play video games.			"

												Let me first start out by saying I don't mind hard games. I enjoy the challenge of doing blind playthroughs of games on the hardest difficulty and seeing how well I can learn and adapt to steep odds. While this game is hard, there are a lot of things in there that just seem to be a result of lazy programming. The problems are:No control over combos. Want to do that one move that stuns your enemy or a quick blow in between your enemie's attacks? TOO BAD the fighting in this game boils down to who can flail the hardest as you have no control over which attacks you do. There are really no combos other than Left click, left click, left click x 1 billion and they all do random ♥♥♥♥. Sometimes you will do a heavy swipe that will stun your opponent, sometimes the very  same heavy strike will not stun the SAME EXACT opponent. Sometimes left click will have your character do a forward lunge and sometimes it wont. ♥♥♥♥ just happens when you click LMB. The only logic that I could get from the combos is that it might be affected by the distance between your character and the target you want to hit at the moment you press left click and thats pretty much it.Enemies that do a ♥♥♥♥ ton of damage while you do very little damage. This is a a horrible part of the game since oftentimes you will be fighting against mobs of enemies and when every enemy you fight is a tank that hits you like a truck, combat isnt fun, its a chore because 1 or 2 mistakes will mean you're dead and have to redo almost 10 minutes of gameplay.Being stuck in an infinite stun lock against groups of enemies is a thing and completely ruins the combat. There's this one part pretty early in the game where you have to train new recruits how to fight and they BEAT THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF YOU because they all knew how to coordinate their attacks so you'd never be able to retaliate unless you wanted to get hit once and die.The counter system is buggy and useless against getting stunlocked by groups of enemies. A big part of Bound by flames combat is to perfectly block an attack leading to a counter. Since your character pretty much has no attacks that can stun his opponent leading to actual combos, this is pretty important since the only way to do damage is to contantly press LMB until you see the monster rear back for his attack animation and then hit you. However, sometimes, even if you react perfectly you will still take the damage even if your block comes out right.TLDR: Buggy combat, enemies op and you are underpowered, a guy kicked me out of my block and proceeded to keep kicking me while I was down so I couldnt recover until I died.

												Bound By Flame is an enjoyable game. Not a perfect one, but enjoyable. The combat was fun and difficult at times which was great. There wasn't a ton of variety to the enemies that you fight. And a lot of times the enemies felt like bunching bags because of how much health they had. As far as the story goes there were interesting dialogue moments, while some had no bearing on the plot or the world whatsoever. I did like how some of my choices affected the lives of my companions. The quests weren't bad, but many of them felt unnecessary and resulted in way too much backtracking. If the developers had tightened up the Quests and the Dialogue as well as create more enemies, I think the game would have been great. However I'd have to say that it is just good enough which is not a bad thing.			"

												Feels like unfinshed Witcher 2.Storyline is meh, most of choices doesn't matter (don't want to spoil anything so sorry for unclear info).Followers seems to have interesting personality but the game doesn't really give them a chance to shine, they don't have combat utility either, in harder fights they die almost instantly.The combat is meh, I like the Idea of having 2 styles that can be swapped in the middle of fight but i find that dual-wielding is more efficient than two-hander simply becouse two-hander have (in my opinion) useless kick ability istead of dodge.Crafting system is neat, but there is very little stuff to craft, health/mana potions, bolts for crossbow, traps (only one type, dissapointing) and upgrading your gear (not making your own, just upgrading).Soundtrack is good, I think this is one thing that kept me playing.It's not bad game, but not a good one too, it's just ""meh"".

												This is by far one of the worst Action-RPGs I have ever played. What they do get right - combat, story, mechanics, etc. - are done better in other games, even such indie games as Divinity 2: Ego Draconis. Most enemies are simply Dark Souls 1&2 failures and their strategies are similar and yet simplified. You will see the same enemies nearly throughout the game, so those early undead you fought before be prepared as they rarely change as the game progresses.So much more is wrong, one being a detestable protagonist, and very little is done right. This feels to be a poor hybrid of The Witcher, Dark Souls, and Kingdoms of Amalur. I regret spending money for this travesty as it is worth only half its cost, if that. Avoid this game unless you find it for sale, at least 50% off, and you have played just about every other Action-RPG to date. In a long list of single descriptive words, ""atrocious"" is a good start for this game.			"

												So this game turned out to be nothing special.The skill tree doesn't give you many options in play-style. You can either go all in on health regen and shoot fireballs until everything dies, or you can go all in on daggers and get carpal-tunnel from parrying. There's no reason to specialize in both daggers and the sword, so pick one and stay with it the whole game. There are a lot of wholly unnecessary skills that you have to take in order to get to the next one which is just very annoying overall.The combat is annoyingly simple. After one or two attacks it's obvious what each enemy's pattern is and it's easy to parry literally everything. You can parry MAGIC for some reason, so if you're good at noticing the patterns, you're pretty much invulnerable. The only actual threats are archers because the early ones will shoot at you 2 to 3 times in a row. If you encounter two of them, it's just a hail of arrows that is difficult to breach. Everything else can be killed with patience and parrying.The plot is annoying as ♥♥♥♥. Every time there is a choice, the dialogue is so vague that you can't be entirely sure what you're choosing until after you pick. I ended up having to save before each major dialogue scene just so I could figure out what the hell I was choosing. If you end up letting the demon influence you, you get some power buffs. If you don't, you don't get power buffs. However, at the end you can still choose to be entirely good or entirely evil and your choices throughout the game do nothing to limit this. The plotline is pretty much ""Hey, lookit those guys over there. Kill em."" and it doesn't go into any more depth than that. The worst part is that at the end, regardless of what you choose, you get about an 8 second cutscene that shows some vague result, then the game ends. No further explanation is provided. It's complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and makes the whole experience feel incomplete.If you're looking for just a boring action rpg to get you through the day, this one fits the bill. It will literally take one day though. Short AF. I explored everything mutliple times and I still beat it in under 10 hours. "

												Fun, but not worth the pricetag.  I regret buying this at 40 bucks, because it feels more like a game that's in Alpha or Beta.  It has it's positives---the game is very pretty, and the enemies look neat.  The armor and weapon creation/crafting is an interesting system, however, in the long run it ultimately feels useless as the challenge curve no matter what difficulty you choose varies too often.  It goes from being either -too- easy to overwhemlingly difficult on the fly.  Not unbeatable or broken, just something that isn't consistant in difficulty.The biggest drawback is the story.  Boy, I'd be lying if I said this wasn't almost -exactly- like Dragon Age: Origins.  Undead monsters?  Check.  You being the last hope for humanity from the undead Horde?  Check.  Sexy witch woman who speaks with a British accent, shows a lotta boob, and also wants to toy with you/use you for sex?  Check and double check.  The story, while not exactly the same, is a lot like a poorly executed Dragon Age.  Difference is?  The voice acting is -awful-, and your character comes off as completely unlikeable.  Think the dialog trees in ME3 are bad and don't say what you want to say?  Try it on for size when you select an option and your characters says ""I just killed a ♥♥♥♥ing big monster, shouldn't I get praise?"" Like a whiney teenager looking for a pat on the back for cleaning their room.Basically, the only thing that makes you come off as a ""Badass"" is your ""skill"" in the game, but your dialog is pathetic and you come off as a dumb jerk.Oh!  And being a badass through your skill?  That's not that big of a deal either.  The combat is pretty bad, and clunky.  Something that could have been condensed to a few controls is mapped out over various different ones, and comes out as a mess in the long run.  It's as if they intended for you to be able to change your style on the fly, but forgot in order to do so you shouldn't have to switch between what buttons you use for a majority of these ""stances"".  Aiming is also a joke, and half the time you forget things that might be useful, because there's -so many- things you ""can"" do that don't seem important.Unpolished is the overall way to describe it.  Fun?  Certainly.  Worth 40 bucks?  Not at all.Edit:  Oh! And I forgot. The customization? It's limited to around four to five faces and hairstyles per gender. Beyond that, there really isn't any customization, and is very unimpressive. The armor and weapons, yes, but your character overall doesn't feel unique. Don't sell yourself on this if you enjoy heavy customization, because there's definately better.			"

Avoiding or blocking is key, damage delt is low, damage taken is high, overall a challenge.  The voice acting is mediocre, a good attempt at least.

												WARNING, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL IT'S PROBLEMS ARE FIXED! READ THE REST TO FIND OUT THE PROBLEMS.Bound by Flame is a game that I've looked forward to for a long time. So much so that I went against my mantra of pre-ordering and got it off steam faster then the retail stores got it. And when I started playing it, my expectations weren't fully met, but it was still a decent and fun game.Then the prologue ended.Everything just plain went to ♥♥♥♥. Don't get me wrong, I can SENSE the effort that was put into this. They've tried to make a hard-ish game that isn't harder then witcher or dark souls, but strangely enough I've found this game harder then both. Why?In dark souls, despite the difficulty of the game, all deaths are YOUR FAULT. You can clearly see the enemy coming but you couldn't dodge, so its your fault. You rush into a wide open area with tons of archers, guess who's fault it is?But in Bound by Flame, on NORMAL, you're placed into situations where enemies can down you in 3 hits, interrupt all of your attacks and don't even flinch at yours. To top it off, the camera veers off at weird places, disallowing you to see what's going on (and dying in the process). Let's put things into perspective.At some point you have to fight another human in some sort of duel. You slash him 6 times and 1/20th of his life is gone. He slashes you once and 1/3rd of your life is gone. After much difficulty, dodging and parrying, you finally win him as a companion. When he finally joins you, how many hits does it take from the monster to kill him? 5! And you? 3! That's just what the game does, it nerfs you and at the same time places you in impossible situations. (Like I don't know...surround you with people slashing at you constantly while 3 others shoot at you from all directions.)So basically, don't buy this until the problem is fixed, if it ever is going to be.

												I really enjoyed this game. Sure, its a bit rough around the edges but the story is great, it has a good pace and the combat/skill system feels good. The interactions with your companions and the world were well written and the soundtrack is fantastic. For a small studio like Spider I am impressed. I wished the story would be a bit longer, but all in all I can recommend this game if you like single player (Action-)RPG´s like Mass-Effect or The Witcher with a good story, companions and decisions that have an impact on the storyline. :)			"

												I will make this short. This game is no where near worth 40 dollars. You either have to be a master at parrying or you have no chance in this game. The combat control is not good at all. When using daggers, you can only dodge backwards. Thats it..only backwards. If you're being attacked by ranged and close quarters simultaneously, you are more or less done for considering you will be doing nothing but backwards dodging. If you travel far enough away from where the enemies first were encountered, they will return to their original spots with full health. The voice acting is terrible. Also I want to note that anyone wanting to play this game should be prepared to be beat down in a corner constantly. I expected strategic combat like the trailers promised, and instead I received a button mashing circus. Oh....and the camera sucks too.			"

It is worth the money I paid and I'm getting alot of fun out of it. The only compliant I have about it is that your damage output could be higher and enemies health and hp could be somewhat lower. Your hp does not seem to increase on lvlup. And the enemies have a substantional amount of health and hp over you, some ridacously so,  even the lower lvled ones.			"

YouTube™ Video: Bound By Flame Review - Comedic yet rough Role Playing

			http://cramgaming.com - Gamertag Shadowmask - A look at Spiders action role playing game in this Bound By Flame review. Gamers can play the game on PC, Xbox 360, PS4 and PS3.		

Bound By Flame is a commendable game from Spiders and one that whilst interesting and full of pleasant surprises beneath the surface does take some time to reach its full potential. The opening hours are a little lacking and might put off some players, but once the game enters its stride, provides some cool moments of tactical stealth and action gaming that's worth the price of entry. The story is pretty good, the characterization effective, and the music top quality. The only things letting the game down are some poor visual elements on occasion, unfair design choices which can frustrate or cause cheap deaths, and an overall lack of polish in some areas where things like companion AI gets stuck on the scenery. So, if you like action role playing games then this is worth checking out, although it's not going to be to everyone's tastes. There's some genuinely jarring bits of dialogue from the main character that have to be heard to be believed, but at least there's an abundance of humour here.			"

+ Epic music in the endMINUSES:- In the movies weapons move in the body when you kill someone and then movie starts- Some humans and elves are horrorable than deadwalkers- Short campaign- They lied to us about a lot of weapons, enemies and very interesting and long campaign, but I don't see something about from the trailer, no army of Red Scribes, no army of elves, no army of Blades etc.- Meanless enemies. Juggernaut is the first boss in this game, and I don't know even what is it. It looks like mammoth, but not it is unknown creature. Idiotic and meanless enemies: ghosts, juggernaut (semi-mammoth and semi-giant), deadwalkers (semi-zombie and semi-skeleton as deadwalkers of The Walking Dead), horrible elves. Only Lord Blackfrost, Edwen and Sybil are beautiful characters.My advises for you:When you reach battle with Blackfrost and Demon, craft health potions and then arrows. I crafted arrows for all my indegrients and then I can't craft health potion. Watch video above this and you will see I won the Demon with 1 health potion for 42 minutes, because I ran all battlefield for gaining health.

												This is the 3rd game I've played by Spiders Studios. Just as the other two, I greatly enjoyed this one. It might've only lasted for about 13 hours, and there were a few issues and grievances along the way, but all in all this was great fun. The story is nothing too original. It's your typical dark fantasy setting with humans facing off the armies of undead, but I was quite impressed with the overall presentation and delivery of it. Most of the companions were quite interesting, though some of them could've been developed a bit better, and the main character and the demon inside of him were very solid in the lead. The combat aspect is a bit of a mixed bag. It was incredibly fun in some ways. The moves and abilities made each battle feel epic, especially with the use of superhuman dodge skill, which created some 'wow' moments as you see your character narrowly avoid an enemy swing. However, despite finding it fun, I have to agree with many of the criticisms by other players. The lack of roll command was something I could not understand at all. And the whole interruption mechanic was extremely annoying, because it was easy for enemies to interrupt you mid-swing, not to mention knocking you down on the floor and getting some cheap free hits whilst you're waiting for your character to get back up.The difficulty in general was way too high, even for the Easy difficulty setting. For a game that has such a strong focus on story, the Easy mode shouldn't have been this hard. This was made worse by some parts of the game having unpleasant difficulty spikes. In general I thought chapters 1 and 2 were brilliantly done and the flow was perfect. There were many sidequests, and the action bits were balanced out with storytelling. And then chapter 3 came along, and the game was ruined by constant non-stop battles with identical enemies and some horrible level design that forces you to walk through monotonous twisting corridors and too much backtracking. And the final boss was way way way too hard compared to the rest of the game. To make it worse, if you wish to go back and buy more stuff and grind, you can no longer do it, so you have to load an earlier bit of the game. I ended up doing that so that I could buy 40 health potions (and no, that isn't too much).Combat frustrations aside, the game was still fun and worth playing. The crafting system was done well, and the levelling of skills was reasonably good too. There are 3 mastery trees in total: Warrior, Ranger, and Pyromancer. You can mix and match and invest in any of those as much as you wish. I personally went heavy on the warrior tree. Too bad in the second half of the game I realised that going Ranger stance with daggers was proving to be much better (and seems many other players agree), making Warrior tree quite underpowered compared to the Ranger tree. As for Pyromancy, I found most fire abilities useless, aside from weapon enchantment with fire, which was a single most useful skill in the game.I'd definitely recommend this game, though BE WARNED that it is HARD and unfair, and you will be getting killed a lot even on Easy mode. If that's something you do not mind, then most likely you'll enjoy the game.			"

												Took under 18 hours to beat, I recommend it on sale. It seems as though they had big plans for the story but were rushed near the end, since the story becomes rushed and some lines appear to be delivered assuming the player had prior knowledge of something that was not stated. Combat is nice, though unbalanced since it seems between the choice of 2-handed weapons and dual daggers they do the same damage per hit, but daggers hit much more often than 2-handed weapons. I managed to beat the game going pure 2-handed, but near the end I wished I had gone the dagger route.Overall I recommend due to uniqueness (Spiders seem good at making unique games despite what I percieve to be budget problems) and vision despite not quite reaching what I think could have been an epic game.

BOUND BY FLAME - STORY RPGSolid rpg ( good battle system ) but it consists in 50% of the game time in conversations with the other characters ( so if you dont like that and think its boring dont buy ) and 50% gameplay ( the levels are really small and linear )....the biggest flaw in my opinion is that the game take a large portion convoluting a story about 7 ice lords with mystical powers and large battles - but the scale of the game world is really really small in contrast to the story - no epic feel at all - 7.5/10 - recommended for the fans of the genre !-i like the stealth option in game-i dont like that if the area is cleared and you return the enemies respawn !-also the replay value that comes from different choices you can make in the game based on your conversations doesnt seem that appealing to me because of the lack of excitement in the game world ( ex : romance by conversations has a finality of a 3 seconds kiss sequence ) - i don't see myself replaying :) "

												I truly wish that I could recommend this game, but I can’t. If you’re an experienced RPG player that’s simply looking for a difficult combat game, then I’d suggest picking it up on a sale to give it a try. But if you’re newer to the RPG element of gaming, please steer clear of this game. I went with it because it seemed like an interesting storyline, but it was completely ruined by shoddy and uninspired voice acting.. Even the written script is meager, at best.If you can stand sloppy script writing and want a challenging game, give it a try.But if you’re looking for a unique RPG experience, this simply won’t suffice.

												Bound By Flame is a sngle player RPG develo0ped by the small studio, Spiders. You may (or may not) be familiar with other games developed by Spiders, including Of Orcs and Men and Mars: War Logs, being the most recent of their games.While Bound By Flame may not be the most impressive, or the most original RPG to have ever released, it does offer quite a bit in way of concept, story, and combat. I'll start with the best things Bound By Flame has to offer.-VisualsThe visual aspect fo the game is actually quite nice in most cases, with strong dynamic lighting, beautiful level designs, and an immersive world. Aside from a few muddy textures, almost everything in the game looks nice. I personally didn;t notice any clipping, flickering, or major flaws with the graphical aspect of this game.-CraftingHaving the ability to craft crossbow bolts, health and mana potions, and even explosive traps and bombs on the fly is a welcome addition to the solid gameplay. Having the ability to also customize your armor and weapons by adding specific stat bonuses is also a nice touch, and helps ensure the feeling of becoming more powerful, because who doesn't love adding spiked shoulder guards and tassets for health and armor bonuses while looking awesome at the same time?-GearThat brings me to my next point. The gear looks fantastic. Swords, axes, and hammers look hefty and deadly, and can be altered through upgrading to look even more powerful and menacing. Armor can also transform the way your character looks (and plays) depending on the stats you want to cultivate. Simply put, the armor and weapons are great for folks who enjoy a bit of customization.-CombatI understand some people (you know who you are) are having ""trouble"" with the combat in this game. While there are a few flaws in the design, it's not often that I actually feel the need to learn efficent strategies for dealing with particular enemy types in games like this. Most games have you facing the same enemies with little variation, and thus little variety in strategy. This is not a game where spamming 1 button will get you through to the end. The combat requires quick reactions, planning, strategy, and swift execution, and can often times be simplified by sneaking and assassinating a hardened target early before facing numerous tough foes.The game allows for ranged attacks by way of magic spells or firing a crossbow, as well as swift and deadly attacks with daggers, or slow and heavy blows with a large sword, axe, or hammer. It's important to understand each weapon type and which weapons are the most effective on enemy types. If you wade into a conflict aimlessly swinging your sword around in hopes of mindless slaughter, it will be YOU who gets slaughtered. This is not casual combat for the beginner, and does require skill and timing to maximize your own effectiveness.-Music/SoundThe music and sound of the game are pretty impressive, all things considered, and I found myself immersed in the hauntingly beautiful melodies that gently flow while I explore a frozen wasteland or a dark cave. The music is a VERY strong point for this game.Now lets talk about the flaws with the game.-Dialogue/Lip SyncMost of the dialogue is engaging, and decent enough, but there are times when the voice acting is sub-par, and many times when the spoken dialogue does not match up well with the movements of a character's mouth. If you are a fan of localized JRPGS, this won't bother you very much. If, however, you are accustomed to spot on voice performances and mouth syncing, you may be a little unnerved by the flaws.There is also character dialogue that seems to be done by unprofessionals, ""Sybil and Buffalo"" and while there aren't many characters who sound aloof and terrible, those two are essentially the only ones that got under my skin. Even with the needless cursing at times, most of the other dialogue and characters seemed spot on.-Hitboxes (Combat)While the combat can be fun (or frustrating), there is a noticeable difference between visual representations of enemies and their actual ""hit boxes"" as in the actual ""reach"" of an enemy may be farther or closer than their actual attack seems to hit. This is a minor flaw at worst, considering that after your first few fights, you will grow accustomed to the distance necessary when combating certain enemies. The ""lack of dodge rolling"" is even less of a flaw considering that each weapon set (Daggers/Sword) uses a different system for defense. Using a sword grants the ability to parry almost any attack, and if timed properly allows for a devastating counter attack that can send an enemy reeling, allowing for follow up attacks.Using daggers allows for a backward leap, essentially dodging all incoming damage and if timed properly also results in a devastating counter attack and follow up. There is also a skill in the Ranger tree that once unlocked allows you to sprint during combat, making quick break-aways easier. A good strategy to distance yourself from a pack of powerful enemies is to lay an explosive trap in their oncoming path, then sprint away, breaking line of sight and returning to a stealth stance. This allows for area damage, knocking the enemies back, and allowing you the oppurtunity to instantly kill or seriously injure an unsuspecting enemy from stealth.So while the hitboxes may not always be indicative of the actual hit range of an enemy, there are plenty of counter measures to level the playing field and ensure you aren't falling victim to ""phantom swipes"".This game is by no means comparable to other triple A titles of the same genre, but if you are looking for an enjoyable, action based RPG, this is a good choice. While it doesn't stray far from the genre basics, most of what the game does, it does quite well. This game was developed with a fraction of the budget that most other games of this calibur are allowed, and the level quality is quite surprising, coming from a small studio like Spiders.I do not regret giving this game a chance, and would recommend it to any hardcore RPG enthusiast, but this game is not for the casual gamer. This isn't a Dark Souls game by any means, but if you aren't familiar with concepts like strategy, planning, and adaptation, you will come away from this experience sorely dissapointed due to repeated failure.

YouTube™ Video: Bound By Flame Review - Comedic yet rough Role Playing 

			Views: 3,113		

			http://cramgaming.com - Gamertag Shadowmask - A look at Spiders action role playing game in this Bound By Flame review. Gamers can play the game on PC, Xbox 360, PS4 and PS3.		

Bound By Flame is a commendable game from Spiders and one that whilst interesting and full of pleasant surprises beneath the surface does take some time to reach its full potential. The opening hours are a little lacking and might put off some players, but once the game enters its stride, provides some cool moments of tactical stealth and action gaming that's worth the price of entry. The story is pretty good, the characterization effective, and the music top quality. The only things letting the game down are some poor visual elements on occasion, unfair design choices which can frustrate or cause cheap deaths, and an overall lack of polish in some areas where things like companion AI gets stuck on the scenery. So, if you like action role playing games then this is worth checking out, although it's not going to be to everyone's tastes. There's some genuinely jarring bits of dialogue from the main character that have to be heard to be believed, but at least there's an abundance of humour here.			"

												WARNING, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL IT'S PROBLEMS ARE FIXED! READ THE REST TO FIND OUT THE PROBLEMS.Bound by Flame is a game that I've looked forward to for a long time. So much so that I went against my mantra of pre-ordering and got it off steam faster then the retail stores got it. And when I started playing it, my expectations weren't fully met, but it was still a decent and fun game.Then the prologue ended.Everything just plain went to ♥♥♥♥. Don't get me wrong, I can SENSE the effort that was put into this. They've tried to make a hard-ish game that isn't harder then witcher or dark souls, but strangely enough I've found this game harder then both. Why?In dark souls, despite the difficulty of the game, all deaths are YOUR FAULT. You can clearly see the enemy coming but you couldn't dodge, so its your fault. You rush into a wide open area with tons of archers, guess who's fault it is?But in Bound by Flame, on NORMAL, you're placed into situations where enemies can down you in 3 hits, interrupt all of your attacks and don't even flinch at yours. To top it off, the camera veers off at weird places, disallowing you to see what's going on (and dying in the process). Let's put things into perspective.At some point you have to fight another human in some sort of duel. You slash him 6 times and 1/20th of his life is gone. He slashes you once and 1/3rd of your life is gone. After much difficulty, dodging and parrying, you finally win him as a companion. When he finally joins you, how many hits does it take from the monster to kill him? 5! And you? 3! That's just what the game does, it nerfs you and at the same time places you in impossible situations. (Like I don't know...surround you with people slashing at you constantly while 3 others shoot at you from all directions.)So basically, don't buy this until the problem is fixed, if it ever is going to be.

												This game feels like an attempt to recreate the action of the witcher 2.  I quite enjoy it, though there are parts where the combat is not quite solid enough and the difficulty is exagerated as a result.  Avoiding or blocking is key, damage delt is low, damage taken is high, overall a challenge.  The voice acting is mediocre, a good attempt at least.  If you've played the witcher 2 and enjoy it, this is a game you might like.  Otherwise, go play the witcher 2 first, it is a much more polished game in all reality.			"

The graphics and art design are ok the VA is alright...the localization isn't good and often has some alright VA's saying incredibly awkward sentences...but they'll often read the lines well enough.The combat is fun some of the time...and incredibly frustrating other times.It's such an odd game, if you've played divinity 2 the dragon saga you'll have an idea of what to expect...it's not bad enough that I regret picking it up for $25 in Aus. But it's not much to write home about.It's right there in the mediocre area, might be worth checking out cheap but otherwise you're not missing anything amazing.			"

												It is a good game. Combat does take some getting used too, but once you get the hang of it it is fun. The areas monsters and npcs are detailed. The lore of the world is intersting.And finally a game where traps are more than just flavour. I can see the Witcher 2 influence and decisions do matter. Crafting is acutally fun and useful. It is worth the money I paid and I'm getting alot of fun out of it. The only compliant I have about it is that your damage output could be higher and enemies health and hp could be somewhat lower. Your hp does not seem to increase on lvlup. And the enemies have a substantional amount of health and hp over you, some ridacously so,  even the lower lvled ones.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. Sure, its a bit rough around the edges but the story is great, it has a good pace and the combat/skill system feels good. The interactions with your companions and the world were well written and the soundtrack is fantastic. For a small studio like Spider I am impressed. I wished the story would be a bit longer, but all in all I can recommend this game if you like single player (Action-)RPG´s like Mass-Effect or The Witcher with a good story, companions and decisions that have an impact on the storyline. :)			"

There are also a few glitches with a few quest and map markers for quests. 7 out of 10.			"

												I'm a disabled combat Veteran and do nothing but play games. Bound by Flame is easily one of the smartest purchases I've made in a long time. The price would be fair at $60 but for $33 it was a steal. I actually feel guilty. I would recommend this game to fans of Dragon Age; Dark Souls; The Witcher; Dragon's Dogma, not because it is similar but because the strengths of those games are represented here. Anyone who appreciated those games should appreciate this one but make no mistake.. Bound by Flame is it's own game. It clearly deserves to stand on it's own merit as an excellent acheivement for the developer and an incredible experience for the fans. The game looks amazing, the combat is challenging but feels incredible and is wonderfully rewarding when done correctly. The dodge and parry mechanics when timed right are extremely gratifying. At higher difficulties it is essential to learn the mechanics and timing and use all the tools provided in combat. The environments aren't completely open but rather blocks of area's with various paths similar to dragon age 2. There are many quests to complete at each stage before moving on to the next and the story quests definitely feel like they affect your path. Anyone who would rather avoid all story will still get something out of this game although I feel they are doing themselves a disservice. It's not often that I make a point in games to read every last conversation option with every character I come across but I find the story is held back enough to keep me interested in discovering the mystery from all these unadvertised points of view and insights from characters all over the world. The voice acting is done well enough not to break the immersion and voices and accents vary enough to keep it interesting. I can safely say I will playthrough this game again as soon as this play is complete to discover the other branches of the options and choices I made. There is enough of a crafting system to feel like it's making a difference with plenty of gear and options to suit any playstyle. The 3 character skill trees are warrior (sword), ranger (daggers) and magic which works in tandem the others along with a passive bonus portion with separate points. You switch on the fly between sword and dagger styles, but magic is always available and used for enchanting your current weapon, used defensively or for ranged attacks. The sword is more blocking and parrying while the daggers are faster and involve dodging. Neither is better, both feel good and have strengths for certain enemies and conditions. There is an exploration and collection element as many items can be found and most of which can be upgraded using the different items found around the world in hidden chests and as drops. There are also companions that you meet and unlock over your journey that can be selected to accompany you on your quests from the local hub. The full compliment is there (if you don't have them killed when you meet them) bow ranged, magic ranged, magic healer, tank, etc. All with different and unique personalities and opinions and they all have multiple conversation options. For me the combat feels alot like the DS series but easier in the sense that there is no endurance so blocking and parrying are required to win but cost nothing and can be used often. Although a mistake can be just as costly especially with multiple enemies; missing a parry can open you up to a chain of attacks that finish you. Each enemy is difficult until attack patterns are learned and you can judge how and when to block, parry and dodge the different attacks. Potions for health and magic as well as traps and crossbow bolts can be crafted on the fly with items found and dropped and all remain useful well in to the game.  I cannot attest to the length of the game but it is rare that I am afraid of getting to the end. I'm having that much fun with it.   As for the budget and the studio's experience... I don't care. Don't insult yourself by considering any of that ♥♥♥♥. This is a solid game I would be happy to have paid much more to play and I'm somewhat upset that I didn't. These are the people that deserve my money so they can fund their next incredible project, not just pay for the costs of this one. It may not be your favorite game of the year but anyone who gives it a real shot will have to admit it's definitely of a higher quality and substance than most RPG's released with this little marketing and at such a low price point and is a positive adition to any collection.

												Bound By Flame is an enjoyable game. Not a perfect one, but enjoyable. The combat was fun and difficult at times which was great. There wasn't a ton of variety to the enemies that you fight. And a lot of times the enemies felt like bunching bags because of how much health they had. As far as the story goes there were interesting dialogue moments, while some had no bearing on the plot or the world whatsoever. I did like how some of my choices affected the lives of my companions. The quests weren't bad, but many of them felt unnecessary and resulted in way too much backtracking. If the developers had tightened up the Quests and the Dialogue as well as create more enemies, I think the game would have been great. However I'd have to say that it is just good enough which is not a bad thing.			"

												Feels like unfinshed Witcher 2.Storyline is meh, most of choices doesn't matter (don't want to spoil anything so sorry for unclear info).Followers seems to have interesting personality but the game doesn't really give them a chance to shine, they don't have combat utility either, in harder fights they die almost instantly.The combat is meh, I like the Idea of having 2 styles that can be swapped in the middle of fight but i find that dual-wielding is more efficient than two-hander simply becouse two-hander have (in my opinion) useless kick ability istead of dodge.Crafting system is neat, but there is very little stuff to craft, health/mana potions, bolts for crossbow, traps (only one type, dissapointing) and upgrading your gear (not making your own, just upgrading).Soundtrack is good, I think this is one thing that kept me playing.It's not bad game, but not a good one too, it's just ""meh"".

												This is by far one of the worst Action-RPGs I have ever played. What they do get right - combat, story, mechanics, etc. - are done better in other games, even such indie games as Divinity 2: Ego Draconis. Most enemies are simply Dark Souls 1&2 failures and their strategies are similar and yet simplified. You will see the same enemies nearly throughout the game, so those early undead you fought before be prepared as they rarely change as the game progresses.So much more is wrong, one being a detestable protagonist, and very little is done right. This feels to be a poor hybrid of The Witcher, Dark Souls, and Kingdoms of Amalur. I regret spending money for this travesty as it is worth only half its cost, if that. Avoid this game unless you find it for sale, at least 50% off, and you have played just about every other Action-RPG to date. In a long list of single descriptive words, ""atrocious"" is a good start for this game.			"

												*New review 3/19/2015* I change the game to a thumbs up, if only because of price, the old review is at the bottom from release month. 6.7/10Freedom/Choices:Apart from the atrocious way they handle the choices in game (either side with the demon completely or not at all, going part way ruins your choices), what few choices their are. If you have any corruption at all, you're stuck with ♥♥♥♥ endings, you need to be all human and do the sacrafice ending to get any kind of recap or anything without a credit scroll. If you ever have corruption key choices are made for you that determine NPC followers. So really there is no freedom and the path is set for the BAD endings as soon as you get any corruption. Also note siding with the demon removes your capability to wear armor pieces, so only choose to if you want to go flatout mage.Combat= Combat would be fun, until you realize there is only ONE viable build, Ranger with Pyromancer support, or Pyromnacer (demon path) with Ranger support. being a Warrior will just get your ♥♥♥ kicked, you'll be slow and the end game boss, infact several bosses and group fights will rip you apart. There isn't enough damage mitigation in the game to save your ♥♥♥, it's all about mobility and attack speed. So having 3 trees is pointless, it's really only viable with Ranger/Pyromancer unless you are on the EASIEST difficulty, even then it can be a pain.FIXED= They fixed dialouge issues with NPC's handing out spoilers, read the below review for an examples so that boosts my rating up to 6.7.PRO's  *Difficult, in a good sense, I hate games that are too easy, you get bored, this game doesn't dissapoint on any difficulty.*Shiny, *Good viceral combat, you don't become roll face god mode at any time, you move around and dodge.*The story has a great premise and an OK way of delivering it.*Replayability for Full human or full demon, honestly you can't save before the end and ge the demon endings, each path has 2 endings, but only the pure human and sacrafice endings have a unique ending tale. Still worth playing twice to see the DEMON mode.*CraftingCONS*Buggy visuals, quite often*NPC dialouge bugs out often enough, case in point, an NPC wanted to be with me for a certain fight, i took them to that fight, then afterewards the NPC acted like I didn't take them.*No quest markers over NPC's you have to revisit everyone multiple times through out chapters.*Minor choices have huge resounding consequences, and seemingly huge decisions don't mean squat, save scum often.*Lots of foot travel to the same areas for a chain of quests, gets boring.Advice* While there are many armor sets throughout the game and you have limited weight capacity here are the ones worth keeping in order. Don't destroy any of the pieces till you have all of the others, these have the most mod capabilies, and the best stats. Everything else is really filler and can be scrapped.EARLY GAME:SwordsmanMIDGAME:RangerLATE GAME:OfficerENDGAME: Elite SoldierCombat 9.0/10Story 7.0/10Exeution 4.0/10END SCORE 6.7/10Worth the currently cheap price, has potential, maybe Spider can improve on it's shortcomings, play for the combat and the shiny*OLD REVIEW BELOW, WAS A THUMBS DOWN*As much as the combat can be fun, that's all it has really going for it.The reason it gets downvotes lets start with the fact that conversations give away quest spoilers or the ending of the game long long before you reach the end of the game. For example *SPOILER INCOMING BUT THE GAME WILL SPOIL IT TOO*  You'll get a hot mage lady she's not entirely trustworthy. In Chapter 2 during  companion conversations you just bring up she used to be an Ice Lord, casualy like you always knew, and she responds in kind, filling you in on all kinds of personal details, skip to about 5 hours later you OFFICIALY find out she was an Ice lord *DUNDUNDUUUUUN* Drama anger can you trust her omfgploxing? Wait wait you spoiled that for me yourself about 5 hours ago. ♥♥♥♥ like this happens ALL THE TIME! You pull information from thin air in conversations and plot decisions from inforamtion you were obvioulsy supposed to have found out, but never actually did.Your ability to make choices, is fairly limited, the instances where making a choice seems logical, it gets scripted and you get no choice, like say absorbing the body of a lich, which transforms you, removes your ability to waer helmets and pisses off the elf prince. But you know, getting a choice to allow the demon to stop ""mind confusion"" seems like ti will mean the death or life of your friends, nope guess what, it doesn't, it means nothing. Seemingly major decisions are infact  cosmetic and the really major decisions are chosen for you with no say what so ever.It's like very very badly written novel by a 9th grade student, or a first time DnD Dungeon Master.Honestly wait till this game is like 9.99, it's worth 9.99. I would even say it's worth 14.99 if you really really want it.5.9/10 a D-PRO'sShinyOK but not spectacular combat mechanicsCON'sBuggyInconsistent story progressionNon sensical decision makingFalsely advertised freedom.

												Fun, but not worth the pricetag.  I regret buying this at 40 bucks, because it feels more like a game that's in Alpha or Beta.  It has it's positives---the game is very pretty, and the enemies look neat.  The armor and weapon creation/crafting is an interesting system, however, in the long run it ultimately feels useless as the challenge curve no matter what difficulty you choose varies too often.  It goes from being either -too- easy to overwhemlingly difficult on the fly.  Not unbeatable or broken, just something that isn't consistant in difficulty.The biggest drawback is the story.  Boy, I'd be lying if I said this wasn't almost -exactly- like Dragon Age: Origins.  Undead monsters?  Check.  You being the last hope for humanity from the undead Horde?  Check.  Sexy witch woman who speaks with a British accent, shows a lotta boob, and also wants to toy with you/use you for sex?  Check and double check.  The story, while not exactly the same, is a lot like a poorly executed Dragon Age.  Difference is?  The voice acting is -awful-, and your character comes off as completely unlikeable.  Think the dialog trees in ME3 are bad and don't say what you want to say?  Try it on for size when you select an option and your characters says ""I just killed a ♥♥♥♥ing big monster, shouldn't I get praise?"" Like a whiney teenager looking for a pat on the back for cleaning their room.Basically, the only thing that makes you come off as a ""Badass"" is your ""skill"" in the game, but your dialog is pathetic and you come off as a dumb jerk.Oh!  And being a badass through your skill?  That's not that big of a deal either.  The combat is pretty bad, and clunky.  Something that could have been condensed to a few controls is mapped out over various different ones, and comes out as a mess in the long run.  It's as if they intended for you to be able to change your style on the fly, but forgot in order to do so you shouldn't have to switch between what buttons you use for a majority of these ""stances"".  Aiming is also a joke, and half the time you forget things that might be useful, because there's -so many- things you ""can"" do that don't seem important.Unpolished is the overall way to describe it.  Fun?  Certainly.  Worth 40 bucks?  Not at all.Edit:  Oh! And I forgot. The customization? It's limited to around four to five faces and hairstyles per gender. Beyond that, there really isn't any customization, and is very unimpressive. The armor and weapons, yes, but your character overall doesn't feel unique. Don't sell yourself on this if you enjoy heavy customization, because there's definately better.			"

												So this game turned out to be nothing special.The skill tree doesn't give you many options in play-style. You can either go all in on health regen and shoot fireballs until everything dies, or you can go all in on daggers and get carpal-tunnel from parrying. There's no reason to specialize in both daggers and the sword, so pick one and stay with it the whole game. There are a lot of wholly unnecessary skills that you have to take in order to get to the next one which is just very annoying overall.The combat is annoyingly simple. After one or two attacks it's obvious what each enemy's pattern is and it's easy to parry literally everything. You can parry MAGIC for some reason, so if you're good at noticing the patterns, you're pretty much invulnerable. The only actual threats are archers because the early ones will shoot at you 2 to 3 times in a row. If you encounter two of them, it's just a hail of arrows that is difficult to breach. Everything else can be killed with patience and parrying.The plot is annoying as ♥♥♥♥. Every time there is a choice, the dialogue is so vague that you can't be entirely sure what you're choosing until after you pick. I ended up having to save before each major dialogue scene just so I could figure out what the hell I was choosing. If you end up letting the demon influence you, you get some power buffs. If you don't, you don't get power buffs. However, at the end you can still choose to be entirely good or entirely evil and your choices throughout the game do nothing to limit this. The plotline is pretty much ""Hey, lookit those guys over there. Kill em."" and it doesn't go into any more depth than that. The worst part is that at the end, regardless of what you choose, you get about an 8 second cutscene that shows some vague result, then the game ends. No further explanation is provided. It's complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and makes the whole experience feel incomplete.If you're looking for just a boring action rpg to get you through the day, this one fits the bill. It will literally take one day though. Short AF. I explored everything mutliple times and I still beat it in under 10 hours. "

												This game is decidedly...mediocre. The plot is odd to say the least. There's something about evil ice lords from the north and no one can stop them and suddenly you get a demon put into you by accident? It's kinda weird. The gameplay itself is a bit frustrating. The combat itself feels like it has no weight to it. I want to like this game. You throw fireballs at things. And yet over the hours, I just am having zero fun throwing fireballs, shooting crossbows, or hitting things with pointy objects. More than once, you just run across zones and back again with nothing to do. The voice acting is not particularly great. After about 5 hours, I realized that it just doesn't have the spark to make me keep wanting to play it. If you have nothing else, I guess, but try to avoid.			"

												To be completely honest with this game, it leaves a lot to be wanted. Combat is slow and quite similar all the way through the game, getting better weapons or powers don’t really seem to make it end much faster or more interesting. Dialogue is really bad, things are said I swear nobody would save in their whole life. The graphics are good, music is also good, there is an interesting lore behind everything that could have been deeper. I don’t recommend buying it unless it is found at a discount.			"

												Definitely worth getting, especially if on sale.   Truly challenging combat, a good degree of character customization as far as combat and crafting go.  It goes the Mass Effect route of giving you a set name and thus makes dialogue more interesting, though there aren't many choices for appearance customization.  The male Vulcan has far superior voice acting to the female voice actor.  The story is interesting if a tad bit railroaded, and you have significant, if few real decisions to make.

												A nice game though it does have some flaws. For me I kind of prefered Mars War logs which was the previous game made by the same company using the same ideas. The game is played out a bit like Witcher 2 though this is much smaller and less depth....but the crafting system isnt bad except for the re-used armor designs where some early armor looks the same as a high-tier armor later on (there isnt alot of armor sets in the game) However there are alot of weapons and each one is named so they sound and look very unique. One problem I have with the game is how boring combat can be later on in the game where the larger enemies spam area of effect attacks which you have to dodge which at ""one stab and dodge/parry at a time"" can make it feel boring so I had to turn down the difficulty to get though it faster. In attidion enemies can sometimes ""stack up"" in one spot and all attack you which makes it a real pain because its hard to get one hit off without reciving 3 hits back...and trying to spread them out isnt going to help D:  On and I forgot to mention the undead with 2 shield.....oh god these are so anoying if you dont put points into ""critical knockdown"" kick attack as they are invincivle and have too much health unless you like doing that ""one stab and dodge/parry at a time"" trick or get lucky after 50 or so hits when the shield breaks....seriously its anoying to see these guy and worse if you see them hanging around some other big guys (tip: just run past them solves everything). Anyway I still enjoyed this game but I havnt yet played with the diffrent story-changing choices you have to make mid-game. I recommend getting it a little cheaper later on though.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. Honestly, what drew me to it was the art style, the premise and the creatures. While, the story may sound very similar to a lot of other medieval universes out there - what sword and shield stories aren't at this point? I struggled to get more than an hour of playtime in this. Here I am now at 65 minutes and I have a headache from the tedious, clunky and completely unengaging gameplay that is Bound By Flame. The dialogue is atrocious as it seems to have been written by a middle school english student. Whatever good story there could have been is completely ruined by the game's presentation and character dialogue. It just gave me a bad headache simply listening to it. On that same note, shouldn't it be against game standards in 2014 to have lyp syncing be completely ( I do mean completely) off sync with the words? Wow. Despite all of that I figured the combat could at least be fun because that's what really drew my eye. Nope. It's clunky, tedious, reptitive and just plain boring. There's a huge difference between watching gameplay videos on youtube where I thought it looked fun and just playing it yourself. The areas in which you fight are very narrow and constricted leaving little room to maneavur. The stealth system might as well be non existant as it simply consists of crouch, get behind enemy, get 30% damage boost. Done. Good luck with that with the extremely linear levels you traverse.And finally... this game does not play like a traditional RPG. It is more along the lines of an action game like god of war with a bit more indepth traditional role playing game traits. I mean... I found leather pieces until a pile of pebbles next to the lake. How does that make any sense? Or better yet I looted it off an armorless opponent. It almost feels instanced. Do some easy, minor and basic objective. Reach door. Load screen. Next linear pathway to box, door or creature to kill. Load Screen. Oh, by the way I've yet to see anyone actually step through a door let alone touch it before the load screen comes up. Maybe I'll edit this review if I manage the courage to give this game a second chance. I'm very disappointed.			"

												A couple hours into the game and thus far i really like it. The only real downfall to the game is that its very linear as far as game play not a whole lot of places to explore your set on a path for the most part with small parts of open space to explore at least so far into the game. But the the large scale bosses make the game great and you can build up your warrior how you see fit and the acting in the game is better then a lot of Action/RPG's i've played. The graphics are pretty good having you kinda take in the sites as you progress through the game. The controller support is good and responsive. I give this game a thumbs up and highly recommend for someone who likes the Action/RPG's.			"

												Note this first post is just a first impersions of the game so far, my opinions on things are subject to change as I get further in at which case I will update this, but as for now here is my impressions.I am not normally one who notices or cares about what others would consider aweful voice acting, but this game definitly has it to the point where even I notice and am a bit turned off by how hit and miss the voice acting is, which is probably what makes the bad VA stand out more is that its not all aweful, but what is bad is noticably bad. The animations on talking in general are pretty bad as well, I don't mean just lip syncing, I mean it in general looks like trying to do facial animations from something barely more powerful then a N64.With that said the rest of the animations for combat are good, combat feels good with decent mechanics, and while the story its self doesn't seem memorable as of yet it does seem interesting enough to care about it. And while some of the difficulty of the game is removed by the fact that the game pretty much auto saves just prior to you entering combat prior to every fight so that if you die in combat all you lose is going back a few seconds prior to engauging the enemy allowing you to restratigies how you take on the enemy with no real lose and so there is no worry about wither or not you will fail the combat on your first try since all you will lose if you fail is about 2 seconds (quit literitally) of progress and that is it. But also with that said the combat does feel challenging enough to where at some points you are glade it auto saved right before you entered combat because you can and will die a few times trying to master the timing of dodging and parrying and riposting and stance switching to be able to win the combat, at no point does the game hold your hand and let you ""tank"" hits, some simple mobs can kill you in 2-3 hits with ease.As to wither or not if choices in the game that are suppose to have conciquences are big enough to warrent replaying I obviously can not judge yet since this is mearly a first impressions and I have not completed and restarted the game yet. But all in all the game seems worth picking up despite bad VA and aweful talking animations.My current impression is that while this game is not and will not be a ""Must Have"" title, this game will be a ""that was well worth the price point, I feel satisfied with my purchase, definitly not a game of the year material, but definitly fun regaurdless"" title. So would I recommend picking up this game? Yes, again if I get 1/2 way in and it takes a nose dive to the point of changing my opinion I will update this, but as for now I would say it seems well worth a purchase. "

												Ok, before we start, please keep in mind that Bound By Flame is developed by a small company, with limited budget. So don't expect it to be anything like Skyrim, Witcher, Dragon Age, or Dark Souls. However, developers did really good job with what they had. Honestly, I expected something far worse when I started this game, but I ended up pleasantly surprised. Pros:- Interesting story. Though I think they should've added more lore and details. Also I have a feeling that the game does not take itself serious at all, and developers did that on purposed. Overall, despite the ""dark, serious"" outline, BBF feel more like a comedy action drama than a dark gritty fantasy.- likable characters. Pretty much all characters, including Vulcan, the protagonist that you control, feel lighthearted, and funny despite being in such a chaostic world. - Decent graphic. Again, can't compare to AAA games we have today, but still pretty pleasant to look at.- Great music.- Simple, yet robust crafting system- Choices with consequences. (not as deep as Witcher or Dragon Age though)- Tough, challenging combat.Cons:- Limited character customization.- Average voice acting.- Stiff, and somewhat clunky animation.- Followers' AI need some serious improvement. They are still useful, but not as much as they should be.- ""corridors"" maps make the fantasy world feel somewhat small and underwhelming.- Rather short. Around 15 hours with most sidequests completed. Overall though, I give this a 7/10. A good game. Keep an open mind, accept it for what it is instead of comapring it with other big budget games, and you might be surprise.			"

												The dialogue and voice acting are horrible in every aspect, I could do a better female voice (and I'm a guy). The main character comes off as a complete ♥♥♥ even if you attempt to play the ""nice guy.""  (Main character: ""Hey look I just killed a giant undead, everyone praise me!"" Captain: ""Nobody cares, we are trying to survive here. Now shut up a get a move on!"") paraphrased but you get the gist.To make things even better... the main character tries to have a sense of humor that falls completely short and is horribly timed. Someone just died? Better crack a joke!The combat isn't that bad once you get the timing down, though you still have to deal with constant interrupts. Sadly the NPC followers are made of glass... they die almost instantly and are completely worthless. (The AI thinks it's a good idea for a healer/mage to stand in the center of a hoard of undead and try to cast)The crafting system is better than most AAA titles released today. The level designs are OK, they are small but decent looking. In all the game is better than most of the cookie cutter RPGs that have come out recently and they definitely made an attempt to use some new ideas. If you need something to hold you over and and have a few bucks to spare then get this game otherwards wait for the price to drop.Good:GraphicsMusicCraftingBad:Voice Acting/WritingClunky CombatWorthless CompanionsSmall Levels I would give this game a 6.5/10			"

												I am only three hours in, but I am a vet of rpgs, and I have to say this is a pleasant surprise.The combat really is solid, requring you to be both defensive and offensive and to switch between the various stances available to take on different threats. You don't directly control your companion in battle, but you do have the option of setting their behavior (offensive, defensive, healer, etc.), and they are responsive to your commands, even in mid-battle. The graphics are decent, so it won't necessarily blow you away with its visuals, but it's definitely got a lot going for it visually. The complaints about the poor lip-syncing are accurate, but I have to say the voice acting is generally spot on! And any fans of the genre know this is not always the case with this kind of title. I also think the writing is generally well done, and the story, while not wholly original, is quite solid and interesting.  Yes, the character creation options are very limited in terms of customizing your physical appearance (only five faces per gender? Really?), but I have heard that there is a robust crafting system that will at least help you to further customize your appearance through the armor and weapons you forge. I also must say the game runs very smoothly so far. No lag, even with a number of enemies on screen in full-blown combat. And I haven't run into any bugs, but I am still quiet early in the game. I would definitely recommend this title for fans of the genre. I 'll update this review if my opinion changes as I get more gametime under my belt.			"

												Deciding whether or not to buy Bound By Flame was a difficult choice. I'm a huge RPG fan, but the reviews that I read, both from professional sites and other steam users, were very mixed. Ultimately I decided to take a gamble, and thankfully I was rewarded with a game that, although flawed, is very enjoyable.The player character is Vulcan (who can be male or female), a mercenary hired to help a group of mages and Elves save the world of Vertiel from the powerful Ice Lords, and their army of undead. You've also been possessed by a fire demon.The story is entertaining but linear. You do get to make a few quest choices, but I'm not sure if your decisions actually change anything. On at least one occasion, I chose one action, only to be forced into the other action anyway. You aren't always in control of Vulcan's dialogue/personality, which can be disappointing ... I prefer *MY* character to treat people with more respect than Vulcan does. But the other characters are interesting and voice acting is quite good, however the lip syncing is poor.Combat is a similar style to the Witcher. You have two different melee styles - strong/slow or weak/fast, plus fire based offensive magic. Enemies hit hard, so there is a strong emphasis on avoiding their attacks, either by blocking or dodging, and then choosing the right moment to make your own attacks. What I really liked about the combat is there aren't any flashing icons to tell you when an enemy will attack. You have to watch their animations, for example the way they raise their sword before swinging, which feels immersive.You only have direct control of Vulcan, but can bring one companion. There are six to choose from, specialising in either melee, ranged or magic, and you can tell them whether to have an offensive or defensive style. Don't expect them to help much though. They can't die, but they get incapacitated quickly. At least they can distract enemies for a while.You can find or buy better weapons and armour, and there is also a pretty good crafting system that lets you upgrade weapons/armour to do more damage, provide fire/ice/poison resistance, or grant health/magic regeneration. You can also choose how to spread level up points between the combat styles, but you can't customise your companion's gear or level up their abilities.Level design is quite linear, not much room for exploration, but there are a decent number of side quests. It took me 17 hours to finish the game, and I think I completed the majority of quests. Control scheme works quite well with mouse and keyboard. There are some bugs, nothing game breaking, just silly things like companions getting stuck on walls (run back to their location and they should free themselves). Otherwise the technical performance was fine, even on my old GeForce GTX 580. And the music is very appropriate for the fantasy setting.Overall, Bound By Flame isn't as polished as more high profile RPGs like Dragon Age, Skyrim and the Witcher ... but lets be honest, if you're a fan of RPGs you've already played all the best ones. If you're looking for a fresh adventure, Bound By Flame is definitely worth checking out.			"

												Having just beaten it on recruit (easiest difficulty) I would say the gameplay is decent, but the story was short and unsatisfying. The combat was decent, you need to position yourself properly and time your dodges/blocks. I originally started on the normal difficulty and it was too difficult for me to dodge/parry 3-4 different mobs at the same time while trying to whittle down their hp, so I turned it down to easy. On easy, it was still a challenge, but a minor one. The primary issue I have with the combat is that going pyromancer doesn't seem viable until you get to late game. You will not have enough mana to kill all the mobs with spells for most of the game and you won't have the resources to keep getting mana pots. Leveling also doesn't seem to make you that much stronger. I seem to be fighting the same enemies from level 1-25, however the killing speed did not really increase by much.The story was ok. Some SPOILERS ahead, so read at your own risk. You only kill one of the 7 ice lords. You never even get to see the other ice lords. Also the final scene after you make your choice on what to do with the world, was extremely disappointing. You get to choose to either destroy the world or rule it. I chose to burn it with fire and destroy it, but all that happened was I absorbed the power of the world heart and then the credits. I wanted to at least see parts of the world burn or something. My biggest issue with the game was the final boss fight. Relative to all the fights before it, it was insanely difficult. I had no trouble beating the last few bosses with my daggers and dodging successfully most of the time. During the final fight, I had to switch to my crossbow and whittle the boss down from afar. You also do not have the option of leaving the area, so if you didnt have like 100+ crossbow bolts on hand or the materials to craft them you were basically screwed. Looking around on the internet, this seems to be a common problem. I was playing on Easy and his attacks did massive damage, while my fully upgraded flaming daggers barely scratched him. Add to this that his glowing daggers and the graphical effects sort of blur his dagger movements, it was very difficult for me to tell when he was going to attack. I tried about 3 times to kill him with my daggers before I gave up and just used my crossbow. Luckily I had a huge stockpile of materials to make 200 or so crossbow bolts and about 20 hp potions. I do not understand why their is such a disparity in the difficulty between this boss and all the others. I can understand if this occurred on the hardest difficulty or something, because beating him with melee on easy probably requires you to have the skills to be able to beat the game on hard. Therefore forcing a less competent player like me to use cheap ranged tactics.Overall the game is not terrible, but I definitely would not recommend it. The gameplay was decent but a little difficult for the average gamer. The story was decent, but I was left very unsatisfied. The last boss fight was horribly designed and there is a good chance it will cause you to ragequit.One particularly annoying issue that I forgot to mention. For whatever reason, when selling/crafting things, you cannot input the number that you want. You have to click the increase or decrease arrows. This was very frustrating when i I was trying to craft 100 bolts or sell my 400 raw metal pieces. If you just hold the increase button, it will very slowly increase one at a time. Not a big issue, but very annoying.			"

												I've only played it for 1.5 hours so far but the first 10 minutes was all I needed to know if I like this or not. The game is amazing and I am finding it very fun especially the combat. I've never seen a rogue style play so well. It just feels nicer than any other game at least from a rogue stance. I find myself using this stance more than anything so far. Mostly because it is fast and I prefer that.Voice acting is terrible, but I don't care about that, it's not enough to put me off. Everything else is great and I look forward to playing more.			"

YouTube™ Video: Bound By Flame Gameplay Walkthrough w/ agentc0re - Part 1 - Giant ♥♥♥ Jugger-Skele-Naut Thing

			★★My Blind Gameplay / Walkthrough / Let's Play of Bound By Flame. This is like a fast paced Dark Souls game. The Story is kwerky and the dialogue is...off but it still makes for an interesting RPG.		

This is a post review of my Let's Play Video posted above.  Pro's and Con's will be listed last.So far I'm really enjoying the game.  The combat is super fun.  It does require you to learn how to use certain skills to your advantage which prevents you from just being able to be button mash king.  You do mash on the attach alot, but there is skill behind when to attack.  Very similar to Dark Souls but much more fast paced.The game starts out with some wonderful cut scenes that are enjoyable to watch.  The graphics in the game aren't anything special but they are NOT an eye sore.  I personally enjoy that middle ground and like the way this game looks.  The control of your character is very fluid and feels natural.  Combat took me a bit to adjust to since i'm use to playing dark souls.  I find myself mashing away at the triggers when i need to mash my buttons.  Nothing against the game here, just want to point it out.  The game gives you a fairly good introduction in how to operate in the game.  It removes the 'have to read the manual' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  The first boss you come across is challenging similarly to dark souls bosses.  Lots of little annoyances running around preventing you from doing the end goal.  I have found the story to be lacking so far.  The dialogueis really bad too, not really well lip sync'dPro'sLooks GoodControls feel naturalGood Starting Tutorial sectionCon'sStoryLip SyncVoice actingdialogueOver all i think this is going to be a fun game with some qwerks about it that will probably be funny throughout the playthough.

												well the game is hard as ♥♥♥♥ which is a nice change of pace, but sometimes cheap.  The voice acting reminds me of postal 2 which may not be a good thing considering the calibur of the game.  The graphics are pretty amazing, minus the mouth movement when people talk.  So far I'm enjoying it.  Be careful with point allocation - haven't found a way to respec if there is one.  You can get followers, but really the only one worth it is Sybil which can heal.  I'll be honest.  I can recommend it because I like the story, graphics and creature design, but it's definintely not for everybody.  If bound by flame and kingdoms of amalur would make a love child it would be the perfect game as it can take the best parts of both of these games.  Just a small suggestion to make the game much better - allow two companions to follow you. 1 is not enough and only having one means you're only going to have the healer as its the default go to choice.**added info**Okay so I put more time into the game.  As I started getting more money I was able to better craft my gear and even make potions which are not readily available early in the game.  I've been switching out followers and experimenting.  While Sybil is a good healer and offensive mage, others seem to be quite nice as well, again, as long as you can keep up the healing.  The story is getting more interesting and its very dark and has a nice gothic touch.  I'll continue to update as I go along.**edit**Ok so I beat the game awhile back and it was very fun.  As I started to learn the mechanics other companions started to seem more beneficial.  The game is great and I'm currently going for a 2nd go.			"

												This game has really challenging Fights and Bossfights that could have come straight out of the dark souls series. Bosses may be the icing but Fights against normal enemies arent a walk in the park either. The Crafting and Weapon-customization is well done and not to difficult, while still being complex. Dialogs may seem static, but they are well writen and quite funny at times.Although Graphics and animations arent mindblowingly amazing they are not bad either.So in summary:+ difficult but fair Combat+ really good Bossfights+ usefull Customization+ entertaining Dialogs+ good (but not superb) visuals- combat animations arent that good- not really innovative A grear game i could recommend to someone who seeks a challenging game.

												I wasn't sure about getting this game... mixed reviews, cinematics that look too good to reflect gameplay etc. but I wanted to give it a try as the concept intruiged me!Im about half-way through the game while im posting this and so far I think the game is both great and somewhat lacking in some respects. So lest start with the good points...1. The graphics are pretty good with creative environments and weather effects.2. A Good variety of armour looks and customising options3. cool mix of combat styles (setting your sword on fire always makes the arm hair stand on end!)4. Interesting storyline from what i've seen so far and the Daemon's dialogue I think is particularly well done.So those are just some of the things I quite like about this game so far, I hope these dont change for the worse!Now for my picky points which both frustrate and disappoint me...1. The laziness of animations - you enter a new area and think wow look at this scenery, then you see the 'frozen' character standing close by pretending to be doing something important of giving depth to the game. I think this is awful in terms of creating a believable environment and frankly is kinda of lazy. The least they could do is breathe even if the animation is poor.2. Combat - This is the first game i've come across where heavy weapons (2H) are completely useless and more often than not end up getting you killed! Clearly logic dictates that a two-handed sword does less damage than 2 small daggers... it does in this game anyway. If you want to focus on melee the only sensible option is to go for the rogue line, at least thats what seems to work for me. I find the boss fights great personally but the frustration at times trying to avoid an aoe from out of nowhere makes you want to cry.3. Companions - the only real use ive found for them is being bait for enemies as most of the time the damage they do is woefully inadequate... the boss fights are more comic than anything watching them attempt to block a knock-down strike! This is still a game I'd recommend for people to try though, maybe not at its full price though.7/10			"

												This review is based off of an hour of gameplay. But trust me, it's enough time to review it.I'll break this down in a really simplistic way.Pros:- You can pointlessly name your character so everyone can call you a 'nickname' you didn't choose.- Customisable character.- You can have a beard.- The ""Man Bun"" is in fashion right now in Britain so that's a plus.- Character models are in 3D.- There is audio.- At least some small degree of effort has been made to produce this game.- When I bought this game it was ♥♥♥♥ing cheap as ♥♥♥♥.Cons:- Graphics are poor.- The voice acting is about as stale as a fart trapped in a 30 year old couch. Plus the amount of swearing/cursing so far is beyond contrived and forced. It's like they wanted to be edgey and cool. Instead they should have concentrated on making the overall dialogue more believable. Ironclad warriors speaking like 1990s gangbangers in crime thriller movie. It's so ♥♥♥♥ing bad.- The combat controls and feels like something from the PS1. Well, no, that's not fair on the Playstation. It suffered from hardware limitations of the time, Bound by Flame doesn't. It suffers from the poor choices of it's developers, cutting corners and doing nothing new.- The skill tree is boring and mundane. Pointless small increases in percentages that are not even noticable.- Cliché after cliché. I feel like I've played this game 20 times already it's that predictable.    The story that I've trudged through thus far is about as original as a salted peanut.   The character design is boring, recylced and done to death. Red haired, bearded, vulgar mercenaries with poorly attempted Scottish accents. Maybe you Americans don't care about authenticity in your accents, but I certainly do. I honestly don't know what else I can say about Bound By Flame other than it's awful. You'd be better off playing with your toes than this piece of ♥♥♥♥. Save your pennies, buy yourself dinner and forget this game exists.			"

												An Action RPG that does some things well, and others....not so much.I haven't gotten too far so I'm still a bit wet behind the ears when it comes to this game, but so far the combat is fun. Not extremely deep, but fun. Controls are a bit clunky. You seem to have 2 main stances (warrior and ranger) that have their advantages/disadvantages, in both modes you can shoot your crossbow and use magic. However I'm finding Ranger to be more fun and its much faster paced. I will say the combat is a bit difficult, not dark souls (its not trying to be either), but difficult. (there are 4 difficulty settings if it feels a bit too hard)Graphics are good, especially the lighting. The textures on some world and actors are a bit wanting though.Story is a bit confusing. (again, not that far though) Lip sync is awful, but I looked past it in Of Orcs and Men, so I'll look past it again.Overall, so far its a very good ARPG, especially considering I was able to pre-order for 25 over at GMG. From what I hear its a bit short for an RPG (20-30 hours) but your mileage may vary. Seems to have a little replayability at least because you do have to make story altering choices in the course of the game.Pick it up now if you don't mind looking past a few faults for a very good ARPG, or wait till it hits about the $25-30 mark somewhere. This is one of the better ARPGs to come down the pipeline for a while.P.S. As of now, don't use the Ultra Shadow settings, put to high. Not much diffrence and you will have a massive boost in fps.

												A fun ARPG with a pretty average story. Pretty fun for what it is, however the final boss breaks the game to the point where you shouldn't even bother starting it. If you don't have enough health potions, gold etc. for the final boss before you enter, you are stuck and can not beat the game without bashing your head against the brick wall known as the final boss for hours. Don't even bother getting this game, the very average journey is not worth it to not finish the game because of an unbalanced broken final boss.			"

												A solid middle market game. As someone who went into this game with zero expectations and prior knowledge (and a price tag of $20.00), I was very suprised at how pleasant of an experience this was. The budget was *clearly* small, as illustrated by the production values. But even with that, they've managed to have a great and varied crafting system, a unique soundtrack, and a 'Witcher meets Baldur's Gate' inspired combat that's rewarding in its own way. I'll mirror other complaints about the horrible voice acting and script, but it's far from stopping this game from being enjoyable.I will say, keep a few things in mine; the game is short, pick it up when it drops below $20. The final boss is a dozzy, so do not go into it without 100s of potions.			"

Bound by Flame - Pixel Judge reviewThe VerdictThe long and the short of it folks, is that Bound by Flame is a spectacular game. It came along with a few minor bugs, none of which were gamebreaking, and all are easily rectified by making minor changes in the config file. The issues that kept Spiders’ previous offering from true greatness are (almost) entirely fixed and absolutely everything has been improved. There’s still a ways to go, and a larger budget is still clearly needed for Spiders to hit their full potential, but it really is just a matter of time.Score: 4/5 - A beautiful work of art.Full review and appeals - http://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/bound-by-flame/ "

												The fighting is challenging but not frustrating. The combat is simplistic in a good way, and yet not boring or repeatative. The enemies when in groups of variety  make the combat fun and difficult. The enemies combos and attack pauses make them less predictable and add variety. The graphics and animations are smooth and well done. The envirorments are beautiful with dynamic lighting. I get a feel of ""The Witcher2"" in the combat and the overall game. It also has a slow time combat skill menu almost like ""Mass Effect"" or ""Dragon Age"". The armor and art style is ""my cup of tea"". The voice acting is just ok and the mouth animations don't match the characters lips to well. The story is nothing that will suck you in. Overall a great game, especially for $40. ""Bound By Flame"" was a lot better than I expected. If you like an action based RPG, then ""Bound By Flame"" is defiantly for you.			"

												So I got this game for Preorder on GOG for about $25. I'd say it was worth it, but I definitely wouldn't pay $40 for it. The graphics are -awesome-, the soundtrack is great and unique, and despite what others say I liked the characters quite a bit (although the primary is obviously a Shepard clone). I enjoyed the combat as well, although the lack of depth creates redundancy in the later part of the game.  The worst thing about this game is the length. There are seven Ice Lords and the game ends somewhat abruptly after defeating just one (who was a cakewalk btw). The final boss, while cool, has a RIDICULOUS difficulty spike which is jarring as hell. The story also seemed a bit convoluted at the end.   Let me reiterate that really did like the characters, story, and voice acting, and was actually disappointed that more content wasn't there for them to be fleshed out more. I loved the main character, Shepard clone or not. There are just enough decisions in the game to make you feel like you have some influence, although the whole ""choose your demon or humanity"" thing is ONE decision that you make early in the game, and you're pretty much stuck with it. Ultimately Bound By Flame never quite reached it's potential.  It's as though you're constantly teased with this awesome new universe that you get to see about ten percent of. I was ready to play it for another twenty hours or more!  Although I enjoyed it all the way through, there are some glaring issues that hinder the experience. Despite that, I do recommend it at a certain price point.			"

												A quick hint of honesty...Although I've not played it that much the controls are very very broken (and I've played Risen on a console and liked it!)  It's just far to slow to react to blocking, allowing the enemies to hit you, when 2 or more enemies you're pretty much screwed as they will contantly attack you.  Even the normal controls out of combat feel broken and like you're trying to drive a 3 wheel car, there's no fluidity just feels jaged, even when sucessful in combat something just doesn't feel rightMust say I expected FAR more from this... There's also something about the atmosphere that feels unfinished.

												Another decent entry in Spiders' catalog of slightly wonky RPG games. The graphics, controls, presentation, and sound are all done quite well. The voiceacting is pretty decent, and most of the dialogue is written well enough (there are some eye-rollers though).The combat system is well done, although by the end of the game the ""trash mobs"" sort of became a trudge and I was getting tired of it. It's similar to Witcher 2's combat, except with less rolling and enemies that have a lot more health. The skill trees and perk system are all well done, and the menus are all easily navigatable and function well.The story was... questionable. It seems like it's going to be a lot grander than it is, and ends up being sort of lackluster. The characters aren't really overflowing with personality, or rather they just don't really have the time to be fleshed out. Don't expect to come to know these characters like you would in Mass Effect 2 or something. The decisions you make along the way are sort of arbitrary and really don't change much of the story apart from how demon-y you look.All that aside, it really wasn't bad. I think I still prefered Of Orcs and Men better, but this was an enjoyable enough romp.			"

												If the Witcher and Kingdoms of Amalur had a defective baby this would be it. No picking classes, no open world and the customization system and crafting is very simple but the story is ok. (A lot of the NPC are cocky) The character details are really good, The music in the game is great but none of it is that innovative or imaginative. What will make me finish the game is the story and combat.			"

												Great combat style and gameplay, but the whole story lasts for less than 10 hours, and the final cutscene lasts 10 seconds, a huge disapointment. Also there is almost no notable interactions with the characters and although there could have been 7 main bosses they went for just lord blackfrost because of an obvious lack of budget.

												This game has been on my radar for some time. I was worried about difficulty of the game and the fact that reviews were not to optimistic; however, the game was not as difficult as I imagined and I was able to finish it quite quickly. Game story is great and the atmosphere of the game feels like combination of Risen or Witcher. There is no thievery mechanics but combat is quite nice especially as a ranger/pyromancer combo. The game is quite linear but it has tons of side quests to keep you occupied. I bought it on 75% sale at $9.99 and I can say it is worth every penny.

												I've liked all of spider studios previous games and gave this one a chance despite so many negative reviews. Boy were they right. This game is so horribly balanced it's inexcusable. Spider's games have always been hard but fair, but this one doesn't feel right. Obtaining materials to upgrade your gear to decent levels takes a lot of grinding. You also feel incredibly weak throughout the entire game. You will need 10+ hits to kill enemies while they can kill you in 3-4. Not to mention multiple enemies can hit you at once to 1-shot you, and if you are not killed outright you are stunlocked. Conversely, you can be meleeing an archer in the face, while he still draws his bow and shoots you point blank without flinching.			"

												It tries to be more than what it is and then falls on its face from the first minute.At the start you go through a cutscene of your character having a stupid monologue provided by the most boring voice you can imagine while fighting some undead, that it would have been a really nice tutorial but nah, boring cutscene. While that is going on, I couldn't help but notice the environment that I was in. It looks nothing like the screenshots. It was ugly and washed out. I am not sure if something was wrong with my game itself but too late to check now.After you get to talk to some people and notice how non-existant the lip syncing is and how the game would have been better WITHOUT those ""cinematic"" cutscenes. At least an option to turn them off or something and let the camera stay behind your character would have helped a great deal. Not having to see the akwardness would have worked. Funny thing is that when you talk to NPCs without cutscenes you see exactly that, the game been better.Then the combat starts... It's never a good sign when you want the combat of a game to end so you can do something else. It's stiff, boring and slow. No feeling of impact whatsoever. The enemies, even on the normal difficulty are annoyingly tough. Even Dark Souls got that part right, where only SOME enemies are tough, not all of them.I felt I had seen enough after that.			"

												Fun game with great graphics. Pretty simple game but l did enjoy it. If you like mindless thrid person action RPG's that are not to hard you will like this. l also liked the dialogue being like a bad 'B' movie. If you don't take it to seriously you will enjoy the humour. I thought that the immortal character that joins you in the end reminds me of the assasin droid in the KTOR. Just plain funny. The last boss had a really hard difficulty spike but once l checked on online on how to beat it was very easy but cheap. But still it was cheap to have the last boss be so damn hard and l would not have seen the ending if the cheat of using your traps. I beat all the bosses without any traps but to have to use the traps for the final boss was definately cheap in my books. The good ending was entertaining as well. Lastly the music and song were pretty cool.			"

												THESE ARE MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS. I've finished the prologue and am working on Chapter 1 at the moment.Oh, Bound By Flame. This was the biggest draw to me out of the Spiders Studios RPG pack, always being a fan of multiclassing action-RPGs. Unfortunately, it has quite a rough start. I decided to play the hardest difficulty, expecting the mechanics to be similar to Dark Souls. Rather, the game starts you forced into the ""tank"" role for the first third of the tutorial - not a good thing for those like me who like to play rogues and pick how I play the whole time.Secondly, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t difficulty. You go from the spectre tutorial to getting destroyed by a crossbow ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the span of ten minutes. I had to turn down the difficulty once to even get past this encounter with the Ranger role. Then in the first boss fight, I kept getting cheap-shotted; whenever I died, the game respawned me in the Warrior role, despite having been in the Hunter role when I saved, so I had to spend a precious second getting stuck with crossbow bolts while I pulled my daggers out. Because of this, I had to switch to the easiest difficulty, just to make things FAIR.The second area seems to be better though; there are no annoying enemies with shields who are near impossible to hit with the Hunter role, and I actually have a party member. Hopefully things will continue to look up.EDIT:So, I've gotten to what appears to be the end of Act 1, and... I plan to take a long, long break from this game. I tend to like mediocre games; I love Quest 64, Final Fantasy XIII (at least what I've played of it), and other games people view as ""... meh,"" but this game... It's just boring. The dialog isn't interesting, the combat is fun for all of ten minutes past the tutorial, and it doesn't even look all that pretty (of course, it's a great looker for an indie studio going for a realistic vibe). It's a poor man's Dragon Age II, for more than the game it tries to ape costs. Just pick DA2 up on Origin. I might return to finish this... At some point, but for now, it doesn't seem likely.			"

												Over all I would have to give this game a negative rating. I liked it, I really did. It has some awesome moments, but the Cons really outweigh the Pros the more you go through the game.Pros:Fun to play.A good idea vs the usual bash/slash em up.Nice graphics with no stuttering or tearing.Adult content.OK load times - when changing into an indoor/outdoor area there might be a few seconds or a load screen - but large zones with max graphics at 1080p run beautifully. Textures maybe could have used a touch more work.Old School map system - Think Ancient Evil/Diablo overlays - that can be turned on or off.Movies are well done and look amazing.Cons:Combat system is really based for a Controller - reminded me of Assassins Creed series - Complicated to start with and frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it gets to be very intuative.Poor quest Info screen - needs more detail.Voice acting is a bit wooden, but not as bad as some reviewers are making out.Ranger is NOT a ranger - It's a melee rogue. And not a very good one at that. Even with all my level up points spent in Ranger tree, on EVERY boss so far I've had to switch to Warrior to take them - Even with no points in Warrior tree, it still kicks ♥♥♥♥.NPC's are unlovable and probably a bit stupid. A number of times they stop randomly and forget to assist you in combat. Sometimes you are made to take a certain group member with you, then you run into another quest where you have to have a different group member to complete the second quest and they may or may not show up for you - if they do, you may then need to run all the way back to camp and get the original member back. Or you may not - I've had it happen both ways after loading a save where I died.Long intro that can't skipped. Gets a bit boring when you decide to try a different base character type.Few ""nice"" options - You are either an a.r.s.e.h.o.l.e., a egotistical a.r.s.e.h.o.l.e. or a uncaring b.a.s.t.a.r.d. Which I guess makes sense considering you have some type of fire demon in you - but what's the excuse for the times you have to make the choice BEFORE you are possessed?Enemies are very repeatative and seem to be DPS sponges with Very good AC. I think they are supposed to be scaled to start with but as you progress thier AC gains a lot more points then you do and thier damage increases a lot faster then yours. They also are pretty much the same all the way through - not a lot of new ones as you progress - maybe 4 or 5 new ones in chapter 2.The skill tree upgrades are very poor, basically adding only interrupts or raising skills by very minimal amounts.I think the combat mechanics were planned to be a lot more then what they are - Interrupts are not complete and pauses are added in the skill trees for you to complete ripostes or such but there seems to be no controls that allow you - basically you just spam your mouse button or Q for a good kick.While the skill tree gives you these upgrades you don't learn any new moves or combos. You basically know everything to start with - mouse 1 = quick slash of 1 of 3 varieties that work in a chain, mouse 2 = AOE slash that runs as a chain - it can be interupted. Q will give you a kick, if you do it at the right time/direction maybe you get a flying knee to their face.The ranger tree (rogue) is fairly useless and I'd skip it totally.The Pyromancer tree (Magic) is nice to boost your warrior skills (flaming blade is a great dmg boost to your regular attack and really needed in every fight), but alone it's terrible.It seems the game really does wish to make you focus on the Trapping/Crossbow aspect (it is apparently your specialty), but gives almost no gear for ages compared to standard Melee, and even when it does, it's pretty weak. There are very few upgrades to it and after about halfway thru chapter 2, I gave up using traps completely.The game really feels unfinished and while i'm still working on completing it, I can't see it being a game that I'd replay.Interaction with some NPC's will sometimes give you quest dialogues before you even get the quest. EG - I was speaking to a Red Scribe, trying to find out if he was a vendor and A quest dialogue popped up regarding a traitor that I was apparently looking for... Huh?!? Then I spoke to the general and he told me he suspected there was a traitor and could I look for him? Ahhh... OK..Unfortunately that was't the only time either. Spoilers right?No option to respec yout skill trees - means if you make a mistake you have to start all over again or load an earlier game.Quests can be random fails sometimes and if you don't multisave you can't go back and fix it.Look, over all, it's a solid start to a game and I'm enjoying it - I'm about to finish chapter 2 and I'll continue playing it if only to see it finished.If you like a good warrior hack and slash with a bit of fire thrown randomly in various directions - it's worth the Killer 7 Bundle from Bundlestars or I'd wait until it's under $5.If you like plaing a Ranger (Bows etc) or a game with cool magic - Save your dosh. It's not that kind of game.5/10 Dragons.Run on 6600K/16GB RAM/AMD R9 380 Dual X.			"

												Recommendation - Worth a playthrough if you're a big fan of RPGs.Rating - 61/100The best way I can describe this game is rough around the edges. It looks like it's trying to copy Dark Souls, feels like it's trying to copy Kingdoms of Amalur, and sounds like it's trying to copy a 1st draft of some prequel to A Song of Ice and Fire. If you can ignore some fairly glaring flaws, there are a few things to love here, just don't go in expecting the best RPG you've ever played.In Bound by Flame (BBF) you are a member of a mercenary group protecting some scribes as they travel to complete a magic ritual. The ritual backfires, forcing a demon to share your body, and you are then tasked with travelling across the world to help stop an army of deadwalkers (think White Walkers from Game of Thrones) from taking over the world. The story is nothing ground-breaking, but it's interesting enough.To start with the things I liked, I found the graphics well-done (until you get right up next to certain things), the story was interesting (even if it was resolved poorly), I liked how the world was ostensibly linear with a bit of side-questing, the simple crafting system was very well-done, and the 1-on-1 combat was quite satisfying.Where I found this game to have failings were in the areas of dialog/acting, group combat, unlikeable characters, TERRIBLE final boss fight, and everyone in camp (including vendors) being completely useless.I have to start with the dialog and voice acting, because they are the crown jewels on the side-crapsalad that this game brings to the table. They are amazingly atrocious, and even though I was laughing at how so-bad-it's-good it was at first, it eventually fell through the floor into plain old inexcusably bad. The dialog sounds like it was written by an 11-year-old trying to be edgy, and the voice acting is so stilted, sloppy, uneven, and messy, that it sounds like it was recorded in a booth completely isolated from every single aspect of production. The cadence that the lines are delivered with makes no sense, and no conversation in the history of the universe would EVER flow the way some of them in this game do. I can't even remember how many times I said some variation of ""...are you serious?"" while listening to the dialog. It's trying far too hard to be edgy, too. I have no problem with profanity and sarcasm, when they fit in the context of the discussion. This game, however, seems to think that just randomly throwing in various adult words and giving everyone a bad attitude will make the dialog more adult-themed, too. Everyone (you included) is a sarcastic ♥♥♥ to everyone else. It's incredibly distracting, and given the wooden acting as well, the whole thing just seems childish. Moments that should be loaded with sad emotion fall completely flat, and moments of triumph or happiness are completely spoiled by poorly-acted sarcasm. It's worth mentioning that I played through with a female character, so maybe the male voice actor is better. Personally, I was rolling my eyes from literally line 1, and I actively disliked my own sarcastic jerk of a character and the condescending demon inside her the second they opened their mouths.While I did legitimately enjoy the one-on-one combat (dodging and parrying were very satisfying to pull off), group combat just ends up being a gigantic frustrating mess. The combat in this game is much more fast-paced than something like Dark Souls, so whereas you could get an attack off against a group of 3 enemies before having to block/dodge/retreat in DS, in BBF, 2 of those 3 enemies will already be swinging before you're even within striking distance, so dodge-dodge-dodge (which only works straight backwards, by the way). If you can peel enemies away from the group to fight them solo, then no problem, but if they refuse to unclump thanks to the cramped combat arenas, prepare for the fight to consist of 98% dodging. That is, unless you've been upgrading the magic, or have been building TONS of crossbow bolts. I didn't focus on those, so I can't say for sure. The un-upgraded magic is a joke and a half.Speaking of combat, the companions you can bring along are borderline useless, and the only purpose they serve is temporary meat shield. Plus, there are far too many of them to be able to form any actual attachment with over the course of this short game, so the only emotion you're likely to feel when they die (and they will) is annoyance at having even more enemies focused on you. They do have personal side quests and romance options, but everything is so brief and shoe-horned in that it feels completely meaningless.While we're on the topic of meaningless, a lot of the ""choices"" you can make in the game are the same way. It's classic Telltale syndrome: Making you think you're making meaningful choices, when in reality, the only things changing are superficial surface-level nonsense. Case in point, 2 companions are arguing over how to carry out the next step of the mission, with completely different and serious outcomes. One says do A, the other says do B. You choose to do A, the B-companion gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and leaves, and you end up having to do both A and B anyway. The choice was never about any meaningful quests, or actions in the story, it was about which companion leaves the party, a consequence that really makes no difference whatsoever. The story unfolds the exact same either way. The only thing in the entire game that can really change (other than your looks and the sound of your voice) is the ending, based on whether you allowed the demon to take over or not. Don't worry, though, the ending is unsatisfying no matter what. Crap might be a better word.Good luck getting to the ending, though. The final fight is such a MASSIVELY drastic jump in difficulty that, according to Steam achievements, only half the people who beat the immediately-preceding boss ended up beating the final boss, and only half of THEM did it at anything but the lowest difficulty. It is a tedious, unrelenting slog of a fight against an impossibly-strong, test-of-patience of a boss. In the world of horrible final bosses, Bound by Flame is a strong contender for the heavyweight belt. God help you if you're a completionist who gets frustrated by difficulty spikes.Overall, this game was entertaining enough for me to play through to the end, but only just. If you can pick it up on a decent sale, and you're dying for a new story-driven RPG, it might be worth taking a look, but if you're like me and find it hard to overlook little things as they slowly pile up, well then you might want to put this down a bit lower on your priority list.

												Wait for it to go on sale.This is basically a budget version of The Witcher, complete with a number of the frustrations from that title and more.It's not a *bad* game.  You might even find it fun.  I'm not saying it isn't reasonably enjoyable.The graphics are ok, just nothing to get excited over.But are plenty of bugs as well as a number of very frustrating mechanics that are just very, very poorly thought out.Oh...also the voice acting is somewhat inconsistent and the writing is 3rd rate and trope laden.Honestly, I'm not sure what I was expecting after Mars: War Logs.  The combat was mediocre, clumsy, and outdated in that game.  It's a bit smoother here, but what we have is a quantitative improvement in a bad design, when what was needed was a qualitative shift to something that well...doesn't kind of suck.This is a $10-15 dollar game with a $40 dollar price tag.

												I finished the game a while ago, and now I feel a need to write a review before uninstalling the game to free some space on my hard drive.So, where do I start... This game is: mostly interesting, quite challenging, varied, rewarding, somewhat annoying, nice-looking, not quite polished, stable, fairly repetitive.Story, atmosphere, charactersThe story was fine by me. The premise is fairly standard (the world that is being overwhelmed by the forces of evil, and you have to stop it - we saw it countless times), but the specifics (what kind of evil it is, and why you) are intriguing. There were a few twists in the story, but they didn't change the overall direction at all. There is the ""light path"" and the ""dark path"", but, as far as I understand, you'll do pretty much the same things during the game regardless of the path you take; this influences the ending, though.The characters were fine, as well. Not awfully deep, but presented well, and memorable to some extent. They had quite a few things to tell about the world, too. The narrative was uneven: sometimes it went well, but in other places (notably near the end) it became abrupt and lacking. The overall atmosphere and world presentation were good and fitting to the story events.CombatOne of my biggest complaints is the uneven difficulty of the game. At the beginning of the game (after the prologue), the enemies were overwhelming (far more difficult than the mid-game bosses!), later my character gained some skills and things started to become increasingly easy (with some notable exceptions). At some point, I could almost forget about tactics and precise timing of blocks/evades (something that was absolutely necessary at the beginning) and just start running/jumping around with some degree of target prioritizing (kill archers first) and spatial awareness (keep dangerous melee enemies at a distance). And bosses... The first one (from the prologue) was ok, the second one was quite a challenge. The penultimate one was a joke (I beat him on the first try without breaking a sweat), and the final one was more like a hopeless battle (though the atmosphere was brilliant. And that music!).The other complaint is how the battles dragged on in mid-game. The reason is that my melee weapons did annoyingly little damage, so I had to chop enemies for a long time before they fell. The crossbow did very little damage as well, which made it pretty much useless because of its limited (albeit craftable) ammunition. Also, there were too much battles that were almost exactly like each other.Companions were not very useful. As many reviews stated, they tend to die too easily. They are not entirely useless, though: healing and crowd control spells were convenient and/or interesting, and sometimes a companion could even do non-negligible damage if I managed to keep enemies on me. Anyway, they are there mostly for story purposes. :)Despite all of this, the combat was actually fun enough. In extreme cases, the enemies could kill me literally in two strikes, and it was quite rewarding when I (as a player) finally learned to deal with them. Having two combat stances with distinctly different features was certainly a good idea (though it didn't work very good for me). Also, I don't usually like traps, but here they were a viable (though difficult) method of combat - and in some cases, pretty much necessary (hint: the final boss).The amount of travels was a bit too much (especially with respawning enemies), but manageable.Quests, development, replayabilityThe quantity and quality of quests was certainly above what I would expect in Action RPG. (This didn't last very long, though: near the end the quests were less numerous and more boring.) There are even the romance options, but I failed to encounter them. :)Character development is interesting, but controversial. Some skills seemed to be too unsignificant (like, +10% damage), while the others were quite important (evasion skills). There are three skill trees: warrior, ranger (more like rogue) and pyromancer. Warrior and ranger skills mostly affect their corresponding combat stances, while pyromancer skills deal with fire magic. There is also a set of perks (or something like this) that are purchased with separate points.I concentrated on ranger skills with a healthy addition of warrior and pyromancer skills. I know it's entirely possible to level up as warrior or pyromancer, but from my ranger perspective I can hardly imagine it: warrior looks too vulnerable without evasion, and pyromancer looks too weak because magic doesn't do that much damage while mana is in short supply. So I'd expect a very different combat gameplay if I were to replay the game with a different skill set.Equipment is numerous, and you can craft upgrades for it. For armour, this works good enough: you become increasingly well-protected throughout the game, and you can (and should) play with different resistances (hint: choose universal ""magic resistance"" whenever you can). For weapons, not so much: I acquired some daggers somewhere in the middle of the game, and everything that I could find later was on par with them, with little variations like damage vs. critical chance. Maybe this is specific to rangers, to balance out their survivability; maybe warrior and pyromancer scale better damage-wise. I don't know.Technical aspectsFrom the technical point of view, the game is decent; I don't remember having considerable issues with graphics, sound, performance or interface. The graphics was quite pretty to my taste, but your mileage may vary.ConclusionGet this game, if you enjoy difficult and varied combat, and can deal with a few gameplay shortcomings. Or if you enjoy straightforward fantasy stories, like to learn things about in-game worlds, and don't mind a good deal of somewhat repetitive combat along the way.			"

												I played this game soon after its release,but didn't have enough persistence to finish it,so I got back to the game recently and finished it. What's good in Bound by Flame? In my opinion the best thing about this game is graphics.It's detailed and looks a bit like comics.The game has also good fighting system. Unfortunately the level construction is linear as hell,the plot is a one,big cliché(I counted that it will be great,but every next event revealing veiled things was just next disappointment,especially the ending) with just a few decisions(referring to the world) to make,changing the events in the 2nd chapter,but it's nothing big IMO.Also the dialogues are bad,really bad.5.5/10If you want to play this game,then I recommend you to buy it on some sale,because it's not worth its full price in my opinion.

												So when first looking at the game, it doesn't look like it could be that bad. That was my thinking initially, until I realized that the archers are virtually impossible to avoid, the bosses are predictable and boring, the combat is repetitive as HELL. For example, the only real good way to deal damage throughout most of the game is to use the daggers, and you can play 100% of the game that way, never putting any points into the sword skills. The thing that really gets to me is the voice acting is horrible, the female main character is not worth playing at all, unless you have the audio muted all the time. It's just so flat, reading off of the script for the first time sort of work that makes me cringe. The crafting can be pretty interesting, to customize the weapons you get with different pommels and hilts, but I never saw the extra effects being useful very much.			"

												As much fun as this game can be (and there are parts that I like a lot) the combat system is driving me insane. The idea behind the system seems to be some kind of scripted combat but it just doesn't work for me.Attacks can't be changed or adapted to new circumstances, half of the time I'm hitting at enemies which aren't there anymore. Even little buggers regulary kill me even on the easiest difficulty setting when they can gang up on me. Most of the times I can't even tell who or what killed me. Bolts or spellpoints for ranged combat are rare, so missile attack can not be used regulary.Could be that this game is not for me (or that I'm too stupid) but for me this (not very inspired but yet very entertaining game) is completely ruined by the combat system.

												Quick breakdown but simply put, don't buy. Gameplay is bland, combat is either dumb down and repetitive or unfair and unrewarding. They have tried copying Dark Souls etc. with hard gameplay but forgot to be tough but fair and you are often fighting enemies who seem god like which little options other than to run around throwing things in the hope you don't get hit by some form of heat seeking laser. Combat is not rewarding and you fight the same 3 enemy types through your entire 10 hour or less time playing this game to 100%. The story is boring and is more of a nod your head and go scenario, you're a merc who just nods your head to what people tell you with not personality other than swearing every third word like a 13 year old mid puberty. There is no companion interaction of any kind that you could call interaction, there is no story lines etc. There is a romance, it consists of 2 lines of text and a quickie infront of an old stone with 1 of two characters on the premise that one's a ♥♥♥♥ and the other than daddy issue's (seriously, that is the case they even tell you themselves and it's updated like that in your diary).The alignment shifting? It's not alignment and it's not shifting. You make a choice at the end of every chapter whether or not you want the buff to make you more powerful or do you do the nice guy thing that normally ends in the deaths of thousands of people, it's not a good or evil shift and the morphs consist of funny eyes, small horns, 4 small horns and black face and 2 small, 2 big and black skin, the last of which occurs 3 minutes before the final and dissapointing boss fight. Your companions and others do mention these changes... twice... one sentence each. Crafting becomes your weapon, it's rather simple but fact is the combat is so unbalanced you'll find your self selling everything that you don't use (not that you need it, combat boils down to using spells, running till mana is back, then repeat) and then changing gold into ingrediants and those into health and mana potions. I found i spent 2 hours during final boss fight, about 40 minutes of that was going to and from the crafting menu mid fight to spam making potions. It's dull, simplistic  and you can make potions out of thin air and gold. The skill tree is cool but with 25 levels,  you basically can entirely max 2 tree's but that said you can't fight like you want. The game is designed to force you to play how they want you to play, want to be a tank? No shield exists and half of all enemies have to be fought with magic or with the daggers, only the weak and basic enemies are fightable with the sword unless you can perfect their ""spam button"" parry system which is unbalanced. Much like Dark Souls there is a parry and riposte to allow you to break an attack and counter, combat consists of fighting 4-5 enemies wailing at you and during this animation you will 50% die before the end of it during the slow motion animation of the counter where his 3 friends have been hitting you for 1/3 you're health a piece. Overall, bad story, bad combat and mechanics. All the pictures for this you see above? Thats the end boss twice, and the other bosses in the game. The big roaring guy? He's the only one you meet and acts as a prologue boss. They are all cutscenes.			"

												This game is not for the faint of heart. I just beat is and only broke one controller to do it. If you want a challenge, this is your game, if you want to enjoy yourself, play on easy, it will still be hard. A controller is a must, the keyboard is just too difficult.The story was okay, there are a lot of times when you have to make a choice whether to give the demon inside you more room or not, ultimately in the end it makes no difference as you get two choices, for two final cutscenes and some achievements. The gameplay was what kept me going, its a lot like the dark souls games in that its very rewarding to win a tough fight, which is most fights. You can use two handed weps and dual daggers. I never once used two handed weps as they felt very limiting to your movement. Also, upgrade you crossbow, you'll be glad you did.Overall I would give the game a 6/10, just enough to recommend it. I am not glad I bought it, but I am glad I beat it, take that as you want.			"

												(MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!)Bound By Flame is a single-player action-RPG with great ambitions.. and nowhere near enough funding to realize their goals. My honest opinions about the title are thus: the game is good for what it is; it's heavily flawed in many areas, the combat does get repetitive towards the endgame, and the graphics are not the highest tier of this year, by FAR. However, it has a certain charm to it--perhaps its the simplicity of the story, a simple ""the world's going to end, we need to put forth our last ditch efforts to defeat the Ice Lords before they can freeze everything, so lets summon a demon and--WHOOPS mercenary gets fire-powers."" (That happens in the first hour of gameplay--it's not really a spoiler, trust me.)The storyline is fairly simplistic, without many twists and turns--save for one companion whose story is somewhat complicated and, in my honest opinion, doesn't get sorted out as well as it could have. Where the meat of the storyline is, is within your companions--people who haven't got a great deal to do with this war, who all have unique personalities. Sadly, only one or two of them truly evolve throughout the course of the game, and a few of them seem token. However, I remember thinking during my playthrough: ""I need to bring this companion along, because I'm curious of what they'll have to say about the events that are to transpire"" which, honestly, isn't a bad thing.So, overall, Bound By Flame is a mixed bag; the graphics aren't wonderful (I can run them close to maximum with my underpowered PC), the music is .. alright, it's fairly generic, but serves its purpose, the combat is basic, but does the job well enough, the story is simple, but overall enjoyable, and the companions are fairly interesting (and I'll say it, this game does have one of my favorite characters from recent memory! Mathras, whoever voiced him and wrote his lines, were superb on so many levels!)I do recommend this title, but only to those who are willing to make concessions; I'm fairly certain I'm not the only one who believes the game deserved greater funding than it got, as the game begged to have been significantly longer, and more open-world. The ending sort of comes out of nowhere, and you level up and advance far too quickly for my liking. Overall, give it a go if you get the chance (would recommend waiting for the price to come down a bit; this'd be a great title for a half-off or less sale, if you ask me.) So, to all; enjoy if you please, otherwise.. well, Inquisition should be out soon enough. xD			"

												I enjoyed the game for what it is, a action/adventure game. There are 2 Fighting styles: Warrior (Sword, Axe, Club), Rouge (Knives), and 1 magic style: Pyromancer (Demonic Fire attacks). I switched between both at the beginning, but as the game progressed, the Warrior style became my standard and only used Rouge style to backstab unknowing enemies. The only thing I can really criticize about the combat is that the only way to evade attacks is using the Rouge style, evade would be useful for attacks that can knock you down even if you are blocking. That is pretty much my only negative with the game that I overcame.Overall I liked the game for what it was and enjoyed the story.I RECOMMEND to play with a controllerScore: 4/5			"

Specifically because some jaded gamers and the ""professional"" (and I use that term loosely) reviewers gave it an average of about 4. Just because Spiders isn't EA or Activision and can't pay for good reviews is no reason to hit below the belt. Yeah, the lip syncing is awful. The gameplay DEFINATELY takes heavy influence from The Witcher and the like. But, the cast of companions in this game are great. The weapon and armor customization is fresh and new. Overall the game isn't anywhere near GoTY material, but it definately is something you'd want to add to your collection. While the 40$ price tag is a bit steep for what you're getting, grabbing it for 20 bucks is definately a deal. If you don't like it, you don't like it. But it's definately a great addition to the dark fantasy genre of games. Regardless of what the jaded and spoiled gaming community says now. "

												I've been really satisfied with all of my purchases from Steam, but I have to say, if there was ever a reason for a return policy, this game would be it.  I admit, I was roped in by a flashy trailer and a promise of innovative gameplay and interesting storytelling.  Instead, I got something I consider to be unplayable.  The combat is dreadful, the graphics are mediocre, and the story and voice acting -- for the few hours I could stomach it -- is unwatchable.  I played a female protagonist, so maybe they saved their budget for the male lead, but the lead actress sounds like they grabbed some girl off the street, recorded her first reading of the script and called it a day.  Not worth 40 bucks, not worth 24, not worth 5 dollars.			"

												OMG, what the hell is wrong with this game.  Every boss isn't hard because you have to sovle the puzzle or do something correctly.  They have one attack that just can't be avoided.  Or they want you to switch stances but eveytime you try while in combat you do a move with the currently equipped weapon instead.  The story is good, the characters are good, and the game looks amazing,  The combat and controls are broken.  Your companions are completely useless.  There are several battles where you need to rely on your companion's abilities.  This is a terrible combination of elements.  They, inevetibaly, get you killed.  The Worldheart boss is where I quit.  The whirwind attack the boss does is impossible to avoid.  If you have any of the ranger skills toward riposte and super dodge it will get you killed trying to dodge it.  You can block it but it staggers you with the last attack.   You can weather it well with warrior stance but good luck switching to it in the fly and then back to ranger to avoid the magic attacks.  I am giving this a Broken rating.  Not 1-10 or 1-100, broken.  Until they update this to fix the issues with the combat controls, ther e is no point playing this action RPG.  All this wasted potential... sigh.			"

												Bound by Flame is a tough game to review, because it's actually quite good, but doesn't quite stack up to bigger budget, or more lovingly created titles, like The Witcher or The Witcher 2. Gameplay-wise you'll like this if you don't mind difficult combat that requires preparation and quick reflexes, sometimes it can be a pain when you repeatedly fail, ugghh... Story-wise i liked it, nothing too fantastic, but tons of great humour throughout, with lots of little decisions and romance! ROMANCE!! But, seriously, it comes across as tongue-in-cheek, which is, um, good?Graphics are servicable with some areas looking really nice, although characters look a bit wooden and animate stiffly. Enemies shine in their design with some truly hideous ""thingies"" out in the wilderness. Music and sounds are nothing special. Overall, this is a decent little game which i have no regrets in purchasing.			"

												A relatively unknown title. Was happy to be pleasantly surprised when I began to play it.Story is an apocalyptical story, with mankind on the brink of extinction, set in a medieval world with hints of Darksiders and  Game of Thrones.Gameplay is pretty good, and you feel relatively free when moving through the various skilltrees, with abilities from all 3 working together. Storyline is rather interesting, though the fact that you can't jump back to do side-quests after ending a chapter, causes the chapter endings to ooze with an unpleasant finality.Solid RPG from a new company. Worth a shot if you're a hardcore RPG fan.Oh yeah... and it's as hard as Dark Souls.PRO's- Interesting story- Relative freedom regarding moral choices. Lots of grey areas a la. Witcher- Combat UI is easy navigate, and fun to use while struggling to bring down the game's numerous hard bosses.- Side quests actually have value, as they more often than not reward extra perks (example: improved range on traps)- Game is rather well designed. Good graphics are always a +- And, well... you can turn into an all-powerful morph between Illidan Stormrage and Kil'jaeden (look them up) that's pretty coolCON's- lip-synch is rather bad, and you are sometimes left wondering if exaggerated lip movements are the people of Vertiel's way of showing integrity.- Music is mediocore. It's O.K. but it fades into the background, almost unnoticable due to various loud screams going on.- Quest-system. It's relatively easy to maneauver BUT you cannot back-trace. Once you're done with a chapter, you're D.O.N.E. No going back to do side-missions. The unneeded finality provides a certain feeling of linear isolation that I personally don't like.PRON's (take it how you will. May be good... or not. A matter of opinion.)- One-liners to rival Duke Nukem.- Difficulty through the roof.			"

												Bound By Flame is actually a better game than many give it credit. Currently, it divides the community like Marmite - you either love it or hate it. The STORY is interestingly fresh in it's details - it's the fantasy war for survival we're used to but, in this case, it's a war that's almost lost. You are literally the last of civilisation trying desperately to find some way to win in the face of total destruction.COMBAT is difficult at first but once you get the hang of it, it becomes clear that the combat system is very skill-based. Proper timing is required to not end up a bloody smear on the ground and that makes it far more interesting than many RPGs on the market today. Playing it on easy is difficult! But not unfairly so. The developers were really trying for an experience wherein you feel like you (and the last of humanity) are hanging on by a thread against a force much more powerful that yourself and, if you allow yourself to get the hang of it, it's something that really keeps you coming back to the game again and again. You feel like you have far more connection to this character than you do in other games - even the FMVs are nice enough to sport an up-to-date version of the character you make, wearing your armour and weapons, etc.COMPANIONS, at first, seem like a lesser version of a Dragon Age system but that too is deliberate - in this world, and this war, everyone is on edge and trust is a difficult thing to come by, making close friendships unlikely with everything that is going on. While your friends in Dragon Age follow you as the blazing star of hope against evil, the companions in Bound by Flame are thrown together by necessity and all are stressed to the breaking point. This, however, doesn't mean that they don't have their good side. In fact, you can have a lot of fun with them and everyone behaves like you'd expect in such a dire situation; making odd jokes, wondering if they'll make it, asking you what you think just for a glimmer of hope. And everyone has detailed histories, adding to the realism.GRAPHICALLY, the game looks very good indeed. It's not the Witcher 2 - or the upcoming Witcher 3 and Dragon Age 3, but it's head and shoulders above the majority of the genre, and every environment looks like it has been given a lot of love and attention. Along with the soundtrack, the atmosphere created by the game is something interesting, new and involving.CUSTOMIZATION is detailed and crafting is excellent. Every weapon or piece of armour that comes along is customisable, and still the game does a great job of making this system user-friendly.You could leave the game for months and come back, and understand everything again at a glance. Find ways to build up new weapons and armour to high-powered levels, or increase their utilities (like poison resist, poison application, and various other types of damage resistance, etc.) It adds a lot of fun to gaining that new piece of loot.SKILLS & FEATS are also really useful. Where I've seen plenty of other games introduce skills for you to spend points on that haven't really impacted the game, in Bound by Flame you find yourself counting your skill points, waiting to buy specific skills that suit your playstyle.While the VOICE ACTING has been called everything from ""bad"" to ""nothing to write home about"", it hasn't bothered me at all. Honestly, I haven't even noticed any really *bad* moments. In fact, for the most part, the voice acting is very good, and manages to be interesting a varied, making it seem like a real and diverse world. Occasionally, the lipsync has been a little off but that hasn't dulled the enjoyment of the game for me.And the MUSIC is incredible. Very different and otherworldly, it manages to invoke a feeling of epic-ness, desperation, intrigue and more. Action moments marry perfectly with the intense fighting on screen. There was even a moment at the start of the 3rd Act, where my character encountered a horrible/sad image in a sewer. Nothing is said where they stumble on the image but the music said everything that was necessary. I'm now on the lookout for the soundtrack - it's that good.The PROBLEMS that the game really has - in fact, the only thing that has annoyed me are the occasional bugs. So far, I've only seen three. Although, the first two were not that bad at all!  An enemy turned and wandered off during combat, and flickered in and out of existence until he vanished altogether. The second issue involved me doing something out of sync from how the game expected me to do it, and this only happened because of I was replaying the game and knew what was ahead. The result was that I did a minor thing later and it caused the journal to start tracking the finished quest again, but this did not affect the game overall. The final bug, however, was VERY annoying. BbF sports a ""Demon System"", where you make choices at certain parts of the game and can become more evil and powerful, or remain good and not gain an extra ""demonic"" increase in spell damage (though you can wear one more piece of armour than an evil character). Both choices influence the end of your game, missions you recieve and how  characters will view and interact with you - especially since the evil choice affects your physical appearance. The problem with this system is that, when I played it, it bugged-up: I chose the good path and my appearance still became demonic. The second time I made the decision, the problem returned and I became even more physically demonic, leading to different character reactions and missions than I wanted.BUT so far as I can tell, I'm the only one unlucky enough to experience this problem, so likely it won't happen to you. At first, this soured my game experience and since I only have so much time on my hands, I did not believe I would be replaying it any time soon. However, after a week or so, I started it again. The action caught hold of me and have flown through. The issue did not repeat thankfully and I am now continuing on to the ending I wanted.Bound By Flame is a very good game. Better than many are giving it credit for. If you are a Dark Souls fan you likely will enjoy combat for the skill-based nature of it. For those who didn't enjoy DS, and I'm not the biggest fan to be honest, you will appreciate the variation of attacks and approaches open to you, which are very wide and so very enjoyable - everything from stealth kills, to quick double-dagger combat with acrobatic dodges, to two-handed swords better fit for groups and literally booting your enemies back to throw them off guard - and all of these are upgradable so you can focus on your favoured fighting style.  Overall, I would heartily recommend this game, AND I would recommend that you really take the time to immerse yourself in the various systems and playstyles, there is plenty to keep you involved and busy, and -aside from the bug I encountered- plenty of reason to enjoy the game. It is well worth the money and, if I had to score it, I would rate it either a 7 or 8 out of 10.			"

												I'm can't really that's a bad game, but I can't recommend it either. It isn't a really hard game, but it's an unfair, frustrating and unbalanced game, though it's technically okay (works fine on my computer, which is saying something).However, let me put it simply :- monsters don't respawn, which means your ressources are extremely limited, and the crafting is extremely expensive, even with upgrades,- you have two different stances, but your mobility is extremely limited in both. You can block in both stances, and jump backward in one, but the block can be bypassed, and the jump is only good in a 1vs1 situation, which almost never happens,- during the cutscenes, Volcan, the main character, suffers from a paralysis, which means you must have iron reflexes, because as soon as the cutscene ends, you'll be attacked from every side,- the enemies are incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty. First of all, they have tons of HP, even in normal. Second, they all kill you in four hits. Third, even by putting all upgrade/points in interruption, it's extremely rare to stagger an enemy. Fourth, the enemies will always stagger you. Fifth, you swing slower than the enemies, which means you have to anticipate every hit, because there's no instant movement. You can't roll. Sixth, you don't fight enemies one by one. You fight them in groups. Seventh, the archers in that game are deadly, as they can shoot you THROUGH their comrades. Which means that while you're trying to swing, you'll get staggered by arrows, and cleaved in the face by the enemy who just recovered. Even funnier with bosses, since archers infinitely respawn. Eight, you're limited in mana and ammos. The enemies aren't. They can literally spend minutes spamming arrows/darts/poison sphere and win the war of attrition. Ninth, when you hit an enemy blocking, you'll stagger. He won't. Tenth, some enemies have unblockable attacks that are barely differents than their usual attacks. Your kick will be ♥♥♥♥ unless you put many points in it. Eleventh, have I mentioned how many HP the monsters have?TL;DR : you're sent against enemies outnumbering you, outskilling you, and with more ressources than you do. You will be forced to cheese to win, and each room will turn into a ridiculous battle of attrition as you run out of traps, bolts, and potions faster than you can craft them.			"

												Quick breakdown but simply put, don't buy. Gameplay is bland, combat is either dumb down and repetitive or unfair and unrewarding. They have tried copying Dark Souls etc. with hard gameplay but forgot to be tough but fair and you are often fighting enemies who seem god like which little options other than to run around throwing things in the hope you don't get hit by some form of heat seeking laser. Combat is not rewarding and you fight the same 3 enemy types through your entire 10 hour or less time playing this game to 100%. The story is boring and is more of a nod your head and go scenario, you're a merc who just nods your head to what people tell you with not personality other than swearing every third word like a 13 year old mid puberty. There is no companion interaction of any kind that you could call interaction, there is no story lines etc. There is a romance, it consists of 2 lines of text and a quickie infront of an old stone with 1 of two characters on the premise that one's a ♥♥♥♥ and the other than daddy issue's (seriously, that is the case they even tell you themselves and it's updated like that in your diary).The alignment shifting? It's not alignment and it's not shifting. You make a choice at the end of every chapter whether or not you want the buff to make you more powerful or do you do the nice guy thing that normally ends in the deaths of thousands of people, it's not a good or evil shift and the morphs consist of funny eyes, small horns, 4 small horns and black face and 2 small, 2 big and black skin, the last of which occurs 3 minutes before the final and dissapointing boss fight. Your companions and others do mention these changes... twice... one sentence each. Crafting becomes your weapon, it's rather simple but fact is the combat is so unbalanced you'll find your self selling everything that you don't use (not that you need it, combat boils down to using spells, running till mana is back, then repeat) and then changing gold into ingrediants and those into health and mana potions. I found i spent 2 hours during final boss fight, about 40 minutes of that was going to and from the crafting menu mid fight to spam making potions. It's dull, simplistic  and you can make potions out of thin air and gold. The skill tree is cool but with 25 levels,  you basically can entirely max 2 tree's but that said you can't fight like you want. The game is designed to force you to play how they want you to play, want to be a tank? No shield exists and half of all enemies have to be fought with magic or with the daggers, only the weak and basic enemies are fightable with the sword unless you can perfect their ""spam button"" parry system which is unbalanced. Much like Dark Souls there is a parry and riposte to allow you to break an attack and counter, combat consists of fighting 4-5 enemies wailing at you and during this animation you will 50% die before the end of it during the slow motion animation of the counter where his 3 friends have been hitting you for 1/3 you're health a piece. Overall, bad story, bad combat and mechanics. All the pictures for this you see above? Thats the end boss twice, and the other bosses in the game. The big roaring guy? He's the only one you meet and acts as a prologue boss. They are all cutscenes.			"

												Is it not possible to recommen Bound by Flame. Not only its graphics are simply subpar to any action rpg of this generations, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The voice acting is dreadful, the dialogues are unintentionally comic so bad they are, enemies respawn as if it was a MMORPG, and the game presumes you are going to farm for itens as well. The enemis are constantly recycled, the story is shallow and clearly the developer simply gave up lessa than halfway through the game and opted for a shortcut to the final. If that was not enough, the final boss is one of the most punishing and unbalanced you will face. Avoid, unless all theses criteria are met at the same time: 1) you are a fan of action rpg; 2) you are out of other options; 3) the game is practically free on steam.			"

												It feels rushed in a lot of places. Like there's a stealth mechanic, but most enemies are positioned in such a way as to make it pointless. There's magic, but it is really expensive and even when you max out the offensive magic it's not that powerful. Talents barely feel like they have an impact and really any time you get stuck you just lay landmines. The story feels like it just skips around to set pieces and occasionally it gives you ""big moral choices"", but you have so little information that you're basically picking blind. And that's assumign the choice makes sense since at least one the game tried to present the choices as mutually exclusive when it was basically fight a boss monster and lower a bridge when the monster is by the lever for the bridge.

												As a full priced item Bound by Flame is a bit too steep for a random gamble.  On a good sale however this is a great game with a good amount of depth.  The branching gameplay has some meaningful decisions, and some illusory choice, but that is to be expected with this type of game.  Essentially this is really impressive, considering the size of the development team.  I enjoyed this game and found the playthrough engrossing enough to keep going even when some of the segments got a bit repetitive.  I don't know if it's possible to beat the game with Warrior build, but the rogue and pyromancer skill tree are a deadly combo.  Worth the time I put into it.			"

												A real mixed bag of quality, for every good idea that makes this worth checking out there's something or a lacking in execution that undermines it.The graphics are real subpar, making the game look like it's development started in the early days of the XBOX 360 and for some reason just didn't come out till recently.Combat is functional but feels clumsy. Information isn't accurately portrayed to the player with no indication you're accessing your hotkeyed abilities or items, and it's difficult to determine the range of area of effect abilities by their particle effects only.The voice acting is underwhelming and a mixed bag overall.That sound track is great, seriously! The composer at SPIDERS who did the music for this deserves an award!The crafting system is actually really neat, if a little odd. You can craft upgrades for your armour and weapons that physically appear on them in game, and if you're out of crafting resources, you can craft the resources! Which are crafted from gold...? It seems questionable but it's nice to have the option.The world is unique and at times feels genuinely alien with some trully original enemy designs, how many games have giant prawn monsters?The story feels like a shallow pretender of the Witcher 2, with alot of swearing in a misguided attempt to appear mature. But it's premise of the world already being lost does add a fresh spin on things. You're not trying to save the world, the world is already lost, you're trying to save what ever is left to be salvaged.And the moral choice system actually has meaning outside of just cosmetic changes. Your character gets tangable benefits based on how heroic or how demonic they become, that goes beyond just looking evil.When looked at as a whole package, it's nothing really special but worth a look5/10			"

												I got a great 25 hours of play time on this game. The action is good and controls are decent. It doesnt take the skill that a Dark Souls does but it is still satisfying. You can have a companion with you and direct the AI what to do. You can customize your armor and weapons as well as skills to match your play style. IMO the graphics and sound are pretty good. Ive seen some bad reviews of the game but I just dont agree. There are two paths you can chose for your character too and alternate endings. As a roleplaying game it is ok, mostly action but there are RPG charateristics. The voice acting is a bit lousy but the script is ok. I really appreciated the time they put into the cut scenes and the story. There is an undead character that is really cool, and he turns out to be the narrator at the end.			"

												Bound By Flame is another RPG from Spider studio from the start great combat but with the same ♥♥♥♥, it suffers from difficulty spikes around the 2nd chapter. I really don’t know why the developers always ♥♥♥♥ up the difficulty. I say like all Spider games get it, It is a good fun.    "

												I was actually enjoying this game. I play games for their story, though - and even on easy mode I got stuck on a very frustrating boss that I could not work out how to defeat. So I wasn't willing to keep trying and, unfortunately, the rest of the book's pages were stuck for me.			"

												The game showed a lot of promise. I loved the combat system at the start, the story was kind of just a Dragon Age rip off, which was fine. As I got farther into it tho, the 1 follower you get in fights just isn't useful. Combat becomes more of run around in warrior stance to regen hp, which is the most boring thing ever. If they just made healing potions easier to make, or made it easier to upgrade stuff in the beginning so you didn't have to run around like that, it could have been fun. The voice acting and the script, one of the worst I seen in a non indie game in a very long time.			"

												Well, about anything there is to say about this game has already been said by other reviewers. So, let's keep it simple:The combat balancing is complete and utter bs, even on normal mode standard mobs kill you too easily/randomly. (And if that counts for something, I really like some balanced difficulty in games as can be found in e.g. Dark Souls.)Followers are unbelievably dumb and simply stand there for themselves to be torn in pieces by every enemy that comes by. No mods available to fix those problems. For me, this game is unplayable in its current state. Sorry to say so, but do yourselves a favor and simply don't buy it for any more than 1 €, if you really want to give it a try. :-/			"

												Compared to the crap dark souls 'ports' I'm not only finding the optimization of this game, the voice acting, the overall graphics FAR superior to at least the first Dark Souls game that I can actually STAND to PLAY this UNLIKE the INCREDIBLY BAD Dark Souls PC 'port'.Primarily because (a) this game doesn't run like sludge on a high end system, it RESPECTS kb/mouse UNLIKE the first Dark Souls, etc.Beyond this although I've ONLY played a part of the intro/tutorial(?) I'm actually having FUN and enjoy the voice acting/etc. unlike dark souls where it seems like drudgery, granted that's most likely because of the INCREDIBLY LAZY 'port'.All of this said, my personal game prefs lie in CRPGs and spacesims e.g. X series games, Star Wolves series, Starpoint Gemini series, Legend of Grimrock, Wizardry 8, etc. so it may very well be a bad hack'n'slasher(which both this and dark souls seem to be to me with shallow RPG elements, which Skyrim shares BTW but I classify that as action-adventure) so take this as you will...  I DO NOT enjoy permadeath, ah hell I'm not a sado-masochist although I do like a challenge just not assininely difficult ones, i.e. difficult simply for difficulty's sake.			"

												Bound by Flame is a fantasy-themed action role-playing game. It puts the player in the role of a victim of a demonic influence, where it's necessary to choose between the evil powers that are offered or rejecting them in favor of developing heroic talents. Pretty damn good game overall. Yes there are issues with the combat that isn't fully explained that leads you to despair but if you work at it, it soon becomes easy to handle that most fights you'll dance around your foe and kill them off with very little damage to you. Voice actors as always are a bit hit and miss but not really a big problem as lots of games suffer that.8/10			"

												Would have given it 7/10 since its relatively decent even though the story is rather incoherent but because there is no dodgeroll and instead you have only this jump-back in thief stance, WHICH LOCKS YOU INTO A COUNTERANIMATION IF YOU TIME IT WRONG EVEN IF YOU DON`T WANT TO ATTACK AND DON`T PRESS ANYTHING ELSE, it gets a 4/10. Usually you would think, timing your dodge perfectly with the enemy attack gives you bonus damage or something. No, you are locked into an animation that you cannot avoid and cannot cancel which leads to unavoidable damage in bossfights, especcially the last one.Incredibly infuriating and I am sick and tired of having to play around ♥♥♥♥ design, the game is hard enough as is.

												Bound By Flame is a great ARPG, that is well worth your time and money.Pros:+The music is great.+Has some meaningful choices.+Combat is challenging. (No, it is not like Darksouls. It struck me as being kind of Fable-esque)+The Story, and most of the Characters are unique and interesting.+It manages a fairly effective sense of urgency, making what you're doing in the game seem like it has more of a purpose.+The main-character is not some ""The Prophecied One"" or anything stupid like that. He's just a Mercenary who comes down with a bad case of ""Wrong place, wrong time.""+Upgrade system is simple, yet cool.Cons:-Meaningful choices are not very frequent.-Enemies get kind of sword-spongy toward the end, taking forever to hack through.-Your allies quickly become not much more than a minor distraction for your enemies.-You cannot just hold a direction to quickly change the number of items you're buying/selling/crafting. It's faster to mash the direction repeatedly, which gets tiring.-By the end stages of the game, you always have so much useless loot that you are always encumbered.-Most of the weapons you find, are not as good as the ones you can buy.-Cannot customize Hammers and Helmets.

												The writing and voice overs in this game are cringy, at best. The core concept of the story/setting is pretty intriguing and something you don't usually see - the protagonist getting possesed, and having to co exist with the spirit (or demon), and becoming more powerful in return. Mostly everything beyond that falls apart though. Characters, story and even the world get very stale after a short while, and the way you are railroaded to either goody or baddy is frustrating.The gameplay is quite enjoyable at least. The combat is fun - it is responsive and also challenging, if you like DS's combat, you'll  like this game's, except the combat here is, imo, more fun than that of DS's -, the crafting is pretty nice and convenient even if sometimes it can feel a bit too easy, and the leveling process if quite simple but enjoyable.I wouldn't recommend picking this up at full price, maybe on a discount.

												I have to say that this is a pretty awful game.The graphics are okay, story okay and there were actually some pretty good ideas here.But I found the gameplay to be really unfair.  The monsters often signal what they are doing so you can react but they either do far to much damage when they do hit or your hits don't seem to have an effect.  What's worse is that your companion WILL die every fight.  You can't play tactically at all.  Ther are really two different fighting styles but I found that the rogue style was the most effective with the other style being far too slow when there are many foes at once.I was fairly interested in what might happen in the story but I came to a point where I was fighting six creatures in an enclosed space (yet again - this is a core part of the game) with a demon that comes in later and gases you when he dies meaning that I died a frustrating and pointless death yet again.  I really don't mind a challenge but this game took things too far.The dialogue options can be quite funny at times but the main character largely comes across as a bit of a d**k.  You might want to take a punt when this is in a sale but honestly, there are so many better games out there - spare yourself the frustration.			"

												Do not buy Bound By Flame. It's a bad The Witcher rip-off with the worst combat system EVER designed. Same goes for the story and the characters : the writing is a total disaster and it lack of... everything. If you really want to play this game, wait for the sales.			"

												Overall Bound By Flame seemed cool on the surface, but didn't deliver on any of the expectations I had (which were not high, I happened across the store page for it and thought ""hey that looks neat, I'll give it a try"").  Things I liked - weapon upgrade system was pretty neat, and different.  Story premise was cool, and I bet the world would be really interesting if expanded upon.Things I didn't like - most of it.  Combat was hard in a bad way, characters were boring, story was disjointed and unfulfilling.Story - Cool ideas, but none of them were satisfyingly developed.  It tries to play the mysterious, figure it out by experiencing the world around you game, but it doesn't work well. You get a little backstory about the location, and stuff in that location, and a little more when you fight new enemies (more on this later) just by playing the game.  Also, the various party members can sometimes explain things. You can get an idea of what is happening, and why, but the story gets incredibly disjointed between chapters.  There was one character, who had a not so well hidden secret (of significant story impact) that I was starting to figure out.  In the next chapter, myself and everyone around me had apparently discovered and processed this secret, and it was no big deal.  But I don't know when that happened.  During a loading screen, evidently.  Characters - you get a Mass Effect/Dragon Age style party, and you can select one of them to follow you around while you do missions.  There is an interesting variety of characters (don't confuse that to mean the characters are interesting, though), and I do like that the main character has some personality.  None of your party members do very different things in combat, though, and you have very limited control (be more aggressive/be more defensive are basically the only options), so it basically doesn't matter which one you bring with.  I took the ice witch a lot, as she has access to one of the stupidly broken spells the enemy often uses on you and I enjoyed turning the tables.  Eventually you can do a mission for/with each of your party members, but they're pretty bland missions (gather 4 herbs so I can make a strength potion).  I think there's also a romance option?  I dunno, never cared enough about them to try finding it.  Gameplay - it's broken into chapters, and each chapter has a hub city (ish) where you get quests, and can venture out to explore the surrounding area.  Sometimes things change in the hub city based on main story missions, sometimes not.  There are not many different enemies, I can remember 7, not counting bosses, across the entire game.  It aims for Dark Souls level difficulty, but with none of the benefit for being good at it.  Your weapons barely do any damage, so even once you get timings down and figure out how to defeat an enemy it takes an annoyingly long time for the most basic foes.  Also, it is incredibly punishing to get knocked down or stunlocked, especially by the archers, which had a special attack that can break through your guard and automatically stun you.  Plus they have this uncanny ability to shoot through terrain, or directly behind them, regardless of how much tactical manuvering you attempt.  Then there are some enemies with auto knockdown AOE attacks, the only defense against which is to be 50ish yards away.  Enemies feel cheap with their uncounterable stuns, you feel impotent and unable to effectively hurt anything, and there is very little benefit for attempting to master the combat system.  You get three upgrade trees, one for magic, one for two handed weapons, and one for two daggers.  A lot of the abilities seemed pretty useless, but I did feel like you could take some of each without gimping yourself.  I mainly went for magic (spamming ranged attacks) and two handed weapons (in a desperate attempt to get a weapon that did any damage worth noticing).  Boss fights were not enjoyable.  Either run away and spam ranged attacks to whittle them down agonizingly slowly, or if there wasn't enough room for that, block and/or dodge for 5 minutes until you think there's a window where you can complete your long attack animation without getting stunlocked and murdered.  After every boss fight, all I could think was ♥♥♥♥ing finally.  Never had a moment where victory was exciting or fulfilling.      All that said, I did play it to the end.  It wasn't terribly long, and I kept hoping for the story to develop in a satisfying manner but it never really did.  Would not recommend.			"

												Bound By Flame is a great ARPG, that is well worth your time and money.Pros:+The music is great.+Has some meaningful choices.+Combat is challenging. (No, it is not like Darksouls. It struck me as being kind of Fable-esque)+The Story, and most of the Characters are unique and interesting.+It manages a fairly effective sense of urgency, making what you're doing in the game seem like it has more of a purpose.+The main-character is not some ""The Prophecied One"" or anything stupid like that. He's just a Mercenary who comes down with a bad case of ""Wrong place, wrong time.""+Upgrade system is simple, yet cool.Cons:-Meaningful choices are not very frequent.-Enemies get kind of sword-spongy toward the end, taking forever to hack through.-Your allies quickly become not much more than a minor distraction for your enemies.-You cannot just hold a direction to quickly change the number of items you're buying/selling/crafting. It's faster to mash the direction repeatedly, which gets tiring.-By the end stages of the game, you always have so much useless loot that you are always encumbered.-Most of the weapons you find, are not as good as the ones you can buy.-Cannot customize Hammers and Helmets.

												After completing it on Buffalo difficulty as a Ranger character, these are my thoughts of what I remember:Ranger:   The quick-stabbing style was strong and fun. I liked being able to take out half or an entire group with surprise attacks without getting caught, and the fighting was constant if I dodged correctly. It lacked some kind of counter to the 'double-shield deadwalker' (DSD) which made fighting them tedious (not difficult). Only way to speed it up was to have your companion help, either by tanking him so you could stab him on the side where there was an opening, or having them interrupting him. The poison specialty helped, but I think there should've been more poison damage skills/crafts as the only poison damage buff was from a gem on the breastplate (+2 dmg/s). The final skill in this tree is too strong to miss, It's gonna be weird playing again without it.Warrior and Pyromancy:   The only useful talents for me in Pyromancy was Flaming Weapon, which buffs Burning Weapon. I see a potential in the build and will go full Pyromancy with Ranger Stealth next time, and that's because the mana potions with the Apothecary feat only costs 1 tainted blood and heart dust. If it weren't for that, weak.   Warrior style could break shields sometimes. After maxing the Ranger tree, I tried getting the interruption bonus talents in this tree in the hopes of making the DSD less tedious by breaking shield in warrior stance and killing it with ranger stance. Unfortunately the shieldbreaking part seemed just as random as the kick ability could stagger/flinch. In addition to the randomness of kick, you could only get 1-2 hits in after a kick before the shield was back up. Before the DSD's showed up, it was much more effective to bait them to start an attack formation and go behind them and start mashing. I can't see how going warrior build is strong enough, especially for the lategame. But I have not tried it yet so I might get surprised.Traps and Crossbow   I never used a trap after the intro area. It only dealt 50 damage, which I could do more with two dagger crits or a surprise attack. I was going to learn the second trap, but got too far in the story while I waited for him to ""take a day to gather materials"" (I even slept a whole day to get him to continue it). Will try to get it and test it next run.   Crossbows were good and strong, but there were too few of them. I think I found 4 or 5 outside of the shop. I prefered the ones with 75% poisoning chance, as i had the poison skill.Monsters   Good animation on attacks. Few have some near-instant attacks which can be troubling if you don't know the monster/pay full attention. The Impalers stab-attack is one I've had most trouble with. The small ones could get oneshot by a surprise attack and the big ones took 4-5 dagger hits after a surprise attack, so just needed a change of tactics. Otherwise I think only the DSD and Generals have a near-instant attack that was problematic.   The hp/defense was well balanced. Only exceptions are the big weapon deadwalkers (BWD) and shield deadwalkers (SD) where the former has more hp than the latter. I could surprise kill a SD in all acts, but in act one (before I had gotten a decent stealth damage dagger) a BWD survived whereas SD didn't. Later when BWD carry around a dark enchanted blade, they have maybe a bit too much hp and damage, but it was more challenging so I don't mind that.   The damage could sometimes be too much. BWD and DSD dealt half or 1/3 of my hp in one hit, but the BWD was very easy to read. Otherwise the damage was fine. There could've been a potion that counters poison and dark debuffs. As it is now, the poison will do a lot of damage to you and the only way to counter it is to drink one or two health potions, and for the dark debuff it's mana potions.Story (SPOILER ALERT, skip it if you don't want any spoilers at all)   Interesting at first. I didn't get bored of the story during the playthrough, and the sidequests was rewarding enough in experience and sometimes material and storywise, so well done there. I was very curious of how I could play out this story from all the dialogues of putting the Ice Lords against each other and wether to listen to your demon or deny it in order to choose the path of the game. This turned out to let me down immensely as it turns out I only fought one of the seven Ice Lords repeatedly spoken through the game, go through his door and fight the demon inside. I hoped that by killing this Ice Lord, the door would close due to his death, or another Ice Lord would appear and close the door. Either way it would force us to go after the other Ice Lords, with or without your allies. As mentioned in some dialogues, being able to plot one Ice Lord against another, could be an interesting plot device which also could fill up some of their story. And as the Ice Lord you killed mentioned the other with the Juggernauts hating you for killing one, I thought some hellbent for revenge Ice Lord that would chase you recklessly would appear, until I cleared the game that is.Conclusion   When I got to the end, it felt rushed. Story and worldlore had a lot of potential but ended prematurely. I will recommend getting this game when it's on sale, but I disagree that it's worth the full price. Also there were many typos in the subtitles (I laughed a bit when the subtitle said 'Needles' instead of 'Needless') and a few voicefiles that was for a different dialogue (Buffalo in act 3 at camp after completing his quest called out for help like when he was trapped). I didn't have any technical issues, and I gotta say the loading and saving time was so fast I did barely noticed it.For the graphic♥♥♥♥♥s; the graphics were great, but more importantly the animation was good and didn't stutter.Other than that it was a great game. Hope the next game (not necessarily a sequel) will be longer and with more diverse gameplay options (story and combat) and bigger skill trees, so that it matches the great characters and worldlore you have in it.

												I wanted to like & recommend this game, I really did... especially given that I paid for it.  Set in the lands of Vertiel, it’s under attack by a horde of undead & has been on the losing end of this war of attrition for at least a decade.  The last of these “freedom fighters” have banded together & think they’ve found a way to turn the tide via a ritual.  Something goes wrong in it & your character is bonded with a flame demon.  The premise is sound where you're possessed by a fire demon & the more you allow it to imbue you with it's powers the more you risk losing your humanity.  I believe that the game is influenced by the Witcher & Kingdoms of Amalur titles, perhaps a tad too much so. The execution of this is where the problem lay.  Choice in itself seems the illusion here, this begins at character creation as you only have 5 pre-generated faces to choose from & you can only choose being a human.  You have 3 skill trees, the Warrior, Ranger, & Pyro tree, unfortunately I didn't really feel any more powerful as I gained levels other then in upgrading the weapons.  You don't get any statistical (STAT) differences when you gain levels, not so much as an added hit/health point per level or increase in in damage or defense.  There are no differences in the weapon swaps one can do; no sword & shield style for the warrior, or spear for that matter, no option for the Ranger to use a bow & so forth.  Your companions, with rare exception are more diversionary then an actual help.  The story is meant to revolve around a male lead, I played a female character & more often then not I was called “Vulcan” even though I’d named her “Jenna”  So many of those little things that are missing & wouldn’t pass the muster had this been a AAA title under a larger company like Bethesda or EA.  I’m willing to forgive many things since this is apparently a small studio that released this title, but even I can only let so much go by.  The combat, as another reviewer wrote, feels clunky. Part of the issue there is that with the exception of the weaker foes, it doesn’t feel as if you do any significant damage, whereas most of the enemies can kill you in relatively few hits.  The story gets inconstant & abrupt at the end.  In the first half of the game you’re told about the 7 Ice Lords & their respective armies & how their truce is tenuous.  How all that was ultimately executed was a problem.  If you still plan on getting this title, wait until it's part of a bundle deal, or expansions are made or it's severly patched &/or reduced in price.  As I wrote above, I so wanted to like & recommend this game.			"

												I'm a little conflicted about Bound By Flame, but I keep coming back and playing more so I must be enjoying it! The firs thing you'll notice is that the game looks great. It's one of the better looking games I've played recently, especially with regards to the character models. This is definitely an action game, although it has the addcitive rpg elements like leveling trees and learning new abilities. The combat feels like a less rigid Dark Souls and is extremely challening. This is one of my major gripes with the game - the challenge level is so high that it is difficult not to simply drop the controller in frustration and walk away. However, it manages to remain compelling; even after dying several times to a small group of the game's weaker enemies - enemies who can defeat you in three hits if you do not defend yourself - I feel motivated to try again, planning my tactics and practicing the game's very intricate parry/interrupt system. A well done battle is very rewarding, with highly satisfying slow motion shots when you successfully counter an enemy's attack. These will sometimes chain several together, giving a feel reminiscent of bullet time. The only other gripe I have with this game is that the dialouge feels as though it was written by a teenage boy who just discovered cursing. Attempts at being edgy or showing off how rough the mercenaries are just comes off as sophomoric vulgarity that serves no real purpose. If you play Bound By Flame you will absolutely have moments during which you want just ragequit, but if you hang with it, overcoming the challenges can be very rewarding. I recommend this game for anyone who likes action games with RPG elements and gothic fantasy settings and who do enjoy a highly challenging game.			"

												There are a lot of negative reviews floating about for this game, and I would say they are rubbish. If I had to compare this game to something, it would be a less polished version of the Witcher combined with aspects of Dragon Age 2.  I would give it 7.5 out of 10. The animation and graphics are good, the gameplay is decent, the story is pretty good. Anyone giving this game a 0-50 score should not be allowed to review games. At ten dollars, it's a good bargain. At 15-20, you would feel you got your money's worth. 30-40+ is where I would say it's overpriced for what you get.  "

												Many of us are bound by some obligations, for example, or gambling, or women, or alcohol. But what happens when the protagonist encounters with demonic forces and ""handcuffed fire""? We learn further in the review.The game falls into the genre of RPG action so that every right step in this category must have an epic story based on saving the world. Therefore, it is not the same in this title, and from the outset adventure you are familiar with the situation in the world. Although this is a relatively brief acquaintance, you will learn everything important and therefore that the world is infected with masters of ice from the north, the undead and cities fall one after the other and can not be defend against this threat.In light of these events is like trying mysterious monks called Red Scribes cause ritual, which would be able to reverse this disaster. These monks chose the place of the old ritual and strength as they need in him to concentrate all their strength, they hired mercenaries from the legendary group Freeborn Blades. This group is a relatively new member named Vulcan shoe that person during the game already reincarnated.The story begins immediately after the show with the situation in the world and key persons. The hero Vulcan with his brothers in arms trying to defend the place of ritual under great duress undead, when in fact happens something strange and place the desired effect, the monks achieved something truly unexpected and Vulcan give new and powerful capabilities of handling the fire.That said, where player game called transfer instructions, introduces him different fighting styles, ie namely hard and slow while fighting style with two-handed weapons, faster with two weapons at once, or ultimately magical style aimed to control fire the player thrown into this world whose survival rests on his shoulders and decisions. The story is thus typical clichés we've already played countless times to save the world from evil through the powerful and mighty.Like any proper RPG, this game also contains a relatively large possibilities of character development thanks to three different trees, focusing on three fighting styles that can be combined during the fight. In the context of character development, it should be beyond reproach itself selection and editing characters at the beginning of the game. This selection is actually trimmed to a minimum and it is possible to modify the character of the hero and others as they wish, as is the case with other RPGs. There are only five preset options for skin color and six different hair types. By editing the characters end up, which is really very little. On the other hand, the action RPG at most of the time anyway player is looking at your avatar, but it is definitely less.As regards the actual combat system, which is in this category of games is very important, he should be commended and works well. Style producers chose what is fun, fast, and in particular it is possible to create your unique combinations by investing in talent trees. Unfortunately there should be a slight reproach konzolovosť control, which would, of course, the PC can be executed differently, thus mapped to multiple buttons. This is not anything terrible and the idol of the genre itself, that Dark Souls is the same control, if not worse.Graphically but is conferred somewhat weaker, it is seen that this game is being developed primarily for the previous generation of consoles, namely Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In this respect, indeed there is no need to wait any visual revolution, but what should be on-screen instructions, it game handles.A great addition to the game mechanics is to create different objects, specimens and weapons. This makes it possible, for example, modify your weapon to give more damage, respectively. armor that added with more lives and so on. This drive is easy and intuitive to operate. Any object that can be produced has different requirements for such production. Of course, for example. the handle of the sword will need iron ore, optionally skin to handle and so on. These materials can be found everywhere during play.Part of that is worthy of praise is a conversational system, very similar to the Dragon Age series. This system allows the player to learn more about the world in which it is located, while it also has an impact on the course of the story, because the player's decisions are reflected in one of two different ends of the game.On the whole, therefore, this is a fairly entertaining dose of games, which is seasoned with the hilarious battle system with three different options for improvements martial trees and interesting conversation system, which is not common in this category RPG. If you're a fan of epic expeditions into fantasy worlds, fighting and rapid improvement of your character in the game is not over increasingly argue with a clear conscience reach for this title. Although Bound by Flame is not known from any issuer, or from AAA study and does not even have taken a great marketing massage that resembles the game of this genre, which appeared recently, but has a lot more and that is the fun of this title. Therefore Snap out of his handcuffs and get on with this heroic expedition.			"

												I have to say that this is a pretty awful game.The graphics are okay, story okay and there were actually some pretty good ideas here.But I found the gameplay to be really unfair.  The monsters often signal what they are doing so you can react but they either do far to much damage when they do hit or your hits don't seem to have an effect.  What's worse is that your companion WILL die every fight.  You can't play tactically at all.  Ther are really two different fighting styles but I found that the rogue style was the most effective with the other style being far too slow when there are many foes at once.I was fairly interested in what might happen in the story but I came to a point where I was fighting six creatures in an enclosed space (yet again - this is a core part of the game) with a demon that comes in later and gases you when he dies meaning that I died a frustrating and pointless death yet again.  I really don't mind a challenge but this game took things too far.The dialogue options can be quite funny at times but the main character largely comes across as a bit of a d**k.  You might want to take a punt when this is in a sale but honestly, there are so many better games out there - spare yourself the frustration.			"

												Overall Bound By Flame seemed cool on the surface, but didn't deliver on any of the expectations I had (which were not high, I happened across the store page for it and thought ""hey that looks neat, I'll give it a try"").  Things I liked - weapon upgrade system was pretty neat, and different.  Story premise was cool, and I bet the world would be really interesting if expanded upon.Things I didn't like - most of it.  Combat was hard in a bad way, characters were boring, story was disjointed and unfulfilling.Story - Cool ideas, but none of them were satisfyingly developed.  It tries to play the mysterious, figure it out by experiencing the world around you game, but it doesn't work well. You get a little backstory about the location, and stuff in that location, and a little more when you fight new enemies (more on this later) just by playing the game.  Also, the various party members can sometimes explain things. You can get an idea of what is happening, and why, but the story gets incredibly disjointed between chapters.  There was one character, who had a not so well hidden secret (of significant story impact) that I was starting to figure out.  In the next chapter, myself and everyone around me had apparently discovered and processed this secret, and it was no big deal.  But I don't know when that happened.  During a loading screen, evidently.  Characters - you get a Mass Effect/Dragon Age style party, and you can select one of them to follow you around while you do missions.  There is an interesting variety of characters (don't confuse that to mean the characters are interesting, though), and I do like that the main character has some personality.  None of your party members do very different things in combat, though, and you have very limited control (be more aggressive/be more defensive are basically the only options), so it basically doesn't matter which one you bring with.  I took the ice witch a lot, as she has access to one of the stupidly broken spells the enemy often uses on you and I enjoyed turning the tables.  Eventually you can do a mission for/with each of your party members, but they're pretty bland missions (gather 4 herbs so I can make a strength potion).  I think there's also a romance option?  I dunno, never cared enough about them to try finding it.  Gameplay - it's broken into chapters, and each chapter has a hub city (ish) where you get quests, and can venture out to explore the surrounding area.  Sometimes things change in the hub city based on main story missions, sometimes not.  There are not many different enemies, I can remember 7, not counting bosses, across the entire game.  It aims for Dark Souls level difficulty, but with none of the benefit for being good at it.  Your weapons barely do any damage, so even once you get timings down and figure out how to defeat an enemy it takes an annoyingly long time for the most basic foes.  Also, it is incredibly punishing to get knocked down or stunlocked, especially by the archers, which had a special attack that can break through your guard and automatically stun you.  Plus they have this uncanny ability to shoot through terrain, or directly behind them, regardless of how much tactical manuvering you attempt.  Then there are some enemies with auto knockdown AOE attacks, the only defense against which is to be 50ish yards away.  Enemies feel cheap with their uncounterable stuns, you feel impotent and unable to effectively hurt anything, and there is very little benefit for attempting to master the combat system.  You get three upgrade trees, one for magic, one for two handed weapons, and one for two daggers.  A lot of the abilities seemed pretty useless, but I did feel like you could take some of each without gimping yourself.  I mainly went for magic (spamming ranged attacks) and two handed weapons (in a desperate attempt to get a weapon that did any damage worth noticing).  Boss fights were not enjoyable.  Either run away and spam ranged attacks to whittle them down agonizingly slowly, or if there wasn't enough room for that, block and/or dodge for 5 minutes until you think there's a window where you can complete your long attack animation without getting stunlocked and murdered.  After every boss fight, all I could think was ♥♥♥♥ing finally.  Never had a moment where victory was exciting or fulfilling.      All that said, I did play it to the end.  It wasn't terribly long, and I kept hoping for the story to develop in a satisfying manner but it never really did.  Would not recommend.			"

												At this point you know what to expect from a Spiders game. Short but sweet. It's about a 20 hour game but priced appropriately. The game has 3 or 4 main chapters, some side quests and an interesting story, but could have been so much more. It’s not an open world but a semi open map that changes each major chapter, so no backtracking. Its comes off nicely done, and for what it is, its defiantly worth picking up and playing if you want to take a break from FO4 or The Witcher 3, or if you are waiting on some new title that just isn’t here yet.Pros:Good/Decent graphicsGreat soundtrackFun playstyleA small amount of choice based storyCompanionsDescent voice acting, especially the main characterCons:ShortNot fully fleshed out/realizedFinal boss seems almost impossible at first "

												Very underrated game.  I feel that people give this game too much hate for what they had to work with (a budget of only around 800k).  There are some bad VOs in this game and sometimes the lines are super cheesy, but I say it's all easily overlooked once you get yourself engaged in the game.   The atmosphere and story are very interesting and have a fair amount of depth to them.  Some characters are bland, but others are super interesting and leave you wishing to learn more.  The choices in this game were sometimes hard to make, but some of them were easy to predict how it would affect your character down the line. Combat in this game was very much like The Witcher and Dragon Age combined, not to mention the atmosphere draws from the two as well, which is a huge perk.  Difficulty comparable to Dark Souls, if it's your first play-through you should definitely go the easiest difficulty.  Also, the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard for the genre.  I got this game on sale, if you can get it for about 20 bucks or so, would definitely recommend picking it up, it's a relatively quick game to defeat (took me 11 hours), depending on how many times you die.

												A game that fails in its mediocrity. Bound by Flame is another lackluster installment in the growing genre of dark fantasy RPG's. Unfortunately, as an expanding genre, Bound by Flame competes with far better titles such as the Dark Souls and Witcher series. This game fails from unrealized potentials. Combat is implemented just enough to have some strategy but not enough to be engaging. A crafting system exists, but without a Skyrim-esque sense of accomplishment or worth. Characters exist but none beyond the range of stock characters in a passion play. A story exists but it hardly feels worth experiencing. A world exists but it doesn't feel worth exploring. These could all be forgiven if all you wished were a simple time waster, a perfectly valid form of game. The problem lies in that the price of this game exits the realm of what I feel is appropriate for a time waster. At $15 to $20 I would not feel this game a failure, but as it is in the $40 territory I have other options which will provide more bang for my buck. There are other criticisms that could be leveled at this game, the laughable overuse of swearing for one, but these only reinforce the main problem that this game feels overpriced for the experience. Not a terrible or broken game but not a game worth full price.			"

												This game is amazing, however that's basically decided on whether you choose to use daggers or if you choose to use swords/axes/maces. Daggers will create fun fluid gameplay where the outcome of a fight comes down to your own timed skill and placement. Swords/axes/maces are too clunky and will punish you the further you progress through the game. The story was awesome, lots of moral choices or even choices you might not pay much attention too (much like myself). Skilltrees and customisation was pretty meh overall. You can switch up parts of your gear for different defensive/few offensive bonuses but they don't really impact the game too much.Visuals were belter, everything looks nice and gothic-esque the way I like it. Creating a lovely atmosphere.Replayability-wise, I can see myself giving the game another playthrough and trying to beat it on the hardest mode (I did it on the one lower) although that will likely be my last playthrough as it's a linear game and they're not really designed for it.All in all I'd definitely recommend the game, it's a true singleplayer RPG with a wicked combat system, lovely visuals and a story that doesn't leave a bad taste in the mouth afterwards!8/10.

												Bound By Flame is an action rpg in core.Gameplay consists of alot of combat, which while not beeing great works and feels responsive. Balancing is a bit of and your perhaps better of choosing ""easy"" to start (changing later on when ur better and understand mechanics better). In the classic term you will progress alot, there's loot everywhere, there's exp to gain everywhere and you can shape your char in many ways. there are 3 distincs talent-trees and also the possiblity, similiar to The Witcher, to change your weapon-style in combat (fluid). Loot can be broken down into it's pieces, which is great initself cause you can still make use of items even when you don't need em anymore, and new gear, potions, etc. can then be craftet from said pieces.armor and weapons can be further modified by crafting and later on will offer quite some choices on how to build your char. there's also sorta mini ""achievments"", like killing x mobs with magic, which then can unlock new passive boosts for your char. all in all itemization and char-progression are well done, range combat, magic, meele all feels very fluid. you will also be able to take on of the many npc-companions with you while exploring and fighting, which can be given orders on how to handle battles. what makes the game is the story, the writing and the (english) voice-work. the story is quite interesting and feels mature, seeing as how you don't get one silly expotion after another. npcs tend to use curse-words, are not ""well""-spoken and compliment the gritty game setting quite well. your ""hero"" isn't a cliche anti-hero and lots of the story-dynamics hail also from him struggling with his own little problem. there's one major choice which will affect how the story plays out, your protagonist behaves and even how he looks (tryin to avoid spoilers). npc-followers are interesting themselves, ranging from a ages old undead over a sorta ""naiv"" kinda scholar bride, a rundown warrior who seeks glory/or death? and and and.over all story and conversations are very well done and offer the strong point in this game.clearly the production quality is not what you would expect from some big publisher, areas and visuals in general are not top of the class and can look a tad run down, chars tend to have blocki and clunky animations and the game world is a gigantic tunnel map with branching paths. yet still the game offeres some amazing moments and you would be wrong just to avoid it cause of some negativ reviews it might have got. i can definitly recommend Bound By Flame, perhaps not with a full price tag, but a mediocre ""sell"".The Spiders Studios pac is quite a good offer on the other hand Mars: War Logs, Of Orcs and Men and Bound by Flame are quite some good value for the price.

Feeling about cheated out of my money right now.  This is the negative.  Lackluster graphics that I would have expected on a console version like Xbox 360 or even a gen before that possibly.  The game even still has some micro stuttering issues and even after tweaking my graphics card it still has problems under adaptive settings.  To make matters worse, the combat is bland with slow movements, bad configuration of blocking and parrying, and the game is abusive in a bad way.  Even under easy mode the game feels like a Darksouls knock off.  It just doesn't do it very good and the story is pretty bland.  I just didn't like this one at all, and the offensive attitudes of the characters weren't likeable.  They in fact succeeded in putting me in a pretty bad mood for the rest of the day.			"

The entire combat is based around parrying enemy attacks. God help you if you miss one parry because a single hit quiet often takes a quarter to a third of your health at any point in the game. All the while your attacks take slivers off enemy health with buffs and crits. The game often throws multiple enemies at you while your partner stumbles around like a drunk retard. More than 2 enemies and it becomes too fast to parry. Get ready for lots of reloading and trying the same group all over again because someone got passed a parry and stumbled you. God just stay away from this garbage of game.			"

												Before you look at my non-recommendation, hear me out. I would probably recommend this game if it came down to about $20-$25. I say this because the combat really isn't my cup of tea. I get that it does take a little more precision than what we're used to in hack and slash games, but this just gets repetitive and ultimately boring. Also there's no class system, (because god forbid we play a role in a roleplaying game). However, the big redeeming quality in this game is its story telling. I haven't had party members or a world this memorable since Mass Effect 2 guys. Still, if your looking for a good hack-n-slash rpg that attempts to beef up the hack-n-slash portion, I highly recommend Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. Seriously that game gets no love.			"

												Alright let me first start off with this, there are much better action RPG's in the world of steam. This game just feels extremely linear and pretty bland and generic. Nothing really WOWS me about it... The plot is bland and has been done countless times. (Insert badguy faction here) is attacking us and we are dieing and stuffs only the power of (random chosen destiny type magic ability out of nowhere) can save us. The combat is very clumsy and the voice acting... oh the voice acting.. heck even the dialog is bad.. Imagine you are watching Lord of the Rings and Legolas ends his let your arrow fly true line with ""ya crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!"" or if half the cast just read from a script with no accent :P then you have this game...bottom line is, even though I got this game in a group package I still regret it.

												Graphics wise the game is beast, but overall you can tell the game was somewhat rushed. Only one of the three endings goes into detail about what happens afterwards. The other two endings left me saying ""What, thats it? ... seriously?"" Going demon gives you two blah endings. Going human gives you one detailed ending, and one blah ending that is shared with the demon ending. Overall its not a bad game, but the fighting system seemed clunky at times. There is definitely a learning curve. The game was challenging even on the easiest setting. I gave up on normal after I died like 20 times in the swamps. They don't explain the crafting system very well so I had a difficult time at first since I hadn't upgraded any of my gear.  They also don't tell you that you can buy potions in town for cheaper than you can make them. Crafting materials usually aren't worth buying in town because gold is very limited, especially early on in the game. The game gets an overall 7/10 from me.			"

												Now, I've only been playing for about 92 minutes of this game so far; and from what I've seen? I can make an accurate 'assumption' on how I feel the game to be. You can decide for yourself if this is helpful or not.The game feels like a typical RPG hack 'N slash, there are aspects of it that feel sort of like Dark Souls with the way that combat feels--only without the dodging and dying every five seconds, which I did, alot. Dying, I mean, not dodging--but instead of an annoying dodge mechanic (like so many other games, including MMORPGs, are attempting to utilize and failing miserably) they incorporate a split between a parry and a dodge. Depending on which stance you're utilizing.Parrying and blocking works the same way as it did in Dark Souls, can block an attack or you can hit it at the right moment and disrupt their attack and stun the enemy. But unlike in Dark Souls, where you had to physically attack to get the riposte, in this game it happens automatically as a reward for doing it successfully--and it does the same thing with dodging as well.The combat in this game is true to many RPGs, it is an active combat--meaning you have to be FACING your enemy and hitting the buttons to damage the enemy, you have to be aware if they have a shield up and you have ques alerting you when an enemy is about to unleash a POWERFUL ability. Which are ALL very nice touches and one of the reasons why I'll probably stick to this game for awhile yet.In most games designed like these (such as Of Orcs and Men and Game of Thrones), even the easiest difficulties are extremely hard--enemies are like tanks and you feel more like a 'poke to death' rather than an actual brutal warrior. In this game? They didn't go that route--they made the enemies health stay in comparison depending on which skills you branch into, but they do considerably LESS damage depending on how low the difficulty is.Now, I'm a person who doesn't like challenging combat. I'm far more interested in the storyline than in any difficult, or tactical battle. I want to just charge in, obliterate all the enemies, feel like a badass, and progress the story. And this game allows me to HAVE that, whilst also having it's own challenge--but it's at a degree to which I like. DO NOTE, however, that I AM playing the game on Recruit because, as I said, I don't really like challenging combat or combat that forces tactics. I'm a casual gamer, not a hardcore strategist.All in all, it's a VERY good game--I noticed NO bugs whatsoever whilst playing it. I definitely give this game a recommended feel. You might like it, might not.And for those of you who might be asking... yes, you CAN change the difficulty of the game whilst playing on the fly. So if a fight is too easy? Make it harder! Is it kicking your ♥♥♥? Make it easier! And it has FULL controller support, giving a seamless flow between both an X-Box Controller as well as Keyboard/Mouse.Even with the graphics turned low for me (as my computer is not the best) the game's quality doesn't degrade from the experience whatsoever.Definitely a game you'd want to add to your library, if, for nothing else, a bit of challenging variety from the staple that most games in this day and age are flowing towards. Less emphasis on perfect spot-on reflexes and more emphasis on a more casual pace in fighting.Oh, and a last piece of advice--Bosses hurt. Alot. Don't get hit by them.Ow, my face.			"

												So, I saw that Technomancer was coming out soon and decided to give this game a shot before it came out to see if the developer was any good. Sadly I probably wont buy Technomancer because of this game.Pros - Weapon Customization, Story has decent premise, Interesting idea for main protaganist, decent art.Cons - Animations are god awful, Voice acting is meh to bad, combat is god awful (Granted I was a warrior, I can see the combat being alil better as a ranger with a dodge.) Characters are forgettable, story even with a decent premise fell short, Serious lack of enemy types.My biggest issue with this game is the tedious nature of the enemies, especially the minibosses/bosses everyone of them has an AOE and they can end up just spamming it over and over again so it basically goes like this, run in and hit the boss 2-3 times depending on weapon than run out rinse repeat for 3 minutes and that if they are alone. Everything has so much life that you question how your character is supossed to be powerful, you hit like a freaking mesquito with a 2 hander.... Anyway I trudged through this game all the way to the last boss, and when I got the last boss to 20% and died because I grew tired of the tediousness of the fight I decided its just not worth my time, Ill just go watch a youtube video if I want to see the ending.

												Really thought it was quite good. Not perfect, but all right. I found myself enjoying Chapters 1 and 2 and was prepared to give it a thumbs up. That is IF it weren't for the horrible end boss. Bosses are hard to do properly and BbF certainly failed at this point. While other bosses before that are easily manageable the last boss inexplicably ramps things up without balance or proportion. You could say the difficulty jumps from 0 to 100 which is really frustrating and I found myself dieing over and over which previously didn't happen. Anyways, I'll say that you can go ahead and buy the game IF it's on sale for at least 75% off AND IF you're 100% resistant to frustration...throw in a little bit of borderline tendencies and this is your game.Personally I can't be bothered to try and beat the boss again so I can reach the ending; painful as it is to me as passionate gamer BbF will forever remain unfinished in my library...

												Though it doesn't really stand out as a triple A title, for those that like a good challange and a little humor with thier story this game hits home. It's mostly a hybrid of Dragon's Age and Dark Souls, which gives it a good mix of challange and skill. However, that being said, the game is not without it bugs and glitchs. Though the fighting system is fun, there are times when it will have you slamming your keyboard against your desk because of small bugs in hit detection or bad AI reaction to damage. Over all though it is a solid game, and easily playable even with the bugs. For anyone out that that likes Dragon's Age/Fable/Dark Souls/ect this is a game for you, great storyline with a few hiccups blended in too...			"

												TLDR: Bound by Flame is bound by design 4/10. Why they think this is a good combat system and even used it again in their newest sucky game Technomancer is beyond me because nobody likes that game either.First, I have around 15 hours in this game and Steam is displaying my time played incorrectly. Second, they thought they were clever with their combat system from Mars War Logs but it sucked and they went ahead and put it in this game anyway. $40 new (I paid $20) for fifteen hours of completely linear gameplay with no reason whatsoever to play the game ever again after you beat it is a joke. I paid $20 and feel ripped off. $10 would be more fair. It is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played because the combat is just not very good at all, just weird, and I was not often enjoying it until the last boss. It is so bad that I said F it and am now looking for a trainer to cheat and beat the boss then uninstall this dog crap for good. I was doing well, eventually beating all of the enemies in the game but this game is just unacceptable on the last battle and I am in no way ashamed to say I am just tired of this game and am getting a trainer for it. I do not care. The only thing I am ashamed of is to say I wasted $20 on this game. I have no doubt that if I actually tried a few more times I could beat the last boss but I am just so sick of this I do not care anymore. Every battle is insanely hard, and not exactly always in a good way. The game can still manage to be fun if you are a very skilled gamer and have a astronomical amount of patience, and I do not have much of the latter. The fetch quests and general running around is insanely boring and feels pointless even though it isn't. Everything is incredibly easy other than the combat. Find something, click mouse 1 to pick it up, take it back to person, add some dog crap awful combat mechanics in, and there you go. Oh and by the way, even on the LOWEST difficulty, the last boss fight is nearly impossible. I had said before that the worst final boss fight in the history of video games was Cavestory+ but this one takes the cake. Whatever tiny bit of fun I was having throughout the game was crushed when I got to the last boss fight. It blows my mind that it is not the chief complaint about the game among all of the user reviews. The combat in the game sucks. Even fights against weak enemies put you at such a disadvantage that it will be a chore to beat them, and it is all because of the controls, how you feel like you are fighting on the moon but the enemies get to attack at normal speed.Oh and a problem equal to everything else is how short it is. It is supposed to be a $40 third person rpg and it is only about 15 hours long and is 100% linear with no point ever playing through it twice, not ever. It is a 100% ripoff. The other problem is that the skill trees completely suck, all three of them. They barely add any improvements to your character and the improvements that the skill trees do add are stupid and nearly useless. And when you get new weapons and armor throughout the game, their stats only increase a point at a time. The one-point increase that a new piece of gear gives is negated by the fact that enemies gain strength as the game goes on. The weapon and armor that I ended the game with felt the exact same as the basic ones I started with, because they basically are. You never do more dmg, you never prevent more dmg, and the skill trees offer nearly no help.Seriously fk this, this game is a prime example of why piracy exists and why not nearly as many people pre-order games as they did five years ago. If the devs for this game are smart they will do it right in the future and scrap this game's awful combat system, if they even made enough money off of this game to make anything else.4/10 combat engine0/10 last boss fight3/10 skill trees are nearly useless0/10 armor/weapon upgrades because of enemy strength scaling negating any improvements3/10 length. actually since it sucks so bad I give the length a 9/10, should've been even shorter lol5/10 overallThey need to seriously scrap this game's combat engine and make a new one for their next game.

												Half of the combat is getting stunlocked. The rest of it is abusing the parry/riposte mechanic. The warrior tree is almost unusable due to slow swing speeds of the weapons and the ease with which the enemy can stunlock you. In addition, the enemy is much harder to stunlock, which creates this awkward situation where you can just get wailed on by a group of 4-5 enemies with archers in the back and all you can do is hold space and pray. It's almost impossible ot get into the game. Novel concepts with the armor melting and equipment modifications but poor execution overall. Shame too, I was so excited when they announced the game.

												I have strongly conflicting feelings about this one.Game has pretty much only one  NEGATIVE,  but it’s a big one, the combat mechanics. They are incredibly uneven across existent skill branches. Combat here is all about blocking, dodging, parrying and interrupting. But the only way to parry is to time your block or dodge to the very last second. Blocking can only be done in warrior stance and dodging only in rouge stance.Magical branch gets a defense buffing spell which barely does anything, and is close to useless thanks to cooldown and mana regen being what it is. And if you thinking about rolling to the side that’s just not a thing in this game. What kills me here is that there are achievements tied to unlocking each branch to 100%, so you would think that investing heavily in either branch is equally valid approach, BUT IT’S NOT. (Side note - with both XP increasing perks and doing all side missions by the end I was level 26, which isn’t max level, with grand total of 50 skills points to spend in any branch. To fully open either branch takes 36 points, so to get 3 achievements for all branches, that’s 3 playtrues. It’s just not worth it, don’t do that to yourself).And interrupting is the whole thing with some skills have it, some don’t. Some weapons being better at it, some worse, while some not even having it altogether. So pay attention to this stat because you will need it during boss fights.:phew: … Now me being done with that rant on to the  POSITIVES  of this game, which kind of include everything else.

												I have strongly conflicting feelings about this one.Game has pretty much only one  NEGATIVE,  but it’s a big one, the combat mechanics. They are incredibly uneven across existent skill branches. Combat here is all about blocking, dodging, parrying and interrupting. But the only way to parry is to time your block or dodge to the very last second. Blocking can only be done in warrior stance and dodging only in rouge stance.Magical branch gets a defense buffing spell which barely does anything, and is close to useless thanks to cooldown and mana regen being what it is. And if you thinking about rolling to the side that’s just not a thing in this game. What kills me here is that there are achievements tied to unlocking each branch to 100%, so you would think that investing heavily in either branch is equally valid approach, BUT IT’S NOT. (Side note - with both XP increasing perks and doing all side missions by the end I was level 26, which isn’t max level, with grand total of 50 skills points to spend in any branch. To fully open either branch takes 36 points, so to get 3 achievements for all branches, that’s 3 playtrues. It’s just not worth it, don’t do that to yourself).And interrupting is the whole thing with some skills have it, some don’t. Some weapons being better at it, some worse, while some not even having it altogether. So pay attention to this stat because you will need it during boss fights.:phew: … Now me being done with that rant on to the  POSITIVES  of this game, which kind of include everything else. Overall design is pretty thought thru, like wooden scabbard for heavy weapon somebody had to come up with that. Soundtrack is beautiful, visual style is lovely. Maps feel very much hand crafted, but considering that there isn’t a lot of them that’s not very impressive.

												This game is not to be confused with another game with a similar title called (Bound by Flamers), which is a game about writing game reviews, the goal of (Bound by Flamers) is to write the most flaming reviews on every game you can until you reach the title of ""Prince of Flamers""  and thus beating the game and reaching flamedom.

												The skill tree in this game makes progression one of the most boring RPG experiences I've ever had. The story telling is slow and unimaginative. The graphics are decent though, and the gameplay combat is nice and fluid, but it's simple and easy even on the highest difficulty.

												SCREW THIS GAME. It s*cks bigtime. It's REALLY BAD. And not even the ""good"" kind of bad, like Ride to Hell Rettibution or Rogue Warrior, games which are so stupid and ridiculous, that they're hilarious. Nope. This is almost all bad, all the time: boring, bland, uninteresting and not fun at all. It has almost no redeeming factor. Where to f***ing start? The story... I never thought it was anything to write home about when I read the synopsis, but...this is just s*it. It looks like a horribly written, lame-*ss knock-off of G.R.R.M.'s work. Except the zombies in here don't even have anything to do with ice, despite them being animated by 7 ICE Lords. There's not even any winter (as far as I played). Why the f**k do they even call them Ice Lords????The voice-acting...HORRENDOUS. Everyone talks either like a robot or like they're high on every opiate known to man. The dialogue options make Bioware's wheel of responses feel like a masterpiece. So it wasn't enough that the story was s*it, they also ♥♥♥♥ed up the story-telling with some truly idiotic dialogue. Way to f**king go...Possibly the worst part of the game is the combat system. I have NEVER seen a game like this that can try so hard and succede to make you look  like a total pus*y when playing it. I know it's supposed to be an RPG first and foremost, but...NO, JUST NOOOOOO!! I never thought I'd see a real time, sword swinging combat that can actually manage to feel more boring, unintuitive and unnatural than turn-based combat. Why does my dumb-*ss, supposedly highly trained, meat-head mercenary character swing his sword like an old man with congestive heart disease that forgot his beta blockers at home? (doctor humor ha ha :-p ) And why is there almost no ammo for the cross-bow in all the terain I managed to cover in the 4 hours I managed to last through this game before I got thoughts of suicide? Despite the cross-bow being much more effective than the pathetic melee weapons in this game. And why do all monsters have pathetically telegraphed attacks to warn you when you have to dodge or block? And why can't I jump or dive-roll? This is HORIRBLE. I'm not asking for spectacle fighter level of combat, like in the DMC or GoW series, but... I dunna,  they could have just riped-off the combat system from the Arkham games. ANYTHING WOULD BE BETTER THAN THIS! I mean, WB has no shame in rehashing it in all of its other sand-box games and they didn't patent it or anything. Fable did a much better job in 2004. There's a similar, semi-obscure low-budget pseudo-RPG called Venetica that also did it better. There's no excuse for it!!!!! And since we're on the subject, this is a f**king RPG, right?  Why the f**k is it linear as hell and with horrible corridor-based level design? It should have been a sand-box, ffs... Even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ flame demon powers are a joke. Most of them are useless, even the ones that aren't, they waste ALL mana after aproximately 3 casts. And it takes FOREVER to recharge. Because I'm sure that someone getting possessed by a demon, does it so he can look like more of a worthless pu*sy. The leveling-up and character progression system is also bland, stupid, lame and boring. I s**t you not, there's actually a feat that you put a single point in and increases sword damage by 2. WOW!!!! Don't even get me started on the useless daggers and the stealth system, which is more broken and useless than in Fallout 3. Don't get me wrong: the game is EXTREMELY difficult, but for ALL the WRONG reasons: clunky combat with sh*t controls. Almost all fights are won through trial and error and attrition: chaining 2-3 stabbs with one block or dodge and rincing and repeating about 10-12 times until the enemy dies. I am totally serious when I say  I had a fight with 4 guys that actually lasted about 10 minutes. Yeah...I timed it. Thus, the fun-factor is almost ZERO. Why do all the games want to be Dark Souls? If you're going to rip-off a classic, at least do it right, ffs.. Being hard and unforgiving is not the same as being unfair, stupid and not fun.The graphics are unimpressive, but serviceable. But even that little piece of praise goes out the window, because the game is optimized like ♥♥♥ and manages to actually run worse than much better looking similar games, such as Shadow of Mordor. Of course...So is there anything good I can say about this game, you ask? Well, there's the music. Yeah...as much as I'd want to bash this too, I have to admit: it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ing sweet. It suits the general atmosphere and feel of the game perfectly and was actually soothing enough to keep me from throwing my monitor out the window in rage of this awful garbage. Does it redeem the game at all? F**K NO. It'd be like re-watching Frozen, just because you like ""Let It Go"" (well, Frozen is actually a pretty good movie, especially for Disney standards and comparing it to this game is quite harsh and unfair, but I wanted to highlight the idea that music can't make you like something you don't have any other reason to like).Conclusion: It's not by any chance, the worst game I've played, but it's actually the first one that made me want to be able to get a refund. I got it for 6 euro, which was an 80% discont and I still feel I over-payed A LOT. You really have to have a lot of nerve and some balls of steel to charge 30 euro for this game... Alas, I played 4 hours of if, so it's too late now. Probably never will again. STAY AWAY! FAR, FAR AWAY. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this game, like I did.Score: 4 out of 10 - PRETTY ♥♥♥♥ING BAD			"

												This feels like an unfinished game that had the last act developed by an entirely different studio, simply because the original studio went ""♥♥♥♥ it, cant be bothered, you finish it""Hitboxes are terrible, sometimes being almost twice the length of the visible weapon or attack, sometimes missing attacks that are right in your face (these are less common though, mostly just on the rarer enemies like the Mimic things)Dialogue and voice acting is passable at best, god awful at worst, and the subtitles have a tendency to include words that arent said, and have a good number of subtle typos.The game claims to have 'every choice count' when in all seriousness most of the choices are menial, with only one or two choices per act (of the three Acts, too) meaning ♥♥♥♥, and most of the other smaller choices being unable to change your mind or take back for no good reason. (What do you mean i cant go 'oh wait, i DO suspect you' just because i told the dude i 'trusted' him. Bull ♥♥♥♥ reason whatsoever)The trailer above (first one) shows far faster and more fluid and responsive (and fair) gameplay than the game even is, with most of the fights being a 15 minute long shitfight because half the enemies in the game have a healthbar youd expect to find in a JRPG... except they arent difficult regardless. Its a pointless combat lengthening technique that doesnt serve anything but to emphasise the tedium this game has. It has three skill trees, but make no mistake, you WILL jack of all trades if you try to focus on all three.Your character is a very preset character, make no mistake, you have very few faces, very few hairs, and despite what GAMESRADAR (shame on you, Mass Effect is nothing like this ♥♥♥♥) might imply, your character has a VERY set personality. You dont get to be a super nice and friendly merc, you just get to choose what level of Renegade you want to be. Either the reckless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME1-2 renegade, or the ""♥♥♥♥ all my friends' ME3 renegade, if you WANT to use Mass Effect as a comparison.The fights are at best tedious, and at worst blatantly unbalanced. All the difficulty this game has comes from the amount of cluster♥♥♥♥ the fights are. The bosses that you fight alone are trivial at their hardest and pose very little challenge, but the smaller groups of enemies fought between can be either not too hard, to downright obnoxious. Quite frequently chucking a bunch of enemies at you with large(r) healthbars and extremely spammy attacks. Come ACT3 (Which is where my first sentence came from) and you will be fighting ONE enemy composition. Well, if you want to be specific, three, but its not different enough to count. Literally, its one or two different enemies in the group, but still basically the same fight. All involved are just a lot of AoE spam. Oh, and the archers can literally shoot arrows at you WHILE THEYRE RUNNING AWAY AND THEIR BOW ISNT EVEN DRAWN. OUT OF THEIR ♥♥♥♥. AND ITLL SLOW YOU DOWN, SO YOU COULDNT EVEN CATCH THEM IF YOU WANTED.Boss fights are quite simple, very rarely posing any real challenge, except for the final boss, where the only difficulty is artificial difficulty created by a stupidly long fight that is just two boring phases over and over again.Only good thing i can say about this game is that the graphics arent terrible. Sure, youd hope for more back in 2014, but not terrible.(also, i DID complete the whole game, before anyone claims i gave up and just made this review out of rage. i dont regret the time i spent playing the game, but i wouldnt recommend it)TLDR: If you were looking at this game, and thinking it looks and sounds like a Action RPG version of Dragon Age or similar, look elsewhere. If youre looking for a balanced, well rounded and engaging game, look elsewhere. If youre looking for a Dark Soulsy game but made with different minds behind it, look elsewhere. If youre looking for a punishing game that does very little to recommend itself, and quite often beats you into the ground with very little blame laying on the player... well... enjoy. I guess.			"

												Trust the review rating.Hollow. Barely even qualifies as an rpg, all relationship and plot choices act like something will happen but for the most part never change anything. It feels a like a regular linear campaign pretending to be an rpg.Unfininshed. It's blatantly obvious the entire game that they planned to do a lot more and scrapped most of it. So instead a complete smaller scale game, we have a medium game with nothing but fetch quests to eat up time, and unfullfilled build up.Glitchy. Various, but to give you and idea: There is ""light"" function in the game for when it is night or to otherwise illuminate dark places. During my game it stopped working in the first 4th of the game and never worked after that. Meaning that the game not only looked very ugly whenever it was dark, but was also difficult to play. About half of the remaining game took place in dark or very low light enviroments.Unwieldly. The combat feels rushed. It entirely lacks what I call ""game feel"", or how closly what you try to do matches what actually happens on screen. It's very frustrating trying to fight that disconnect when you are having to combat multiple enemies at once who can kill you in a second if you fail a block or parry. Later this far too often means you have to play very cautiously spamming ranged skills, while getting in single melee hits during the very short openings.It's not like I had no fun at all, but in retrospect I wouldn't have bought it and I would never recommend it.

												I've played through this game two times now, and the story is very scripted. It just replaces some of your followers or alters your appearance along with a few demon buffs if you go the easy way. Combat is enjoyable, but only on recruit difficulty. Ranger stance with daggers and fire blades with interrupt seem to do the trick. Guard break with a two handed sword is good against shielded enemies as well. Doesn't look like this game will get DLC either, sad :(I'd recommend something like kingdoms of amelur instead, it is less glitchy and has more depth			"

												I think its a good game, heres why:The graphics are good while not amazing but they are very original. My only main criticism here is of the graphics the protagonist/playable characer have. He simply looks stupid and ugly in a lame not cool way. Thats a area that could be greatly improved.The combat is very fun it has lots of elements like traps and several fighting styles and also some magic. The boss fights seem very hard.There is also a cool item system which I didnt get indepth with YET but you can upgrade your weapons.And there is lots of loots from your slain enemies and in chest and so on so you can find many nice items to help your quest.The story isn't so good but its very  rare IMO to find a game which has a great story. So it's not a big detractor I think.Overall a very enjoyable Action RPG game.8/10			"

Great visuals and storyline, but the cinematics and voice acting is quite dull.
This is an insanely hard game, the combat is something that makes you take your time and focus on parrying much like the first Assassin's Creed, only with way longer boss battles.
No matter how high of a level/strength you get the enemies always seem to be stronger, never making you feel empowered.
I couldn't for the life of me beat the final boss, even on normal difficulty so I just gave up, put enough hours into the game.
If your a hardcore Dark Souls or Dragon Age fan, I'd check it out.

												Bound By Flame – ReviewBy GMCamulosGenre: RPGPlatform: PC, PS4, PS3, 360Publisher: Focus Home InteractiveDeveloper: SpidersWhen creating a game what do I want to add? A nice dash of action, some good graphics, great sound in both music/ambient and voice acting, a nice control system, a hint of swearing, a little somethin’ somethin’ for the guys, and conversely nice looking guys for the ladies out there, some good story elements, nice character progression and levelling and a metric tonne of other small little things that fill in the gaps between the aforementioned.Now, can Bound By Flame find the right mix or has the ever omnipotent game master added a dash too much of one ingredient and not another?Gameplay:Bound By Flame was an interesting one pre-release. It looked like it had something really kicking for it. A nice combat style, a demon possessed player character (true we have seen a lot of those in the past), and hey, it was next-gen.What we got from it was a fun solid (in areas) next-gen RPG. The story for Bound By Flame is that your character is a member of a mercenary force called the Freeborn Blades that are trying to protect the world from the Icelords who slowly taking over and killing anything they come across. The Red Scribes who hired the mercs to protect them while they find an ancient temple and try to perform a ritual to help out… can we see where this is going?The ritual obviously has to go wrong cause is the start of the game and all, and your character is left with a very nice and friendly demon residing in him… I mean let’s see, how bad could that actually be right?The demon will eventually try to get you to make the choices which suit IT best, which can lead to a very interesting storyline as your companions will treat you differently if they think you are turning evil. So should you embrace the evil and grow an awesome set of horns and look like you are constantly warming up people three towns away, or will you keep your humanity and make choices that help rather than hinder?Well if you go evil you will find that the demon can be a nice kick into the powerful meter, but the choice is yours.It’s just a pity that its strongest feature is a nice combat and skill system. The three skill trees are Ranger, Warrior and Pyromancer.I dare say you only spec into one of the Ranger or Warrior classes depending on how you want to play but some of the Pyro skills are very complimenting, such as the ability to have a nice fire shield or even ignite your weapon for more damage.A quick warning before moving on, the game did kind of shock me the first time I met an elf and my whole opinion of how they can converse was tipped upside down. The occasional swear in a game is fine, but when half the cast will try to slip one in every third sentence, it drags away from it being a fantasy game and just tries to tip into a game for less mature players.And don’t get me started on the fact that one of your more… well-endowed female companions looks like she could be shivering just looking at a fridge given what she is wearing… I still don’t understand the need to make a female character in a game have less protection than a male character… breastplates on guys… yet a breastplate on a girl will cup the breasts and show them off… I just don’t get it…And given that there is crafting in the game I kind of wish there was more I could craft, though the recycle feature to get some materials back is a very handy touch to let you experiment with what you want to make and use/upgrade.Graphics:The game is next gen, so I would have liked to have seen a little more… pezaz? Don’t get me wrong, it’s still solid and I can’t really fault it, but it’s still just at a level that says… yeah, we know we are making things for next gen, but we need it to work on everything else at the same time.Nice little touches pop up here and there, such as the changes your character goes through the more you let your demonic inner voice take over… but its things we have seen before in other games.Sound:The sound is good, if we don’t talk about the lacking performance on the majority of companions. There is something to be said about your demon side and his influence and conversational chats, but the majority of the team seem to let me down. A nice casual chat while a player dies, no inflection of pain or regret, just “Yep I am dying…” ok, yeah, thanks… I mean, don’t say that, it’s not your time… bit more work could have gone into this side of the game, and I don’t just say that because I know a lot of voice actors who could use work *wink wink*Skill Levels and Controls:Bound By Flames combat never really had me at a point where I felt UBER as I quite often get to in other RPG’s. The game really does ease you into how the combat and levelling works at a nice solid pace in the first section, and just keeps going from there. On normal it still felt like the monsters of the world were levelling at the same time I was, it’s just that I was able to put points into my skill tree’s that continually allowed me to stay ahead of the curve. Some fights still gave me a bit of a headache, but still, nothing you can’t overcome.Your choice of companions can also help with battle and thus can complement or just strengthen your play style, bit of a choice there to help out as well.Replayability:With the amount of choices in the game, and deciding what you want to do, the game has a little replayability unless you want to see what it’s like to swap from allowing the demon to take over, or to be the man in charge all the way through. But it’s an RPG, when you know the story, you know the story. Nothing major is going to change from playing through it again. Last thoughts:I did enjoy Bound By Flame, it’s a great little RPG which does have a lot of merits. I do kind of wish the game was longer and had a bit more variety, but hey, on the whole I did enjoy it and had a lot of fun playing through it all the same.I give it 7 Demonic Possessions out of 10.

												After playing a bit longer I decided to re-write my review and make it a bit less confusing to read.Sadly for starters I still don't think this is a 40€ game but rather a max 20€ game but I do feel less bad about spending my money on it than I did this morning.I'll rather start with the negatives:- Graphics, even on highest setting, are not 2014 quality. But are they blinding bad? No. Just not what you'd expect from a brand new game with such price.- The character creation is still pure blasphemy. You can't have a RPG with such a limited character creation in modern gaming - pick from very few premade faces and hairstyles (in ONE color)? Yeah, no. This part for me is unforgiveable. - Very difficult combat which might turn the least patient or least skilled player away. The difficulty levels are not balanced like you'd expect them to be.- Animation issues such as character lip sync and lack of facial expressions: without holding back it looks absolutely terrible. One can easily get over this by not focusing on it but it's still baffling they didn't give more focus on this part.And now the positives:- The story and characters are interesting and unique. I saw few people mock the dialoque in their reviews but in my opinion it is absolutely genius. You rarely see such humor in RPG's and I personally find it very refreshing. I also want to give high points to the voice acting which goes hand in hand with the quirky dialoques.- As opposite of the negative: it offers lots of challenge what it comes to combat so if you seek a challenge this one is for you.- Simple yet fair crafting system + talent boost system.That is all. Now do I recommend this game? No, not right now. Not in the current price. When it's on sale? Absolutely.			"

												It feels to tedious, honestly i played a good hour or two of this game and from what it feels your companions are practically brain dead and can't fend for themselves, and the enemies have alot of health and i mean alot. Though this doesn't mean the game is bad this does mean the game is making the combat tedious. Though i do find the game challenging its mostly due to the fact, the heavy weapon doesn't feel like it has enough backing behind it and the daggers seem like the better option. And don't get me started on the crafting system... I wasn't even able to get to a town yet to buy potions before i threw down the controller since you need 12 tainted blood to make health potion. Doesn't seem to difficult right? wrong. You would have to literally farm from the undead horde if you wanted to make the health pots which makes the crafting entirely unsatisfying. Unless you want a game you want to continuely wacking monsters with a 2handed swords with no reward at al, play this game, if not stay far away... "

												Well, here is another half-@ssed game by Spiders, the masters of lies and deceit who think they are an AAA studio now because the graphics are not as ugly as before ( just look at the price of their next game, Technomancer... ). First thing first, the game doesn't look at all like the screenshots and presentations they did, it's quite ugly with that old PS3 feeling, characters look bad, environments look bad, animations are sh!it, post effects try to hide the uglyness but just make it even worse. Oh and don't forget the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cliché story, laughable voice acting and lip sync... They couldn't even make working quest markers, they constantly indicate the wrong location, or closed gates, and don't correspond to the actual quest tracked in the journal.And then there is the combat. Some say it's hard and challenging, while in fact it's clunky and downright unfair, as your character is always at a disadvantage simply because all the enemies are faster than you, hit harder, while you need to use all the resources at your disposal to take a single enemy down. Sometimes you hit them and don't even see their life bar diminishing, because your attacks are extremely weak, and theirs are devastating. And I play in EASY !So, if you're a masochist enjoying unfair difficulty and like to spend 10 minutes hitting a single enemy to take him down, go on, play this game, you'll love it.If you're a normal person, just take a hammer and smash your hand with it, it will have the same effect.

												This game is trash the combat system is a joke. i cannot understate my distaste for it the only thing that was done right with this production was the marketing. It is an utter waste of money avoid it like the plauge.combat system consists of hiting enemys once then dodgeing/blocking untill the enemy attacks rince repeat. enemys constantly attack with the exact same move but that does not matter as each of your attacks does about 5-8% of their hp and each of their attacks does 20-40% of yours. Combat does not flow at all as your attacks dont stop or slow enemy attacks enemys just keep attacking and with the difference in damage they will win a straight fight every time. If your idea of fun is nothing but spaming 1 attack then dodge or parry then this is the game for you. Garbage utter garbage anyone who says otherwise either has an agenda or has standards so low they think susan boyle is a bombshell.			"

												I picked up this gem recently and I'm really enjoying it!  It has a compelling storyline and lush graphics. It reminds me a lot of Dragon Age 2 and Witcher 2.   I'm playing the female Vulcan and I love her character.  At first, the flat Midwesern accent seemed somewhat out of place in a sword and sorcery setting, but it totally fits the deadpan snarky character of the Powder Master. It took me a bit to get the hang of combat, but once I did, it was pretty cool.  The crafting system is one of the best: it meshes excellently with the inventory system.  You aren't endlessly having to cart around a million crafting ingredients waiting to get to the one place where you can make an item.  Also, you aren't picking up a ton of gear.			"

												Bound By Flame, an RPG with darksouls difficulty combat and the coolest demon ever.*Spoilers pop up later, will give warning*So, let me just start off by saying, it's an indie game.  It takes alot for me to not be dissappointed by a game's parts, so for all means, this will be some ♥♥♥♥ thrown at the game itself.  Judging the game off its worst parts, it would be a terrible game.  If, however, you're willing to not be looking for a mass media level game, which this isn't, then you will be disappointed.  You run that risk on any games not made by the companies who have been doing this year after year.Spiders doesn't seem to have been in business all -that- long.  The only time I'd ever heard of them before was in Mars: Warlogs, which made me hesitant at first.  The voice acting and mechanics in Mars: Warlogs, were unrealistic and clunky respectively.  To point out a few things, the first few women I met in Mars: Warlogs made me want to gouge out my eyes, and the combat left me feeling like I was trying to throw a bag of meat out of the way of bullets while being constantly wrecked.  Thinking back on it, its mechanics may have been better suited to a medieval RPG.  That's where this game comes in.Once again, we live in clunk city for the combat.  As interesting as it was, as difficult as it may have been while still being possible, it was in the end a bit rediculous to use.  It wasn't the most aerodynamic thing, and for the life of me, I could never seem to get the parrying right.  Crossbows seemed vastly underpowered, and I only seemed to be able to find 3 different crossbows, though that could be because I didn't end up searching endgame corpses.  The game brings this back with its magic.  I loved the constant balancing between casting time and trying to formulate a plan of attack.  Trying to use only one of the branches would usually leave you pretty beat.  (Except the OP rangers, but they have bombs.)  Balancing magic casting times and sword swings, you had to be able to think on your feet in order to dodge, block, and flame your way to victory.  This aspect could be re-done so many times, its replayability is quite nice.  The combat, overall, was a good thing.*WARNING, SPOILERS BELOW*What wasn't so good, was the storytelling and the arcs you were forced into.  I realize the game has to be created around a story and allowing people to make choices causes you to have to script more, but did you really have to make sure the same events took place regardless?  And then, in the end, you come down to two answers. . . based on a question you were asked near the beginning.  Now, that is ludicrous for two reasons.  Firstly, their question was near the beginning of the game, meaning your endings were decided right next to the beginning, with no questions about it in between.  Secondly, they asked you whether or not you wanted to use a demon's power.  Not only did they never ask how far you would use it, but they never warned you that you would lose all humanity.  They said your souls would combine, and warned that you might lose humanity, but in the end, even with all the horns and burning skin, your character still SPEAKS human, and still ACTS human, with fire of course, but not much else.  They try to tell us that we lose control or something if we take the demon path, which is BS.  The way I had seen it, there honestly should've been the chance to oh. . . I don't know. . . GIVE YOUR LIFE LIKE A MARTYR?  I honestly thought that was where they were going.  They said that the demon could grant powers, and others encouraged you to use it.   To save humanity that is.  And in the end, it's like star wars, and you became the Sith. . . without meaning to in the slightest.  That seems quite unfair, honestly.  And yet, it caused me to play the game again, so I must be the idiot in this situation.  Even after all that, and I mean, for a while, that made me mad, I did think back on it, and it does make sense.  I relate it to the holocaust, honestly, because for so long, the humans in this story, much like the Jewish in WWII were hunted down, and exterminated.  But what could they have lost in trying to break free?  Most who were killed, to their dying breath, still stood for what they believed in, and when they died, they died in peace.  Honestly, the option to become a demon shouldn't have even been an option, because that purpose the humans have, it could've become far more prominent.  And that's why I find it more a broken feature than a folly in itself.  It's forgivable.The music is among some of the best I've heard lately.  I want to know what language the songs are in so bad.  The final battle, I lived for that moment when my heart started beating heavily, and the mirror demon began to fight our protagonist.  And suddenly, it was all over.  And it felt like it was over.  It left no room for idiocy, though space for another game.  They let you wrap up with everyone, and that feels like it was important.  You could see the ending knowing everything was over.Now, to relate this game to a mega corporation's product like Dragon Age, that'd be too harsh on this game.  Currently, anyways.  But it was worth a try, and I for one have been impressed by the powder master, Vulcan, and his adventure.  I look forward to seeing if Spiders gets even better for their next game.			"

												This game certainly has issues, but I've enjoyed it. The writing is bad, and a lot of the voice acting is pretty bad too. The combat is reasonably entertaining, though, and I even if the writing is poor the feel of the setting is sometimes compelling (it's sort of like Myth: The Fallen Lords and the Witcher had a baby, thematically). And honestly, when they're not taking themselves so freaking seriously sometimes the writers have even managed to make me laugh aloud. Bottom line: buy it on sale if you need something to whet your appetite for the Witcher 3.			"

The one thing that i hated so much about this game was the voice acting. On every cutscene the horrendus voice acting burns my eyes and ears. There is a lack of cohhesiveness throughout the game. If you are okay with expression less voice acting and stupid conversation or dont mind skipping everything and just grinding through the game then its a game for you.Well since i bought it i skip all cutscenes and miss the whole story, just to play the game so that i can get my moneys worth.I would not recommend this game.

												This ""RPG"" is by far one of worst that I've ever played in my life . Although the storyline & quests are generally productive , the talent & growth of the character is too limited . Firstly , there are not much of an equipment to choose from . You literally can't craft/buy any superior weapons/armors . Secondly , there is poor talent & development growth in the character . (Codename Vulcan) You can only max 1 out of 3 classes and there is little room for OP-ness . Thirdly , the difficulty is rigged . Anything beyond ""Normal"" is insane when it comes to killing monsters , as these monsters can kill you in just 2-3 hits . Needless to say , it is technically suicide when you face bosses . You basically rely on your potions throughout the whole game , which kind of defeats the purpose since RPG players would love more on action and making their character invincible . Lastly , I find that the game is too short as you could literally count the number of bosses you fight with one hand . Much disappointment experienced , seeing how I completed the game in just ONE day (I basically grinded the game for 20+ hours non-stop) and that it is overpriced for such a low-standard game .			"

												To begin  graphics , the half of textures is 2d, however not much there to see in environment.Scenario is not more constructed than I saw, adventure goes, even one instant an escape of zombies ? After what king kong come in the base and fight butterfly?Scenario does not give the choice, yes, there is a bar to choose texts, but the building of texts is the same, it is type, 1. aggressive, 2. aggressive 3. aggressive, there is therefore no choice it is only a phantasm, any freedom of choice also in our companions, you collaborate with sorceresses who like massacre? furthermore you must listen to the unpleasant texts of your companion chosen on your place.The principal character is malicious cruelly, he would have even been able to play the villain in game.The gameplay is rather well, but the resistance of the armor is unusfull, you must use every 2 seconds a potion of life in a combat. All enemies are strong, not 1 is more suc* than other one, skills are unusfull seen by the damage is weak, the armor are unsufull, the armor not improve your defence, however having bought from dear price dear a blacksmith.One of the most poor games that I saw. 1/10EDIT : After about 5 hours pasts in game, I can finally conclude that game is not bad, not complety poor. Loot became interesting, the treasure hunt reinforces the desire to play. The partners begin numerous therefore the choice is large. The competences  make useful in battle, but mines rest the best manner of fighting lol, but if we fight with the whole, it is possible of  defend. But have to search pleasure in a game made the game an game not finished , to take example, dragon age inquisition composes very the good points of a  rpg, I shall have like to see the same contents in the  game, with different story, like the one in the game, but with the dragon age gameplay. History and not so badly, she begins becoming interesting, because the quests was exclusivly of help and I like to help. I come back therefore on my note which is 5/10.			"

												I don't usually write reviews, and in fact this may be the first one I have ever written. However I felt the need to warn naive optimists like myself:PLEASE. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT IS NOT FINISHED.PROS:-A pretty good soundtrack.-Promising concept that led me to purchase it in the first place.-A darn good trailer.-Okay graphics (except for the character models).CONS:*clears throat*-Character animations look like they were made with one hand whilst the dev simultaneously had an existential crisis and wasn't able to give them his full attention in the face of how terrible his/her life must have been to find themselves working on such a sh***y game.-The voice acting is BAAAAD. Not just bad, it's BAD. Like in the sort of completely immersion breaking, IMPOSSIBLE to ignore bad. Yes, it is that bad. Hey, also- LIPS DO NOT SYNC UP TO THE AUDIO. E V E R. It's a nice touch. (*coughs blood*)-Combat is slower and more frustratingly boring than watching an old lady covered in cold molasses cross the street whilst tripping every five steps (who dies of old age before she can even get to the other side of the road).-The characters are stereotypical idiots with little to no thought put into them. There's (A) Gruff McGrufferson, your Captain, (B) Bit****ts McGee, the obvious romance who is shown as the damsel in distress TWO TIMES in the first 15 -- no, FIVE minutes that you first see her, Random-Ally-Idiot-You-Don't-Care-About versions A through Z, and of course you, (C) the cocky over-confident a****** who inexplicably got kinda strong offscreen before the game started and now thinks he's king of the world. I didn't say he/she here because the main character's dialogue is all from the perspective of a haughy muscular man, and they copy and paste it to the female MC playthrough. They did not even try to make a female perspective for their main character. Jesus, it's even worse than FemShep in Mass Effect 3. (JK Mass Effect is a TRILLION times better than this game)-The menus are confusing as all get out. I took one look at the skill trees and ♥♥♥♥ myself out of fear of going insane and wasting my life caring about them. The only points I invested were in the skills that made my dagger combo faster so that I could one button mash my way through this nightmare a tiny bit faster.SUMMARY:This game is a pile of cow dung that woefully proabably was going to be pretty sweet at some point, but then their publisher said ""no, f**k you guys we want character customization and skill trees"" so it went from being a Witcher/Dragon's Dogma kind of sword fighting game to a hairbrained rushed mess that ended up so terrible I had to delete it after just an hour of playing it. That or the developers just didn't give a flying f**k. Thank GOD I didn't buy this for full price and only gave GabeN $5 for it.DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.THIS GAME IS NOT FINISHED.			"

Sure, you can play this game with an upgraded sword, but this unforgiving ♥♥♥♥ throws you into the game expecting you to understand combat. Look, Dark Souls is one of my favourite games... I can understand unforgiving games, but this game THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME does it wrong. It does everything wrong.

												In a vaguely described but perfectly bland world, a generic hero with no personality to speak of, desperately tries to stop an unoriginal invasion of undead horde (as apparently orcs are to edgy and tentacle monsters from outer space are too cool). The hero is joined by an entourage of sidekicks I would never saw before If I never played any other game (Morrigan <sorta-indecent-sorta-evil-and-yet-sexy-like-a-turnip> ripoff, Tali/Aerie/Shani <every-sexy-bookworm-ever> ripoff, Carth/Sten <my-life-is-forfeit-I-lost-my-reason-to-be> ripoff, Every Elf Ever <with 50% forgettable design more> ripoff and witty yet still unfunny <like rotting Alistair> undead person). That perfect combination of cliches, filler and uncreativity allows me to focus all my attention on gameplay. Which (not surprisingly) is a ripoff of far better games. Bound By Flame is what we would get if Witcher 2 and Dragon Age 2 had an unloved child who tried (failing miserably) to be like Dark Souls and Mass Effect at the same time. Sadly the game works just fine and has no major bugs to speak of, which prevents it from entering so-bad-its-good cathegory which was its only chance to be remembered by anyone. I found it in a bargain bit and for physical copy of a game that had to be burned, boxed and delivered to the store I paid an equivalent of 5 Euro. Its still too much. Spending 30 Euro (BBF's current price on Steam) is a truly hilarious joke.			"

												Where to start I got to the end. The boss was too hard for me to finish I had no potions so I never beat him. I have however experienced the rest of the game. So without furtherado I will commence my review. This game is terrible the voice acting is ♥♥♥♥♥ they seem to think profane humor and needless cussing constantly. The character feels like a toddler playing pretend. Southpark was more mature than this shizz. The gameplay itself is appealing at first but the further you go the more obvious it becomes. Everything is pretend difficulty the mechanics are crap. I do not suggest getting this game ever. Believe me I spent the 40$ read the reviews first do not look at the trailer like me and say AWESOME. Look at the trailer and say it looks too good to be true because it is not true. The truth is I want a refund and I know I will never get it please for your own good do not buy this game.

Had my doubts about the demon making you evil and all but turns out I was wrong. The game ain't about being good or bad, it's more about what you think of doing is the best and the consequenses that follow. So, plot and all it's twists are okay, as expected from the devs and what nots of ""Styx"".Gameplay is also kind of good. Hard but fair. Everything is just about balanced. Defend, attack or run away. It's all your decision, reflexes and capability.All and all, I liked the game. It may not be one of those ""Must have!""s but still good enough and worth your time.			"

												I tentatively give this a thumbs down. The game looks good, aside from the occasional lip sync error, and the combat after a little bit is fairly easy to get used to. I have one major gripe thoughSpoilers aheadBasically, the game doesn't really have a very good skill balance. I found maybe three situations outside of the tutorial bit where using the daggers was preferable, and none where I wanted to use the crossbow. However, it turns out that the boss is just about impossible in close quarters, and my fireballs don't do anything to him. For a game that has the most emphasis on melee combat, this is unacceptable. Combine that with a lack of skill resets, and it makes the end of the game unplayable.That being said, I enjoyed the story, but making it so unbalanced just broke it for me. Maybe buy it on a good sale.			"

												One of the most garbage RPGs I've ever played. It has a story and setting we've all seen a thousand times before, done better, by games like Dragon Age, The Witcher, and even Bethesda RPGs and their clones. It has combat that is remarkably broken, with enemies tanking several multitudes more attacks than your weak and pathetic ♥♥♥. It has exploration that consists of running down one or more copy-pasted corridors. The loot is uninteresting, the characters are forgettable, the voice acting is poor, and even the mediocre action-RPG gameplay is a far cry from that of so many other RPGs.I wish I could say more about this game, but I played under 2 hours so I could refund it. I bought it on sale for about $8, and that was still too much.I don't see what other people do in this game, as it just feels like a ghetto and ham-fisted clone, not unlike the soulless GTA clones pumped out for easy cash that we saw years ago. This game doesn't have a single unique bone in its body that isn't stronger in another game. The fact that the sitting MSRP for this as of writing is $29.99 is sickening to me. This is the kind of game that belongs in a bargain bin for $5, alongside ♥♥♥♥♥♥ licensed games and outdated EA Sports games.			"

												This game has promise but the amount of times it crashes completely and or loses sound is unacceptable. I can't play a game I have to restart every 5 minutes. Great graphics.The combat, while hard to master, becomes very satisfying once mastered. It will feel clunky at first, but there is a way to adapt to it. You have to be fast and accurate. It is not a button masher. Hardcore RPG'ers will enjoy and get the combat.The sound is great...when it works. It crashes about every 5 minutes for me. The story is hard to listen to. Though this game is voice acted, there is so much dialogue to sit through at times, I find myself fast forwarding through it, just to get back to the gameplay. While this company has gotten better at their work, they still have a long way to go. This game would have been great at a 19 dollar price, but for almost 40 dollars, it is not worth it due to technical issues and minor game play issues. Buy this if you a hard core RPG'er all others stay clear.			"

												I liked Mars well enough, this is both an improvement as well as a disappointment. Its an ARPG, but the game-play is very much lacking in the combat and class building, but keeps and expands on the gear crafting that was a main feature in Mars. If you like Mars, you may very well like this. I dislike that I can't roll and enemies don't seem to react to damage what so ever in most cases, I hit you with a sword, flinch at least! I like the story and the voice acting is okay, there is no point in naming your character since they call you by the default name, and the character creation might as well not be a feature for how little you can change. I hope they update this game till then I say stay away, nothing worth the preorder for disappointment, not worth full price due to its lack of basic combat mechanics and 'choices'. -Heretic			"

												Disclaimer: I've entered game inputs for less than 30 minutes.I was concerned in the opening option screen when my choices for leaving the option screen were ""cancel,"" ""save & quit,"" and ""back."" To me that would have meant:- Cancel = cancel changes and exit current menu.- Save & Quit = Save current game progress and exit the game.- Back = Exit menu. Since cancel was another option I figured ""back"" would keep my changes. The Save & Quit left me confused and afraid of exiting the game. Save and Quit is how you keep your option changes. Game Opening cut scene:Very bad voice acting and animation that cannot be skipped. The 3rd or 4 word spoken is the default character name, which I had changed. A skeleton places his shield in front of himself causing your character to shoulder charge and fall to the ground.The controls are sluggish. If you thought the Witcher 3's  original release movement control was slow, this is many times worse. I walked around constantly over-correcting my walking/running direction with no jump or walking off ledges.After being told to talk to a particular NPC by name for my next ""quest,"" I ran up to each character butting up against them to get close enough to see if their name matched my quest name.Then I quit and uninstalled.

												I seen a lot of reviews and comments where Bound By Flame was compared with Dark Souls series and The Witcher 2/3. All of these games are NOT RPG. These games basically are third person action games. In my opinion most of negative reviews were made just due to too big expectations.Dark Souls has own unique gameplay and it cannot be compared with Bound By Flame. At the same time The Witcher 3 is very terrible game both as an RPG (not enough RPG elements to be RPG) and as a Third Person Action (totally broken combat system with awful hitboxes and animations).Obviously Bound By Flame has much lesser budget for development than games mentioned above. And i think those few things made in the game were made almost excellent.Combat system in Bound By Flame is good for the game of this genre: you can just not only beat enemy up but also parry strikes, use two different styles of melee combat (daggers with ability to dodge attacks and swords/maces/axes/etc. with large damage and kicking ability), and use additional useful things (magic, mines, mini crossbow, etc.) which make fights more interesting than just dumb clicking or typical click'n'dodge. Another feature of the combat system is a good balance between distance and speed/interval of strikes. This eliminates any problem with hitboxes.Graphics are not outstanding but certainly not bad for 2014 year. Amount of content not so large as in top AAAA-games but quality and amount of the in-game content enough for the game of scale of Bound By Flame.I can tell much more about Bound By Flame but the tale will be too long. I'l just say that the game is not so bad as most of reviews may describe. Just dont compare it with Dark Souls series - this game is too different and has absolutely different but good gameplay. For low budget game Bound By Flame is outstanding one. Howewer, i think the game is overpriced a bit. If the price would be 30-50% lower Bound By Flame would be a great choice even without holiday sales.My rating of the game: 7/10			"

												I bought this as part of a bundle and for the $1 I paid for it (proportionately) it's been incredible value. Yes, it has its faults - some of the voice work is pitiful (though the combat ain't as bad as some folks say - this is an RPG not a FPS, combat isn't hardcore) but all told - it's good fun and very much in the vein of KOTOR or Mass Effect (though in a fantasy setting). Is it perfect? Heck no. Is it good value for money and entertaining enough to be worth buying? Yes. Not sure I'd pay full price though; you might be best waiting for a sale or finding it in a bundle.			"

												Looks good, the combat is interesting, but for a game that relies heavily on dialogue, it's atrocious. There is no lip-sync, the characters merely move their lips in a pre-set way and look like they're mumbling half the time. And the voice acting itself is about as lifeless as a brick. The characters either sound like they're bored or that nothing holds any interest for them. I got to the first serious bit of dialogue and couldn't continue.			"

This game deserves MUCH more attention than it has received.The story is well put together, the combat is challenging(on the hardest difficulty as least), and the game offers a fair amount of replayability due to the choices you are met with both story and character progression wise.If you enjoy action combat with a story you could really get into, I would highly recommend this.Reminds me of The Witcher...and we all know thats a GREAT thing.

												Stay away from this game!Combat is terrible and extremely sluggish.You seem to deal around 8%-10% damage per swing to enemies whilst they freely smack you for over 40% of your HP every swing, some enemies even deal alot more. The enemies don't change attack styles etc, they spam the same attack over and over and your attacks do not interrupt theirs. Enemies will win every fight against you unless you use nearly all abilities available (the ammount of health potions you actually need in most fights in rediculous).Resources for making potions/traps etc are extremely low and require a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ammount of resources to make anything, (something like 12 bloods to make a health potion, you may only get 1-2 of these off a group of enemies) and since the enemies are all godlike you tend to try and avoid most of them if not all of them.Dialogue has to be a joke, no way it an be taken seriouslyAtleast it was only $30, If you like bad games and wasting money then this is a game for you =D			"

												I was really looking forward to this game, but after a few hours of play I am pretty disappointed. The graphics are really bland and dated, with basic textures, blocky shadows and are pretty unrefined to look at (and I am playing on high/ultra at 2560x1600). Some nice lighting occasionally distracts, but not enough.Gameplay is very basic and is largely a left/right mouse button mash. There is no real dodge mechanic which really irritated me as a ranger-style player since all I can do is jump back and then try to sprint around the back of my enemy. I could have used some greater agility to feel like a nimble rogue.Storyline is ok, but quite generic as well. Voice acting is overall quite bad with most actors sounding like they are mildly bored  reading from a script. Characters barely emote or move in conversations, with no face emotions and exceptionally bad lip-synching. Totally destroys immersion for me.The game this most reminds me of is Demonicon in terms of overall quality, looks and gameplay. If this was on a cheap deal and you were after a hack-n-slash RPG-lite that's not too pretty, then it would be a decent timewaster, but it's no big budget AAA RPG that will consume you for hours.

												It's not that Bound By Flame is a bad game, per se, but within an hour of starting the game it's pretty easy to see why the scores aren't overwhelmingly positive for this title. It plays no differently, on the surface, from most other action RPG/hack and slash hybrids, but it doesn't play as well as them either. While any of both your more popular hack and slash games and true action RPGs like Witcher 2, Darksiders, Darksiders 2, DMC 3 through 5, Metal Gear RR, God of War, and dozens of others utilize well built control schemes to condense various types of magic or abilities into one place, Bound By Flame makes the mistake of forcing you into a more MMO-familiar numerical menu, or quick-wheel which pauses the action, in order to do anything more advanced than swing a sword. In addition to this, the game utterly lacks a proper dodge function.You can parry or dodge, but you can't do both in the same stance. If you use warrior stance, you can parry, which doesn't particularly help against large groups of enemies which can easily murder you regardless of parrying if more than one enemy hits you. Combined with the fact that you barely gain any HP from new armor or even levelling up, and you spend far too much time being a weakling that can be taken down by a pack of even the weakest enemies. If you use ranger stance, your combat is much faster and you can actually dodge - whether timed correctly or not - and it's quite disappointing that you just can't play the game without another stance.In addition to that, while the premise of the game is for you to balance or choose between flame demon and human, you really have no choice but to use fire magic to accomplish anything. It's just too bad even after putting skill points into it, your spells still cost so much mana.As for the story and the dialogue, they really aren't special enough to earn any praise. The dialog combines a lot of modern English and profanity (not that there wasn't profanity in the old days) with the demon speaking in strictly Shakespearian English - to the point where the juxtaposition is just ridiculous. While I would like to be interested in the story, I find myself skipping through the dialog and cutscenes once the subtitles have displayed so I can get back to the game. Interactions with party members also seem ridiculous and overall your characters attitude is juvenile and callous, down to the wording he uses when he talks to people.I really wouldn't buy this game until it's on major discount - 10 dollar or less. The overall quality of the game combined with how short it is doesn't merit even the $20 I paid. If you need an action RPG fix, this will satiate you - briefly, at least, but I fear it will not tide you over until a better game releases.			"

												Bound by Flame suffers from Mass Effect. Select the female as your antagonist and you get a better voice-actor. Also known as the Jennifer Hale effect. The voice actor is still limited by what Spiders wanted her to do, but she makes the most of it, though I sometimes get the feeling that even she was close to calling it a day a few times.Spiders didn't bother to motion-capture a female fighter though, so if you go with the female you'll get one who carries herself like a beefcake would. Given the quality of the antagonist's female voice-acting, that's a shame.Graphic options enough to be impressed, but even on full graphical detail the game is a drab and dreary 256 shades of brown.Facial animation is non-existant and the characters speak from the corners of their mouth. Its hard to watch and not at all made easier by the wooden animation of the characters as a whole.Fighting is mixed bag of ideas with combat difficulty being of the 'light attack from monster, you lose half health' while your attacks barely register. It gets better once you get pyromancing abilities, but on the whole I find the combat very tedious for an action RPG. If my toon swings a basterdsword that is counter-weighted, it should demolish an enemy. Blows like that are hard to recover from. Yet, any ememy you encounter will shrug your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sword's blows off like being tickled with a feather. Get stunlocked over and over again until you have to reload. That's BbF's combat in a nutshell.The maps are small and claustrophobic, exploration is limited. Chest have set loot, which is painfully obvious when you have to reload. You'll get the same items from lootables again and again.The game has crafting, which by now is very old and tired. Given the limited exploration and the claustrophobic regions, running around trying to find stuff to make stuff is a tedious chore. I wish developers stopped thinking that crafting is the beesknees. It isn't. And in the case of BbF, it's a half-azzed attempt of keeping you in uninteresting regions far longer than the player needs to be. Crafting in BbF is adding a chore to a chore.I believe that efforts like BbF are outdated. All of this has been before and better. A good thing then that the pricepoint is certainly reasonable. BbF isn't AAA by a long shot and Spiders evidently knows this. For the rest, the game is forgettable but at least by the time you put it down, finished or not, you won't feel robbed.I don't recommend BbF, but don't let that stop you. Just remember that for me, the only thing I took away from it is the voice-acting of the female Vulcan.			"

												 I played this game and finished it. I think I finished it twice, in fact, to see a different ending... Buuttt I don't really remember anything about the game at all. I think you might have a fire spirit inside you or something? Either way, it obviously isn't very good if I don't even remember the basics, so instead I'm going to review The Witcher 3 for you: If you have two choices - ""Play Bound By Flame"" or ""Play The Witcher 3"", you should play The Witcher 3. It has a wonderful story and memorable characters with some really great story choices that move the world forward in a reasonable fashion without promising all the nonsense that games like Mass Effect 3 promised. You guys remember that? Remember when Mass Effect promised that all your choices would change everything and the whole game would hinge on what you do... Then the ending was the same three generic tubes with a space baby that told you some screwed up version of the plot that totally contradicted what had been the plot before? Then you got to pick your favourite colour. Then they had the audacity to ""fix"" the endings by making them more ""happy""... Who the hell asked them to be happy?! It just wanted them to relate to the God damned story. You remember the Knights Of The Old Republic games? They had a choice system too, but it wasn't so much: ""Good vs Evil"", it was more ""Reasonable Human Being vs God Awful, Short Sighted ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bag"" right up until the last choice. If I'm an evil Sith I've got to look beyond the simple things like currency. Money is great, but if I can convince everyone I'm a good person by doing good deeds and then call on them to fight my enemies knowing they will think me the kindest and most gentle soul in the galaxy, isn't that worth more than asking for 100 more credits?... Ohhhh, the unspeakable evil of Sith capitalism and price negotiation! Those monsters!   While we're talking about that, why are Sith evil anyway? Jedi oppress all emotion, even love. Sith are permitted to love. Why is any human emotion this instant, one way ticket to evil? I mean, we can all agree that emotional people do some awful stuff from time to time, but logical people can be uncaring, calculating and indifferent to suffering... The ends justify the means in their eyes. That doesn't sound better than a person who deeply loves his wife and children. Maybe if the Jedi stopped running around trying to murder every Sith there wouldn't be so much conflict?    Anyway, don't buy this rubbish. Maybe have a snack instead.			"

												If your expecting something like dark souls or similiar your wrong. The fighting mechanics is not up to par. For example. The enemy and me attack at the same time, if my strike lands first on him he should stumble backwards right?? Wrong, instead if my attack hits him, hes attack still continues and then he hits you.In the middle of combat when your surrounded by 2 or more enemies and you swing your blade at one while the other one attacks, you cannot parry the other enemies attack, instead you need to sit back and watch how he brutilize you because you cannot attack and parry at the same time.This game is a waste and dont even bother on buying this game, rather spend it on dark souls if you havnt gotten it yet			"

												Probably gonna get hate for my lack of playtime but, a lot of people are comparing this to Witcher or Kingdoms of Amalur. The thing is both those games do everything better than this game. You're better off buying one of those games rather than dropping 40 bucks on this lackluster title.			"

												It's alright but I just couldn't get into to it somehow. The whole armor/weapon upgrade system through crafting is pretty sweet and the story seems decent enough, as do the combat skills. But the graphics are a bit too overcontrasty and red filtered for my tastes lol.That and the character models/voice acting/animations remind me of Dragon Age 1 and they don't seem to fit too well with eachother imo.Combat is pretty good IF you can used to it. It's like a mix of the Witcher 1 (with the DDR style timed stuff that triggers combos) and Dark Souls (with the block/slash/dodge at the right time or you die) but it doesn't feel refined enough to me. Still though it does work as long as you get the timing right and the right skills in at the right time. Health is a bit hard to restore though seeing as the potions require materials that are a bit hard to come by in early game areas, but there are traits or talent points that can be used to get more mats out of everything.I dunno, I might give it another go some day and see if I can get into it properly. Seems to have potential to be a fun game.Also Demon is best girl. :P			"

												I enjoyed this ""indie"" RPG. Why? Mainly because it has a great soundtrack, a decent story with interesting characters; and that it came out at a time when the market has a shortage of decent RPG titles. I was so hungry for a nice RPG game and this fit nicely. Sure, the animation of the characters' lips movement vs the spoken words, is inexcusably inaccurate. And that we only get to fight one big boss while expecting to battle seven. But given that this is a small company developing a relatively ambitious (relative to the developer) game, I think it is a good effort. RPG fans should play this game. However, for anyone less keen, I think this game is only worth <$20. So, wait for the right discount and get it!			"

												Honest review in my OPINIONGraphics - 7/10The Graphics were good they reminded me of Borderlands mixed with the Witcher 2. Not next gen but not too shabby at all.---------------------------Lore and dialogue 9/10The lore in this game was absolutely amazing! more or less every character had backstory and many dialogue options. It wasn't quite mass effect but it was good.   ---------------------------Storyline 6/10The story for this game completely made sense wasn't particulary amazing but it was good. It's a shame it was not terribly long. ---------------------------Difficulty 4/10This game is incredibly easy. I picked this up for the first time and blitzed through the game side quests all on the highest diffuculty in less than 12 hours. Only the last boss is remotely difficult which took me 5 attempts. Enemies telegraph attacks from a mile away and you can pretty much become immortal by spamming backstep through enemies attacks.---------------------------Gameplay 8/10This remindes me of Dark souls A LITTLE and Dragon Age Origins mixed together.  The game is pretty fluid and although there are some things I would liked to have changed such as more enemy variation and better/more areas with more options than 'Climb'. Add some traps in and more enemies!Overall 7/10For a first release by the company I think that this game was great and I reccomend buying this game and any other titles the developers make in the future.

												I would not recommend ""Bound by Flame"" to you unless you're both a real avid fan of the action RPG genre and you've played the multitude of other, better, games available to you. You might get some enjoyment out of it, but be aware beforehand that the game is riddled with problems, limitations and questionable design decisions.Firstly, I did find the lore to be engaging. You kept getting glimpses of some very interesting story elements, enough to keep atleast myself hooked until the ending, which then kind of dropped the ball and fizzled out into unsatisfaction. Given that the game studio is both new and small, perhaps you can't expect a perfect product, granted. However, as a gamer, it's still a disappointing experience to sit through, regardless.The game is not built around the lore, however, but rather the combat system. It's no saving grace, sadly, as you'll quickly discover it to be as simplistic and clunky as the story. To clarify: the idea behind the combat system is great, but the execution is not. Like many other action RPG's you'll be expected to fight in a block/dodge-counterattack style, or run and gun with your crossbow and magic. Some enemies will be blocking your attacks themselves, and others will have attacks that need to either be blocked, dodged or interrupted, so you are meant to switch styles on-the-fly. In actuality you don't need to. You will never want to use your blocking and interrupting stance, ever, but solely rely on dodging and interrupting your enemies with the fast attack weaponry. This is because when you fight more than one enemy at the same time, your attack animation for the blocking stance is much, much too slow to ever get a swing off between enemy attacks. Your fast attacks in the dodge stance will always end up doing more damage, faster, simply because your attack animation is that much shorter. That's not to say you HAVE to play with just the daggers, but playing according to the developer's intention WILL frustrate you to no end, for no upside what-so-ever.Another problem with ""Bound by Flame"" is that the controls are unforgivingly clunky for being the main focus of the game. Sometimes your character just will not dodge when you desperately spam the dodge button. Sometimes your character does dodge, but automatically counter-attacks in an attack animation that you cannot interrupt or dodge out of until it's done, which can (and will) spell out your doom when you meet attack combinations that *require* two consecutive dodges.The camera also proves to be problematic, as fighting in small spaces often leads to walls or other doodads getting in the way of your line of sight, and I need not reiterate the need for visuals in a game where your mode of fighting is twitch-based dodge and counterattacks. It's enough to ruin more than one fight every playthrough, which in this day and age is completely unnecessary in my opinion.There's also something to be said for the art direction, as you will be fighting two things throughout the game. The first being undead, primarily zombies, and the second being insects. It gets very boring, very fast. Zombies and insects are easy, starting enemies you have to plough through in most RPG's early in order to get to the good parts; only in this game it ends before actually getting to that good part. The bosses are just the same way, where they look and feel like regular enemies as you get bored after the first time you beat them. Perhaps *something* other than slow zombies would've livened the game up somewhat. Slow zombies are not scary, they're not imposing and they're not dangerous. Neither are insects.The side characters were unengaging, flat and one-dimensional. Your standard, garden variety, fantasy stereotypes.As with Skyrim, you have just about no interaction with them throughout the game, no fluff dialogues to establish any personality, no discernable effect in combat whatsoever, the most bland and formulaic personal quests as well as so called ""romance quests"", that are no more than you picking the dialogue option that suits that character, then choose them for a quest and then get a short cutscene. Coming from someone who's played games that did side characters right, like the Baldur's Gate-, Dragon Age- and Mass Effect series, the lack of effort and thought put into it in ""Bound by Flame"" really shines through. I've played through the game four times and I don't even know any of their personalities; being as bland and vanilla as they are. There's just no interaction whatsoever, nothing to latch onto. They tried giving some of the side characters some gimmick, like the swordsman who refers to people in the third person, but with zero interaction with him apart from the one personal quest per chapter, he's just another body in a collection of bodies.The voice acting is poor, very unengaged, detached, flat and dry. This is extremely disappointing as the main male lead is voiced by the amazingly talented Robin Atkin Downes, of Babylon 5 fame. It's not appropriate to the actions taking place on the screen, with every line coming out like it was read aloud from a sheet of paper with no context. Inflections, tone and timber feels off throughout, and almost never reflecting the emotions that the game tells us the characters are currently feeling. A prime example being a girl who lost her father and apparently feels cold, her heart hardened by the loss and her determination hard as steel. However, neither her voice acting nor dialogue lines never, ever, changes one iota from before her loss to after. In a voice acted RPG, this cannot be done so shoddily, it just doesn't lend to a good player experience.Finally, I have to mention the uncanny valley-effect while watching the cutscenes. The characters don't look at each other, or the camera is pointed so it appears like they're not looking at each other, not making eye contact and not syncing the lip movement to what is spoken. They're also not standing naturally in relation with each other, sometimes standing with a huge space between each other and sometimes right up in each other's faces, not making eye contact of course. It's instantly noticable and very distracting in my opinion.So in conclusion, I would not recommend ""Bound by Flame"", as it tries to do what other games in the genre does, only it never really gets it right or well enough to be passable. An RPG is built on setting, story and characters, and ""Bound by Flame"" fails to deliver an engaging story with interesting characters in an immersive setting. An action RPG is built on a good fighting system and tight controls, and ""Bound by Flame"" fails to deliver either, as the fighting system is heavily biased to one path and the controls are sluggish and unresponsive. A lacking player experience, with an annoying camera, uninvolved voice acting and poorly produced cutscenes, cements the foundation of my recommendation for you to NOT get this game for anything less than a ""75% off"" deal, and only then if you're a fan of the genre. There are better games like ""Bound by Flame"" out there, better games on Steam even. Instead, play the Assassin's Creed series, the Mass Effect series, the Baldur's Gate series, the Dark Souls series, Darksiders, Bastion or even Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.			"

												The story line is interesting, But the game itself doesn't live up to the expectation. The ending is aweful; unfullfilling and lacking the drama it had benn building up (any ending that you pick). I have also noticed that in the course of playing, you are really only given about 2 options to allow the demon to further posses you, otherwise the demon will just posses you on its own (honestly, its almost like you can't stop the possession). Overall, Very unfullfilling, I do NOT reccommend.			"

If your looking for a game with a good story to it and where you actually feel important? Then this is for you. I know some people didnt like it and others did but me personally i liked it cus of the story; While on the other hand, find this to be a very short game. I had just finished beating this game in 1 whole day and was somewhat disappointed in the length of the game because when i heard i might be fighting the 7 ice lords i was like ""Heck yeah this is gonna be a long game"" but instead i just do what i did and beat it....kinda sad :( but still the story was the only thing that will make me recommend this to anyone			"

I've been stuck on ACT II for more then a week because a main character, known as Randval, simply disappears if you don't complete his quest before doing other quests, wich gets you stuck forever. I ckecked every forum there is, this seems to be a common problem. The fact that there has not been a update patch so far pisses me of and therefore I say DONT BUY THIS GAME,			"

												======PRELIMINARY REVIEW=====Bound By Flame is a new RPG from Spiders studios. As you first start playing a number of things become very clear. Firstly, that Spiders (whether on purpose or by aiming too high) have created a completely unique looking beautiful work: Vertiel. A lot of people have been calling it a Skyrim/Dark Souls type game. This I feel is actually quite accurate. Not only does the dark colour remind my of my experiences in Dark Souls (I and II) but the strategic combat also feels very much like it was inspired by a Souls game. The essesence of Skyrim (and other Elder Scrolls games) comes through as you first read the group of mercenaries are abbreiviated to The Blades (any Elder Scrolls fan will know that the Blades serve(d) to protect the Emperor up to the events of the Oblivion Crisis). The second thing I noticed was the music. After watching the music trailer when it was released, I was prepared to hear the voices come through my headphones. What I wasn't prepared for was the quality of the whole soundtrack. Whoever has created this music deserves a huge round of applause as it really is one of the best soundtracks I've heard for a while.However, it isn't all good. Some of the voice acting is a little dodgy (I'm thinking the very first Cinematic's voiceover, which didn't boost my excitement level at all) and the Cinematic's (so far) seem to be a little to frequent. This could, however, be due to the fact it's very early in the game. Also, I know that many people have complained about the lip-syncing. As of now I don't have any complaints about this, which I am surprised about due to the sheer voloume of people that have mentioned it. I will continue this review as I get deeper into the game, and will present the whole review (with a score out of 10) when I have completed it.			"

No it's not perfect, but its a wondeful action fighter rpg style like game and I won't lie, I love it. With a awesome storyline, questionable main chara morals, humor, and good usage of swear words this game manages to tie you into the main storyline completely, while giving you side quests that never seem to take priority at all. You do them honestly because they arent out of the way, and becauce why not/. Highly reccomend this game to anyone!			"

												I bought Bound by Flame because I also own Mars: War Logs and immensely enjoyed basically everything about it. Seeing as the complaints about both games are very much similar (dated graphics, clunky controls), I thought I should give this one a try as well because I was sure I was going to enjoy it just as much. I knew it didn't have a long story, I was fine with that. I was even fine with the flat characters and the horrible, horrible voice acting. Not much difference from Mars: War Logs, but in a solid game, that wouldn't be a reason to complain. It's not Square Enix or Bethesda after all.I did not enjoy it. Ignoring the blatant problems with voice acting and a rushed storyline (I was really confused about a lot of thing up until the middle of Act 2 and suddenly, everything happened at once?). I dragged myself further, trying to ignore my problems with the game, but it really was just that - a drag.While the story seems rushed after completing about 50% of the game, the combat is the real issue at hand. I'm not sure if it's a problem with keyboard/mouse controls, but what I experienced was a very unresponsive protagonist. Sometimes, you would get surprise attacked without having your swords or daggers pulled and thus just have to deal with a devastating first blow. Sometimes, the character simply wouldn't do what I was telling her to do. She wouldn't block or parry, wouldn't attack when I saw an opening in the enemy's defense. The unresponsive controls made the combat even less enjoyable than it already is.Difficulty in combat mostly comes from the enemy's high HP pool and often bigger groups of enemies in small, confined areas that are hard to navigate (especially due to a wonky camera that doesn't exactly appreciate narrow areas with lots of different obstacles) vs. your own very low damage output. At several points, I thought throwing rocks at my enemy would have been just as useful. This kind of difficulty quickly turns into frustration, which, in my case, also leads to me being less willing to actually try my best in combat. That's a vicious circle, really.A lot of people have written that the combat is fluid, but I can't agree to that. I don't know if it's a problem with keyboard/mouse or my system, but even changing stance in combat simply didn't happen fast enough to avoid getting hit, being cornered and killed in a matter of seconds (especially with bigger enemy groups that will all rush at you if they see you on the ground - normally a reason for praise!). To me, it really was clunky, unresponsive, unbalanced and unrewarding. Defeating an enemy didn't give me the feeling of ""Ha, I finally killed ya!"", but more a feeling of ""Thank god it's over, can we please move on now?""Moving on is another thing. Cutscenes happen at the most haphazard times or so it feels. Your companions will (seemingly) randomly stop and tell you their entire life story in one go. I don't mind finding out about the companions, quite the opposite, but even those dialogues felt like a drag, especially with the questionable writing and bad voice acting.Now, I won't get into details about the graphics. They're not 2014 by any standards, but they're not horrible as so many people claim they are. I think they're okay, especially keeping in mind that Bound by Flame was made with a low budget. The lighting is beautiful, but there isn't a lot of variation in areas and seeing the same ice barrier for the umpteenth time in a long, narrow corridor isn't blowing my mind. But really, the graphics and the design are okay (except for Edwen's wardrobe malfunction which doesn't bother me because of nudity, but because of the absolute impossibility of her dress staying where it's supposed to be).Voice acting was bad. Really bad. There is nothing redeeming about it, the voices all sound bland and devoid of emotions which is really sad. The writing wouldn't seem half as bad if the voice acting had been done right and you would feel some sort of emotion, so you'd feel connected to the characters. As it is, that never happened. I found the protagonist and almost all companions except Mathras to be highly unlikeable.The story again was okay. It's nothing groundbreakingly new, it's not super exciting, but it gets the point across. It would have been even better if it had unravelled a little more quickly during the first half of the game and a little more slowly towards the end. Balance is the key here, but the way Bound by Flame presents its story now feels rushed and very hectic.In general, only looking at soundtrack, graphics and story, it would have been an okay game. I would have given it something like 7/10. But the awful combat and controls combined with the horrible voice acting drag it down. Seeing as gameplay is vital and a clunky game simply isn't fun to me, I'll give it a 3/10. I know where it was trying to borrow from, it tried really hard too, but it ultimately failed. Now, I tried really hard to like this game, to ignore the problems with the controls, but I can't. My final advice is: don't buy this game, it's not worth the 20 bucks at all.			"

												      This game tries to be on par with other games such as dragon age and mass effect, but it just isn't. The graphics are good and the story itself is good as well but thats where it pretty much ends. There are a number of bugs in this game, from quest that don't disappear from you log when you fail them to dialog that repeats its self. The voice acting is not that bad, however, as in most games there is that one character that you just do not want to talk to because well, thier personality just sucks.        The fights are fun but a real pain because you have to wait for one animation to finish before you can issue a new order, which more often then not will get you killed. Overall i would recommend this game if its on discount, it is not worth full price. And remember while this game tries to keep up with dragon age, mass effect and other games of that type, it fails to do so. But is still a good game. I give it a 7/10.			"

												 This game surprised me. When I purchased it I figured it just looked like an average RPG with a somewhat interesting storyline. When i started actually playing the game i realized iw as wrong. I really enjoyed the combat system in this game, being a bit of a mix of Dark Souls and the Witcher I found it pretty awesome coming from a guy who thoroughly enjoyed both of the games. The way that they set up the storyline is also similar to the witcher in the fact that your decisions will change the outcome of the game and the general layout (act 1/2/3 etc.). However, I would personally say that what you do in this game has more of an effect than what you did in the Witcher. But that is my personal opinion.I've havent even finished my first play through but im loving the stealth elements already and there are plenty of different ways you can play it. Definitely has re-play potential.			"

												Great game. Voice acting is great.Animations are kind of lacking though. Especially if it's not the main character's. I would guess this is where the budget had to be cut. And I agree with them. Combat can be very difficult. This isn't your God of War hack and slash. Reaction is important. As well as awareness. Didn't leave much for a sequal. I hope to see more though.

It is a good game, with interesting story, but I cannot recommend it, because it is way too expensive. For that much money I would expect more than 15 hours of gameplay.

												I'd say this game was enjoyable but the combat is horrid. Enemies have way too much health and you die far too easy; even though I personally didn't have too many problems this games combat is worse than almost any other game I've played with each fight being more a test of endurance, timing and skill juggling rather than actual sword play or anything resembling actual skill. The storyline is definitely interesting though especially the last stage where all your decisions have an impact on you. Overall I'd give it a C+. It's worth the playthrough even though the gameplay is quite horrid the storyline is memerable enough to keep it going for the 15-20 or so hours it offers.			"

												I recommend this, but only really if on sale. The combat is fun, but once you figure out how to always dodge enemies it becomes pretty uniform and a lot of mashing. I went through as the twin daggers class, so for me it was just : attack, attack, attack, dodge, attack attack attack, dodge, etc...The one very very very weird thing about this game is that all the way through it had moderate difficulty, but then the final boss is about a 3-4x increase in difficulty. He is actually a MAJOR challenge and 1-2 shots you. I guess this makes sense for a final boss, It almost made me want the rest of the game to be more in line with the final fight because it felt really epic, but was just SUCH a sharp contrast to the rest of the game that it was really really hard to overcome.

												First of all this game is a very interesting story based game with a lot of turns that surprise the player. The fighting system is well done and a little overwhelming sometimes but it is something one can get accustomed to. The crafting system is a nice addition to the game but it is as limited as the actual vote power of democracy. A fantastic soundtrack with memorable sounds that fits the game and adds depth to the overall experience. From a graphics point of view this game is not a jaw dropper but it suffices.The main problem here is the way the storytelling is executed and how there is no real interaction with the npcs and the followers along the entire journey, of course you speak to them every now and again and sometimes they share some of their knowledge or opinions along the way but that's it, apart from that they just stand around lifeless and even at crucial moments you would at least expect them to look at you. I'm not going to spoil the ending but in my opionion the whole decision making in this game is quite pointless. Romance is a complete disaster as if they wanted it there but just lacked money to make cutscenes and additional speech lines.Overall this game is a dissapointment with the execution of its core purpose which is story telling, intriguing but stale and sometimes simply funny where its not supposed to be. I do recommend it though because I feel like the mere 10-12 hours of story including pretty much all side quests and experimentation can deliver some fun and epic moments.I do want to complete the game fully on harder difficulty levels and unlock all of the achievements but I feel like it would just be a pointless grind, maybe one day I will come back to it and go through all of this again.

												I would recommend this game on sale. Enemies can be spongy at times and you will generally drop pretty quick but combat overall is satisfying in my opinion. I enjoyed the protagonist male voice acting, but the females is horrible and often cringeworthy. This game has one of my favorite soundtracks of all time. Final boss has a sudden difficulty spike but is beatable. Game is relatively short (under 10 hours if you rush, 10-14 if you take your time), but the 2 stances and how/if you decide to use the demons power were varied enough for me to play through the game twice.

												I got this game as part of a bundle a little over a year ago and just now got to playing through it. I originally tried it out and thought the combat was too complicated so i quickly tossed it aside. After seeing a recent review where someone likened this to dragon age and given my love for that franchise I just had to give this another try.The combat takes a little getting used to and the crafting system does as well but it's suprisingly simple once you've played a little bit. I did my initial playthrough as a rogue after hearing that it was a lot easier than the warrior. Essentially you stealth kill an enemy, flame on, kill things and move on to other things. The combat is very captivating and the storyling kept me interested the whole way through. Granted, it doesn't take much to keep my interested.P.S. I've never written a review for a game before. I chose to break that habit with this game as i thoroughly enjoyed it and was suprised given the number of negative reviews on here. If you are in doubt, give it a shot.			"

												I'm no professional  reviewer but I will tell you what I've observed:Combat is fluid and fast but unreactive. Like many have said, you hit the enemy and there's not much else to it. The health bar decreases and you move on to the next enemy.The targetting systems is old. Press ""R"" to target and flick your mouse-wheel up or down to change targets. I remember that from ""Advent Rising"" and even then I hated using it. It's not a bad system, but a little more intelligent optimization of the engine may have made targetting more intuitive.Voice acting is very emotionless in most cases but very over-the-top in others. Talk to Mason if you want to know what I mean.  The voice actors they chose for the male and female characters simply don't match the character models, but that's a personal opinion.Despite some of those very small issues, I am still having fun!  The story so far is great and the characters are interesting.  I try not to compare one game as a whole to another game. If I wanted another Dragon Age or Amalur, I would play them.Hopefully you have fun, too. For $39.99, I think it's surely worth it.  Enjoy.			"

												Eventhough it comes with its small imperfections like out of synch lip movement and some of the add-on armor parts clipping with the armor itself.The game itself is well optimized for pc use though single gpu preffered it seems, the game takes very little resources to run.The art style looks amazing and the graphics are fairly solid quality.I personally dont like the in game music at all it tends to be out of tune with the game 90% of the time, fast paces at relaxed moments not rough enough for action, but your pretty much forced to keep it on [im usin at like 30% volume] considering some of the cutscenes sound affects are worked into the music wich makes the cutscenes really awkward now and then with music comepletely off.The controls seem alittle off at first but they end up being really well layed out [keyboard/mouse]Difficulty wise its sliced down in the middle not to easy not to hard [though i havent tried the hardest difficulty]The story is captivating its a cliche with a new twist, the voice acting has solid work and the main character i found to be lovable a cheecky little merc with a sence of adventure and the moral choices are handled well not making the character feel like he/she has way to many mood swings.All in all theres much more to say and way more detail for it to be said in, but in my opinion :This is a 40 euro game that somewhat feels high budget tripple A yet small studio tender love and care,it simply is a solid buy i personally find it on equal level with the big name large budget rpg's out there [if not better then some of them].If i have to make comparisons it feels like Dragon age 1 plotish fableish char development [looks wise] mass effect 3 upgrading [but with materials needed for ''mods''] combat wise closest would be the witcher series you really need both fighting styles and at higher dificulty ''magic'' and even bombs/crossbow become somewhat needed.If this sounds interesting pls do buy this game and support its developer in hope of seeing another game such as this.PS : found 0 buggs so far.

												Honest review, so far. I am about as far as the 7th screen shot on steam currently, not too far into the first true chapter.So Bound by flame is definitley not blockbuster of the year. But it, so me, is still a great idea of a game. If you are looking for another Dark souls, Dragon age 2, Witcher video game, look no further. Now the storyline is your typical RPG. World is being ravaged by frost demons, your a merc, get partially possessed by a fire demon, meet allies along the way to do various things, heal, archery, so forth. You set out to save your world, now I haven't got far enough for the demon possession yet, see if the storyline changes or what not, but that ties into the skills. Now the 3 you have, is Warrior, two handed weapon, heavy damage, block, parry/counter attack, and stun with a kick. Ranger, dual wield daggers, parry/counter, i think, played mostly warrior, and dodge, wish warrior had dodge.IT IS SLOW to switch stances by the way. No quick on the fly. Last is Fire Magic. Which you can use in both your stances, light your blades on fire, fireballs, so forth. The skill tree in my opinion, as fast as I have been leveling is small. Not terrible added with Crafting. As well as traps and a crossbow for non magic long range, not skills. There are also perks, you unlock by doing things. For instance getting more health, just drink 5 potions, and unlock the perk with a point. Experience, magicka, weapons, everything almost has a perk. THE KEY to combat in this game is BLOCK TIMING. I cannot stress this enough. It is learning the enemy moves, and knowing when to parry. Combat is fun, but if using only one skill set, becomes repetitive, but this early for me isn't bad since im still trying to learn the timing, and I keep dying, its a nice challenge without being too much like DS. It feels good to start demolishing a foe with ease when you know its moves. Then a new one comes along. All the regular enemies have different attack styles. And the 2 bosses I have fought, one being huge, attack its armour while fending off its lackeys, and besides its almost one hit kills, is fairly easy. The 2nd in the 7th screen shot on steam so far, ""SPOILERS"" Is all by his lonesome, but has a high health bar, few attacks, but they hit fairly hard, but are fairly easy to counter once learned, and its defense attack where he springs spikes out of the ground, can quickly kill you if you get caught in a pinball machince effect with it, and is not as easy to defend from, for if you can't dodge because your not in Ranger mode, you can't just block as a warrior. Now with that, the crafting, COLLECT EVERYTHING! Almost every enemy drops some kind of loot, or money, and sometimes items, along with coming across a rock you can search and barrels and crates, SEARCH IT ALL, GET IT ALL. ""SPOILERS"" The barrells can be like chest mimics, they look like womens privates. """"So CRAFTING uses all you find, gold can be used within your menu to buy items you find for the basics, and then the basics make the higher tier regeants. So no needing to always stop by a town, even potions can be made on the go. So with the regeants in check, you can make armor and weapon mods, on the go. The higher the weapon and armor, the more mods available to make, from resistances, to more power, or speed, so on and so forth. Which is why with this added to the perks and the skills, its balances nicely for now. This is not the best game I have ever played, nor is it amazing, maybe great or good, and ok, lacking in some areas. Dialouge could be better, talking to someone and being in a cinematic view is ok, but then your still talking to the peson, and even though it looks like you can move, you can only move your camera angle. Small things like that. On a 1-10 system, a 7. I will update when I get there. Hopefully this lets you know what your getting into, and wether you want to pay the $40 for an indie developer, who is actually pretty good. If this game came out 2 years ago now, say around DA2, then it actually might be amazing, especially from an indie developer, now with the new consoles, new games, it still holds its own to me without falling through the cracks.

The battles aren't easy like most games make them to be and, although there are silly diologues here and there, it does not take much from the main story.

												Let's preface this review by admitting this game isn't on a grand scale like Dragon Age, Mass Effect, The Witcher, etc. It's from a smaller studio, and it shows. Does that make it an unplayable game? No. Is it a great game? No also. It's right in the middle. A playable game that's worth two playthrus just to see both sides of the morality scale (at least four if you want to unlock the achievements for each romance).Let's start by what they did right. The game holds up in story. Could it have been fleshed out more? Possible, but the reasoning you get in the ending justifies why you did it the way you did. The dialogue, at times, is nice and witty.Now let's talk about what went wrong. A lot of times, the animation doens't match the voice acting. Playing the game is like watching a badly dubbed foreign film, but the dialogue and subtitles are both in your native language. Not a deal breaker, but distracting. Also, the first 20 to 30 minutes where most people are running into their problems to continue is the hump of the game. It's admittedly slow, but picks up.The combat takes a huge, huge hit in this game which for a RPG is not a good thing. You never feel like you've gotten stronger, even with upgraded weapons. armor, magic, customizations to said weapons and armor, and talents. Weak enemies are weak, strong enemies are strong, and your health will suffer for it. On the hardest difficulty, an archer can kill you in less than a handful of hits, and they're never alone. The enemy will gang up on you and beat you mercilessly. I found myself being beaten on the floor more than once and just having a ""Well, this won't end well"" moment. Unless you can manage the parry system for two-handed and dodge for dual wield you won't be having fun times. However, some people enjoy the difficulty so this can be pushed aside as a problem for certain people. If you aren't one of those people, stick with easy or normal (normal is still decently hard for an average person).The weapon selection leaves something to be desired as well. You have two stances; one uses two-handed weapons and the other uses dual wield. There's no sword and shield, no staff, no bow(*). Two-handers come in sword, axe, and mace types and dual wield comes in...daggers. *= You have a crossbow, but it's always equipped and requires you to craft bolts for it and unless you want to put it on your quickbar it's hard to use. Adding to the quickbar, it consolidates all your items, skills, and spells into one. No separate potion button, or spell button. You need to make the decision on what you want on it at the time. Usually you'll have your health and mana potion, and a spell or two and be done. It's easy to switch out however by hitting tab and changing them around, which also slows the combat down to a matrix-style crawl so you can better plan an idea.As long as you go into Bound By Flame with an idea that it's from a lesser known studio, and it being their first RPG, you'll be fine. They did decent for their first go-around, and I've seen far worse come from smaller studios trying their first RPG and bigger studios who know the RPG game. Is it worth the $40? To me, sure. I got what I wanted out of it. Could you wait for it to be on sale in a weekend deal or summer/winter sale? Absolutely. You shouldn't, however, count it out. Just don't expect Dragon Age III quality, and use it as a appetizer for DA3 and Witcher 3 coming out.			"

												The game is ok with lot of elements that are bearable and need to be overlooked to enjoy it. The story is quite simple and characters you meet fairly cliche copied from Dragon Age. Combat is interesting and so are some of the mechanics like crafting and adjusting your weapon to your needs. I would give it a go if you have a spare 40 dollars if not then standby for Lords of the Fallen which looks like its gonna receive a better polish or even the Witcher 3.			"

They require some thinking and tactics when it comes to some of the larger.  Otherwise, they can just be a typical button pushing battle.2. Building your skills into what type of fighter you want to be.  The way you have to switch between the 3 classes depending on what type of creature your going up against is good.3. Its not open world, so you can go through it fairly quickly.Cons1.  The dialog sounds like it was made by a bunch of teenagers making their first game.  Profanity that seems like it was just put in there for profanity.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm no prude, but it just didn't seem in place.  The accents changed constantly.  There was even one that had a typical ""American"" southern drawl which made no sense.  It just seems like they didn't put any effort towards the story.2.  You can't tell good from bad in your dialog choices.  I thought rescuing a particular person sounded reasonable.  Then she killed someone and everyone hated me.  oops.  Plus they put an achievement to ""fall in love"" with particular NPC's.  During the entire game, Im trying to figure out how to do this.  Then all of the sudden one of my chioces led to the achievement.  Not sure how I did so don't ask.  Just keep talking to them and keep your fingers crossed.3.  The end.........I didn't finish it.   There's no way to ""stock up"" before the last boss battle.  They take away your only healer.  The people you go in with instantly get taken over by the boss and start fighting on his side.  I tried several combinations, but was never successful.  P.S. I was on Easy mode.So, my final recommendation is turn off the subtitles, turn the volumn down.  Stock up well before the boss battle.  And when you get to the boss battle, trade it in for a much better game.			"

												Bound by Flame continues Spiders’ unfortunate history of producing B grade RPGs, seemingly being unable to learn their past mistakes to make their future releases better. It has all the makings of a good RPG, the combat system works most of the time (despite it’s wild changes in difficulty), the levels are meaningful and the crafting system is halfway to being worthwhile. Still the story is well below mediocre and Bound by Flame has numerous glitches and behaviours that do nothing but ruin the experience. I’d love to say I’m looking forward to what they’re doing next but it seems that they have no interest in learning from their mistakes.Go on Spiders, prove me wrong.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/05/23/bound-by-flame-humanity-is-overrated/ "

												I just finished this game and all the posts on the community about this boss being infuriatingly dififcult compared to the rest of the game are true. I've lost count of how many tries the damn thing took me.This game isn't the longest or the most polished game ever but I liked the plot, the atmosphere and the characters. You can be male or female and I really liked the female choice, she has a bad-♥♥♥ personality. The controls felt like a simplified Dark Souls, I didn't find them particularly awkward but some of the fights can be very difficult. Controller support is very good. There are quite a few choices to make that affect the flow of the plot, the endings and even your character's appearance. Weapon and armour customisation also changes your appearance a lot, a system I liked, although initial character creation is a little limited. Although the world is very linear with no ability to backtrack, there are quite a few side quests with good rewards and lots of hidden treasure to find. This game is often compared to Dark Souls and I think I prefer it to the Souls series because you have companions and in general are a lot less lonely, also there is background music and you can guard-break properly. Most importantly, this game made my inner pyromaniac cackle with glee all the way through the story.			"

												This was an exciting RPG that had plenty of action, many different choices regarding characters and companions, and the ability for the character to be totally engaging was awesome.  The various battles were great, and plentiful; you really needed to use solid strategy to win each battle.  I only wish it had been a longer game.  I know that may sound frivolous, but I like long RPG that take many days to complete.  Other than the aforementioned, the only item that seems to be lacking is a more robust crafting system.  Though you have the ability to craft by adding various thing to the existing items, the opportunity to build unique, and more powerful armor from scratch would have enhanced the gaming experience.  Still, I will have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this game and would not hesitate to recommend it as a good game to own.  I hope that the creators of the game are planning for a sequel sometime soon.			"

												I do and dont recommend this game. My reason is, if someone is looking for a game thats LONG, then this isnt for you. If your looking for a game with a good story to it and where you actually feel important? Then this is for you. I know some people didnt like it and others did but me personally i liked it cus of the story; While on the other hand, find this to be a very short game. I had just finished beating this game in 1 whole day and was somewhat disappointed in the length of the game because when i heard i might be fighting the 7 ice lords i was like ""Heck yeah this is gonna be a long game"" but instead i just do what i did and beat it....kinda sad :( but still the story was the only thing that will make me recommend this to anyone			"

												This is a game you play if you:>Not too fussed about Storyline>Not too fussed about graphic>Love quicksaving>love customisable armour>Love throwing your controller through windowsAll in all, this is a ♥♥♥♥ing fun game. I scavanged around for everything I could to get the armour/weapon mods I wanted. It's a nice little game that has a throwback to oldschool RPGs. It's hard. HARD! So don't be afraid to play on easy first run through to save your teeth a good grinding. Like people have said, it's not the best game out there but I guarentee you'll spend a good 20-30hrs playing this. Player agency gets taken away at choices when you let the demon win, but honestly I didn't mind it. Made sense. Last boss takes the difficulty up to 11 but HOLY SH*T do you feel acomplished when you beat him.All in all, is it worth $30? Nah. I love this game, but it's not worth that. Get it on sale or through a 3rd party and enjoy it. 7/10			"

												Short and sweet(like this review), this game is a great fix for that action adventure fantasy RPG craving that I feel when I'm not in the mood to dive into something huge like The Witcher, or an E.S. game. Cheap story, cool armors/weapons, surprisingly difficult combat (depending on the setting), and average 2012ish graphics, it really accomplishes all that it needs to. Not sure why all of the negative reviews. Come on people, not every game can be top shelf. I give it a 7.5/10. Definitely worth the 10 bucks its on sale for at the moment.			"

												There is something about this game that makes me really want to like it.   Unfortunately, the development team didn't care to spend any time making sure controllers work on PC consistently.  I have a Xbox One controller for PC and this is literally the only game in my entire library that doesn't recognize it.  I even tried playing this with the dreadful Steam Controller and it didn't feel any better.   I get it that most PC fanboys love using keyboard and mouse for everything.  I do not fit into that category.   Controllers are my preferred way of interacting with games period.   I wish someone would have considered players like us before porting this game over.			"

												It's a solid game, especially if you think it isn't AAA budget game. The story is interesting even though was rushed in the middle. Looking at the gameplay, it's not perfect, as you can read elsewhere, but I found it challenging and fun especially using the knives. In the end, if you love playing rpg like dragon age origins, this game can be a good choice.			"

												Well I just finished game on buffalo difficulty (one step lower than highest one) and I've got problem with this game. Overall it's pretty solid aRPG, with fine combat, quite nice story and insteresting characters. Whole idea of sharing body with demon and turning into one or saving your humanity based on your decisions is awsome. Graphics are nice yet world is pretty limited - some sort of hallway simulator. For me it was way too short - it took me ~14h to complete the game with doing most of side quests. I can recommend this game, but it's for sure not for anyone.I need to write few words about combat I played as a warrior with 2h sword and difficutly was harsh. (Playing as stalker stance and using daggers is easier due to thier attack speed compared to 2h weapons). Monsters in this game have enormous pools of HP so don't expect hack'n'slash action combat - it's closer to Dark Souls than God of War with blocking attacks and waiting for opportunity to land blow or two. Then block/dodge again and repeat. Sometimes you had to use some ""exploit"" tactics to beat enemies (for example thier aggro-range, if you run away from them for enough distance they will start to back to thier starting postion - yet killed one don't respawn - so kill 1 enemy, ""leave combat"" wait for HP regen and then kill another one). You also can have one companion in your party but this feature it's kinda broken - they are only somehow helpful if you set thier behaviour as ""defensive"" so they can tank for you and you have free time to hit monsters back - until they're knocked out untill ""combat end"" (they can't really die).Controls - this is a big ""minus"" of this game, controls are ""clunky"", attack windups with 2h weapons are too slow to be effective, kicking enemy shield does not work sometimes like it should, as a warrior you can only block, as a stalker you can only dodge. There is no roll-on side button and that makes dodge'ing some attacks almost impossible. This game would be way better responsive with dodge-roll mechanic.Graphics - besides it's a hallway simulator and zones are pretty limited, graphic quality is fine. Main character model is nice, animations are fine, cutscenes everything fits to the theme. Good point here - dark spaces at night are dark as they should be! (hello Bright Souls 2)Story - it's not bad, it's not good. Yet companions should have more backstory cause you don't really care about them. It's a wasted potential here.Music and sound - fits perfectly - especially last boss theme. It's a strong point here.Overall it's not a AAA game, it's not even pretending to be the one, and it's not worth AAA price, but if you like hard games, hard aRPG games, you should give it a try when it's on sale.PS. Gamepad is strongly recommended for this game.			"

												I'm glad this went on sale because I forgot about it and due to first impressions it seemed it had issues so I bypassed it at release.  Pros:  I loved the combat, it was as versatile as you wanted to make it with many options for beating any given enemies.Consistent difficulty, never really felt like I was OP due to minimal gold available and weapon progression was held in check.Overall a decent story and the inner demon aspect was very amusing/intriguing.  Not overly complex but the crafting system was well done, with the ability to buy mats and craft anywhere when needed.  Also the different mods for weapons/armor allowed for more variety of gameplay.Cons:Voice acting was pretty poor overall.Too short.  Some replayability if you want achievements but not my style.Would have been nice to see more useful abilities, you could seriously get by with only using 1 or 2.OVerall I'm glad I played it and would recommend to any action RPG fans looking for a diversion.

(there was a particular part in the game where you had to fight two elite enemies at once, it was far harder than the actual boss that came after...) the final, final boss was terrifyingly strong, to the point of just one shoting you with ease, however the boss before that had been a push over??Class balance. (I rolled a full warrior tree and half the ranger and half the pyro, the ranger was far more powerful, this was due to the fact that the warrior can't roll (like it does in all the cut scenes...) and that the daggers attack faster and the pyro skills don't scale with the base damage they're set, so flaming daggers > flaming great sword.Voice acting. At times good at times terrible, also weird experiences such as the enemy reading my line, then me reading it xD----------------------------------------------------------------------All this said, if you can brush off a bit of unpolish here and there to enjoy the story and battling your own morality for a weekend I would definitely pick this up =)!Thanks to the developers <3 P.S.

												Combat feels polished and flexible, thoguh the Warrior stance always feels a bit clunky and slow (in a good way, you're wielding a heavy weapon after all). Story is alright, kind of a short journey though with it only being 3 Acts and an short end segment with a somewhat difficult Final boss, even on the easiest difficult setting. It's pretty much a discount Witcher. You only really get one choice though to change anything in the plot and it comes in the Swamps, and it basically boils down to ""Let the Demon take over"" or ""Stay Human"". I advise making a save when you get to that point so you can play both paths with the same ""character"". I felt it was a pretty well-done RPG from Spiders, even with the few issues I found while playing.			"

												(03/10) - Just BadThe graphic looks good and the story seems interesting.Sorry, but that´s every positive point that comes to my mind thinking about this game.The performance is a joke, first time a game lagged on my pc.And the battlesystem, uuuuh the battlesystem. It is not the worst i´ve ever seen, but it feels just like playing an MMO: click the same stuff for hours and watch.Overall the game just feels dull. The movement, the inability to do anything other than walk and hit and most of all the interaction with objects/people. Defeniltly not recommendable...Edit: I wanted to initially write that the dullness in this game feels a lot like the one in ""Mars: War Logs"", to descripe how odd it feels.As i now know: Bound by Flame is from the same developer,  as Mars: War Logs is. Funny when you can see the ♥♥♥♥ they put into their games without even knowing the relaiton...			"

												Came into this not expecting too much of it; I did get it on extreme sale for a little less than seven dollars. It seriously surprised me, though. The combat is really intuitive and challenging - I found myself having to retry fights against regular enemies several times just because they'd take advantage of the smallest mistakes I made - and just plain fun, which is important if your game is a hack-n-slash RPG in the vein of The Witcher. The voice acting is also excellent, and while the script does have some flaws, all the characters are dripping with personality. I love it so far. Great buy.			"

												Enjoyable enough game, though I can see why some people point out ""cliches"".I had fun while playing it and in my opinion the plot had its great moments. The last boss was really good in my opinion.The companions are a clear drawback. The ONLY way to use them effectively is to set them to defensive stance and make them block all the hits they take, so at least it isn't you who has to be dealing with it.The combat is engaging enough, though it relies a lot on being able to land your counterattacks after parrying or dodging.Well worth a try if its on sale, but otherwise not really worth 30 euros.

												This game is worth the time and money you will hopefully put in.+Beautiful world.+interesting characters.+Good combat system with a few recycled ideas pieced well together. Nothing special but Im still happy.+challenging. Most of the challenge is about OP stated enemies but the games built well enough that it pushes the the player to work. Often compared to DarkSouls2 I would say this is harder because unless you really try unlike DS2 there arnt any gamebreaking exploits... so far.+Good story easy to follow and enjoy.+Interesting lore, dialog and conversations. Plus the accents are half the fun.-Its a bit short. The game has such potential and it does color in the lines a lot but there lots they could have done. Missed opportunities. Dosnt ruin the game but does leave its mark.-The game is all about combat which is loverly but after a while it would be nice to solve a quest through smarts or dialog.-The story is a little lacking in some areas. Some events and choice seem dead at there core. Again its not enough to kill the game but it is noticable.-Shity character creation and ingame options for design. Though id like to mention that you can upgrade and alter weapons and armor includng there physical properties, these alterations are limited.Note:+-Many plp like to compare this to Souls games... I would recommend not listning.+-Some plp like to complain about the dialog and accents though idk why. Just FYI.+-There are two differant basic combat types(2handed heavy and daggers) This can be seen as ither good or bad. Some plp are happy we arent stuck with 1 where as some think we need more. Either way the ones we do have are fun and usefull both.8/10All in all its a few good hours of RPG fun. As long as you dont take it to seriously from the get go you might jsut enjoy yourself.Like allways before l recommend a game l recommend its media. Watch a walkthrough or read multiple reviews. Dont buy or ignore based on one opinion. I hope this helps you make an informed decision.			"

												I just finished this game and all the posts on the community about this boss being infuriatingly dififcult compared to the rest of the game are true. I've lost count of how many tries the damn thing took me.This game isn't the longest or the most polished game ever but I liked the plot, the atmosphere and the characters. You can be male or female and I really liked the female choice, she has a bad-♥♥♥ personality. The controls felt like a simplified Dark Souls, I didn't find them particularly awkward but some of the fights can be very difficult. Controller support is very good. There are quite a few choices to make that affect the flow of the plot, the endings and even your character's appearance. Weapon and armour customisation also changes your appearance a lot, a system I liked, although initial character creation is a little limited. Although the world is very linear with no ability to backtrack, there are quite a few side quests with good rewards and lots of hidden treasure to find. This game is often compared to Dark Souls and I think I prefer it to the Souls series because you have companions and in general are a lot less lonely, also there is background music and you can guard-break properly. Most importantly, this game made my inner pyromaniac cackle with glee all the way through the story.			"

												  This one I have mixed feelings on. It was good in some ways, bad in others, but in equal amounts that makes it difficult to love or hate.    On the plus sides, the story is interesting, the graphics were okay. The combat system is diverse, letteing you play as one of three styles or mix them up. A plethora of choices while interacting with the various npcs and party members also allows for some interesting situations.   On the negative, This game feels like the fantasy version of mass effect, in a bad way. The story itself hurts the game when they talk about the Seven Ice Lords, but you only deal with one of them really. It makes it feel like there should be a lot more to the game then what was presented, giving it a feel of being unfinished from the story aspect. There's also supposed to be romantic options, but they are/were quite well hidden.    The game itself did have some issues with the sound that kept dropping out and and doing weird things, and there was some noticable lag during some of the fights.   Overall, I am quite literally on the fence with this one. It was good as well as bad. I would suggest trying this one for yourself, but only if you can get it on sale. Love it or Hate it, Bound By Flame is not worth full price.			"

												An enjoyable game that seems to have been published too early. The combat and story seem like a mix of The Witcher and Dragon Age, and it works well. I would welcome an expansion/sequel that deals with a lot of the unfinished content.SPOILER:The story skips a beat about halfway through the game. It feels as if there is an entire missing Act. The game also takes an incredible difficulty jump at the last boss, as if to make up for the reduced amount of content earlier.			"

												First off, let me say, yes, I do recommend this game. Second off, you’ll most likely enjoy it more or be less annoyed if you can get it on a Steam sale.Bound by Flame is a linear RPG set in a dark fantasy setting (mostly medieval humans, elves and undead). Where this game tries to stand apart from all the other dark fantasy RPG games, in my opinion, is the following: 1. Combat options are limited - either a two handed sword or dual wield daggers - but you are empowered by a fire demon to buff your attacks and give additional fire damage.2. You can upgrade or customise the armour and weapons that you loot or buy with ingredients that you can loot or recycle from weapons or armour.3. It is quite difficult. Presumably the developers aimed at Dark Souls difficulty, but for me the easy difficulty was enough of a challenge to keep me interested.Bound by Flame is a good game – it is not an excellent game, yet you could believe that the developers were aiming for something spectacular, but then their time or money ran out. Some aspects of the game are truly excellent, but unfortunately the combination of all these aspects aren't as polished as you’d like.The music is excellent; combat music or ambient music. It sets the somewhat sad and melancholic mood that underlines the whole “end of the world” situation. The 3D models are quite good, however the quick time movie events that tells the story could have used more work. The voice acting was well executed, but unfortunately the subtitles contained quite a few spelling and typographical errors. Character creation is very limited: you get to pick one preset face out of four for each gender.Environments / maps are limited. Think Dragon Age 2 maps, but for a shorter game. Enemies respawn, so you can farm for loot or XP if you'd like. Combat is quite basic, yet effective. You only have two stances: melee, using a two handed sword, and ranger, using two daggers. Timing is critical as you have to block or dodge, stun (by means of a kick or crossbow bolt) or attack between enemy attacks. You can also make use of fire magic to buff and support your normal attacks (e.g. setting your sword aflame or throwing fire balls). You get to loot each and every enemy you kill. Loot entails weapons and armour, as well as raw materials with which you can craft potions, traps, or components with which to upgrade your weapons and armour.Story wise it’s a tried and tested formula. The world is in danger and you have been empowered to be the only one capable to save it. You gather some companions to help you in this struggle, but certain choices will cause them to leave you. The choices are somewhat artificial – it doesn't change the story at all, except for the final scene and end credits. It is quite short; I wasted a lot of time farming and replayed a level or two and still finished in 20 hours. However, at the end of the game it feels like the developers had had a longer game in mind but were forced to quickly tie everything off and finish it.Comparisons have been made between this game and far bigger and more successful games. Sure, the whole choice system is getting to be an empty promise as precious few games allow you to truly change the story by means of your choices. The storyline is always the same but for a few inconsequential differences. Therefore don’t expect this game to revolutionise the choice system, or anything else for that matter. Play it because it contains just good and clean hacking and slashing, some disturbing imagery, and some unexpectedly well rendered graphics and witty dialogue.			"

												Well I just finished game on buffalo difficulty (one step lower than highest one) and I've got problem with this game. Overall it's pretty solid aRPG, with fine combat, quite nice story and insteresting characters. Whole idea of sharing body with demon and turning into one or saving your humanity based on your decisions is awsome. Graphics are nice yet world is pretty limited - some sort of hallway simulator. For me it was way too short - it took me ~14h to complete the game with doing most of side quests. I can recommend this game, but it's for sure not for anyone.I need to write few words about combat I played as a warrior with 2h sword and difficutly was harsh. (Playing as stalker stance and using daggers is easier due to thier attack speed compared to 2h weapons). Monsters in this game have enormous pools of HP so don't expect hack'n'slash action combat - it's closer to Dark Souls than God of War with blocking attacks and waiting for opportunity to land blow or two. Then block/dodge again and repeat. Sometimes you had to use some ""exploit"" tactics to beat enemies (for example thier aggro-range, if you run away from them for enough distance they will start to back to thier starting postion - yet killed one don't respawn - so kill 1 enemy, ""leave combat"" wait for HP regen and then kill another one). You also can have one companion in your party but this feature it's kinda broken - they are only somehow helpful if you set thier behaviour as ""defensive"" so they can tank for you and you have free time to hit monsters back - until they're knocked out untill ""combat end"" (they can't really die).Controls - this is a big ""minus"" of this game, controls are ""clunky"", attack windups with 2h weapons are too slow to be effective, kicking enemy shield does not work sometimes like it should, as a warrior you can only block, as a stalker you can only dodge. There is no roll-on side button and that makes dodge'ing some attacks almost impossible. This game would be way better responsive with dodge-roll mechanic.Graphics - besides it's a hallway simulator and zones are pretty limited, graphic quality is fine. Main character model is nice, animations are fine, cutscenes everything fits to the theme. Good point here - dark spaces at night are dark as they should be! (hello Bright Souls 2)Story - it's not bad, it's not good. Yet companions should have more backstory cause you don't really care about them. It's a wasted potential here.Music and sound - fits perfectly - especially last boss theme. It's a strong point here.Overall it's not a AAA game, it's not even pretending to be the one, and it's not worth AAA price, but if you like hard games, hard aRPG games, you should give it a try when it's on sale.PS. Gamepad is strongly recommended for this game.			"

												Plays like a mix of The Witcher and Dark Souls. Getting the best performance out of the battle mechanics requires some internet research.Controlls are fluid (being slowed down seems to store actions in a qeue tho)Story starts off with some really bad exposition and storytelling faults but becomes actually decent once you get out of the prologue. Seems to have some inexperienced voiceactors.Plot makes hefty use of tropes but still doesnt disappoint.I don't understand why the game's only got an ""Average"" - exceeds many games in performance and immersion and was very fun to play.Also runs without any problems on low-end computers.

												Over an hour in I am leaving this review for anyone who, like me, is looking at this game while it is on offer and wondering if they should get it...Do.It is a great looking game, graphics are very unique, almost cell shaded yet realistic at the same time, combat so far is engaging, no idea why people are complaining about pressing left mouse for attack, right for heavy and space for block. It looks simple yet you need to keep and eye on the enemies. You will enjoy it I promise.			"

												Short and sweet(like this review), this game is a great fix for that action adventure fantasy RPG craving that I feel when I'm not in the mood to dive into something huge like The Witcher, or an E.S. game. Cheap story, cool armors/weapons, surprisingly difficult combat (depending on the setting), and average 2012ish graphics, it really accomplishes all that it needs to. Not sure why all of the negative reviews. Come on people, not every game can be top shelf. I give it a 7.5/10. Definitely worth the 10 bucks its on sale for at the moment.			"

												The reason I bought this game is that I saw the walkthrough one guy made on the YouTube. The game looked interesting, so I decided to play it.I didn't regret it.Yeah, okay, the game looks cheap. It is obvious that the developers had a very small budget to make it, but it is still good. Gameplay is easy to catch but difficult to master (for those of you who will play - daggers for the win, guys, trust me on that!), bosses for the most part are really tough. The game doesn't offer much for those who love complex tactical battles, they are more based on using your reflexes like dodging at the right time and quickly counter-attacking. Still, it adds to the game's dynamics, which is great to my liking)The story is rather simple, yet catchy, characters are... well, some of them strongly reminded me of Dragon Age: Origins. For example: early in the game you will find a sex-appealing witch with a lot of attitude. Oh, and you meet her in a middle of a swamp. Pretty much like Morrigan, yeah? And it's not the only example. Oh, and trust me: companions are completely worthless in this game, you'll have to do all the job yourself. The only exception seems to be Sybil who can heal you, the others though... Well, at least you can talk to them.All in all, the game is good. Not perfect - good. It is dynamic, rather short (I beat it in 11 hours) to feel boring and it offers some challenge.

												I would give this game a 6/10. Enemies were very linear and would do the same move over and over again almost as if it was broken or glitched. Most minions as well as boses felt the same making the game feel very small with its character designs. And almost every fight seemed to be a pain in the ♥♥♥ and not fun when they do the same move. This game would be lower on the scale without it's beautiful landscapes and maps with a good interface. The Dialog was okay at times. And the spells seemed to be broken with the upgrade of the fireball that made it go three different ways instead of three in a line doing more damage and being more effective. And not getting health points and magic points every level didn't help with the game, while having two ""feats"" or skills for health and magic points that only increase your health and magic and total of twenty points. But with the seemingly broken AI this game wasn't very fun.			"

												I thought that this game was a really good game that had a lot of great mechanics, but it just barely missed the mark. The fighting mechanics were great, and the voice acting was incredible. This game missed a few things that I hope will be fixed with a sequel or with a some dlc, such as a more free world aspect, better transitions between cutscenes and actual gameplay, and better character introduction. I was also hoping for a continuation after you finished the game and I wish it was a lot longer, but for the price I enjoyed my experience. I really enjoyed how this game portrayed the story and how the introduction of characters is really well thought out, but I was hoping that there would be a lot more character and relationship development. Overall this was a really good game and it just needs a few tweaks done to fix its problems.			"

												The game is enjoyable but unfortunately it has several drawbacks. First of all they sell this game as an RPG but in truth it is a hack and slash with RPG elements. No classes, just 3 skill trees from which you can pick new abilities and spells, following Gothic style. The quests are always the same: find the monster and kill it, or find an item and bring it back. The game itself is very short and has only 4 main areas. Bosses are repetitive and frustrating, you only have to fight them in ranger mode and dodge powerful attacks. I gave up at the final boss, and you can count the game I haven't completed in my life with your hand. In short, buy this during sales, but don't expect too much, it resembles Gothic but it has nothing to do with that masterpiece.			"

												Good game.Pros-Interesting story-Varied assortment of characters-Frenetic and exciting combat-Great crafting system-Good amount of choices and consequencesCons-Subtitles tend to not match the voice acting (character says one thing and the subtitle says another), same with some descriptions of monsters etc-Pretty lackluster boss fights-While good, the combat could have used some polishSummaryThe combat takes some getting used to, but when you get past that point the game becomes a journey that, while short, it thoroughly enjoyable. Except the last boss fight. Screw that one.			"

												I recommend trying the game if it's on discount because you'll be disappointed if you pay the full price. It is slow and not completely original but they did try to include new ideas which is commendable but the story itself is quite short. Don't be fooled because it says I have 3 hours on record because I have played about 20 hours but has refused to register. So all in all it's a nice game to try providing that you don't pay $30 for it.			"

												I have played bound by flame and uploaded gameplay on youtube.I will have the link below. But, despite some negative reviews on here I think it was really good however, the pros and cons.Pros: Story is very well written so far         Voice acting was very funny and played very well         Combat System is very interesting and somewhat new to me although i know there are games that have a similar     system.         Graphics are awesome despite my system having a bad graphics card.         There is more but i am very early into the game but after i am finished i will write a more indepth review.Cons: Combat system is very slow at the start          Character customisation is very limited just not much to it.          Once again i am very much early into the game but overall it is a fun game to play despite the cons.

												Bound by Flame is probably the less developed Dragon Age or Witcher, in which the story is ok, the talents are decent, the combat is action based and fine, but nothing spectacular.To be honest, I enjoyed this game quite a bit until act 4 when it became ""trying to get back up simulator""  Every darn thing knocks you down and it becomes very annoying.

												I found this game to be fun and enjoyable although it could be better. The story line is very scripted and there aren't a lot of choices other than whether you want to stay human or go demon. There are some romancing options, but nowhere near as enjoyable as the witcher. It took me a bit to get used to the fight mechanics, but once I did, it was pretty fun. I found the ranger line to be the most fun -- riposting was a blast.			"

												-Before you look at the thumb, I have to warn that it is not worth the $39.99 asking price, but it is fun.If anyone is a fan of the Witcher 2, then this is familiar playground.  After spending 21 hours worth into this game, it does a great job of intense combat, decent characters, and a consequencial plot.  It's one downside are some textures that look downgraded, but Spiders Interactive has what it takes to get into the ARPG crowd.  Hopefully we see a spin-off or Prequle that can enrich the lore of this universe even further.  One last thing, the interaction with the Demon is interesting to say the least, even if the voice acting for Vulcan and FemVulcan is at Jason Brodey (FarCry 3) levels.  So yeah, buy this at your own risk.			"

												Plays like a mix of The Witcher and Dark Souls. Getting the best performance out of the battle mechanics requires some internet research.Controlls are fluid (being slowed down seems to store actions in a qeue tho)Story starts off with some really bad exposition and storytelling faults but becomes actually decent once you get out of the prologue. Seems to have some inexperienced voiceactors.Plot makes hefty use of tropes but still doesnt disappoint.I don't understand why the game's only got an ""Average"" - exceeds many games in performance and immersion and was very fun to play.Also runs without any problems on low-end computers.

												Bound by Flame has a fairly interesting setting that hasn't been explored all that often in games. Even though the game has some nice ideas such as the choices you make during the story having an effect on the appearance of your character and equipment customization system that affects both the looks and stats of your equipment, they aren't enough to save it from being a mediocre action RPG that is being held back by its low production values.Between things like terrible writing, poorly balanced combat, badly designed boss encounters, dull environment design, short length and a cast of genuinely unlikeable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ characters - it is difficult to recommend the game, especially at full price. That being said, the concept they had for the game is good and ambitious. Unfortunately the execution is poor and lacking the polish it required, which ultimately makes for an experience that occasionally manages to entertain but more than often frustrates the player with its shortcomings.

												Well I just finished game on buffalo difficulty (one step lower than highest one) and I've got problem with this game. Overall it's pretty solid aRPG, with fine combat, quite nice story and insteresting characters. Whole idea of sharing body with demon and turning into one or saving your humanity based on your decisions is awsome. Graphics are nice yet world is pretty limited - some sort of hallway simulator. For me it was way too short - it took me ~14h to complete the game with doing most of side quests. I can recommend this game, but it's for sure not for anyone.I need to write few words about combat I played as a warrior with 2h sword and difficutly was harsh. (Playing as stalker stance and using daggers is easier due to thier attack speed compared to 2h weapons). Monsters in this game have enormous pools of HP so don't expect hack'n'slash action combat - it's closer to Dark Souls than God of War with blocking attacks and waiting for opportunity to land blow or two. Then block/dodge again and repeat. Sometimes you had to use some ""exploit"" tactics to beat enemies (for example thier aggro-range, if you run away from them for enough distance they will start to back to thier starting postion - yet killed one don't respawn - so kill 1 enemy, ""leave combat"" wait for HP regen and then kill another one). You also can have one companion in your party but this feature it's kinda broken - they are only somehow helpful if you set thier behaviour as ""defensive"" so they can tank for you and you have free time to hit monsters back - until they're knocked out untill ""combat end"" (they can't really die).Controls - this is a big ""minus"" of this game, controls are ""clunky"", attack windups with 2h weapons are too slow to be effective, kicking enemy shield does not work sometimes like it should, as a warrior you can only block, as a stalker you can only dodge. There is no roll-on side button and that makes dodge'ing some attacks almost impossible. This game would be way better responsive with dodge-roll mechanic.Graphics - besides it's a hallway simulator and zones are pretty limited, graphic quality is fine. Main character model is nice, animations are fine, cutscenes everything fits to the theme. Good point here - dark spaces at night are dark as they should be! (hello Bright Souls 2)Story - it's not bad, it's not good. Yet companions should have more backstory cause you don't really care about them. It's a wasted potential here.Music and sound - fits perfectly - especially last boss theme. It's a strong point here.Overall it's not a AAA game, it's not even pretending to be the one, and it's not worth AAA price, but if you like hard games, hard aRPG games, you should give it a try when it's on sale.PS. Gamepad is strongly recommended for this game.			"

												Für alle rpg-/action rpg gamer die sich dieses game holen wollen:Ja, es erinnert stark an, bzw. ähnelt sehr stark  ""mars: war logs"", aber dennoch ist es anders. Denn es ist irgendwo gefühlt ein Mix aus ""dragon age"" und ""mass effect"". Es gibt zwar LEIDER keine offene erkundbare Welt (genau wie bei Mars: War logs), aber es gibt dafür die Möglichkeit das Verhalten eurer Begleiter direkt zu beeinflussen (genau wie bei mass effect). Ihr könnt euren Begleitern offensives oder defensives Verhalten befehlen, ihr könnt mit ihnen smalltalken usw.Das Taktische ist aus meiner Sicht gelungen, ABER: Spielt es in der Schwierigkeitsstufe ""Falcon"" und ihr werdet sehen dass es ganz schnell vorbei sein kann, obohl dies nur die zweitschwierigste Stufe von 4 ist . Die mischung zwischen Haltungswechsel und benutzung von Magie ist der Schlüssel, aber das Glück ist der Masterkey, denn: Leider ist die allgemeine- und vorallem begleiter KI sehr schwach. Eure Begleiter werden sehr schnell erledigt und eure Feinde sind, sobald es mehr als 2 sind, ÜBERMÄCHTIG. Ihr könnt nicht mehr erkennen wann ihr blocken oder ausweichen solltet und seid somit ganz schnell geschichte... Eure Begleiter werden teilweise sogar von einem einzigen Gegener überrannt und ihr seid ganz schnell gefrustet.Aber: gebt euch (genau wie ich) einen Ruck und ihr werdet bestimmt Spass und Freude an diesem Game haben, dass von einem Team geschaffen wurde welches wahrscheinlich weniger finanzielle Grundlagen hat als ein Minijobber bei za...do...

												Very pleasently surprised by this game.You play a character inadvertently possessed by a demon and this is the games hook.Is the demon evil or good. If you accept it's increasing possession of you, how will that play out with your companions, will its extended powers help you or hinder you. Sometimes the obvious choice is not the right one...or is it.Not being quite sure makes the story engaging and makes a replay inevitable.Combat is very good, you can become a master of all trades to a certain extent, with Warrior/Rogue and Fire Mage powers available to you and use all the powers in succession, eg. Stealth into battle, Kill some mobs, then apply fire to your 2 hand sword, throw fireballs, send out a wall of fire to push enemies away from you etc.Combat is also done in the presence of companions, you can have one at a time from a stable of 4 or 5, they each have their own abilities, like, Mage, Ranger, Warrior, Healer, They are not great but they do keep enemies occupied while you take care of business.Bosses are VERY impressive for the budget scale of the game, in size, design and combat ability.There are plenty of quests, none of which will keep you too engrossed, but they serve their purpose.My main gripe with the game so far is the quest system (but only a slight gripe). Some times you will fail a quest because you haven't read the fine print, eg. you may do a quest and get XP for the different components of it, but see a RED X beside something and find that you should have done the quest in the presence of a certain NPC, or events in the game may over take your quest progress and you may not be able to hand it in because the quest giver has died, but pretty much small potatoes and stuff for your subsequent playthrough.

												helloThe goodThis is a good game and the story is not bad.The RPG and story are quite good and the cut scene are quite good.you can play male or female (human) the 3 ""classes"" a works well.The availability of all the style at all time is really good and seemless, so you have plenty of option to manage a fight. as well, you can use choke point and traps.in short, I liked the combat system and the difference between the warrior style and the rogue/ranger style.The ranger style is probably easier to get the doge and the attack doing the movement for you.The interruption is very important for the warrior,  So kick and parry need to be timed and used appropriately.  And you will need to use that or the game even in easy mode will be quite hard.The bad There is romance  and it is reasonably well made but there is no same sex romance, hence the bad.The two first level bosses takes for ever and a day unless you meta-game.the companion AI is somewhat random... :-)The uglyFor me the main issue is that like all directly level based games is the power curve effect on the game experience, you end up having MMO level of grind tediousness to the MMO/dragon age II level.So if you do not have a good grip on the combat and or not that much extra equipment, the combat with Bosses with peta-hit points are dragging for ever.and as you guessed when you have a certain level of proficiency, you really sail through and the combat that I used to look forward just became a formality.I started in the pen-ultimate hardest level and changing to the hardest just slightly impacted on my resources.phil			"

												A strong RPG with a powerful tone of helplessness and destruction that reaches for greatness but dosn't quite make it. A oddly crude script and odd writing choices let it down, along with some mixed voice acting. The impact of your choices is never quite clear, and the reactions of characters as you become more and more demonic borders on bizarre, with only a few commenting upon your outright demonic appearence mid to late game, yet still treating you as if you were the same human. Gameplay wise, it plays like a fable game, with mutliple combat styles, with the magic sadly constrainted to late game due to needs for specific builds to actully be useful. Difficulty widly fluctated also, with even regular fights being very challenging on normal early on, to bosses being only beaten through cheap tactics and spamming parry.  Many bosses and enemys relied upon shockwaves to discorage melee rushing, except several such as the ice general were way too powerful, with AOE's taking up half the arena and most of your health.  The game also suffered from some glitches and bugs with characters getting stuck on climbing patches, and referancing events in dialouge yet to happen.This was a game with some fantastic ideas,  but like mars war logs is let down by flawed execution, unfocused character development and a combat engine that really needed some work. The final boss especially highlighted problems with the system, as if you don't bring traps or a good crossbow and at least 60 bolts you are a bit screwed. If you like action rpgs, this is worth a shot.6/10.			"

												This is a simple hack and slash style game. Apparently some mages tapped into a tree that contains all the worlds magic and started taking over the world. As a last ditch effort a few other mages try a spell they had very little clue what would happen and ended up trapping a demon inside you. Throughout the game you are given choices to accept its power or stay pure blooded.Combat system is fairly straight forward. The attacks and special abilities vary dramatically based off the weapon you are holding. With a sword you can kick to knock enemies out of a block or you can use the daggers where you now have the ability to dodge! I warn you, the final battle cheats.			"

												Pretty good story, good voice acting for the most part. Fast play ... but even on Recruit (easy).... End boss ... after 3 hours straight of fase smashing. Unbeatable. If I wanted to smash my face I wouldhave played Dark Souls. Don't waste your time money or effort. Completely different than the whole rest of the game. I went in with 50+health potions, traps, Crossbow bolts, everything. Fully maxed out in both warrior and pyromancer. Can't get him to %50 without using all of it. One shot kills from the boss and I couldn't get past Phase 1. The rest of the game was enjoyable and I selected Recruit thinking it would be more of a hack and slash and story ride, not a grind, keyboard smash fest..... What a waste.			"

												Ok so I got this game knowing the reviews were mixed going in.  I played Mars War logs (same dev) and enjoyed the atmosphere of that game but the combat was a bit messy at times. After a little research it seems war logs players found bound in flame to have a much tigher combat system.  After purchase I am very happy to say I agree. The game is smoother, the skills are more straightforward, the characters are better, the crafting and upgrade systems is much more varied, and it feels a little like the first witcher game.  Combat has consequence though I find myself bruteforcing it from checkpoints sometimes (I wish there was a darksouls checkpoint system instead to force me to learn to fight properly #lazygamer). Overall I am greatly enjoying this game and it is definitely worth the 10$ I spent on it.  I'd pay for it up to about 25$ and feel satisfied by it so look for it on sale. Happy hunting.			"

												After getting past the first horrible hour, I really like the game. At this point I can’t insist that you purchase it but I like it. The graphics are very pretty. They’re like a mix of Skyrim and Kingdoms of Amalur. Not realistic but not cartoony either.For whatever odd reason, the combat is action-rpg but with an optional targeting system like Dark Souls. I have yet to find a real purpose for it, sticking to the basic face my camera in the direction of my enemy and slash away. The difficulty of enemies is also similar to Dark Souls but with a bit more fast paced action.I’m really glad I pushed past the first forty-five minutes of the game. While I have to put up with a lot of disgustingly horrible dialogue, I’m really enjoying it so far.Full First Impressions at http://gameversevault.com/bound-by-flame-first-impressions/ "

												I'm no professional  reviewer but I will tell you what I've observed:Combat is fluid and fast but unreactive. Like many have said, you hit the enemy and there's not much else to it. The health bar decreases and you move on to the next enemy.The targetting systems is old. Press ""R"" to target and flick your mouse-wheel up or down to change targets. I remember that from ""Advent Rising"" and even then I hated using it. It's not a bad system, but a little more intelligent optimization of the engine may have made targetting more intuitive.Voice acting is very emotionless in most cases but very over-the-top in others. Talk to Mason if you want to know what I mean.  The voice actors they chose for the male and female characters simply don't match the character models, but that's a personal opinion.Despite some of those very small issues, I am still having fun!  The story so far is great and the characters are interesting.  I try not to compare one game as a whole to another game. If I wanted another Dragon Age or Amalur, I would play them.Hopefully you have fun, too. For $39.99, I think it's surely worth it.  Enjoy.			"

												As a Beta game it has a lot of promise.  However it definitely has some balance issues.  For instance during the tutorial you can frustratingly die over and over again trying to learn the game mechanics.  You will face multiple enemies and while you are learning the tutorial you die.  Crawl, Walk and run is not a training tactic used here.  Even Dark souls  had a easier start, lol.  I think the game has enormous potential and deserves future attention.			"

												Eventhough it comes with its small imperfections like out of synch lip movement and some of the add-on armor parts clipping with the armor itself.The game itself is well optimized for pc use though single gpu preffered it seems, the game takes very little resources to run.The art style looks amazing and the graphics are fairly solid quality.I personally dont like the in game music at all it tends to be out of tune with the game 90% of the time, fast paces at relaxed moments not rough enough for action, but your pretty much forced to keep it on [im usin at like 30% volume] considering some of the cutscenes sound affects are worked into the music wich makes the cutscenes really awkward now and then with music comepletely off.The controls seem alittle off at first but they end up being really well layed out [keyboard/mouse]Difficulty wise its sliced down in the middle not to easy not to hard [though i havent tried the hardest difficulty]The story is captivating its a cliche with a new twist, the voice acting has solid work and the main character i found to be lovable a cheecky little merc with a sence of adventure and the moral choices are handled well not making the character feel like he/she has way to many mood swings.All in all theres much more to say and way more detail for it to be said in, but in my opinion :This is a 40 euro game that somewhat feels high budget tripple A yet small studio tender love and care,it simply is a solid buy i personally find it on equal level with the big name large budget rpg's out there [if not better then some of them].If i have to make comparisons it feels like Dragon age 1 plotish fableish char development [looks wise] mass effect 3 upgrading [but with materials needed for ''mods''] combat wise closest would be the witcher series you really need both fighting styles and at higher dificulty ''magic'' and even bombs/crossbow become somewhat needed.If this sounds interesting pls do buy this game and support its developer in hope of seeing another game such as this.PS : found 0 buggs so far.

												Honest review, so far. I am about as far as the 7th screen shot on steam currently, not too far into the first true chapter.So Bound by flame is definitley not blockbuster of the year. But it, so me, is still a great idea of a game. If you are looking for another Dark souls, Dragon age 2, Witcher video game, look no further. Now the storyline is your typical RPG. World is being ravaged by frost demons, your a merc, get partially possessed by a fire demon, meet allies along the way to do various things, heal, archery, so forth. You set out to save your world, now I haven't got far enough for the demon possession yet, see if the storyline changes or what not, but that ties into the skills. Now the 3 you have, is Warrior, two handed weapon, heavy damage, block, parry/counter attack, and stun with a kick. Ranger, dual wield daggers, parry/counter, i think, played mostly warrior, and dodge, wish warrior had dodge.IT IS SLOW to switch stances by the way. No quick on the fly. Last is Fire Magic. Which you can use in both your stances, light your blades on fire, fireballs, so forth. The skill tree in my opinion, as fast as I have been leveling is small. Not terrible added with Crafting. As well as traps and a crossbow for non magic long range, not skills. There are also perks, you unlock by doing things. For instance getting more health, just drink 5 potions, and unlock the perk with a point. Experience, magicka, weapons, everything almost has a perk. THE KEY to combat in this game is BLOCK TIMING. I cannot stress this enough. It is learning the enemy moves, and knowing when to parry. Combat is fun, but if using only one skill set, becomes repetitive, but this early for me isn't bad since im still trying to learn the timing, and I keep dying, its a nice challenge without being too much like DS. It feels good to start demolishing a foe with ease when you know its moves. Then a new one comes along. All the regular enemies have different attack styles. And the 2 bosses I have fought, one being huge, attack its armour while fending off its lackeys, and besides its almost one hit kills, is fairly easy. The 2nd in the 7th screen shot on steam so far, ""SPOILERS"" Is all by his lonesome, but has a high health bar, few attacks, but they hit fairly hard, but are fairly easy to counter once learned, and its defense attack where he springs spikes out of the ground, can quickly kill you if you get caught in a pinball machince effect with it, and is not as easy to defend from, for if you can't dodge because your not in Ranger mode, you can't just block as a warrior. Now with that, the crafting, COLLECT EVERYTHING! Almost every enemy drops some kind of loot, or money, and sometimes items, along with coming across a rock you can search and barrels and crates, SEARCH IT ALL, GET IT ALL. ""SPOILERS"" The barrells can be like chest mimics, they look like womens privates. """"So CRAFTING uses all you find, gold can be used within your menu to buy items you find for the basics, and then the basics make the higher tier regeants. So no needing to always stop by a town, even potions can be made on the go. So with the regeants in check, you can make armor and weapon mods, on the go. The higher the weapon and armor, the more mods available to make, from resistances, to more power, or speed, so on and so forth. Which is why with this added to the perks and the skills, its balances nicely for now. This is not the best game I have ever played, nor is it amazing, maybe great or good, and ok, lacking in some areas. Dialouge could be better, talking to someone and being in a cinematic view is ok, but then your still talking to the peson, and even though it looks like you can move, you can only move your camera angle. Small things like that. On a 1-10 system, a 7. I will update when I get there. Hopefully this lets you know what your getting into, and wether you want to pay the $40 for an indie developer, who is actually pretty good. If this game came out 2 years ago now, say around DA2, then it actually might be amazing, especially from an indie developer, now with the new consoles, new games, it still holds its own to me without falling through the cracks.

												I do enjoy playing this game despite the numerous negative reviews. For one, it has an action rpg feel that is enjoyable. The battles aren't easy like most games make them to be and, although there are silly diologues here and there, it does not take much from the main story. There are enough skills to manage each situation in a very balanced manner. Overall, Bound By Flame can definitely provide a challenge without making combat dry and loathed.			"

												Having a ball with this game. Is it the best game? no, but it sure is fun, the game lets you feel overpowered, combat is fun and exciting as well as the creatures that you face. It's tactical, always progressing, rewarding and has a decent amount of play time.I highly reccomend it.			"

												For $33 this is a solid game. Any person who expected a AAA game at that price is naive. The game does lack in areas such as combat which isn't terrible but feel slow and clunky. The dialogue and scrip seems subpar. But the crafting seems deep and interesting. Overall i'd say if you're looking for something to keep you busy till Watch_Dog / Wolfenstein launches then this is a good choice.			"

												I bought this game because I loved Mars: War logs. In prologue everything seems it would be similar - everything is perfect there - the tension, desing, graphic, music, voice of desperate renegade, but after that it goes wrong. 1/3 of the game you spend in a dull jungle/swamp - yes it could be interesting if it would be made more dark/mysterious with cool natives, but here it is just dull - dull quests, dull villagers, the music is still the same, so it starts to be annoying and it just doesn't fit. I tried to continue just to find out that another 1/3 of the game you spend in similar dull city/mountain corridors. I didn't bother to continue...There was nothing about the background of the story, no cool places. I would expect more compact story you would uncover about the world around you, but it is not really connected in this world - it is just random names of random groups. The only interesting thing there is your dialogue with the demon inside of you and your decisions about it. The reason why Spiders changed the style is in this interview:http://spiders-devblog.tumblr.com/post/53755625960/check-out-the-interview-of-jehanne-rousseau-ceoIt seems like they wanted bigger world, but they don't have experience in that - as George Lucas said that to create a fantasy world you need to create all the background so it would looks realistic and you need a lot of ppl and time for that. And that is what this game doesn't have, why the factions and places seems so dull. It is still better to have less but with really well developed background then make it bigger but with no background and fail it in the end. I guess Spiders are better with narrative games rather then action games - there is quite a lot of them already and they will never be as good as some American companies who don't develop almost anything else. If Spiders would want to get better rating they could change their engine that would allow them to implement better fighting system or better movement - like jump. So I don't know if I should recommend this game. But it has nice graphic, the idea of the demon is cool and for some players it will be still OK.			"

												Not bad for a first from this studio. The story is kind of linear and easy to guess. The combat system is fun but less tactical than I thought. The party members all have a personality of their own, but we can't really get attached to them since there aren't enough dialogue options. The plot changes if you chose good or evil, there is no inbetween. Any of the romance options have really few moments dedicated to them, not enough. Plus the language has a ""Holywood"" kind of vibe. It didn't really fit for me.The environment, game logistics and customerisation systems, and even the crafting system all have my thumb up. The music is marvelous and still good even after the second playthrough. Overall, it's not a bad game. I still think it could have been a whole lot better and it felt like a cheap ripoff of dragon age.Although, I would recommend this game to parents that have a hard time finding games for their 12 to 15 years old kids. They often want big games that are rated 18+ with an adult vibe. This game would be a good inbetween since there are no visible sex scenes and not that much violence. It's like an intro to the 'adult-like' game world.			"

												So I knew that Bound by Flame was developed by a small studio and it probably wouldn't be on par with other high budget RPGs like Dragon Age or Skyrim, but I had heard some positive reviews and was hopeful that it might end up being one of those overlooked gems that just never quite got the attention it deserved.But I was wrong…so so wrong…To anyone thinking about buying this on a steam sale DO NOT DO IT!The game has some potential, I’ll give it that.  The combat was fun…for the first couple of hours, until you realize there are about 9 different enemies, including bosses, that just reuse the same animations over and over until they becomes a chore to get through.The story and characters you’ve already seen before, only done better in other games.The crafting system is interesting at first when you actually have to make choices about what upgrades you want, but by the second chapter the game just starts throwing resources at you like they’re going out of style.At one point you’re forced to make a choice to A) attack an enemy general, or B) save your army from an ambush.  Playing the paragon role I naturally chose to save my forces from they’re impending doom……by immediately attacking the enemy general…Seriously…And don’t even get me started on that final boss.If you’re really hurting for something to play then try Skyrim, Fallout, Fable, hell even Divinity II would be a much better choice than Bound by Flame!

												I almost didn't buy this game because of negative reviews, but I'm glad I did buy it in the end. There is a main story and several side quests to complete, your choices actually do make a difference and the combat isn't bad either. What I especially like are different combat styles. I'm a fan of dual-blades with fast attacks, so I went straight for the ranger tree. There's 2 kinds of attacks (left and right mouse button) and a quick jump backwards for evading hits, so you get a good feel of real live action and aren't just blindly button-smashing.Even though you will get stronger as you progress and will start feeling almost invincoble, you still need to play it smart, or you'll end up dying often. Especially when fighting some stronger enemies. There is a main story and a number of side-stories you can follow.All the characters have personalities, which you will learn through (fully vioiced) dialogs. As you progress through the game, you will meet a few characters, most of which you can invite to be your companions in battle (pets).There are some forking points in the game, where you get to choose (through a dialog with one or more game characters) which direction to move ahead. In some cases, you will have to listen to your gutt feeling to make a hard choice, which can determine who lives and who dies, but I think that makes it even more interesting.I like the graphics and the game plays smooth on my notebook. The only thing I find annoying so far, is that the camera sometimes goes behind trees, bushes and other obstacles in the sceen, covering your view of the character and the battle. Other than that, I'm happy with the game and really enjoy playing it.			"

												This game feels like the joint of The Witcher 2, Dark Souls, and Dragon Age, but lesser-great than those games (of course). The combat and movement for me personally is pretty good and still enjoyable (Because i love RPG games), there are many ways for you to vanquish enemies. But unfortunately, the enemies are still too strong for even lowest difficulty level.The RPG elements i must say not so good, but not bad at all either. The craft system is good enough to produce usefull items that can help you in battle. Levelling system, pretty simple though, but still acceptable as a RPG-Genre game.One thing that i don't really like so far is the way the present the game. The cinematic is pretty bad, it seems really boring on how they design the in-game cinematic, which makes you do not feel the game atmosphere.Overall, this game is still pretty good, grab it on discount and it will worth the price, 7.5/10 :D			"

												 This game surprised me. When I purchased it I figured it just looked like an average RPG with a somewhat interesting storyline. When i started actually playing the game i realized iw as wrong. I really enjoyed the combat system in this game, being a bit of a mix of Dark Souls and the Witcher I found it pretty awesome coming from a guy who thoroughly enjoyed both of the games. The way that they set up the storyline is also similar to the witcher in the fact that your decisions will change the outcome of the game and the general layout (act 1/2/3 etc.). However, I would personally say that what you do in this game has more of an effect than what you did in the Witcher. But that is my personal opinion.I've havent even finished my first play through but im loving the stealth elements already and there are plenty of different ways you can play it. Definitely has re-play potential.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. It has all the elements of a game that i would absolutely love. The story line is somewhat interesting but the dialogue isnt the best. The game seemed to me to be difficult at first but once i got the hang of it the combat became tedious. i invested mostly warrior with some pyromancy for burning blade and the flame barrier by the end of the game i didnt feel particularly powerful. boss battles felt like i was slowly beating them to death with a giant dull butter knife. they couldnt kill me quickly and i couldnt kill them quickly. I opted to go full demon thinking that would provide me with the most power in the game but all the demon bonus powers are a tradeoff and i didnt find them particularly useful or powerful. The graphics were solid but i feel like the demon and various enemys could have been a lot more interesting. overall i wouldnt recommend this game to most people.			"

												With a difficulty on par with dark souls, I was reluctant to delve deeper into this game, as I feel a high difficulty level in gaming is counter intuitive to my purpose (relaxation), however I am glad I did. A wonderfully high graphics game, with beautiful, rich animations. The characters are a little lacking in devolpment outside the main, and the customization for the main is a little sparse. That all being said, the combat is intense (a little clunky, but if one is adaptive, quite rewarding) the story is rich, character driven, and really fun. As with Mars: War Logs, the crafting system is super thorough, and really fun to use on the large variety of weapons and armour one gets. Over all I would say give this game a try, but not when it's full price ;)			"

												This is a good game, but it's a very straightforward experience. Customization options are offered, but are extremely limited. There are 5 faces and 5 haircuts to choose from, and entering a different name will not change the fact that everybody will still adress you as the default 'Vulcan'. There's also a noticeable difference in the quality of the main character's voice acting, so much so that I decided to play a male character, even though I would have prefered to play as a female warrior, as I usually do. The combat is solid and reminds me of Dark Souls in its execution. You slash, block and parry, watching the timing of each one as attacking leaves you vulnerable. It revolves around a system of 3 stances and the proper application of them. Certain enemies need to be met with a sword, while others are more easily dispatched with daggers. The number of potions is limited, so tactics are key. So far, so Dark Souls. The third stance is related to the main story arc and contains fire spells, in the usual offensive (Fire Bolt, Fire Blade) and defensive (Fire Shield, Fire AoE) variaties. All of your attacks can be individually upgraded, which, combined with the everchanging teams of enemies facing you, serves to keep combat fresh. The boss battles are suitably epic, and also remind me a lot of the ones in Dark Souls. All in all I give it 4 stars. I'd suggest playing it with a controller.As a final note for the RPG fans: It is possible to eliminate all the subtitles, combat text and mini-map for a nice immersive experience.			"

												Honest review in my OPINIONGraphics - 7/10The Graphics were good they reminded me of Borderlands mixed with the Witcher 2. Not next gen but not too shabby at all.---------------------------Lore and dialogue 9/10The lore in this game was absolutely amazing! more or less every character had backstory and many dialogue options. It wasn't quite mass effect but it was good.   ---------------------------Storyline 6/10The story for this game completely made sense wasn't particulary amazing but it was good. It's a shame it was not terribly long. ---------------------------Difficulty 4/10This game is incredibly easy. I picked this up for the first time and blitzed through the game side quests all on the highest diffuculty in less than 12 hours. Only the last boss is remotely difficult which took me 5 attempts. Enemies telegraph attacks from a mile away and you can pretty much become immortal by spamming backstep through enemies attacks.---------------------------Gameplay 8/10This remindes me of Dark souls A LITTLE and Dragon Age Origins mixed together.  The game is pretty fluid and although there are some things I would liked to have changed such as more enemy variation and better/more areas with more options than 'Climb'. Add some traps in and more enemies!Overall 7/10For a first release by the company I think that this game was great and I reccomend buying this game and any other titles the developers make in the future.

												Okay Pros and Cons for this game.  I started this game on Steam, but then finished it on my XBOX.Pros1. Battles good.  They require some thinking and tactics when it comes to some of the larger.  Otherwise, they can just be a typical button pushing battle.2. Building your skills into what type of fighter you want to be.  The way you have to switch between the 3 classes depending on what type of creature your going up against is good.3. Its not open world, so you can go through it fairly quickly.Cons1.  The dialog sounds like it was made by a bunch of teenagers making their first game.  Profanity that seems like it was just put in there for profanity.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm no prude, but it just didn't seem in place.  The accents changed constantly.  There was even one that had a typical ""American"" southern drawl which made no sense.  It just seems like they didn't put any effort towards the story.2.  You can't tell good from bad in your dialog choices.  I thought rescuing a particular person sounded reasonable.  Then she killed someone and everyone hated me.  oops.  Plus they put an achievement to ""fall in love"" with particular NPC's.  During the entire game, Im trying to figure out how to do this.  Then all of the sudden one of my chioces led to the achievement.  Not sure how I did so don't ask.  Just keep talking to them and keep your fingers crossed.3.  The end.........I didn't finish it.   There's no way to ""stock up"" before the last boss battle.  They take away your only healer.  The people you go in with instantly get taken over by the boss and start fighting on his side.  I tried several combinations, but was never successful.  P.S. I was on Easy mode.So, my final recommendation is turn off the subtitles, turn the volumn down.  Stock up well before the boss battle.  And when you get to the boss battle, trade it in for a much better game.			"

												8.0 / 10I've only played a little bit so far. But the game surprised me.From looking at the screenshots a lone it looked very... ' cinematic '. Like the main highlights of this game may be just cutscenes. I figured the gameplay would be overdone and too showy like Assassin's Creed's ( just as an example, not hating on it. )But the good graphics kind of threw me off. Rarely is a game blessed with good graphics with a comfortable and simple gameplay. The user interface is simplistic, easy to use, and not at all complicated. Pretty straight forward.I've only played for a hour or so, and so far the only thing I can say negative about this game is that the Voice Acting while not terrible, is a bit lacking. ( I'm just picky with those things. )The use of swearing to add either grittiness or to add some form of crude humor seems a little uneeded. But I guess at times I did have a little chuckle.Also the lore is kind of not explained to you, one of those cases where they throw you in the middle of a new world and you're just suppose to pick up on stuff. Not much is explained to you about it, though you can talk to characters and learn more. Which brings me to my next part, the characters are all designed pretty well. Unique with distinguishable personalities. The dialogue reminds me alot of Mass Effect or Dragon's Age. Which I'm quite fond of.Overall I give this game a 8.0 / 10The game is nice, especially if you're a fan of such games like The Elder Scrolls or Bioware's Dragon Age.My only gripes as I said was the lack of info on lore ( I'm a lore nut. ) And the somewhat scrambled voice acting. Other than that, It's a great game.Co Op would be great though!			"

												Absolutely underrated game, even more so than Mars: War Logs, which was a little hidden gem - rough at the edges, but with some heart. Same here. Combat system is not the greatest, but it's not bad - the Total Biscuit review makes no sense (unless he didn't get into the character development at all). No AAA title, but definitely worth checking out.			"

												While the choices in this game are limited and the combat can be very difficult it is still a very good game. The music is beautiful and the graphics are respectable. Each character is interesting enough to continue to pique your curiosity for the duration of the story and the combat can feel oddly staisfying even if it is unvarried. I think this is an excellent attempt by Spiders to put out a game for fans of Mass Effect and Dragon Age, especially considering it is a bargain priced game, and I look forward to their next product.

												This is the game I've always wanted but never knew it.It's set in a fantasy land with demons and magic and ♥♥♥♥, but at the same time it manages to maintain kind of a gritty feel, like The Last of Us, but with liches.The characters are all fantastic. They all feel real and flushed out without getting up in your face with character developement, including the protagonist. In battle, they're a weird mix of useless and invaluable, depending on how the fight is going.The level up system is perfect. You can choose between 3 skill trees to put your points into, and it's entirely viable to make a hybrid class. All of the level-up rewards give significant bonuses to your character, but none of them make the game easier to play- they just reward you for playing well.The combat is a dream. All of your actions must be deliberate and well thought-out or you'll get hit, but you have enough HP to take plenty of hits before dying. Imagine the skill-based intracacies of Dark Souls, but the forgiveness of a typical hack-n-slash.The morality system isn't really a morality system, it's just a decision of how demonic you want to be. Which is awesome.Overall, BBF is a shining example of what RPG's should be, and I eagerly anticipate the next one.			"

												Great for offline use and fairly challengingLooking for a game to kill some time but, also quite rewarding through battles? Well, this is your go to. I can see this weekend people are looking at the game quite a bit so i thought i'd drop a review for your sakes and add a list of pros and cons. there are some iffy situations in-game that may turn you off but, there is never a 100% perfect game they could always use additional fixes and content. The game overall does deliver but, i wouldn't go as far as to pick it up for full price, now that would be quite absurd. Pros:+Although bad dialogue, it is quite hilarious 90% of the time.+Unique battle system+Challenging+Can be played offline+Able to mix n' match skills across three different skill sets+Customizable armor (can be changed visually and add-ons to the armor sets are possible)+Clear plot+Straight-forward questline/stroyline (it will most likely never become lost)+Visually pleasing bosses/monsters that you'll find quite awesome+Crafting system (don't have to drop gold on every single thing you need)Cons:+Sketchy dialogue (the actors weren't that great although they were funny)+Time consuming combat+Linear world (not rly open world but, there's a lot of area to move around)+Not worth 40$ (if it's not on sale, you can't partake in this coolness)+The archer style isn't really much of a skill, not dependable at al+Overwhelming and unfair battles (depending on what difficulty u pick of course)+Fairly short (10-15 hours of solid gameplay on normal, 25-30 levels of solid content)+No competition (a lot mmos offer player competition but, this one surely doesn't)+Not much replay value, after you finisht the game once you probably won't feel inclined to do it once more+The name you choose doesn't carry over to your game (#foreverVulcan)Hope this helps during your decision to purchase the game or not, i think it's good for 20$ but, not entirely worth it for 40$. Please don't mistake this game for an elder scrolls game or ""dark souls"" series, it's no where near as hard as dark souls and lacks the content/customization elder scrolls offers so it falls into it's own class of game.With regards, your friendly gamer.

												This is a simple hack and slash style game. Apparently some mages tapped into a tree that contains all the worlds magic and started taking over the world. As a last ditch effort a few other mages try a spell they had very little clue what would happen and ended up trapping a demon inside you. Throughout the game you are given choices to accept its power or stay pure blooded.Combat system is fairly straight forward. The attacks and special abilities vary dramatically based off the weapon you are holding. With a sword you can kick to knock enemies out of a block or you can use the daggers where you now have the ability to dodge! I warn you, the final battle cheats.			"

												Great game, I've been having a blast with it, the combat is engaging and solid, it's not unfair at all, every time i die i know exactly why i died, and most of the time is my own fault, it's true that it has some minor flaws, but Bound By Flame is fantastic game anyway, before this i played hundreds of hours of Dark Souls 2 and you know what? the combat feels better in this game, a lot more dynamic, fluent and engaging.A lot of people say the Voice Acting is bad, in my opinion the writing is what is kinda bad, specially those ""merican"" lines like ""at least nobody will see me if I crap my pants"" but... in the end... who cares? Vulcan is supposed to be a ""rough around the edges mercenary"" anyway. In my opinion the Voice Acting is quite good, actually i enjoy listening to the characters talk very much.			"

												I'm glad this went on sale because I forgot about it and due to first impressions it seemed it had issues so I bypassed it at release.  Pros:  I loved the combat, it was as versatile as you wanted to make it with many options for beating any given enemies.Consistent difficulty, never really felt like I was OP due to minimal gold available and weapon progression was held in check.Overall a decent story and the inner demon aspect was very amusing/intriguing.  Not overly complex but the crafting system was well done, with the ability to buy mats and craft anywhere when needed.  Also the different mods for weapons/armor allowed for more variety of gameplay.Cons:Voice acting was pretty poor overall.Too short.  Some replayability if you want achievements but not my style.Would have been nice to see more useful abilities, you could seriously get by with only using 1 or 2.OVerall I'm glad I played it and would recommend to any action RPG fans looking for a diversion.

												A strong RPG with a powerful tone of helplessness and destruction that reaches for greatness but dosn't quite make it. A oddly crude script and odd writing choices let it down, along with some mixed voice acting. The impact of your choices is never quite clear, and the reactions of characters as you become more and more demonic borders on bizarre, with only a few commenting upon your outright demonic appearence mid to late game, yet still treating you as if you were the same human. Gameplay wise, it plays like a fable game, with mutliple combat styles, with the magic sadly constrainted to late game due to needs for specific builds to actully be useful. Difficulty widly fluctated also, with even regular fights being very challenging on normal early on, to bosses being only beaten through cheap tactics and spamming parry.  Many bosses and enemys relied upon shockwaves to discorage melee rushing, except several such as the ice general were way too powerful, with AOE's taking up half the arena and most of your health.  The game also suffered from some glitches and bugs with characters getting stuck on climbing patches, and referancing events in dialouge yet to happen.This was a game with some fantastic ideas,  but like mars war logs is let down by flawed execution, unfocused character development and a combat engine that really needed some work. The final boss especially highlighted problems with the system, as if you don't bring traps or a good crossbow and at least 60 bolts you are a bit screwed. If you like action rpgs, this is worth a shot.6/10.			"

												I bought this game because I loved Mars: War logs. In prologue everything seems it would be similar - everything is perfect there - the tension, desing, graphic, music, voice of desperate renegade, but after that it goes wrong. 1/3 of the game you spend in a dull jungle/swamp - yes it could be interesting if it would be made more dark/mysterious with cool natives, but here it is just dull - dull quests, dull villagers, the music is still the same, so it starts to be annoying and it just doesn't fit. I tried to continue just to find out that another 1/3 of the game you spend in similar dull city/mountain corridors. I didn't bother to continue...There was nothing about the background of the story, no cool places. I would expect more compact story you would uncover about the world around you, but it is not really connected in this world - it is just random names of random groups. The only interesting thing there is your dialogue with the demon inside of you and your decisions about it. The reason why Spiders changed the style is in this interview:http://spiders-devblog.tumblr.com/post/53755625960/check-out-the-interview-of-jehanne-rousseau-ceoIt seems like they wanted bigger world, but they don't have experience in that - as George Lucas said that to create a fantasy world you need to create all the background so it would looks realistic and you need a lot of ppl and time for that. And that is what this game doesn't have, why the factions and places seems so dull. It is still better to have less but with really well developed background then make it bigger but with no background and fail it in the end. I guess Spiders are better with narrative games rather then action games - there is quite a lot of them already and they will never be as good as some American companies who don't develop almost anything else. If Spiders would want to get better rating they could change their engine that would allow them to implement better fighting system or better movement - like jump. So I don't know if I should recommend this game. But it has nice graphic, the idea of the demon is cool and for some players it will be still OK.			"

												ok so i've been through the game twice now and think I can give a decent  judgement on the gamethe story line has alot to fit in because you are kind of starting at the last chapter in a way. Humanity is almost wiped out and are pretty much fighting a losing battle. There isn't any time for a slow build up like other games where usually the antagonist isn't known yet. It's kind of an apocalypse/end of days setting with just the remnants of humanity left. It would be like starting mass effect 3 at the story starting point without having played the first 2. I think alot of people don't get the combat, you can't just wade in to a group and button mash, archers need to be taken out first for example and it's also essential to learn how to parry/riposte or dodge, you can't face tank and expect to get anywhere in the game. You can die in like 3-4 hits but most enemies are slow and you learn their sequences. It's pretty much like the witcher combat, which people also complained about because they couldn't just hit attack all the time. There's a learning curve and I think it's decently challenging and not bad.If you go full warrior spec. you will find it underwhelming and they aren't comparable to the mage spec. Most effective playstyle was to stay in ranger stance so you can dodge and put points into the mage tree, upgraded you fire 4 fireballs at once. Also the first tier of the ranger tree you can sprint in combat so yeah sprinting around in combat behind slow moving targets and firing off a cluster of fireballs at point blank range makes the fights actually pretty easy. There was only one fight with 2 concubines that took a few goes.Mercenaries are not that helpful admittedly in combat, it's best to just take sybil except for when you need to take someone else and put her in defense mode. She will be a decoy for some mobs in group combat and will heal unless she is being pinned down and will heal post battle saving a need for pots or downtime for health regen. There isn't any type of way to augment your mercenaries so I don't know how they scale.I thought the graphics looked pretty good played out at max, the player model especially when it's turned fully demon looks very sharp. It has a really great soundtrack which I thought added alot to the immersion of the game.The voice acting/dialogue is passable for a budget game, there are dialogue choices which can have an impact on your mercenaries though there isn't much depth to it as you end up at the same point in the end.Like any RPG you can augment your gear which will depend more on what style you are playing, it's fairly basic and the crafting system is not complex.The game is around 15 hours doing every quest and You will want to play it through twice if you want to experience other playstyles and see alternate dialogue choice endings.I don't think this game ever tried to pass itself off as a AAA game with a huge studio and multimillion dollar budget. I didn't expect any more as I paid $35 for this game new which is almost 1/3 the price of any other new game where I live.it's not perfect but I think it is still an ok game of a 6 or 7 rating and the bound by flame universe is interesting enough if they expanded on it more that I still enjoyed this game enough to buy any dlc/sequel			"

												I was a little leery going into this game. I heard terrible things about Orcs and Men (though I haven't play it), and Mars:War Logs (Both are prior games made by the same company) had an intresting premise but failed to really hook me in.It seems like Spiders really learned from making the above mentioned games. And made the first fantasy rpg I could really sink my teeth into since Bioware's Dragon Age series.At time of writing this review I'm still fairly early into the game. But here are some of the things I've noticed that may determine wether this is a game for you or not.Combat: The timing of your button presses are important. Some people like to play these types of games (especially if they're using a controller) by mashing the attack button to get your character to attack. This game punishes you for trying. Attacks don't stagger an enemy when they connect (unless the weapon has a high interupt stat). Because of this an extra or a poorly timed attack usually leaves you open to an enemies counter attack. Though this sounds terrible on the surface it actually lends itself to risk vs reward style of combat. Do I want to go for that other swing and risk getting hit? In order to not make this incredible ridiculous with instant counters from enemies, all the enemies (at least the ones I've encountered so far) have a distinctive and usually length wind up for their attacks. If you recognise it you can stop your attacks and throw up a block, or prepare a parry staggering them and letting you get in a free it or two with an increased critical chance if you pick up the right skills and have the right weapon equipped. This kinda leads to my next point...Gear customization: Your weapons and armour can be customized in a diverse manner, and in ways that suite certain play styles. Will you trade increased damage for the ability to have a large interupt stat and therefore allowing you to breifly stagger enemies for a few extra hits? Changing the stats of your weapons and the resistances of your armours to suit the enemies you'll be fighting is a big part of the harder difficulties.Character Development: There isn't a single class. Yes, you can specialise in the archtypes of Rogue (called Ranger in game), Warrior and Mage, but you can switch ""classes"" on the fly by changing stances. And overly emphasizing one style will lead to difficulties against certain foes. Examples: In ranger stance shields are incredibly hard to bypass, but are hardly an obstacle in warrior stance. Large monsters laugh at the warrior stance's attempts to block their attacks but in ranger stance you deftly dodge them. Having to switch the fighting style to match certain enemies (or even at certain points of a fight) is one the games biggest appeals for me.Voice acting: At times the way characters say things break immersion. But the fact that its noticable when it happens means most of the time its good enough to be immersive.Story: I for one am hooked on this story. I don't want to include any spoilers here, but I'm just really excited to see were the plot goes with this one. It's got that ""you know your fighting a losing battle but you're doing it anyways"" kinda vibe going on.			"

												This game is way underrated and underhyped... I dont know how an rpg of this quality slipped under the radar; I had never heard of it until the day it was released. The combat is fun, and challenging enough for a dark souls fan on the higher difficulty levels. RPG elements are in full force and well done: companion quests and relationships, crafting/upgrading, multiple character advancement paths, etc. Full voice acting, and it's done well to boot.The other thing is that this game has really amazing graphics which, equally amazingly, are optimized really well. I can run it on full settings and it looks awesome, and I don't exactly have a cutting edge computer these days. It seems to accomplish this partially by using cell shading in some pretty cool ways - I hope this visual style catches on because it looks great.If you like RPGs you should be playing this game!

												Straight to the point, Bound By Flame is a good game, with a handful of minor flaws that keep it from truly shining. The decision-driven story is interesting. The combat is fun, fluid, and engaging. The characters are varied, versatile, and full of personality. The music is AMAZING. The graphics are decent. The voice acting is technically ""bad"", but I personally find it to be fun and refreshing, because it sounds more realistic when it's so raw and unrefined. There's also a light sprinkling of humor throughout the game which I thoroughly enjoy. Overall, it's a solid game. If you absolutely need some kind of comparison to other games, I'd say it's like a mix of Risen, The Witcher, and Dragon Age 2. Any fan of action RPGs (especially Euro-RPGs) should give it a spin! :)			"

												When I think about this game, my heart skips a beat.  I flat-out love this game.  I had such an amazing experience.  I love Spiders studio in the first place (games like Mars: War Logs and Of Orcs & Men), but this game... my gosh.  Spiders just hit it home.  Spiders created a world that is beautiful and believable.  What's more, every gripe (albeit small) I had about previous titles was alleviated here.  The graphics are polished, yet they don't bog my system.  The dialog is masterfully performed.  The story is memorable.  This game has all the staples I look for - dialog choices, consequences, great controls, loot, upgrades/character leveling, and an open world to immerse myself in to leisurely explore. -and oh, the MUSIC!  Hardly ever do I think about the music in a game.  I might recognize a theme song here or there, but the background audio was so catchy that it was almost distracting (in a good way!).  I saw Total Biscuit’s ""WTF is...?"" of this game.  I know he bashed it.  I’m telling you, I whole-heartedly disagree.  The combat is NOT broken; it’s simply about timing.  It’s downright easy.  It requires just a small investment of time to learn, and you’ll be tearing through your enemies like a boss.If you’re an action RPG fan, you owe it to yourself to give this game a shot.			"

												The $40 asking price for this game is absurd.  I got it on sale and I still feel like it underdelivered in a big way.Graphics:   Extremely dated.  The worlds feels empty, the maps are small.  The animations remind me of Gothic 1, but slowed down to try to copy the feel of the Souls games.  The environments are very low polygon count - only my rig running at 1440p with everything cranked all the way up, it really looks a lot like morrowind with a high def texture pack.  And the textures, ugh.  It's an early 2000 looking game for $40 in 2014.Sound:  I couldn't get past the voice acting.  Between the bored, can-barely-read-lines-from-the-script and the painfully bad script, I couldn't get interested in the story at all.  By the way, what bits of the story I managed to catch (and I usually pay really close attention to the story!) seemed pretty weak.Story:  I guess it might be ok, but it is conveyed via terrible voice acting with profanity that is distracting by how ridiculous it is.  I don't have a problem with swearing in a video game, but when your characters speak like a 2014 recent college graduate and then throw in words with a misguided ""medievel flavor"", it is pretty distracting.  I guess you're some kind of unexpected hero trying to save the day from some evil guys.Gameplay:  It's bad.  There is a skill tree that I suppose is meant to add some depth to it, but you start with almost all of the skills and the skill tree just makes your skills scale up a little as the enemies scale up.  The actual combat is like an awkward dark souls, where you have to use timing and mobility to win.  The problem is that the animations and everything else are so bad that it's frustrating or boring to play.  Sometimes games that fail in graphics or story are still super fine, like minecraft.  This game is just bad and not fun.I can't believe they want $40 for this.			"

												Bound by Flame is an ambitious game with various interesting ideas behind it. Unfortunately, the developer either didn't have the money or the time or the talent to actually realise these ideas. This game is just not particularly good.The story is, on paper, quite interesting... but generally awful voice-acting and dodgy writing made it very hard for me to get invested. I just didn't care about the world and its people, so why would I want to save it? It was an easy choice, then, to ""embrace the demon inside"" but even that was very disappointing. No one seems to acknowledge that my character is looking more and more demonic. In fact, the game seems to have a hard time recognising your character in general. My female character was addressed as a man more often than not, really. Dragon Age Inquisition this isn't.The combat system is similar to The Witcher 2 but lacks any semblance of nuance. Quite frankly, all enemies have stupendous amounts of health and armour whilst you yourself can easily be killed within three hits. Even on the lowest difficulty level. It's touted as ""strategic"" combat, but don't be deceived. What they mean with 'strategic' is that you're expected to go for hit-and-run strategies when you're facing more than simple zombies because otherwise you're in for a world of unfair pain. Graphics-wise this game isn't overly special but it isn't bad either. I found that the game ran really smoothly on my system (which isn't the bulkiest rig around, I can assure you) and the caverns had some nice glistening wall textures. Hair looks terrible, however, and the lighting has an excessive bloom effect that just blurs everything. By the way... Did I mention that the voice-acting was bad? It's been a while since I have been so frequently annoyed by voice-acting. The voices are ALL over the place, with ""British"" accents that sound like they were done by Americans, some terrible ""Oirish"" accents and some inexplicable Americans too. I mean, why exactly is the main character American when almost everyone else speaks with some sort of British/Scottish/Oirish accent? Oh, and one character in particular sounds Russian. Because why not.Overall, this is a budget game that has bitten off more than it could chew. Only die-hard RPG fans should consider acquiring this, and even then, you have to ask yourself if you don't have better games to spend your time with.			"

												Among Golden Axe: Beast Rider this game makes the top in my list of crap games played recently.Bound By Flame is supposed to be an adventure game based in combat with looting and crafting but it doesn't make one single thing right and considering that loot and craft are absolutely boring and tedious I will just talk about the one single thing that at least had to be done right: CombatCombat It is so awful that it reminded me playing Time Commando long ago during earlier 90's, the difference is that while Time Commando been almost 20 years old have a reason to be flawed compared with nowadays games this can't be used as an excuse for Bound By Flame.History, narrative and voice acting is ""Meh"" and there is no reason you will ever remember those.The soundtrack and graphics are absolutelly the opposite from the awfulness gameplay and are gourgeous, specially considering that this is a 4 GBs game.To be very honest it seemed that this game was released before been finished OR the team behind it was in serious hurry to have it released.Considering all above I cannot recommend this game to anyone BUT if you want to try your luck, don't get it for more than $ 5.

												I would give this game a 6/10. Enemies were very linear and would do the same move over and over again almost as if it was broken or glitched. Most minions as well as boses felt the same making the game feel very small with its character designs. And almost every fight seemed to be a pain in the ♥♥♥ and not fun when they do the same move. This game would be lower on the scale without it's beautiful landscapes and maps with a good interface. The Dialog was okay at times. And the spells seemed to be broken with the upgrade of the fireball that made it go three different ways instead of three in a line doing more damage and being more effective. And not getting health points and magic points every level didn't help with the game, while having two ""feats"" or skills for health and magic points that only increase your health and magic and total of twenty points. But with the seemingly broken AI this game wasn't very fun.			"

												I find almost no games to be worth the retail price, and there was never a question of paying full price on this one. But picking it up on sale worked out nicely.I had a few days of fun with this game. Yeah, the writing was inconsistent and the story was tropetastic, but the gameplay wasn't as bad/hard as some have claimed. I think it helped to play a stabby pyro blend instead of warrior, but can't say for sure. What I can say is that combat seemed too easy toward the end (dagger flame on, mash assault, repeat). The twin-boss fight was a bit of a pain, the next two were easy one shots, and the final fight was all about going in with 100 crossbow bolts and 30 healing potions and sprinting in circles ahead of the icy bowling ball salvoes.I actually (kind of) liked Mars <hurk> War Logs too, which this studio did previously IIRC. Now, /that/ was a game with a miserable combat system. But it did have a certain Total Recall/techno-magey sort of charm to it, and the main (English edition) voice actor did a perfectly respectable job with what he had to work with (I may have played a later redubbed version.)If these guys could a) spend ten more minutes brainstorming character and place names, b) tighten up condition checking on the dialogue trees, c) point their script editor to the 20% of lines he seemed to miss on his own pass, and d) fight the urge to keep their male characters swearing like ten-year-old Halo deathmatch players, they would really improve their rep on the story side. On the combat side, well, this game was a lot better than the last one, so keep tweaking.			"

												So wow, i loved this game. I don't play many action RPGs like Dark Souls and stuff, so i can't make comparsions. But the gameplay was legitimately challenging for me at times, even on easy. As well, the story was FANTASTIC. I'll admit, it felt like i missed a couple tidbits of information that would've made things clearer sometimes, but that's to be expected. It's hard to remember to talk to all your companions all the time.All in all, i loved it.And, no spoilers, but remember: It's lonely at the top.			"

												I thought that this game was a really good game that had a lot of great mechanics, but it just barely missed the mark. The fighting mechanics were great, and the voice acting was incredible. This game missed a few things that I hope will be fixed with a sequel or with a some dlc, such as a more free world aspect, better transitions between cutscenes and actual gameplay, and better character introduction. I was also hoping for a continuation after you finished the game and I wish it was a lot longer, but for the price I enjoyed my experience. I really enjoyed how this game portrayed the story and how the introduction of characters is really well thought out, but I was hoping that there would be a lot more character and relationship development. Overall this was a really good game and it just needs a few tweaks done to fix its problems.			"

												Not bad for a first from this studio. The story is kind of linear and easy to guess. The combat system is fun but less tactical than I thought. The party members all have a personality of their own, but we can't really get attached to them since there aren't enough dialogue options. The plot changes if you chose good or evil, there is no inbetween. Any of the romance options have really few moments dedicated to them, not enough. Plus the language has a ""Holywood"" kind of vibe. It didn't really fit for me.The environment, game logistics and customerisation systems, and even the crafting system all have my thumb up. The music is marvelous and still good even after the second playthrough. Overall, it's not a bad game. I still think it could have been a whole lot better and it felt like a cheap ripoff of dragon age.Although, I would recommend this game to parents that have a hard time finding games for their 12 to 15 years old kids. They often want big games that are rated 18+ with an adult vibe. This game would be a good inbetween since there are no visible sex scenes and not that much violence. It's like an intro to the 'adult-like' game world.			"

												A long review of this game is simply not worth my time. Here are a few key features of the game:First, being one of the most exciting parts of a game for many players, I must say the character customization is crummy. You can choose male or female, 5 preset faces, and 5 preset hairdos.The item customization is not great. It is portrayed as amazing, but it is quite bland. Sure, some fo the upgrades look cool, but perhaps it's not the upgrade you want and so you don't get the best looking weapon or armor.The combat feels boring and basic. The only thing you need to do is press Q or Space at the right time and find an opening to use abilities.The bosses were too hard for their fighting style. Some of them had unblockable attacks that dealt too much damage and were fired off too fast. They were incredibly simple, yet they took such a long time to kill which made them drawn out and boring.The visual effects were shoddy to say the least. All of your companions' spells looked like they were made for a children's game, which is to say cartoony.The companions were useful in only two ways: some could heal you, and you could set them to block and act as a personal meat shield. It's not fun to attack enemies from behind with no fear of getting hit or even having to attempt a block.The voice acting was probably the worst part of the game. It felt like I was reading a crummy fan fiction. The dialogue took too much time away from the game. I wanted to hear what was said, what I had to do next, and what was going on, but it took so long to listen that I didn't even care. It's likely that I often spent minutes at a time listening to just dialogue. There was also an annoying factor of trying to enter a location and receiving a two minute speech about whether or not you really wanted to go in there. After skipping parts like that and attempting to enter a new area again, I would be given another speech. I was finally able to enter a cave after the third time clicking ""enter this cave"".The pyromancy tree was a bore. All of the spells felt basic. A wave of fire, a fireball, setting your weapon on fire, and a few defensive fireballs floating around you made all forms of pyromancy a snoozefest. There is no ""excellent combination of weapon styles and spell"" and IGN is one of the biggest sellouts I have seen.Lastly, I can credit the story, it was pretty neat and I enjoyed it.If you really wish to buy this game, wait until it is on sale and about $10. The game is too short and boring to be worth much more than that. Oh well, I am going to beat it anyway.			"

												Every single terrible thing you've read is true. This seems like an Indie game developed by a single Dev as a Kickstarter promo for a bigger project. The combat is sluggish and not very good, enemies have almost no impact response. The voice acting is so bad I wonder if the cast was held hostage and forced to read the lines. The story is same old same old, fantasy save the world etc etc. The Graphics are exceptionally dated and quite ugly. Honestly I'm shocked this game even made it to consoles and never will bother buying from Spiders (the makers) ever again. Nothing in this game merits a purchase. Find something else. Stop saying this anything like Dark Souls.			"

												-Before you look at the thumb, I have to warn that it is not worth the $39.99 asking price, but it is fun.If anyone is a fan of the Witcher 2, then this is familiar playground.  After spending 21 hours worth into this game, it does a great job of intense combat, decent characters, and a consequencial plot.  It's one downside are some textures that look downgraded, but Spiders Interactive has what it takes to get into the ARPG crowd.  Hopefully we see a spin-off or Prequle that can enrich the lore of this universe even further.  One last thing, the interaction with the Demon is interesting to say the least, even if the voice acting for Vulcan and FemVulcan is at Jason Brodey (FarCry 3) levels.  So yeah, buy this at your own risk.			"

												There is something about this game that makes me really want to like it.   Unfortunately, the development team didn't care to spend any time making sure controllers work on PC consistently.  I have a Xbox One controller for PC and this is literally the only game in my entire library that doesn't recognize it.  I even tried playing this with the dreadful Steam Controller and it didn't feel any better.   I get it that most PC fanboys love using keyboard and mouse for everything.  I do not fit into that category.   Controllers are my preferred way of interacting with games period.   I wish someone would have considered players like us before porting this game over.			"

												I would recommend this game on sale. Enemies can be spongy at times and you will generally drop pretty quick but combat overall is satisfying in my opinion. I enjoyed the protagonist male voice acting, but the females is horrible and often cringeworthy. This game has one of my favorite soundtracks of all time. Final boss has a sudden difficulty spike but is beatable. Game is relatively short (under 10 hours if you rush, 10-14 if you take your time), but the 2 stances and how/if you decide to use the demons power were varied enough for me to play through the game twice.

												I've seen lots of people say this game was too hard, but I thought its difficulty curve was fine, you just have to use your head a little bit and considering this is an action RPG, I think that's fair.As for the game itself, it's like a poor man's action version of Dragon Age Origins or The Witcher 1. Those games are better, but if you've already played them and are looking for something to scratch that fantasy rpg itch, then you could do a lot worse than this, I mean, Skyrim still exists right?B+			"

												I got this game as part of a bundle a little over a year ago and just now got to playing through it. I originally tried it out and thought the combat was too complicated so i quickly tossed it aside. After seeing a recent review where someone likened this to dragon age and given my love for that franchise I just had to give this another try.The combat takes a little getting used to and the crafting system does as well but it's suprisingly simple once you've played a little bit. I did my initial playthrough as a rogue after hearing that it was a lot easier than the warrior. Essentially you stealth kill an enemy, flame on, kill things and move on to other things. The combat is very captivating and the storyling kept me interested the whole way through. Granted, it doesn't take much to keep my interested.P.S. I've never written a review for a game before. I chose to break that habit with this game as i thoroughly enjoyed it and was suprised given the number of negative reviews on here. If you are in doubt, give it a shot.			"

												I recommend this, but only really if on sale. The combat is fun, but once you figure out how to always dodge enemies it becomes pretty uniform and a lot of mashing. I went through as the twin daggers class, so for me it was just : attack, attack, attack, dodge, attack attack attack, dodge, etc...The one very very very weird thing about this game is that all the way through it had moderate difficulty, but then the final boss is about a 3-4x increase in difficulty. He is actually a MAJOR challenge and 1-2 shots you. I guess this makes sense for a final boss, It almost made me want the rest of the game to be more in line with the final fight because it felt really epic, but was just SUCH a sharp contrast to the rest of the game that it was really really hard to overcome.

												I'd say this game was enjoyable but the combat is horrid. Enemies have way too much health and you die far too easy; even though I personally didn't have too many problems this games combat is worse than almost any other game I've played with each fight being more a test of endurance, timing and skill juggling rather than actual sword play or anything resembling actual skill. The storyline is definitely interesting though especially the last stage where all your decisions have an impact on you. Overall I'd give it a C+. It's worth the playthrough even though the gameplay is quite horrid the storyline is memerable enough to keep it going for the 15-20 or so hours it offers.			"

I would welcome an expansion/sequel that deals with a lot of the unfinished content.SPOILER:The story skips a beat about halfway through the game. It feels as if there is an entire missing Act. The game also takes an incredible difficulty jump at the last boss, as if to make up for the reduced amount of content earlier.			"

												  This one I have mixed feelings on. It was good in some ways, bad in others, but in equal amounts that makes it difficult to love or hate.    On the plus sides, the story is interesting, the graphics were okay. The combat system is diverse, letteing you play as one of three styles or mix them up. A plethora of choices while interacting with the various npcs and party members also allows for some interesting situations.   On the negative, This game feels like the fantasy version of mass effect, in a bad way. The story itself hurts the game when they talk about the Seven Ice Lords, but you only deal with one of them really. It makes it feel like there should be a lot more to the game then what was presented, giving it a feel of being unfinished from the story aspect. There's also supposed to be romantic options, but they are/were quite well hidden.    The game itself did have some issues with the sound that kept dropping out and and doing weird things, and there was some noticable lag during some of the fights.   Overall, I am quite literally on the fence with this one. It was good as well as bad. I would suggest trying this one for yourself, but only if you can get it on sale. Love it or Hate it, Bound By Flame is not worth full price.			"

												I found this game to be fun and enjoyable although it could be better. The story line is very scripted and there aren't a lot of choices other than whether you want to stay human or go demon. There are some romancing options, but nowhere near as enjoyable as the witcher. It took me a bit to get used to the fight mechanics, but once I did, it was pretty fun. I found the ranger line to be the most fun -- riposting was a blast.			"

												Over an hour in I am leaving this review for anyone who, like me, is looking at this game while it is on offer and wondering if they should get it...Do.It is a great looking game, graphics are very unique, almost cell shaded yet realistic at the same time, combat so far is engaging, no idea why people are complaining about pressing left mouse for attack, right for heavy and space for block. It looks simple yet you need to keep and eye on the enemies. You will enjoy it I promise.			"

												Absolutely underrated game, even more so than Mars: War Logs, which was a little hidden gem - rough at the edges, but with some heart. Same here. Combat system is not the greatest, but it's not bad - the Total Biscuit review makes no sense (unless he didn't get into the character development at all). No AAA title, but definitely worth checking out.			"

												This is the game I've always wanted but never knew it.It's set in a fantasy land with demons and magic and ♥♥♥♥, but at the same time it manages to maintain kind of a gritty feel, like The Last of Us, but with liches.The characters are all fantastic. They all feel real and flushed out without getting up in your face with character developement, including the protagonist. In battle, they're a weird mix of useless and invaluable, depending on how the fight is going.The level up system is perfect. You can choose between 3 skill trees to put your points into, and it's entirely viable to make a hybrid class. All of the level-up rewards give significant bonuses to your character, but none of them make the game easier to play- they just reward you for playing well.The combat is a dream. All of your actions must be deliberate and well thought-out or you'll get hit, but you have enough HP to take plenty of hits before dying. Imagine the skill-based intracacies of Dark Souls, but the forgiveness of a typical hack-n-slash.The morality system isn't really a morality system, it's just a decision of how demonic you want to be. Which is awesome.Overall, BBF is a shining example of what RPG's should be, and I eagerly anticipate the next one.			"

												Great for offline use and fairly challengingLooking for a game to kill some time but, also quite rewarding through battles? Well, this is your go to. I can see this weekend people are looking at the game quite a bit so i thought i'd drop a review for your sakes and add a list of pros and cons. there are some iffy situations in-game that may turn you off but, there is never a 100% perfect game they could always use additional fixes and content. The game overall does deliver but, i wouldn't go as far as to pick it up for full price, now that would be quite absurd. Pros:+Although bad dialogue, it is quite hilarious 90% of the time.+Unique battle system+Challenging+Can be played offline+Able to mix n' match skills across three different skill sets+Customizable armor (can be changed visually and add-ons to the armor sets are possible)+Clear plot+Straight-forward questline/stroyline (it will most likely never become lost)+Visually pleasing bosses/monsters that you'll find quite awesome+Crafting system (don't have to drop gold on every single thing you need)Cons:+Sketchy dialogue (the actors weren't that great although they were funny)+Time consuming combat+Linear world (not rly open world but, there's a lot of area to move around)+Not worth 40$ (if it's not on sale, you can't partake in this coolness)+The archer style isn't really much of a skill, not dependable at al+Overwhelming and unfair battles (depending on what difficulty u pick of course)+Fairly short (10-15 hours of solid gameplay on normal, 25-30 levels of solid content)+No competition (a lot mmos offer player competition but, this one surely doesn't)+Not much replay value, after you finisht the game once you probably won't feel inclined to do it once more+The name you choose doesn't carry over to your game (#foreverVulcan)Hope this helps during your decision to purchase the game or not, i think it's good for 20$ but, not entirely worth it for 40$. Please don't mistake this game for an elder scrolls game or ""dark souls"" series, it's no where near as hard as dark souls and lacks the content/customization elder scrolls offers so it falls into it's own class of game.With regards, your friendly gamer.

												I recommend u buy this game ONLY if its on sale or you'll waste your money if u buy it full price. Here's why;Gameplay is really great, I love the combat on this game, the graphics is amazing, the protagonist is quite a ♥♥♥♥ head with a somehow badass, but there's one single downfall this game has and that is.. THE STORY IS REALLY SHORT, 10 hours only playing this game (including side quests) this game would be a bomb if the story is long. The ice lord boss are 7 but u only have to battle 1!!! then after that final boss!! (literally speaking) I'll love this game so much if only the story is quite long enough and the end scene is like a cliffhanger dunno why i felt that, oh yeah i forot to mention the game music soundtrack is really good. Overall, play this game if u like action cause literally, the combat in this game is really good but if u like an rpg with a looong story, I wouldn't recommend this game but for me I don't regret buying this game. ;)			"

												Clunky but fun.Pros:-Graphics are pretty-Gameplay can be challenging-Doesn't take itself too seriously-Music is ambient-Reasonable amount of customisation (not tons though)Things I like but others might not:-Story is silly-Combat is difficult to get the hang of and is clunky, but makes fighting normal monsters reasonably difficult at times as, unlike games similar to this, the enemies all attack at once - and will also exploit moves that knock you down etc-Voice acting is cheesy Cons:-Gameplay can feel linear at times but mostly as you will traverse the same area (different areas but you will walk around them all a lot) going to different parts of it-Some bugs with camera angles -Although there is replayabilty, the other sides of choices and their consequences can be worked out during the first play through (I think)-Some sound effects don't really feel like they've happened, I think they were just not mixed well or had bad EQ with a lack of bass and maybe mids too If I had to compare it to other games I'd say it's a mixture of The Witcher, Dark Souls and Dragon Age... On a budget.8/10 would parry again.Edit: I got it on sale and have enjoyed playing, but if you're unsure don't pay full price as it is not everyone's cup of tea.			"

												Other reviews go in depth, this is a basic run down of my opinion.A very mediocre RPG.Wooden, emotionless voice acting with almost none existing facial animations.rather linear gameplay (which is perfectly fine) but an uninteresting story and truly terrible combat make it feel like a chore going from one area to the next. Pretty limited and basic leveling system.Graphics are ok but bordering last gen, runs great though and has plenty of pc options including FOV.I picked it up 80% off and at that price I would recommend it, at full price i'd say stay well away.

												The fighting and gameplay mechanics are more involved,the story and transformation concept bring something interesting and new that I love.The characters, despite Edwen being a DA Morrigan rip-off and Randval is too close to GOT's Jaqen H'Gar (still like, even prefer they stay as they are,) are fun, dialogue's... actually funny and satisfying.But, the dialogue and storyline are not diverse or cohesive (at all), the weight mechanic doesn't allow for much armor/weapon diversity, character customization is very limited. While I like the characters, they're EXTREMELY one-dimensional.I was disappointed that the online community didn't have much in the way of mods, but that really doesn't have to do with Spiders' part, other than that there was a lot of slack I was hoping some immersive mods could pick up.I feel like this game has an excellent concept and has a ton of potential, but maybe fell short on budgeting. Mars: War Logs did much better in these regards, but I have to say Bound by Flame would've been much more my thing.I'm hoping we get a remake in the way we had Two Worlds II going above and beyond expectations set by the original Two Worlds where we saw the inconsistensies thrown out and replaced with better mechanics, more diversity, graphics, storyline, etc, whatever. If you'ved played both, or even just BbF as an experienced gamer, you'll know what I mean.Also, why so heteronormative, Spiders?Like, come on.Anyway, I got this game on sale for like 6 bucks and consider that very worth it, but would feel shorted if I'd paid the original price for PC or console. Despite its shortcomings, it's worth playing. Support this studio so that we can see them able to better produce these games, I really think they have a lot of potential.I'm serious about the heteronormativity tho.Sidenote: I've been playing in offline mode for the last couple weeks. I've actually spent well over 20 hours playing this game.			"

												This oozes total Glen Cook Black Company flavor, which incidentally gives a great justification for the railroady early acts. By the time you're 15-20 hours in the poorly-ramped difficulty might get annoying, but until then it ticks all the ARPG boxes pretty competently.(Also, difficulty ramp may be a matter of taste: every time you enter a new area you're overclassed, and then you grow into it, but when you're 20th level gaining the power or gear necessary to deal with a frozen citadel full of amped-up demons is a bit glacially slow for me.)

												I was initially intrigued by this game, I liked the idea of being possessed by a demon and having to choose to use it to gain more power or to maintain your humanity at the cost of being weaker. However, I didn't feel the need to pre-order it and I figured I might get it when it went on sale. After the game's release, I read the terrible reviews about it and quite honestly I was surprised so I decided not to buy it. A friend of mine recommended it highly after he started playing it, so I figured I'd give it a shot. It went on sale, so I picked it up and started playing.My first impressions were that the combat was indeed slow and extremely difficult. You truly have to treat every fight like it's a battle for life or death. And once I thought about it, that's the way it should be. Most games, the boss fights are the only difficult ones. This game, every battle requires skill and strategy to win. And that makes this game truly unique in that regard, it reminds you how difficult your character's fight truly is. And as for the slow combat, it also makes sense. Your character is a powder master, you're supposed to deal with explosive traps and a huge greatsword. He only uses his daggers for a backup option.As I played on, I saw the points that all the negative reviews were making, but they didn't bother me. Yes, the voice acting could have been better. Sure, the story could have been longer. But, I found that the game itself is extremely fun! I loved being able to upgrade every piece of armor I found, and quickly learned the benefits of buying ingredients instead of specific items and recycling unwanted items instead of selling them. Considering I only paid $24 for the game (thank you flash sale!) and I am planning several more playthroughs, you can easily get your money's worth if you just buy it on sale. The characters the game contains are entertaining and certainly unique, though the two-person party deal makes it tough. I found myself keeping one person close to me and hardly interacting with the rest.Overall, buy the game on sale and enjoy it! I was too focused on the negative reviews I saw when deciding to purchase this or not, instead I should've followed my gut and bought the game just for looking interesting! Definitely worth a try, especially if you enjoy seeing how your decisions affect the world (and companions) around you.			"

												Spoilers. You've been warned.Bound By Flame has a strong ""Dragon Age"" feel to it, which I enjoyed. But, it started to feel like a clone when I first met one of the characters (Edwen). I was all like ""that chick is totally Morrigan. Come to think of it, this other chick is totally Leliana."". This wasn't very far into the game either (when I had this revelation), maybe only 3 hours in.The dialogue between the main character and his ""companions"" (I use the term loosely, as there is no feeling of comradery), is pretty bland, and feels cold and scripted. As a player, I had no emotional investment whatsoever. I found one character's (Mathras) backstory to be interesting, but that was it.The party system is misleading, and disappointing. Even though there is constant reference to ""companions"", your party size is limited to two. Except for that one quest where you get to take two of them with you (what gives?). Issuing commands to your ""companion"" (because really, only one matters), is pointless. You get to tell them to focus on attack or defense. I had them always on defense, to be a meat shield, otherwise they die too quickly.The whole idea of choice is a joke. I only came across three choices that seemed to impact the story, and the game vetoed one of them (pretended like I picked the other one). So really it was only two.I could go on about how much this game disappointed me (good thing I picked it up on sale), but I will cut myself off here.p.s. I actually enjoyed the game when I wasn't comparing it to similar RPGs.			"

												Okay, listen. There's a lot of controvery over Bound By Flame. Yes, it is (basically) a lighter Witcher clone.The story is incredibly interesting; that being said, the script is written by twelve year olds. I stab a giant ice-demon-general in the heart and in a cutscene, the main character screams, ""♥♥♥♥ you, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!"" It's bad. I first thought that maybe Spiders (the company responsible) did it for the ironic, ""Haha, he swears too much,"" kind of cliche joke. You quickly realize that isn't the case.And then there's the points of intrigue. Actual intrigue. Every so often, the dialogue is excellent. And then the main character speaks.The gameplay is solid, interesting, and deep in it's own right - you earn gold to buy new weapons, and you can customize each weapon with two weapon slots. You craft these slots with different items you find to gain different effects. For instance, I use the dual blades. I have both slots filled. One slot gives me a %10 chance to light an enemy on fire, and the other gives me %10 chance to poison them. The options are many, and the combinations can be fun.This game certainly isn't worth the forty dollars asking price, but it IS worth the sale price.Pros* Fun gameplay* Great combat* Excellent customization* Easy to get in to* Laughable dialogue* Story is interestingCons* Laughable dialogue* Difficulty often steeps itself suddenly* Laughable dialogueOverall: 7/10It's 100% worth playing, but maybe not at $40 bucks.

												So I knew that Bound by Flame was developed by a small studio and it probably wouldn't be on par with other high budget RPGs like Dragon Age or Skyrim, but I had heard some positive reviews and was hopeful that it might end up being one of those overlooked gems that just never quite got the attention it deserved.But I was wrong…so so wrong…To anyone thinking about buying this on a steam sale DO NOT DO IT!The game has some potential, I’ll give it that.  The combat was fun…for the first couple of hours, until you realize there are about 9 different enemies, including bosses, that just reuse the same animations over and over until they becomes a chore to get through.The story and characters you’ve already seen before, only done better in other games.The crafting system is interesting at first when you actually have to make choices about what upgrades you want, but by the second chapter the game just starts throwing resources at you like they’re going out of style.At one point you’re forced to make a choice to A) attack an enemy general, or B) save your army from an ambush.  Playing the paragon role I naturally chose to save my forces from they’re impending doom……by immediately attacking the enemy general…Seriously…And don’t even get me started on that final boss.If you’re really hurting for something to play then try Skyrim, Fallout, Fable, hell even Divinity II would be a much better choice than Bound by Flame!

												In short, it's a game that had alot of potential but most likely ended up like many others with the ""Holy crap we had too big hopes for this and the money is running out""The first chapter is amasing. It's a massive buildup of sidequests and interesting characters via an atleast decent dialogue. I got really excited and practically plowed through it all in one day. Only to be really disapointed by the following chapters. It's still decent in many ways. It is a full story even though it seems to have bin speed up and could use atleast 7 more chapters to make it into what i'd call a full game. The graphics aren't as bad as many people seem to think. Sure there area alot of reused tectures and some rather half-arsed piles of corpses. But this is to be expected by a low-budget enterprice as this looks to be. And in my oppinion, if this is the case, they did a rather fenomenal job actually finnishing it off. As many games today never really get finnished, or gets bought by EA and forced out before they're harlf finnished, atleast they didn't let EA do that to them.The gameplay is pretty good, entertaining anyway, a mediocre player like me had to play on easiest to only die about 4 times throughout the game.So my final virdict is I recommend it, almost solely because of the first chapter, not counting the prologue, and it's somewhat entertaining gameplay. However not at full price, since i would not actually call this a full game, sorry devs.			"

												This was an exciting RPG that had plenty of action, many different choices regarding characters and companions, and the ability for the character to be totally engaging was awesome.  The various battles were great, and plentiful; you really needed to use solid strategy to win each battle.  I only wish it had been a longer game.  I know that may sound frivolous, but I like long RPG that take many days to complete.  Other than the aforementioned, the only item that seems to be lacking is a more robust crafting system.  Though you have the ability to craft by adding various thing to the existing items, the opportunity to build unique, and more powerful armor from scratch would have enhanced the gaming experience.  Still, I will have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this game and would not hesitate to recommend it as a good game to own.  I hope that the creators of the game are planning for a sequel sometime soon.			"

												Plays like a mix of The Witcher and Dark Souls. Getting the best performance out of the battle mechanics requires some internet research.Controlls are fluid (being slowed down seems to store actions in a qeue tho)Story starts off with some really bad exposition and storytelling faults but becomes actually decent once you get out of the prologue. Seems to have some inexperienced voiceactors.Plot makes hefty use of tropes but still doesnt disappoint.I don't understand why the game's only got an ""Average"" - exceeds many games in performance and immersion and was very fun to play.Also runs without any problems on low-end computers.

												Not the best of the Spiders games, but still recommendable, 7.0/10, As all their games, nice graphics, unusual world and story, dark athmosphere, interesting enough RPG and Action system, ok game length (it feels it ends too early...) What I did not like was the end boss, not as cool or polished like Of Orcs and Men, and I dont like it when you basically need to make choices and play the game at least twice to see most of the game/unlock most of the achievements. Sill, when on sale, recommended!			"

												I feel dirty after playing that (but highly satisfied), gameplay areas were reused, side quests were a plenty (in my opinion) main quests were moderately interesting, it seems like they made the intro to the game, then made the ending of the game, and started to put in as much filler as they could with their budget.Fair warning, although daggers are enjoyable at the start of the game, as stealth is highly viable, later on their will be too many barricades, where enemies will be stationary, traps I found a grand use for once here, twice there.I would highly recommend being a Crossbow/Pyromancer, though the lock on mechanic is borked, it's your best option for defeating the various bosses, lest you suffer dying repeatedly.I'm going on my second playthrough for Achievements/See what could have been, Daggers are above and beyond OP (maybe it's just my practice) but even with parrying every single attack, I feel the damage per second with Warrior stance is horrendous.

												I recommend u buy this game ONLY if its on sale or you'll waste your money if u buy it full price. Here's why;Gameplay is really great, I love the combat on this game, the graphics is amazing, the protagonist is quite a ♥♥♥♥ head with a somehow badass, but there's one single downfall this game has and that is.. THE STORY IS REALLY SHORT, 10 hours only playing this game (including side quests) this game would be a bomb if the story is long. The ice lord boss are 7 but u only have to battle 1!!! then after that final boss!! (literally speaking) I'll love this game so much if only the story is quite long enough and the end scene is like a cliffhanger dunno why i felt that, oh yeah i forot to mention the game music soundtrack is really good. Overall, play this game if u like action cause literally, the combat in this game is really good but if u like an rpg with a looong story, I wouldn't recommend this game but for me I don't regret buying this game. ;)			"

												Other reviews go in depth, this is a basic run down of my opinion.A very mediocre RPG.Wooden, emotionless voice acting with almost none existing facial animations.rather linear gameplay (which is perfectly fine) but an uninteresting story and truly terrible combat make it feel like a chore going from one area to the next. Pretty limited and basic leveling system.Graphics are ok but bordering last gen, runs great though and has plenty of pc options including FOV.I picked it up 80% off and at that price I would recommend it, at full price i'd say stay well away.

Worth picking up during the Summer/Winter sales when it's heavily discounted, but it's definitely not worth the full $30.Combat's okay. Not amazing, but it works. It takes some getting used to and there's not a whole lot of variety in playstyles, but it does its job well enough.The story (from what I've seen so far) is the standard fantasy RPG ""the forces of darkness descend upon us and we have to drive them back"".The voiceacting is horrible... definitely the worst part of the game.

												A long review of this game is simply not worth my time. Here are a few key features of the game:First, being one of the most exciting parts of a game for many players, I must say the character customization is crummy. You can choose male or female, 5 preset faces, and 5 preset hairdos.The item customization is not great. It is portrayed as amazing, but it is quite bland. Sure, some fo the upgrades look cool, but perhaps it's not the upgrade you want and so you don't get the best looking weapon or armor.The combat feels boring and basic. The only thing you need to do is press Q or Space at the right time and find an opening to use abilities.The bosses were too hard for their fighting style. Some of them had unblockable attacks that dealt too much damage and were fired off too fast. They were incredibly simple, yet they took such a long time to kill which made them drawn out and boring.The visual effects were shoddy to say the least. All of your companions' spells looked like they were made for a children's game, which is to say cartoony.The companions were useful in only two ways: some could heal you, and you could set them to block and act as a personal meat shield. It's not fun to attack enemies from behind with no fear of getting hit or even having to attempt a block.The voice acting was probably the worst part of the game. It felt like I was reading a crummy fan fiction. The dialogue took too much time away from the game. I wanted to hear what was said, what I had to do next, and what was going on, but it took so long to listen that I didn't even care. It's likely that I often spent minutes at a time listening to just dialogue. There was also an annoying factor of trying to enter a location and receiving a two minute speech about whether or not you really wanted to go in there. After skipping parts like that and attempting to enter a new area again, I would be given another speech. I was finally able to enter a cave after the third time clicking ""enter this cave"".The pyromancy tree was a bore. All of the spells felt basic. A wave of fire, a fireball, setting your weapon on fire, and a few defensive fireballs floating around you made all forms of pyromancy a snoozefest. There is no ""excellent combination of weapon styles and spell"" and IGN is one of the biggest sellouts I have seen.Lastly, I can credit the story, it was pretty neat and I enjoyed it.If you really wish to buy this game, wait until it is on sale and about $10. The game is too short and boring to be worth much more than that. Oh well, I am going to beat it anyway.			"

												I find almost no games to be worth the retail price, and there was never a question of paying full price on this one. But picking it up on sale worked out nicely.I had a few days of fun with this game. Yeah, the writing was inconsistent and the story was tropetastic, but the gameplay wasn't as bad/hard as some have claimed. I think it helped to play a stabby pyro blend instead of warrior, but can't say for sure. What I can say is that combat seemed too easy toward the end (dagger flame on, mash assault, repeat). The twin-boss fight was a bit of a pain, the next two were easy one shots, and the final fight was all about going in with 100 crossbow bolts and 30 healing potions and sprinting in circles ahead of the icy bowling ball salvoes.I actually (kind of) liked Mars <hurk> War Logs too, which this studio did previously IIRC. Now, /that/ was a game with a miserable combat system. But it did have a certain Total Recall/techno-magey sort of charm to it, and the main (English edition) voice actor did a perfectly respectable job with what he had to work with (I may have played a later redubbed version.)If these guys could a) spend ten more minutes brainstorming character and place names, b) tighten up condition checking on the dialogue trees, c) point their script editor to the 20% of lines he seemed to miss on his own pass, and d) fight the urge to keep their male characters swearing like ten-year-old Halo deathmatch players, they would really improve their rep on the story side. On the combat side, well, this game was a lot better than the last one, so keep tweaking.			"

												helloThe goodThis is a good game and the story is not bad.The RPG and story are quite good and the cut scene are quite good.you can play male or female (human) the 3 ""classes"" a works well.The availability of all the style at all time is really good and seemless, so you have plenty of option to manage a fight. as well, you can use choke point and traps.in short, I liked the combat system and the difference between the warrior style and the rogue/ranger style.The ranger style is probably easier to get the doge and the attack doing the movement for you.The interruption is very important for the warrior,  So kick and parry need to be timed and used appropriately.  And you will need to use that or the game even in easy mode will be quite hard.The bad There is romance  and it is reasonably well made but there is no same sex romance, hence the bad.The two first level bosses takes for ever and a day unless you meta-game.the companion AI is somewhat random... :-)The uglyFor me the main issue is that like all directly level based games is the power curve effect on the game experience, you end up having MMO level of grind tediousness to the MMO/dragon age II level.So if you do not have a good grip on the combat and or not that much extra equipment, the combat with Bosses with peta-hit points are dragging for ever.and as you guessed when you have a certain level of proficiency, you really sail through and the combat that I used to look forward just became a formality.I started in the pen-ultimate hardest level and changing to the hardest just slightly impacted on my resources.phil			"

												So wow, i loved this game. I don't play many action RPGs like Dark Souls and stuff, so i can't make comparsions. But the gameplay was legitimately challenging for me at times, even on easy. As well, the story was FANTASTIC. I'll admit, it felt like i missed a couple tidbits of information that would've made things clearer sometimes, but that's to be expected.

												I would give this game a 6/10. Enemies were very linear and would do the same move over and over again almost as if it was broken or glitched. Most minions as well as boses felt the same making the game feel very small with its character designs. And almost every fight seemed to be a pain in the ♥♥♥ and not fun when they do the same move. This game would be lower on the scale without it's beautiful landscapes and maps with a good interface. The Dialog was okay at times. And the spells seemed to be broken with the upgrade of the fireball that made it go three different ways instead of three in a line doing more damage and being more effective. And not getting health points and magic points every level didn't help with the game, while having two ""feats"" or skills for health and magic points that only increase your health and magic and total of twenty points. But with the seemingly broken AI this game wasn't very fun.			"

												I thought that this game was a really good game that had a lot of great mechanics, but it just barely missed the mark. The fighting mechanics were great, and the voice acting was incredible. This game missed a few things that I hope will be fixed with a sequel or with a some dlc, such as a more free world aspect, better transitions between cutscenes and actual gameplay, and better character introduction. I was also hoping for a continuation after you finished the game and I wish it was a lot longer, but for the price I enjoyed my experience. I really enjoyed how this game portrayed the story and how the introduction of characters is really well thought out, but I was hoping that there would be a lot more character and relationship development. Overall this was a really good game and it just needs a few tweaks done to fix its problems.			"

												This oozes total Glen Cook Black Company flavor, which incidentally gives a great justification for the railroady early acts. By the time you're 15-20 hours in the poorly-ramped difficulty might get annoying, but until then it ticks all the ARPG boxes pretty competently.(Also, difficulty ramp may be a matter of taste: every time you enter a new area you're overclassed, and then you grow into it, but when you're 20th level gaining the power or gear necessary to deal with a frozen citadel full of amped-up demons is a bit glacially slow for me.)

												I recommend this, but only really if on sale. The combat is fun, but once you figure out how to always dodge enemies it becomes pretty uniform and a lot of mashing. I went through as the twin daggers class, so for me it was just : attack, attack, attack, dodge, attack attack attack, dodge, etc...The one very very very weird thing about this game is that all the way through it had moderate difficulty, but then the final boss is about a 3-4x increase in difficulty. He is actually a MAJOR challenge and 1-2 shots you. I guess this makes sense for a final boss, It almost made me want the rest of the game to be more in line with the final fight because it felt really epic, but was just SUCH a sharp contrast to the rest of the game that it was really really hard to overcome.

												I'd say this game was enjoyable but the combat is horrid. Enemies have way too much health and you die far too easy; even though I personally didn't have too many problems this games combat is worse than almost any other game I've played with each fight being more a test of endurance, timing and skill juggling rather than actual sword play or anything resembling actual skill. The storyline is definitely interesting though especially the last stage where all your decisions have an impact on you. Overall I'd give it a C+. It's worth the playthrough even though the gameplay is quite horrid the storyline is memerable enough to keep it going for the 15-20 or so hours it offers.			"

												Combat feels polished and flexible, thoguh the Warrior stance always feels a bit clunky and slow (in a good way, you're wielding a heavy weapon after all). Story is alright, kind of a short journey though with it only being 3 Acts and an short end segment with a somewhat difficult Final boss, even on the easiest difficult setting. It's pretty much a discount Witcher. You only really get one choice though to change anything in the plot and it comes in the Swamps, and it basically boils down to ""Let the Demon take over"" or ""Stay Human"". I advise making a save when you get to that point so you can play both paths with the same ""character"". I felt it was a pretty well-done RPG from Spiders, even with the few issues I found while playing.			"

												This game is, hands down, solid. I'm quite frankly surprised to see so many reviews that are heavy on the criticism. It doesn't have the most amazing story, the most amazing graphics, the most amazing combat, or honestly the most amazing anything.But, frankly, it's just plain solid. *Especially* for the price! I think folks are being way too critical of this title - it does what it seems to be trying to do and does it fairly well. The game runs buttery smooth and I've had no hitching whatsoever, the voice acting has been pretty decent-to-good for the most part, and the story has some decent twists here and there.. most notably in regards to the companions and choices. However much they ""matter"" or not in the long run it's as much as many other AAA titles which receive endless praise despite doing no more than this game does.For the cost, $30, I'd say this game is positively worth it. On sale it's even more worth it. There's not a TON of variety with the character as far as skills and spells but there's a decent amount of choice and specialization and you can definitely lean more one way or another with your focus on the skills.I mean, again, this isn't a mind-blowing genre-defining title, but it's positively solid. Most of the criticisms I'm seeing here can be made of many much more popular/expensive games that've come out recently and are at least in part personal preference or somewhat forgivable.I say give this title a shot, it's not nearly as bad as some reviews frame it to be.

												Not entirely sure why most people don't recommend this game. It is actually quite good besides the repetitive music that seems to make you want to just fall asleep in the towns..  Other than that this is actually a decent game, I would NOT pay 29.99 for this game. now for 5 or 6 bucks then yes..10/10 actually fun9.5/10 graphics4/10 repetitive music "

												Pros:+Graphics is good+Model detailing is good+Music to some extend is goodCons:-Combat system is horrible (some may like it and some may not)-Warrior is laughable!!!! -Boring lengthy dialogues -Map is a loop and you feel like a joker running around-Final boss can be killed easily iff you are pyromancer or Ranger !!! else prepare for a lengthy fight-Warrior has to block block and block to play!! no other goFinal suggestion is that - gamers who can be perfect all the time consistenly during battle can play this without any issues... but make sure you have patience to play this			"

												I feel dirty after playing that (but highly satisfied), gameplay areas were reused, side quests were a plenty (in my opinion) main quests were moderately interesting, it seems like they made the intro to the game, then made the ending of the game, and started to put in as much filler as they could with their budget.Fair warning, although daggers are enjoyable at the start of the game, as stealth is highly viable, later on their will be too many barricades, where enemies will be stationary, traps I found a grand use for once here, twice there.I would highly recommend being a Crossbow/Pyromancer, though the lock on mechanic is borked, it's your best option for defeating the various bosses, lest you suffer dying repeatedly.I'm going on my second playthrough for Achievements/See what could have been, Daggers are above and beyond OP (maybe it's just my practice) but even with parrying every single attack, I feel the damage per second with Warrior stance is horrendous.

												Not the best of the Spiders games, but still recommendable, 7.0/10, As all their games, nice graphics, unusual world and story, dark athmosphere, interesting enough RPG and Action system, ok game length (it feels it ends too early...) What I did not like was the end boss, not as cool or polished like Of Orcs and Men, and I dont like it when you basically need to make choices and play the game at least twice to see most of the game/unlock most of the achievements. Sill, when on sale, recommended!			"

												Wow, I underestimated this game.It is a hidden gem.At first I thought it was going to be junk, with all the mixed reviews, but upon playing it for a while, and getting hang on the combat it's pretty good.It's comparable to Witcher 1, story wise it's no where as deep as the Witcher series, but it's a nice attempt at it.The most fun is the combat styles in this game, it's more flexible, you are not locked into any specific class, you can be a broad sword warrior, a blade, a ranger, or a mage, just switch as you wish. The combat moves and sword dances are quite nice, but it could have been better animated, still not bad.I guess people that had negative comments regarding this game, they probably came in expecting too much.However entering this game with low expectations will actually surprise you quite a bit by the wide array of neat features it has.I think my only gripe about this game is the graphic quality, it's a good engine, but the graphics are B grade, specially people faces. I know it's not a AAA title, but the game was released relatively recently in 2014, graphics quality supposed to be better.Game wise, the fun factor is Good,			"

												a very good game allowing the player to choose either a full on warrior character or a stealthy character. what I didnt like about the game was the character builds versus game length. you basically had to choose a certain path to go down to build up a skill tree if you wanted a particular achievement i.e. all ranger skills. this didnt give you the option of building up a character that had a full ranger tree and a partially built pyromancy tree. combat itself was challenging if you didnt keep an eye on your enemies. A few hits and your health is near depleted so you really had to rely on parry and block defences. enjoyable game though and definitely worth the money			"

												I feel as though this game was quite the mixed bag, I really wanted to love it, but the story itself felt too short.When the game initially starts, it seems to go so deep into lore and history leading up to the story, that you almost expect yourself to get into a story-intensive game where you'll be bombarded with decision all throughout that will affect your storyline, and the final outcome...But that's not what you get, you are placed with a pretty limited combat system and a steep learning curve to a fairly limited game that will end solely based on a single decision you make. I understand infinite endings with infinite decisions in a game is extremely complex, but leading the whole game up to a single decision always just feels so lazy, ♥♥♥ if the budget ran out and they just say ♥♥♥♥ it. The game itself is pretty decent, but don't let the game surprise or fool you into thinking it's an incredibly deep game. It's a good game that kills a weekend or so, and it's definitely worth its price tag if you can get it on sale, as it's only 10 hours for the story, and maybe another 10-15 for the completionists out there.

												This game is a mixed bag. It's not bad, but it's not great either. Narrative - While not really original or brilliant, the story is ok. Can't shake the feeling that is rushed though, since a lot of the big characters (like the Ice Lords) are just mentioned and never actually make an appearance (save for the one and only you'll fight during the game). The majority of the NPC (companions included) are also bland and uninteresting. You will have simple romance options, a bit of lore, branching choices and all those features that are more or less become a staple in this kind of game after DA/ME, just not expect them to be deep or really meaningful. Voice acting and characters lines follows the same way: sometime are good, sometime not. I don't feel like complaining about it though, i've heard far worse.Gameplay - The game features a nice crafting system and 3 skill tree equally viable with 5-6 abilities each and some upgrades; sadly the combat is absolutely obnoxious (you will spend more time dodging than actually hitting your foes). Allies are basically just meat to distract your enemies, they are completely useless in a duel. There is also a lot of backtracking if you want to do sidequests. Overall not a positive experience.Graphics and Musics - Visuals and models are not special in any way, however the cellshading and light effects are pretty well done, and the end result it's quite pleasant to the eyes. The OST is good, feels appropriate and it does the job during the cinematics and relevant cutscenes, as well during explorations and fights.Conclusions - Honestly i'm not really sure if i should recommend it. I'll probably never replay this again because it didn't leave me a good enough impression, but trashing it completely would not be fair to the devs. If you need an action RPG fix this game could be okay for you, provided you get it on sale. Just be aware going in that it's nowhere near AAA titles of this genre, and that the gameplay it's heavily flawed by the bad combat system.			"

												I've seen lots of people say this game was too hard, but I thought its difficulty curve was fine, you just have to use your head a little bit and considering this is an action RPG, I think that's fair.As for the game itself, it's like a poor man's action version of Dragon Age Origins or The Witcher 1. Those games are better, but if you've already played them and are looking for something to scratch that fantasy rpg itch, then you could do a lot worse than this, I mean, Skyrim still exists right?B+			"

												Originally I had read plenty of negative or mid way reviews about this game so I had gotten a bit turned off, but after buying the game on sale and trying it for myself, I absolutely love it! I read negative reviews about the combat system and a few other aspects but I personally really enjoy the combat system and have yet to find anything really negative. Overall I'd say 7.5-8/10!			"

												Bound By Flame. Where do you begin with this. as you can tell I do recommend this game, when it's on sale. I got it for $5, and was more than worth it at that price, imo. I played the game to completion and I understand, much like War Logs, why a Spiders game has such mixed reviews. The combat can be rough, with certain design decisions leaving me scratching my head. However I was able to get used to it about halfway through the game, and was able to avoid dying besides near the end. The soundtrack and music in general is amazing, imo. The voice acting overall was improved from War Logs, though there is still something to be desired with a few characters. The story I found quite compelling, my only complaint I can level at the plot of the game is it's short length and a lack of an epilogue scene with one of the endings.The choices left me wracked with indecision as each side of the argument had valid points for their viewpoint. Companion characters were better in every way from War Logs, they were much more helpful in combat than before, although granted that isn't saying much. However they managed to hold their own a tiny bit better and had overall better characterization than in War Logs.			"

												I'll admit it can have a rough start that may be too much for some to put up with. However, combat does get more reasonable once you're able to upgrade weapons, armor and skills. If you're looking for a great game with amazing story, character building, interesting world lore... This is not what you're looking for. It is a good game, but it's not for everybody. If you're starving for anything RPG like I am, this scratches the itch to a reasonable extent. If you're expecting Skyrim or Dark Souls, look elsewhere. Probably would've been more disappointed if I paid full price, but if you can get this for less than 10$, it's well worth it. Surprised it worked on my system, 32bit Vista with bad graphics card; performance is not an issue.			"

												I am really enjoying this game. It could have done with some greater fine tuning, but the story is a blast and the combat (while a bit wonky at times) is fun. I like the idea of a main character that is ethically upstanding while at the same time being morally questionable. That and the demon fused with the character has a distinctive attitude that reminded me a lot of Lionheart and Beyond Divinity. I certainly recommend this game; it's not going to change your life or consume your passions, but it is a good time and that's all games are for, any way.			"

												Short version: a low budget Dark Souls clone that manages to be entertaining enough.It might not be an AAA RPG but it's actually fun to play once you get used to the cringy dialogues and stiff facial animations. If you have played other Spiders RPG you pretty much know what to expect.The game has a couple of game changing decisions (there's at least two different endings) and three skill trees that completely change your playstyles (I recommend choosing either ranger or warrior, don't spread your skill points too much).

												This game isn't great, but it is fun. It's not an open world game although that makes a nice change to most other RPGs these days. The story is fairly engaging but the main character's scripting is terrible. There is re-playability with alternate endings. The skill tree is a failing in this game tbh. Be warned, the way you skill your character might drastically effect how difficult fighting the final boss becomes.You can ♥♥♥♥ nearly every character... Not that you get to see any of it >/ :P			"

												Okay, so I think Bound By Flame has gotten a bad rap - its not perfect, but it does not deserve its 60 on metacritic. Just to get this out of the way, the game is very punishing, the controls are difficult to get used to at first, and it can be messed up, particularly on anything past Hawk difficulty. (Full disclosure, Buffalo as a veteran gamer made me want to put my fist through my screen for the first couple hours.  But so worth it.)Mechanically, think Witcher 2, if you had a intially very slow regenerating health and magic bar, and you had to be even more on your guard and strategically defensive. The crafting system is well done - I barely had to buy anything, since you can just recycle outdated equipment and upgrades and use them to upgrade your current enhancements. The feats and talent trees are surprisingly deep and fulfilling, even though they may not look it. And of course, your choices impact how much you embrace your inner demon with some mechanical weights - which was uniquely rewarding for both directions.But that said, the setting, the storytelling, the ambience, the characterization, and the consistency of the mechanics intertwined through all of that are top notch. And on top of that, once you get into the swing of things, it feels amazing. You'll still die a lot, of course, because it feels realistic like that - always on your guard, always ready, using every trick in your arsenal. The satisfaction, though! And more than that, the first time I've felt a feeling of total immersion, wonder, and magic in playing a game to this level for...years. Like...maybe, 10 years. Everything just sort of fits, clicks, and this magic happened that drew me into the world.If you like the Witcher, Jade Empire, or both, you will love the ambience, gritty humanism and dry dialog of this game. Unless you're ready to rise to the occassion though, play Hawk or easier. And give it a hour or two, maybe three.			"

												This one is a mixed bag.I can see why people like it and why others hate it.First off, it is an indie game so its understandable why it may be clunkier than other games.In saying that, some of the clunkiness is a bit silly.The combat system is quite fine.Left click, attack, right click heavy area attack.You also have spells and equipment you can use.With that you have different combat ""stances"" each with its own specialty.The main is a two handed weapon, the second duel blades and pyro, which is specifically for spells.The problem in the combat lies in the ""block/dodge"" mechanic, which is seperate for two handed/duel blades.In which, you cannot dodge with a two hander and you can only backstep with duel blades.This combined with holding space bar to block starts to get quite irritating in 1vmulti fights.While this system isn't too bad in 1v1 fights, it can still be extremely annoying at times.Other than that, it has a great crafting system, funny dialogue an interesting story and world and the graphics aren't super bad either.Not something I'd say you should buy at the $20 price range though as it can be a frustrating mess at times. But definitely something to check out, especially if you like SPYDER's other games.			"
