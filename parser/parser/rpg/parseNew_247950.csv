												Beyond the technical presentation, Sacred 3 feels like little more than a cheap mobile game. All you do is grind your way through samey levels, punching samey enemies with samey attacks, and you never feel rewarded for any of it. The cinematics are well produced, the graphics are okay and the soundscape is generally decent, but when the gameplay is so incredibly void of interesting mechanics, and never rewards you for all the monotonous grinding, it’s a hard sell at €50. Even if you ignore the fact that it’s supposed to be a sequel to a series of games that play completely differently, the game doesn’t become any more acceptable as its own thing either. Far better games can be found at far lower prices. The other Sacred games, for starters.2/5Full review:http://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/sacred-3/ "

												Ok guys i try not to write bad reviews but this game is just missing everything sacred has been over the years. The quest, freedom and diversity we know and love is gone and replaced by an arcade game with bad cut scenes and disgraceful gameplay.This Sacred game starts out with terrible jokes and tries to be funny in the cutscenes. From there you go into a arcade score values hack and slash with no loot, no real level up system and very very little freedom. In the first hour of the game you are fighting the same enemies and bosses while auto attacking with fiddly controls and annoying voice over for combos. The only damage numbers are for critical hits and interrupts. Not to mention the options menu that was made for atari. Sacred 3 would be a nothing but an indie game that you pick up for under $10 on a steam sale, if it didnt have 2 very successful games in the series to start off with. To play a game with no real goals and a boring story line that has been used before i suggest spending your well earned cash on something more enjoyable and that would last longer, like pizza or a haircut.  I personally do not recommend this game at all. If you still want to pick it up steam sales when its around $15 bucks would be your best bet.			"

												This game is the reason why they have the demand not to swear written in the Rules and Guidelines. Because if that weren't there I would have a few choice words for this game.The first thing you will notice is it's no longer made by Ascaron... Someone bought the rights to use the name and I fell for it. Well, I guess it's my own fault that I trusted the name ""Sacred"" and expected another good game and that I coughed up 50 Euros without getting informed.If you don't know Sacred you may very well like this game, don't let me stop you from trying it.If you are a fan of Sacred however, don't make the same mistake I made. You will kick yourself for wasting so much money. Aside from the name and aside from sporting a Seraphim character, this product really has nothing in common with Sacred.I only hope I can spare a few people from the bitter disappointment I felt. I hope you guys are smarter than I was and actually read these reviews before you throw your money out the window.			"

												Sacred 3 is a dumbed down version, with linear mission, no open world, no costumization, no exploration, and combat system isn't much fun either.If they would have made the same game under a different name, we may could talk about a positve review, but after Sacred 2 this is a shame to the Series, and players.Of what I've played, every second felt like a insult. If I could, I'd demand my money back (bought retail >.>).Go buy Sacred 2, it's cheaper and better.(Update) Nope, game isn't even good on its own.			"

												This has quite little to do with the Sacred franchise. It is more like Bastion. However, Bastion is really more fun. Sacred 3 is Hack and Slay with one weapon while constant left clicking - skills are mostly useless.I dont think its worth full price... If you can get it for a lower price and enjoy local multiplayer and massive enemy smashing, it can be fun.UPDATE: This game takes around 6 hours to finish on normal. Definitly too short for a full price game.			"

												Graphics are prettyVoice acting is good (with a few exceptions) and quite funny at pointsBut the game play is repetitive and boringYou get essentially 4 attacks and one finisher. One of the 4 attacks is worthless on its own and is just used for breaking opponent's guardOne is your main attack, which you will use to charge up bars.The other two attacks are available when you have enough charge in your bars.That's it, nothing else, no combos nothing, the only thing that would act as some sort of tactics is the dodge move, but again that is not enough.You can ""customize"" your character by picking different extra attacks, or leveling up your attacks or weapon.This is done by buying (with the gold you find) the upgrades at the levels on which they are available, and don't expect much of customization, you just move along a line, having to pick one out of 2 perks every so often.Basically what you do is pick 2 attacks that you like and stick with themThere is no random loot, instead you when you defeat certain bosses you gain weapons, 2 hours and about 3-4 bosses.into the game and I have found 3 weapons total.Overall the game is extremelly boringOne important note, don't you dare play this without a controller, pc controlls are awefulAnother important note, if you feel that you are missing out cause you don't have the 5th character, you are not, he seems to play (and by play I mean have the same extra abilities) as the angel character "

												The most disappointing game I have played in a long time. A series of rather high quality in-depth action rpg's made into a simplistic, almost primitive arcade-style game I would expect as a gaming hall or browser title, not a full-price wanna-be blockbuster. An all-use ingame currency instead of diverse loot, near to no armor or weapon variation and customization. As well as hardly any attack or skill variation: light attack, heavy attack (shield breaker), and 2 skill slots with 5 alternatives to use in each, that's it, no diverse combat, just button mashing. Linear and quite limited maps instead of a living, breathing, npc-settled open world. One mission / level after the other with point recap in between, just like stages in a 90's arcade side-scrolling game.I'm usually the last one to totally dismiss a game but I can only advise anybody to never touch this one, especially if you expected this to be a diablo / sacred style action rpg. Console port is in fact a very small excuse for (imho) destroying a (rather) popular and quite high quality game series like this.			"

Wow.Firstly, lets just say that in comparison with previous titles in the series, Sacred3 has vastly imrpoved graphics, control and feel - although I really hate pc games with console controls.Unfortunately, thats where the good stops and the bad begins.Sacred 1 was buggy but had a decent storyline and some funky mechanics.Sacred 2 was buggier but prettier and still had a pretty cool vibe.Sacred 3 is a different game altogether.Really.Entirely different.There is no loot.There is no open world.There is no grind.There is no craft.There is no customisation.There are no mounts.There really... is not much game.Step 1: Defeat the hordes in a VERY linear 'mission' map with some ""hidden"" side areas for gold.Step 2: Get a score card, spend your mula in the lobby, upgrade your stuff.Step 3: See step 1.This game is more akin to titles like Forced, except Forced at least had thoughtful gameplay, this is just 'mash a key until they're all dead'Only other pros I can think of:Should be fun multiplayer. Mindless, but fun.Really, really, really disappointed. Wait for the sales.From user Amiculi:This is Sacred 3:http://www.unbended.zone/en/The developers of the original two games lost franchise rights, but they're working on the spiritual successor. "

												Sacred 3 is the third game in the Sacred series. The game play and design is strikingly different to the two previous games.  The game was released on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 in August 2015. Unlike the first game, Sacred 3 is a hack and slash brawler. Every single one of the levels is linear, there are no quests to complete; just a simple get to the end of the stage without dying. There are plenty of classes to choose from at the start of the game with all of the classic RPG ones available such as warrior, rogues, mages and marksmen.  The game play is extremely watered down too; with each class only being able to have two active abilities and a weapon set. The lack of any loot drops throughout the game really means this brawler has no rewards for even completing stages.  In between the story missions, Sacred 3 also offers side missions which to be frank, are absolutely pointless. They can be completed in less than five minutes and yet again, offer no real reward for completing them. Every single mission in this game is 100% linear, only one route to the end, and one way to kill any of the bosses. There are a few scenes which sees you running through corridors of falling rocks and lava, but nothing that really keeps you on the edge of your seat. All of the enemies in the game are just more of an annoyance than anything else. None of them present any kind of threat to you and you will not die. I didn’t die once whilst completing my play through. To be honest, I am not sure how to rate the graphics in Sacred 3, at times the game looks really well fleshed out with some of the scenery in the levels looking very good. But then at some points, it just looks awful. The textures and background views are bland and very low res, almost to the point where it takes you out of the immersion as you are just astounded at how bad it looks.  Now the audio is whole new ball game – this has got to be the most cringe worthy voice acting I have ever heard. The unfunny one-liners, the sexual innuendo, and some quite blatant sexism that comes out of the characters mouth’s is mind boggling. I did have to eventually mute the game just because I couldn’t concentrate on playing the game because of how awfully bad the voice acting is. The narration through the whole story is just as bad too; the random comments that add no other benefit to the game and only drag the seriousness of the Sacred series down to a kindergarten standard. Sacred 3 is not a hard game at all. Like I said, I completed the whole game without dying. You are able to change the difficulty of the levels on the fly, meaning you have no real downside to starting the game in hard mode and then lowering the difficulty if needed; but there won’t be any need. Once you get to grips with the controls you’ll be able to dodge, outrun and out manoeuvre anything the enemies throw at you. I was expecting a sort of open world game in Sacred 3, to be able to wander off the beaten track into buildings and caves to find my own adventure; but sadly that is not the case here. The are quite blatant caves and buildings that look like they are really interesting to explore, but the game has put up invisible walls all over the place prevent you from exploring. The game can also be completed in a short amount of time considering the rest of the series were 20+ hours. I finished this game in just under seven hours. Yes I could play another character, but why? I would only be playing the exact same linear missions all over again and have exactly the same experience just with one or two different spells to cast. The game has up to 4 player co-op, but I honestly don’t see any reason why you would want to make the whole experience even easier than it already is.One part where Sacred 3 does have some pluses, is that I didn’t have any technical issues whilst playing. The game has a wide choice of resolution options, whilst the graphical options are limited, the game is well optimized to run on anything (probably why it is on console). The game can also be played with a game pad, but I had the best experience when using keyboard and mouse. In conclusion, I can’t recommend Sacred 3. Fans of the series will be bitterly disappointed with this game, and even new people to the series will find nothing original in here. There are so many more much better made hack and slash games out there, Sacred 3 should only be played when you can get it for less than £3,99 – not a penny more.

												This is Sacred in name only, be warned.Sacred 1 and 2 were wonderful open world games, with lots of loot, and a decent combat skill selection. They both had decent stories and character progression. My advice for franchise fans, is to go replay sacred 1 and 2, skip this. If you pre-ordered like I did... I am so sorry. This game doesn't even pretend to be the same genre.This is an isometric brawler with very limited combat. There are no selection of combos, no character customizaton, no hot swapping skills, and no loot! You pick from a limited selection of skills (you get 2 in mission, from a limited pool), and a selection of weapons that are nigh identical, but must be unlocked through the story. Combat is repetitive, oh so repetitive. Controls are somewhat awkward on the PC. This seems to be geared more towards a console platform in that regard.The voice acting is decent, and for sacred fans, the cheesy lines are still there, but that may be all that remains. There is little to no character development, and the story itself seems to be a tired reincarnation of ""evil being attempts to destroy world for some reason"". Graphics are not bad... not great, but they certainly could be worse. If you want a simple brawler, this is alright, but not worth the $50 price tag (there are similar, much cheaper titles available). Give this one a pass. R.I.P. Sacred			"

												This game is a disgrace!NOTHING lke the previous two open-world hack and slash games. If you are a legacy fan, AVOID this at all costs. The game is unrewarding, dull in gameplay, highly frustrating. The interface is horrible, it seems like a cheap console rip-off. Honestly, this feels like playing God of War (on a very bad day), Warriors Orochi, a bit of Prince of Persia and at least couple more. You have to pay gold for everything in the game even for upgrading your skills! I barely managed to play for like 60 minutes and it totally repelled me. To summarize - this is one of the worst purchases I've ever made. Back to Sacred 2.			"

												Sad title if ou compare to Sacred 1 + 2. No more open world, no loot, no inventory, no maps, fixed arena style, bad graphics, irritating narration (as in *really* irrittating). Controls by keyboard does not work well or naturally and you have a fixed viewpoint with no zoom. You cannot do anything, not even ask for a refund..Looking at the intros, the game looks good, but this is the only thing in high-res; the rest is much worse than Torchlight which you can get for a fraction and even get the claasic action RPG features at the same time.If you like smashing the same monsters over and over again, and perhaps with friends, fine, otherwise: stay far far away from this one.No thanks, I am oing back to Diablo 3.

												If you came here thinking to play an open world ARPG using mounts to travel a large landscape, acquiring loads of different loot to try out on your character along with a fairly large ammount of skills that can be combined and tweaked to fit your playstyle and many other things like in Sacred 2 then you will be very disappointed. As this game feels more like a game that should of been put on a console market place in the arcade section for a price of £10 to be honest as its completely crushed what sacred 2 was.Its got barely any customization(no loot drops gear ect) and the voice acting is... meh not to mention the HUD looks rubbish I was drawn into Sacred series by Sacred 2 which I enjoyed ALOT and was looking forward to Sacred 3 but now that ive actually played the game its let me down big time. For me it looks like a title of a game I loved but the genre could never be so far apart from what drawn me into the series to begin with. Bring back Ascaron and Keen Games should never touch this title ever again, I'm so glad I got this game way cheaper than £39.99.With rambling aside id say if you are looking for an amazing ARPG like Sacred 2 then dont get this game. But if you like types of games like Bastion and that type of genre then this WILL be the game for you. Still overpriced though so id suggest trying to get it cheaper.			"

												Well, that's another franchise Dungeon Sieged!Honestly there is nothing really wrong with this game on its own; it runs really smoothly, looks good, and can be kinda fun if all you want is mindless console style hack and slash action, and are willing to ignore any and all dialogue. Seriously, the dialogue is appalling!But as a game supposedly part of the Sacred series, this game is not worth your money. Buy Sacred Gold, or Sacred 2, and forget that this one even exists. All the elements that made the earlier games in the series amazing have been removed, no true rpg elements, no rich lore filled world, all the humor that was so well integrated and enjoyable in the previous games is now slapped on jokes that just fall flat on their faces.The companies that bought the rights to the francise so they could make this game clearly have little to no experience making RPGs, because this game plays exactly like every mission based action adventure game ever made. And as such stands out in absolutely no way whatsoever.			"

												Suckered! Thanfully waited until this travesty of a game was 50% off but still wished I hadn't wasted £20 on ths ****. Even bought £5 worth of add-ons before playing the game, presuming incorrectly that it would be a worthy sequel to a brilliant Sacred #2. Lesson learned - read the reviews before purchasing. So disappointed I couldn't even reach 10 minutes of play time. Complete scam, those responsible should be ashamed of themselves. I really urge those considering buying this game to bypass it and spend your money on better titles.			"

												I can not believe how dissapointed I am with this game.I am the type of person who researches a fair bit before buying a game. But I didn't with this one, you know why?! Because I love Sacred! But this isn't Sacred. Not even close. It's not open world, the combat is completely different and it's gone from do whatever you want to a completely linear progression style game.But that's not relvant, on it's own it's a horrible game. They've obviously tried to make money of the Sacred franchise. The worst part is that they absolutely DESTROY the immersion with the horrible voice acting and in game humor. The 'guide' is literally saying things a teenager might say...I wouldn't have played it passed the intro had I not paid $50 for it...So dissapointed, I feel like I have been ripped off... Don't make my mistake, watch the first 10mins of full gameplay and you'll understand.			"

												I know this is very early to write a recommendation, but maan.. I am dissapointed! There may be several reasons for this: I just came from the 3 week old Divinity: Original Sin, a masterpiece in its own genre, and wanted to have a blast in an aRPG like sacred. I grabbed the game for 50 euro and 8 euros worth first-day dlc aswell. Downloaded 18gigs of game and threw myself at it. I had an expectation of some openworld freedom alike Sacred 1 & 2, lootdrops, any basic kind of character customization and I hoped for an engaging story.. this is not what I got - at all. These first 45 minuttes in the game made me angry, so angry and dissapointed that im going out for a walk now. Never have I ever  wanted to ask for a refund for a game, but this.. this is a justified request. the layout is but a given path, with a few stairs. thats it. You left/right-click everything to death, and are given 2! abilities to bring to use. it seems like you can swap them around later on though. there is no strategy, no tactical gameplay given, just a bloody 1 track pathway to walk down. It feels like supermario in a nice package & an unbelievable high pricetag.I would not ask you to neglect this game, just get a firm grasp of what it is you are getting for your money. My expectations were completely elsewhere and thus I cannot recommend this game. TL:DR This games only similarity to the sacred franchise is the lore. NOTHING ELSE!! do not grab this title if you expect openworld and lootdrops!			"

												If your after anything like the original games save your money as this is nothing at all like Sacred 1/2 but more like Sacred Citadel 3D. This game is an insult to the original fans of Ascarons Sacred franchise. It appears to be nothing more than a cash cow for Deep Silver.You have four races to initially choose from (the fifth race is DLC). No open world. A linear mission quest line. Your equipment consists of two items; an armoured suit (which can be upgraded but NOT replaced) and a weapon (which you can upgrade and replace). No loot drops other than gold, health orbs, energy orbs and weapon spirits. Skills, armours and weapons can only be upgraded/unlocked/bought with gold after meeting level requirements. You cannot directly upgrade your characters attributes. Levelling a character increases your health and may increase combat arts energy. Completing the relics quests (stars missions on map) will unlock new items for you to buy in store and increasing capacity is done in the circle missions. You can only equip three skills at a time; a light combat art, a heavy combat art and a battle prayer (the battle prayer is co-op only). Upgrading and equiping can only be done outside of the mission quest. More bonus gold can be earned by using combos and playing co-op (this will heavily impact single player as your gold will increase much more slowly). There's no real strategy other than bashing buttons to kill your enemies with combos which becomes boring after a while due to its repetitive nature.			"

Diablo 3 has way better control functionality. Why mention Diablo 3? Because this is NOT your standard Sacred RPG. This is a terrible attempt at making a knockoff version of Diablo 3.With the new refund policy in place by Steam, I think I'll be making my first refund request. I was not impressed with this game at all.			"

												As a pretty big fan of the Sacred series, I figured this game would be awesome, preordered it first chance I got. HUGE mistake! This isn't Sacred anymore, nothing about it is close to a sacred. I would even be happy if it was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ diablo clone, but it wasn't even able to do that. There's no open world, epic loot, or customization, or anything that makes sacred sacred. I can honestly say I would've rather burned my $50 than spent it on this game.			"

												First impression after having played until the first boss fight:Don't buy it, if you're a fan of Sacred 1 & 2. This game is definitely not a Sacred. Apart from the story, it doesn't have to do anything with its predecessors. Compared to Sacred 1 & 2, this game is actually a huge step backwards:- only 4 character classes available- you can't name your character- there are no items- no open world, only a linear way (and what's making it worse: you can't even go back)- the player character doesn't autogenerate its health over time (instead you have to collect green balls to refill your health)- you just have 2 skills + 2 different attacks with your weapon- the player character and enemies don't comment their actions- fighting against enemies turns into stupid click orgies- the game doesn't remember the resolutionOn top of that I miss the typical Sacred-style humor, when the game doesn't take itself serious - be it quests or comments made by NPCs, enemies or the player character when doing certain actions.

												The gameplay itself isn't terrible but the voice acting seems disconnected from the game and characters.It's a generic hack n' slash type game.All the characters talk like they are 12-13 year olds or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and say things Jim Carey says in the movie ""Dumb and Dumber"" such as ""I like it a lot"" etc.There are some technical issues with resolution in that the game can't handle 21:9 aspect ratio and needs to be played in a window if you try and play in 21:9 ratio because fullscreen will illicit a blank/blank screen.It's hard to recommend this game as a package even though certain parts are not terrible, but the parts where it's terrible it's really bad and can be annoying.

												As many others wrote before, this is not a game that can be compared to ""Sacred"" or ""Sacred 2"". This is true but this is in itself not necessarily a bad thing - there are many hack'n'slash games over there. The problem is that even 'Diablo' (the first one, that is) makes much better work that ""Sacred 3"".Almost every single typical h'n's element is simplified or removed. There is no traditional loot items, no equipment to be found, no crafting, no skill trees or any other similar character development mechanics, no freedom of movement. New weapons, armour and powers (you can use only two at the time) need to be unlocked and bought for gold (not unlike in many arcade games). So, if you're a fan of Diablo-like games, you may pass this title. If it reminds me anything, it may be a tad similar to ""Lord of the Rings"" for PS2 (and is definitely closer to LotR than to ""Torchlight"" or ""Titan Quest"". Also, it was made with drop-in multiplayer in mind, so the single-player experience suffers substantially.Sure, the game graphically pleasant to the eye, but not really imaginative and the cutscenes seem to be sloppy (I understand that you making good looking static pictures is not a simple task, but we're speaking an AAA game here, not some amateur production). Music is completely forgettable. Run of the mill heroic tunes with nothing interesting added for good measure. English voiceovers are average verging on bad, the humour is infantile at best. German looks a bit better but again, nothing to write home about. It is painfully obvious that authors wanted to be a bit tongue-in-cheek take on fantasy, but they did not have any idea how to make a comedic piece. So, really, it is rather disappointing.Also, there are some flaws that got me really disappointed. Dodging, extremely important in arena battles with bosses works haphazardly when you're using mouse and keyboard (but judging from the control scheme I belive this is not an issue with gamepad, did not try it though). Saving progress is also unintuitive and it is quite easy to lose progression in a given mission. Difficulty is rather unbalanced - I found that easy, even boring sequences are lead to very hard boss battles. It gets better the farther you go, but sometimes the contrast is jarring what is a tell-tale of poor testing.So, for the final verdict - it is not a _bad_ game and forming a party with friend might be actually fun as the simplistic, multiplayer hack'n'slash games go if you don't mind very poor attempt at narrative. But even then, I don't think it is worth half the initial price. And even then, I strongly recommend to play it on console or on PC with a gamepad. And I definitely do not recommend it to any single-player h'n's fans out there.			"

												A quick ""beware"" warning after the first few hours of play.If you liked the massive open world of Sacred 2 then beware that this game is very different.  There are no item pick ups.  The world is broken into a progressive map of paths to follow.  The only things you pick up are health, energy (to power your abilities) and gold.Sacred 3 is now very similar to diablo 3 in terms of abilites.  You are given the opportunity to buy abilities and upgrades to those abilites with gold.  But you must also be a certain level to get those upgrades.  You also only get different items (weapons/armour) as you progress through the game levels.  There are no luck of drops for items.  Sacred 3 now seems to be an ARCADE style hack and slash.  I feel the focus of this game is now on the multiplayer/co-op aspect.  I dont think this is either a good or bad thing.  Just as long as people are aware that this is now a very different game to what it used to be.  So far Im not a big fan of the story for the campaign of this game.  It seems a mish mash of the same old ""bad guy"" out to destroy the world.  The 'cut scenes"" are filled with corny lines that I assume are supposed to amuse young children.  This game is still fun, but as long as you can let go of what the Sacred games used to be.  I think Sacred game loyalists need to be warned of this before buying.  Look up game play video and reviews before buying.			"

												TLDR : Sacred 3 doesn't support any of the typical mechanics of the hack'n slash genre. The experience is closer to a very generic bland and mindless beat'em all. Disappointing, 3/10In spite of all the rather poor ""preview"" articles, I persisted in thinking Sacred 3 couldn't be *that* bad and decided to purchase the game (pre-order, mind you...). After all, a hack'n slash IS a hack'n slash, right ? Well... not quite :/The game does present itself as an ""arcade hack'n slash"", but it is actually only a brainless beat'em all. Fantasy action games can take a wide range of shapes and forms, but let's be clear... What do people enjoy in h&s games ? Ignoring all the details, in the most abstract form it fits in 4 major points :- Finding items, to improve their strength ; an endless gear treadmill to become more and more powerful- Optimising their character, by leveling up, equipping armor pieces, favouring offense/defense stats choices, etc.- Defining their experience through gameplay choices (skill tree or similar, inventory, stats, etc. or any combination of the above)- Combat ! Well, that's the core of the action, so... It should be ""fun"", aka ""challenging & rewarding""Sacred 3 does not support any of these gameplay elements. The game has as much depth as Golden Axe. This is like Dungeon Hunter 4 on PC, without the (few) fun bits.Enter a small area ; defeat a bunch of enemies (read ""spam LMB"", pro-tip use skills 1-2 to kill things faster) ; collect meaningless orbs ; move onto next area ; rinse & repeat. After a few times, BOSS ! Yeaah, exciti... ah, no. My bad. You can spam LMB, but can you dodge AND spam ? Oh, you can ? I guess you're too good for this game, well done, you cleared a mission ! How interesti...zzzZZZZZ...Seriously, how can a game decently call itself a h&s without having a loot system !I am not very far into the game myself (and probably never will be...) but I understand the base campaign can be completed in less than 10 hours on the first playthrough. The game does seem a bit overpriced for that kind of duration.Bottomline, avoid this piece of s...oftware !			"

Problems are: Aparently it takes 10 hours to finish. Yes, 10. Even less once you've been through it once. If you last that long. I just can't get any further with wasting time on this game. Two and a half hours in and I'm getting no-where.It has no open world, no inventory. Basic survival grinding and button clicking using one of only three attacks from one place to the next, and you can forget exploring. Theres nothing to see other than where you are herded.I bought this cheap. Don't even waste your money. Seriously. Play Torchlight 2, Path of Exile, or (even) Diablo 3 - which is better with the DLC I've heard.Heck, even go back and play Sacred 1 or 2. They're as good as this franchise will ever get I'm afraid.

												If you thought this game was like a RPG much like the first and second game then you can stop here to save yourself any disappointment.It can be summed up as an get from A to B battle using a joypad or WASD keys which give you 8 directions to move in.  The rpg bits of the game consists of a map that opens up as you unlock more battles and gives you the abilty to buy and upgrade, other wise you can think of this as much of an 'champions of norath' like console game.The voice acting in my opinion is annoying what with the narators of the good and the bad sides sounding like a hip yes someone is trying to sound like a hippy school teen girl and another that sounds like a corny cowboy both argueing with each other.If you like hack and slash gameplay then this is for you but if you wanted an rpg like its predecessors then pretend you never saw this game as its clearly milking the name of a game that no longer plays like a game using the 'Sacred' name.

												I do not make it a point to write reviews, ever, but here is a list of my grievances.1.)  The background dialogue is extremely cheesy to the point it's almost as if they were not trying. I got tired of listening to it, and I had to turn it off, which if you knew me, you would know I can exert a fair amount of patience, but this was consistant inane chatter that didn't in any way provide to the story.2.) I was admittedly taken aback by the genre change, I consider it my fault that I did not research about the game before it came out, however I did not expect them to make such a drastic change in gameplay from what was a great breath of fresh air if you were either tired of or not really into diablo.  Anyways, it is very linear, no choices, and your guided by an annoying half-wit.3.) Character customization is rather limited, you have weapons to choose from that have various percent chance passives, and 2 sets of skills with 2-3 choices each, which inside, have only 1-2 customizations inside there.  Which is a drastic reduction in skills from the previous Sacred titles.  As far as loot and weapons and feeling the ""reward"" from killing a boss just forget about it.  You get some gold coins, which you lose almost immediatly because the game was designed for you to farm the same levels OVER and OVER and spend it on upgrades for your character.4.)  In the story levels, you are forced into silly scenarios where an elite just happens to have the key you need, to a door that will continue your journey.  Maybe it's nothing, but with previous arguments of the perception of them not trying very hard, this kinda rubs me the wrong way.  I spent more time thinking of why the first antagonist did the classic ""AHA I have destroyed your only way to me, EXCEPT for this one LOCKED door, to which I put the key in my minions hands!  I shall make this mistake repeatedly, over and over, and NEVER learn from my mistakes!"".  You would think the emperor would eventually put out an all points bulletin reminding his generals NOT to leave keys with their subordinates.5.) Oh and something was buggy with the online portion of the game, I wanted to try teaming up with random strangers and was stuck in offline mode for some reason.  If I even cared about the game at this point maybe I would look into it, but after I click ""Post Review"" I am just gonna delete it from the hard drive.			"

												I actually was kind of expecting a similar style of gameplay like Sacred 2 but it was not so.  The fact you only get 3 different weps was a big drag.   You do not get drops of weapons or armour but rather you get pre selected armour and weps based on the stages you beat.  The game isn't that long either I beat it on the xbox 360.   The skills are few like 4 light skills only can pick one of the 4 and 3 heavy skills again one of the 3 heavy.  As you level the skills unlock and they got a little power up tree per each skills that again you can pick upgrades to the skills as you level.   The highest i got was about level 27.  Once the game is beaten you unlock a harder level in which you can get more items and more upgrades to the weps if you can manage to beat the insanely tough stages.   I still like the game but wish it had the same style of that of the Sacred 1 and 2 to where you could explore a vast world filled with quests and loot to find.   The game stages never changes so be prepared to play the exact same stages over and over to gass up in level.  Had i know it would be a story driven no loot game i would not have bout it.  But alas i did so i have to deal with it.   But if you like hack and slash with limited skills and no real loot just gold, health drops, enegy drops  for your skills, and spirit drops  then this game would be right up your ally.  To be fair though i put in many hours in this game!! More on xbox then on PC but it still a good game.  More of a gauntlet style game and the challenging on the deity level is really challenging when your level 25 and if you like challenges like I do you will find yourself trying to beef up your level so you can go through that mode and see what the other weps and armour addons look like.   To me i give it a 6 out of 10 in way of just fun push the button action.  But again if your like me and was expecting Sacred 2 styled fighting then you will be highy disappointed!!			"

												This is NOT Sacred!If they named this game anything other than ""Sacred 3"" I'd recommend it. They could have named it ""Sacred: Heroes of Ancaria"" for example. But this game is nothing like Sacred 1 and 2. Everyone who played and/or read about it knows the negative points that I don't need to recapitulate. All they've done is sell a known name. It's neither a bad game nor a great one. It's mediocre. That's all there is to say.			"

It just feels all manner of wrong!Where is my mouse control???Like most of the other comments made here, ""Is this even Sacred?"" No is the simplest of answers. Designers and publishers, please take note. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Now you have to fix this, and I am not sure if I even want to play now (Not that it will bother them much as they already have my $50!)			"

It's a simple, isometric hack 'n slash RPG...if you can really even call it an RPG.Characters are dry as a bone and, with no extra gear to find, there's no reason to ever treat playing as anything but a speed run.If you have to buy it, wait until it's deeply discounted.

												This shouldn't be called Sacred. It has nothing in common with the Sacred Franchise. Do not buy if you want a new sacred game. There are no quests, no open world, not even item looting, no horses etc.etc.Also it's HEAVILY optimized for controller use, I highly recommend either buying it for console, or plugging in a controller while playing this. With keyboard + Mouse it's really, really tedious to play.That being said, the gameplay is not that bad in itself. I can imagine this being a lot of fun in local co-op on a console version. You fight your way through various, very straightforward missions. Gameplay is fluid, fast and intuitive (At least if you play with a controller.)Skill customization is slightly lacking but decent enough. If you look for some fast paced action hack'n'slay this is a pretty good game.Final word: It barely resembles a RPG (There is level progression and that's about it.) and should never have been released under the name Sacred 3.The reason I give this game a thumbs down ultimately boils down to the really bad online play. I haven't had any game having annoying lags like this one does in a long time. Tried with 5 different people, there is ALWAYS lag and warping around going on. That is unacceptable for a multiplayer title like this. Also the game crashes on me completely at least once an hour.			"

												Being under the title Sacred 3. It's a disapointment compared to Sacred and Sacred 2. Reducing it to simply a hack n slash without all the fun stuff that the first two had. Ruin's it for earning the title of ""Sacred 3"". Because it's simply NOT in line with the previous two games.If you ignore the title and that it's meant to be the third in the series, and consider it as a simple hack n slash ... it's ... eh ... ok. Not exactly worth the full $50 price tag it has. Because it lacks even then some things from my experience of other hack n slash games.A number of tweak's and keeping it along the lines of the previous two titles it could have been an awesome game.If you're of a mind to buy it. Wait for a steam sale, then pick it up.			"

												Ahh to recommend this game or not..... I really want to.... I really wanted to like this game.... but still can't recommend it and here's why.Firstly I'd like to point out that I know this isn't truly a sequel to Sacred 2 and that my opinion on the game isn't influenced by this, I wanted to give an unbiased opinion on this game as a stand alone.So as you may be aware it's a linear action RPG.... and by linear every single map is virtually a straight line with no chance of going off and exploring the areas. The map zones are nice and the graphics are good enough; but you always feel really limited over what you can do. Aside from the fighting you get to run along a corridor and avoid falling debris..... on every major map zone - not always debris, maybe lightning, but basically the same thing and it gets repetitive quickly. Same goes for turning a wheel 6 times to move a bridge, open a door etc - happens too often and it becomes doing the same thing again and again.The controls feel weird at first but after a few zones you get used to them although even at the end you'll miss attacks or dodge in the wrong direction after you've lost the cursor on screen in amongst the action.The different characters are varied enough with some options to change and upgrade attacks and weapons which is done by coins collected during missions. The lack of loot in game felt odd but wasn't as bad as I thought (and I love looting in games usually) so don't let this put you off.As for the dialogue..... well..... they try and be funny.... main word being try. Sometimes they get it right and it can make you laugh, but a lot of the time it'll make you groan at how silly it is.Oh and you get a spirit which is meant to help you out and talks as you fight........ by the end I'd been called babycakes at least 100 times - and that was annoying the first time!To give you an idea on how long the game it, I've completed the main quest without skipping a zone in just under 9 hours - there is an option to play online with others but I'd never seen more than 4 people online at once.So like I said I wanted to like this game, I am a big RPG fan especially action-RPGs and didn't want the fact it was not Sacred 2 to change that, but on it's own it's just not a good enough game. Fans of the genre should wait for a sale - I picked it up for £3 so am happy with that with what I got - it's not worth the £15 it's currently priced it.			"

												This is Sacred no more!As a first-hour-fan of the Sacred series it was a punch in my face when i heard that Ascaron had to close its doors after they developed Sacred 2. Nevertheless i looked forward to Sacred 3, happy about the fact that the franchise will live on. However i am deeply disappointed by what Sacred 3 has become. Everything that made the original games fun and enjoyable has been ripped off in a way, that i have to call it rude.Basically there's nothing left in Sacred 3 that we know of the former games except the Seraphim class and the name of the realm, Ancaria:1: No open world2: No in depth skill system3: No character customization4: Background / Lore1The ""world"" in Sacred 3 is mission based. Every mission takes place in a linear level with recurring gameplay elements:- Fight- Dodge- BossOk, maybe we have to fight, dodge, fight and then boss, but that's basically everything there is. The level's details are in fact beautiful i have to admit.2I remember reading, printing and studying countless class guides for Sacred 2 for hours, everywhere and anytime i could (BfG Sera, anyone?). All this has become nonrelevant in Sacred 3. You're limited to a skill system with a maximum of two choices at certain character levels. Ok, that was somewhat similar in Sacred 2, however, since you have no gear to choose from, except 3 weapons bound to your class, the skill system feels shallow at best. Your armor gets upgraded automatically at certain levels and has a more cosmetical feel than anything else. Also, there are no weapon sockets anymore, instead you unlock weapon spirits whom provide certain bonuses. Those weapon spirits, unfortunately, feel like commenting on your actions in a manner, that i'd love to play the game in an ancient, long forgotten language, i simply can't understand...3Hairstyle? Haircolor? It wasn't much in Sacred 2, but at least it was something. Combined with your hardly gathered armor set you still felt like caring for that character you played. In Sacred 3, you can't even name your figure. Everything's predefined and done for you already. Level 6? Ok, my armor got upgraded visually, automatically, done. No loot. Just gold to unlock your next skills, limited by character level and in numbers.4To this day, i listen to the audiobooks released with and around Sacred 2. I clearly remember helping Hansi Kürsch and his band Blind Guardian, retrieving their stolen instruments, so that they can do their ingame ""live""-performance. I remember the conflict between elves and humans and their very own agenda within Ancaria, aswell as helping the spirit of xmas on that awesome dedicated island. In Sacred 3, all that seems to be gone. As told in the intro, all races send their best fighters to stand against that evil force, witch is noting but some totally unknown elf guy, talking slang language and somehow manages to insult you mentally speaking.ConclusionThis is Sacred no more. Ironically, the original developers are working on a new ARPG title they formerly named Unsacred. Due to copyright issues, they had to rename it to Unbended. For their own good, i say, because Sacred 3 is the true Unsacred.If you feel like forgetting about this game's title, you may end up playing a simple, somewhat entertaining hack'n'slay adventure. If you're new to that genre, this game feels like it's made for that let's-see-how-i-perform-on-those-controller-buttons experience. If you're looking for a worthy successor of the Sacred series, wait for, and support Unbended.Pros:- Graphically beautiful- Fluently playable, even on lower end rigs- MusicCons:- Castrated skill system- No open world- No loot system- No exploration- Flat story- Flat characters- Miserable, bothersome humor- Repetitive gameplay elements			"

												As a previous fan of both Ascaron Entertainment's first and second Sacred game, I have to say, this game makes me very sad to experience. I was well aware of the community's warnings and disapproval, but I still got it for the sake of clarity and some itch to keep supporting a previously good developer. Even though it isn't even Ascaron Entertainment that is behind it, I still felt they wouldn't let a game reputation like Sacred slip so easily into wrong hands. (Which... It seems they might actually have..)First and foremost, the story... The first game was brilliant where magic was just magic, where you had to gather elements to defeat a loose Sakkara demon. As fantasy-RPG as it gets.The second game then tried to explain how everything magical was actually run by T-energy, which had started pouring into the world and corrupt it. For the sake of the story, I won't spoil more than that, but it had enough going to keep you going to see what was behind it all.But now with the third game, I don't see any of the T-energy or any enticing lore that keeps you wanting to progress through the story. On top of that, they made it entirely linear, even less open-worlded than Diablo. Gameplay...First and second game was a lovely free-roaming RPG with vast maps and plenty of quests to do along the main one. It was also hack-n-slash and focused on classic gear gathering and skill-progressing. And the combo system in the first game was brilliant, to say the least.Sacred 3 has lost all of this, except the hack-n-slash. No excitement for finding legendary gear and enhance it, no stunning combos which they otherwise boasted about a whole lot, compared to previous games AND went to feel like a side-scroller instead of open-worlded.Pros and Cons about the game...To try not comparing it with the previous games, since it's obviously not; looking at it as the ARPG, hack-n-slash it tries to be, I have to admit it's still fun and challenging and accomplishes what it tries to do. I can imagine it works perfectly fine on console and I find myself compelled to continue playing just to see how powerful I am capable of becoming, but I can already imagine that it turns into a boring grind when you start up new characters after first run through. Controls feels weird when using keyboard/mouse though, so I'd recommend a controller.  So, pro is that they managed to make a decent isometric brawler, but lacks a lot compared to other brawlers.  The cons is that they went WAAAY off their usual way, making one question if they just made it to try expanding into the console and DLC world for the sake of money.Finally, my recommendation...If you are a fan of the previous Sacred games, don't buy this. You'll be severely disappointed and likely come to hate yourself for buying it.If you like side-scrolling, hack-n-slash, brawlers with beautiful graphics and fairly challenging combat (If you play on the hardest difficulty) and don't mind that the price is fairly high due to the title's previous reputation. I would still not recommend it, compared to other brawlers or hack-n-slash. Bastion, Transistor and Diablo does a far better job.			"

												Well ok everyone who loves exploring a giant world, farming for epic loot and waste hours of time like in Sacred 1 & 2 and expects this from Sacred 3 i have to dissappoint u.To be honest  dont have any postive points about this game. Some would argue that its a nice arcade game but i dont think so. There is no feeling of pregression and it gets really boring after a few missions.So let me point down a few things why i disliked this game.-> Leveling up is the biggest joke. U can`t really spend any poits and level up anything. Everything is predetermined and gets leveled on its own when u reach a certain mission or can be upgraded with money-> There are 3 Weapons for each class -> There is 1 Armor for every class-> On hardest difficulty i completed every mission in 7 hours-> The idea of weapon spirits was nice but when 9 out of 10 suck its not so great anymore.-> The game is totally linear and gets repetetive after a few missions-> There is absolut no feeling of beeing rewarded for grinding a mission again and again.-> No leveling System like spending Skillpoints, perks, statuspoints etc.Some will say now ok if u see this game not as Sacred but as a different Arcade game its ok , i dont think so. First i know ALOT Arcade game which doesnt even cost a quarter and have done everything better, no repetetive combat, repeting a mission again and again, no loot etc,I would advise everyone who still wants to play the game not to pay 49,99€ and just search for a key which are already sold for about 10€This is my opinion and ur free to think different!

												Forward------------------------------------------------------------------""Let's play the name game!"" the developers said.""You guys have been working on a shell of a game, might as well release it finally."" said the lead developer.""Ya let's call it Sacred 3!"" they all said together in a bro-fist fashion, with teeth grinning and head banging, they shout from the mountain tops ""SACRED 3!""Sadly the story ends there, on a sad note.  This ladies and gentlemen is not ""Sacred 3"" (well it is but not in the vein of...you know what, you know what I mean), it's not even ""Sacred 2.8 uncut finalcut master faith 360 degrees drop edition"".  It is not even worthy of holding a candle to its name, but does that mean it isn't good?For starters Sacred was known for its killer diablo like ARPG mechanics.  It was a loot all ask questions later type of game and we (the fans, myself included) loved it.  Sacred 2 followed the same formula except updated it in a more modern way, lots of faults but still the same Sacred type of play we love.  Now we come to Sacred 3, this abomination of a game set in the ""Sacred"" universe.  Let's go over a few things, as to why I don't recommend it.WHY in spaghetti monster's (insert your own diety here) name did they have to call it Sacred 3!?!?-------------------------------------------------------------------This question baffles me, they could have named it anything else, ANYTHING and it would have been absolutely fine, but no it wasn't enough, they had to drag the name through the mud.  If it was called ""Sacred: Mini Adventure"", ""Sacred: Not Serious Edition"", ""Sacred: Battle of the Bads"", I mean absolutely anything this would not be a question.  Everyone would see it as an off-shot and not a sequel, just a fun extra.  Instead they have the balls to call this piece of trash SACRED 3, it is not an ARPG, it was turned into an Action Battle Arena and a very basic and limited one at that.  So enough about the name, I think I shared my thoughts on that quite enough.Combat-------------------------------------------------------------------Extremely basic press key/button to slash, press key/button to do a special, press key/button to dodge/block.  That can be good or bad I suposse.  On one hand it is easy enough for a basic gamer to pick up and tackle without any confusion on the other it just leaves combat to a lacking unimpressive grindfest.  The responsiveness of the controls is fine, they are tight at least and you can interupt your skills to dodge/block which is a highlight, ""the knight in shining armor"" one would say.  So the combat gets a sideways thumb from me, not bad/not good.Voice Acting/Story-------------------------------------------------------------------Excuse my french here but HOLY ♥♥♥♥ is it ever bad.  Not only is the story completely off the rails down right stupid, everything must be a JOKE!  It's like the writers sat down and were like; ""Man this game is horrible, let's just make the dumbest thing we can think of and constantly make fun of it throughout the entire game"".  I can not think of any other way this was made except for the extreme reason to punish the developers/publisher to even unearthing this thing.  You will constantly roll your eyes and soon just skip the story cutscenes (art with text/voice...).  Nothing and I mean nothing is taken serious about this game, the main villians are portrayed as idiots.  Like a dumb laughable cartoon villian except you won't be laughing, you will be crying at how bad it is.  Your companions are even worse!  They never shut the hell up, they just keep gabbing as you try to fight your way through a horde of murdering orcs!  When you think it couldn't get any worse, it gets worse.  Absolute thumbs down, you will not care about the story (""story"" right) or the characters.Areas/Zones/Set Pieces--------------------------------------------------------------------This is very repeatitive and reused, tons of set pieces are the same and you will see them through the game, ruins, camps, arenas, fire, jungle.  Same stuff, throughout the grind.  There are some story zones that shake things up a bit but they are all linear paths, if it braches off it is just to grab a chest and then come back to fork X and go the other way.  I'll give this a sideways thumbs, again not great but there was some effort...I guess.Level Restrictions/Skills---------------------------------------------------------------------You will hit these hard mid game and even worse late game.  So the base of the whole system is you get xp from killing enemies and completing the mission on the map you are on.  This will then give you some bonus and let you buy skills in the menu.  The skills however are not very different and the whole system is a joke.  Some level ups will grant you companions or lvl up the companion.  You can only go into areas that are your level or lower, so you will get level blocked at some point, what that means is even if you are doing the extra side quest areas you will need to redo a story mode or arena map multiple times just to level up and move on.  Trust me this made me want to quit more times than I can count but I kept treading on.  By the end of the game you aren't even half way leveled up, they have the balls to say, ""well play the game again!"".  No sir! no sir I will not.  This gets a huge thumbs down from me, level blocking is a horrible system to make a player waste more time in their game doing the same crap they already been through, no one likes that, no one has fun.  No Fun Allowed!Online Co-op/Drop In-Out----------------------------------------------------------------------So if you are lucky to even find anyone online (I found one guy once...) you can drop-in their game or they can drop in yours.  This is neither fun, nor does it help, nor does it hurt.  They are just there...  It's like a ghost on your screen, killing stuff while you kill stuff as you have been killing stuff, with no gain.  There is no reason to play this game co-op unless you just want to play with your siblings or friend.  It is a system that works, but not desired.  Sideways thumb.Closing Arguments----------------------------------------------------------------------It's an action game take it for what it is worth.  Is it worth playing, that is up in the air.  From the fun I had with it (extremely short time, rest felt like I was doing it just to finish it) I would say it isn't worth even bothering loading it up.  It's not a Sacred game, I made that point very clear.  So take it for what you want.Final Verdict----------------------------------------------------------------------Combat - Sideways Thumb, okVoice Acting - Thumb so very far down I'm pointing straight at hell itselfAreas/Set Pieces - Sideways Thumb, mehLevel Restrictions/Skills - Thumb down, shame on you developers!Online Co-op - Sideway thumb, alrighty thenRating: 2 Stinky Fish and an octopus (You might not mind the octopus, but the stinky fish will deter you otherwise)Please friends!

												All the (extremely) negative reviews on here boil down to one complaint: Sacred 3 is nothing like its predecessors. It isn't an ARPG. Instead, it is -- as the description already makes clear -- an isometric, arcade-like hack-and-slash game, or to put it in even simpler terms: a topdown brawler, similar to Gauntlet. In fact, I'd say it's better than Gauntlet: quicker, more fair, and more colourful. The ""humour"" I could have done without, but it's lame enough to be easily ignored. The bottom line is simply this: if you're invested in the earlier Sacred games, you're better off giving this a miss. If, on the other hand, you don't care at all about the earlier Sacred games, and approach this as the arcade brawler that it is, you're likely to enjoy it quite a bit. Me, I came to this game after having played Sacred Citadel and Castle Crashers, and it fits into that niche quite nicely. This is, by the way, a great game to also play casually with a friend.			"

												Unfortunately Sacred originality was lost... The company founder, Ascaron Entertainment, became bankrupt. And this ""part"" of Sacred was developed by Keen-Games - firm, who make games for CONSOLE. And, of course, Sacred 3 the worst game of Sacred series, because it became Arcade game. NOT normal, interesting RPG...Better should play one more time first or second part of Sacred, because they VERY interesting unlike third part, in where you cant walk across fully-open world, cant discover any REAL interests things or locations(yep, there is exist some Chests but in them you can find only gold. No weapons, no armor...), cant buy different weapon(there is no merchants - all things you make in your inventory. By the way - there is no inventary or mini-map).Maybee it is not significantly for you, and you want play this game, but i can tell only one thing: if you liked first and second part of Sacred - don't play this game. It is not our favorite Sacred. Only new game with ""history"" of Sacred named ""Sacred 3"".			"

												As a sequel to Sacred 1 and 2, this game falls flat and fails in just about every aspect. It is highly disappointing for the type of game a Sacred player would be expecting.No open world. It is a linear path at all times, no sidequests to be had. You can go back and forth along the story path to select and re/play missions, but the freedom to explore is simply not there.No loot to find. You earn gold and a limited selection of new items/item levels/skills, then must upgrade the the items and skills with the gold you earn. A dull and uninteresting system coming off of Sacred and Sacred 2.I cannot recommend this game as a sequel to the Sacred franchise. Maybe under a different name and a lower price, it would be worth playing.ETA: I have, since first writing this review, discovered that the game WILL NOT keep my privacy/online settings. Every time I boot the game, I have to switch my game mode from Public to Friends Only (my preferred setting). If you have a preferred privacy/online setting other than public, you WILL need to change it EVERY TIME you:a) Start the game;b) Leave a party.This is more than a little frustrating. What game doesn't keep your settings (ESPECIALLY privacy/online settings) unless you either change them yourself or reinstall the bloody game? -10 for that alone.			"

But here not even an inventory or caracther how i can like...  The whole game like an empty pot of somthing what we called before Sacred. Im so disapointed of this game. But stop this negativ review , Those who dont know the Sacred from before and like the puch 1st gamestyle , hitting enemys without a brain .. they will like it.. My point for this is 4/10. New grafix , a couple of great hour before its turn into endless grinding :(  Definatly Not reccomend for this money...			"

												Absolute rubbish. Not worth £3.99 let alone £39.99.The most similar game I have played to this is Halo: Spartan Assault (which I might add was at least fun), this is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥isation of the Sacred franchise made by a company that has never made a PC game before and apparently has never played Sacred 1 or 2 either.The Pros:None, this game has no redeeming qualities. Not being buggy (at least as far as I can see) is not a plus as some reviews have said, not being buggy is expected in a game (if not always achieved) not something that should be praised.The Cons:Not Open WorldNo inventoryNo item dropsTwo active Combat Arts (Skills) onlyAnnoying talking headsNo cut scenes, simply still images with commentaryAwful voice actingExtremely linear levelsNo replay value, levels are linear there is no way to customise your playstyle short of actual changing charactersPlot is horrendousClunky keyboard/mouse controls; this game was clearly designed for console kiddiesOnly 5 playable characters, and 1 is DLC onlyNo visual character customisation at allThis is not a competitor to Diablo 3. This is not even like Diablo 3, D3 involves at least some level of skill and replay value, what good is an Action RPG without items and equipment and a comprehensive leveling experience.If only Steam did refunds and if only I hadn’t pre-ordered the game without actually doing any research			"

												This game is slightly better than its reviews suggest. Oh, it's bad - a poorly conceived and designed mess, but with lowered expectations it's a passable timewaster. The kind where you just switch off your brains and mow down enemy hordes. On the one hand, the fundamentals are kind of solid (if uninspired), the graphics are decent and there's quite a bit of variety. On the other hand, you've got nearly everything else. I'll get into its writing in a second, but I do need to mention that the design is awful; some of the character progression is actually ok for this sort of thing, but others just... pop up, randomly, with no explanation or logic. Some of the combat systems are ridiculous, too - there's a ""fatality"" type move that you can pull on bosses where you just... immobilize them, and inflict tiny bits of damage. Took me a while to figure out that it's meant for co-op play; as a solo player, it's ridiculous that it's still available as an option without getting buffed up. You expend your healing Items throughout the missions without any way to recover them, which means that you may reach the end boss- where you'll likely need them the most - without them unless you refrain from using them. None of the design problems are a huge issue except when the difficulty spikes up, in which case you'll spend a fair amout of time cursing at the screen (the last underworld mission, especially its boss, is one of the worst ""♥♥♥♥ you's"" I've ever seen designers aim at their paying customers). But that's an isolated case, difficulty has been fine elsewhere. I got this mainly to play co-op with my wife, who loves this sort of thing ever since Baldur's Gate - Dark Alliance; the problem is that after watching me play a couple of levels, she wants nothing to do with it. The writing is just that ♥♥♥♥ing, offensively bad. Offensive in its stupidity, not in any sort of premeditated, comedic way. It's disposable fantasy twaddle without the slightest hint of personality except for a smug sense that it's the funniest thing ever, even though it doesn't seem to understand the basics of a joke. You get bombarded with its noxious brand of humor throughout the missions, and it's almost painful. Let me put it this way, it throws in a Larry the cable guy quote at one point. It's even less funny without any sort of context. TLDR version - It's a brain dead, ok-ish action-RPG with a really obnoxious personality and some pretty stupid design decisions. I'm kind of enjoying it... kind of, and even that in a sort of MST3K way. However - even if it sounds like your kind of thing, wait until it's at about 10% of its current price (shouldn't be long!). It won't be worth it even then, but it's not like there are a lot of couch co-op, controller-enabled games for the PC.			"

After playing a while I think I can say it's not that great, mainly hack'n'slash no pickups other than gold which you don't seem to be able to use and no weapons other than what you get after completing end of level boss. If you are a Sacred fan I would suggest you avoid this game, but I'm guessing you probably already worked this out for yourselves.			"

												This game is not bad, but don't spend $50 on Sacred 3.Firstly, it is not even an Action RPG as its predecessors were.  There is no loot.  There are no towns to visit or NPCs with whom to interact.  This is a 100% Action Beat 'em Up game.  It should not have been named Sacred 3, but that is the failing of both Deep Silver and Keen Games.  They should have called it ""Sacred Citadel 2"" or spun it off into its own IP.Gameplay is actually solid.  It's not inspiring or very innovative, but it is consistent and the controls are precise, simple, and functional.  A far cry from Sacred 2, this is probably Sacred 3's single most redeeming quality.The voice acting and dialog are atrocious.  Worthless.  They would have done better to NOT record voices and include only minimal text dialog with as few in-mission interruptions as possible, or just make their own gibberish language like ""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"" did.The only similarities to the previous Sacred titles are ""Combat Arts"" and the Seraphim, with vague references back to some of the original Sacred 1 classes (Battle Mage weapon spirit, etc.).Don't spend $50.  Maybe $20, definitely $10...but if you pay full price for this game, you're in for a let down.			"

A good game.You HAVE to finish the level or won't save your story progress, and you can change inventory, weapons, skills etc. only at the beginning of each mission.Unjust exaggerated criticisms IMHO, for a funny and varied, and with some original ideas, good h'n's with the only fault being named ""Sacred 3"" instead of something like ""Arcania wars chronicles - Sacred legacy"".It's not a sequel but a spin-off, and what's the problem?Ignore bad reviews by original Sacred fans who voted against this game just because it's not what they expected. In its genre this is a good game, runs fine on medium hw, and has no technical issues if you know how to keep Windows clean.Idiotic haters can now continue voting thumb down and wait for a real sequel to the classic series.

												Awful. I couldn't play more than a few levels and it's nothing like the previous Sacred games, there's no open world and is extremely linear with parts of the map locked until you kill X waves of creatures and once you get past it it then locks behind you. No loot system, no side quests, no inventory, no customisation. It feels more like a game you would play at a cheap arcade which is a shame considering how good the previous games were. It's also heavily optimisied for consoles as the keyboard controls were terrible, even the movement was too awkward to play and had to switch to controller.The forced online co-op is also a put off with people constantly dropping in and out of your game with no way to control it (that I have found anyway).

												While not a horrible game.Just like Dungeon Siege 3, not the same game and a disgrace to the brands name. Remove the name and  it is similar to the Recent Gauntlet. Recommend for a hack n slash fans ( not diablo/torchlight/ POE style)Not recommended for the fans of Sacred 1 and 2.			"

												Sacred 3.Game we wanted to be like sacred 2. Way i can see it is that developers are just following blizzard. Diablo I was good, same as Sacred I, Diablo II was AWESOME, same as Sacred II but same as Diablo III, Sacred 3 is massive disappointment. But this is much worse.Let me explain why.No more open world, just corridors where some enemies jumping at you. Easy to kill and you would probably even don´t kill them if there is no ""magical barrier"" every 5 meters that´s blocking you until you kill all enemies and i´ll not talk about those characters that are talking to you and trying to be funny (seriously, it´s really not). After you finish one part of corridors, you there will be some screen with score you achieve and where you can ""upgrade"" you ""gear"" but about that later.Fighting is now more like in God of War. Not sure if i like it of dislike it but it´s certainly feel different. It´s kinda fun from the beggining but it´ll not hold for long. And it´s extremly easy! If enemy have some kind of mark above them, you just hit right mouse buttom and he will be out for several seconds so you can mindlessly hitting him. Bosses ... well they have their special abilities but they will tell you almost 5 minutes before they actually use them so you have pleenty of time to move. Seriously, where is the challange ?Loot ? This game don´t have loot. Enemies just drop globes for healing and money. That´s all. No swords or armor with stats so no more happiness from founded some legendarys. Sure, you can upgrade your gear. After every level in score screen you can upgrade your weapon and armor, for money. That was normal 12 years ago but now ? We want many types of armor with different stats so we can create our own hero and not just use that one which was created for us .... . So no fun in that.Moving around is also no longer made by mouse, but our famous combination with WSAD with spacebar for jumping to the sides, basicly where your mouse is ""looking"". Maybe someone like it more but for me, i would rather to use good old mouse like in S2.Graphic. I know that games are not always about graphic and i like many old games which i still play but it´s becose they have good story, great mechanics and they are generally fun to play unlike Sacred 3. Seriously guys, it´s 2014, wake up ...I´m not yet deep in the story (btw storytelling is HORRIBLE) so i may update my review but i don´t think it´ll change anything. For me it´s NO and i do NOT recommend this game to anyone who want to play good old Sacred. Just go back to Sacred 2 ..... much better then .. this.			"

It was nearly perfect.If you expect Sacred3 to follow this line, you´re gonna have a bad time.....Its a hack n´ slash game, and you need to follow a path to complete each level.The trailer is awesome, and if you expect the game to be like the trailer, again...you´re gonna have a bad time.Bad gameplay, few options, poor/silly inside jokes. Guns/upgrades are poor and few options.Its boring and repetitive. It was a deception for me.			"

												So disapointed. For any Sacred fan, this game is not for you, its combat resembles a similar hack and slash style found in Dynasty Warriors.Cons:Terrible dialogue and scripting, which hinders the players immersion in a fantasy world.Hack and Slash combat with little variation to attacks.No Loot, which makes the constant killing of mobs feel worthless.Little character customisation.Weak talent tree system.Not open world, instead, single route levels.Very few characters and races.Pros:Combat seems smooh.Appealing visuals.Basically everything that made Sacred amazing has been removed. The brand name has been abused and stamped onto a generic Hack and Slash overpriced game, in order to piggie-back on a franchise they knew they would make money off.			"

												This game is not Sacred, That is fact, the developer bought the title only to earn money on Sacred fans. The game is very cheaply made, voice acting is horrible, all you need to do is left click and everything dies while you rarely take damage, even on the bosses. This game can be fun with friends while drunk, but it's worth is maybe around 10 euro, maybe. As a Sacred fan, i am very dissapointed, as a customer, i feel ripped off, HARD, as a person, i sort of loose faith in the genre, but i will stay vigilant and hope for better games, that i know will come.

												Oh dear where do I start with this. It's gonna be a long one!As a long term fan of the Sacred series, cutting my teeth for the first time in the world of Ancaria back in Sacred 1 in 2004, and then on to greater glory in Sacred 2 in 2009... the news that developer Ascaron Entertainment had gone under was a massive blow. Hope was on the horizon however when Deep Silver announced they had purchased the rights and that Keen Games would be working on Sacred 3! Oh yes! More Sacred! More Ancaria! MORE LOOT!Now in 2014 we finally get to play Sacred 3, so much time has past! Teaser videos and screenshots, discussions across forums about ""what we hope for"", rumours... finally we can play! Sacred 3 is here and... what the hell is this? This isn't Sacred!Sacred 1 and Sacred 2 were ""open world"" action RPG's. Classic isometric camera angles, an almost free-form camera in Sacred 2. Tonnes of loot! I remember spending many hours farming for dual light-sabers on my Seraphim... Seemingly endless expanses to explore, lots of depth to crafting your own combat arts just how you like them. Stat points to build character... character customisation; want a character with bright green hair in Sacred 2? No problem!Sacred 3 is none of this. Well apart from sharing the name and ""isometric camera angle"" - and I say ""angle"" 'cos it's a fixed camera.Sacred 3 chooses more to go down the route of an ""action game with some RPG elements"". By that I mean, you will gain XP and level up - but you will have no ""points to spend in stats"".You will still fight using ""combat arts"" - but its less about building them bit by bit as we did in past Sacred games and more a case of spending gold to purchase upgrades for them.There is no more open world. The game starts you off with a lengthy tutorial. Once you complete that, you are returned to the menu where you can pick through locations on a map to take on individual challenges. They range from the main ""story"" maps - largish maps with lots of mobs and a boss at the end... stamina test maps where you have to hold off against 5 waves of mobs... and simple ""clear the map of enemies"" missions. After each mission is complete you will need to stand in a circle to be teleported back to the menu to choose your next adventure.There is no apparant ""droppable loot"". Every so often you will kill a mob or a boss and you will be alerted that you have found an item, a sword, etc. However you will not be able to take a look at it or equip it until you have exited out of the current ""challenge"" and are back at the lobby/menu. Here again you can choose to upgrade your weapon by spending gold to add extra features to it. Same goes for armour, skills, and combat arts as I mentioned above.There are no character customisation options. You can no longer tweak how your character looks before you start to play. You can't change their name either. ""Claire - The Seraphim Paladin"" for instance is one of the available playable characters/classes. You are stuck with the way they look. However, as I mentioned previously you can upgrade armour and weapons - and as you do so you will notice slight changes to your chosen characters visuals.The game itself is beautiful, it plays well. The voice acting is awful. Sacred is known for tacky humour, Sacred 2's seraphim often quipping sarcastic remarks, but Sacred 3 is just over-the-top, stupid ""in your face"" - trying to be funny and failing completely - a miserable attempt at humour.If you come into this game expecting a great RPG experience, either as a RPG fan or as a fan of the Sacred series, you will be disappointed. However if you approach this game without that mindset, and consider it a game of it's own accord then it can stand up - just about!This really should have been a new IP, or a spin off from Sacred. This I will warn you now, is NOT a Sacred game - at least not in the true sense of what we have come to know. Overall however, it still falls short. To me it feels like a very hollow RPG. While playing I did mention to my friend that it felt very much like playing a Free To Play MMO, very watered down and basic. You will be button mashing in this game - a LOT and you will feel as if it is more a ""brawler/beat-em-up"" than RPG.Playing CoOp was fun however and does make the game more enjoyable. So if you want to play with a group of friends, it may be worth while looking into. However at the RRP of £39.99, I really couldn't ""recommend"" it. If it drops to around £10-£15 - at a stretch £20, it would be worth checking out. But even that would be pushing it.Overall it really is a shame as this was a missed opportunity. The engine is smooth as silk to play and looks stunning. If they had gone all out and made a true Sacred follow up with this tech, it would have been a truly amazing experience.			"

												As a fan of the first two games in the series, I had high expectations for the third installment when it came out.After the first few minutes of gameplay, I knew that the game wouldn't meet my expectations in any way. Deep Silver and Keen Games left out everything that made Sacred great. Instead of a huge open world with ridiculous amounts of sidequests and places to discover like in the first two games, Sacred 3 features a set of missions that have to be completed. The missions themselves are extremely linear, with only one route from beginning to end.Instead of an inventory and a huge pool of items, weapons and armor, there's... nothing. However the characters do have a few different weapons to choose from, with no weapon being necessarily better than the other, just different. The only loot you'll find is gold, which you can use to buy new skills.This is a shell of a game that features very little interaction other than killing stuff. No quests, no NPCs to talk to, nothing... just a few switches to press here and there. There is a bit of dialogue during the game. However that dialogue consists almost entirely of horrible attempts at humour and bad jokes... and I mean really bad, like kindergarten level bad.Although this game bears the ""Sacred"" title, it doesn't resemble Sacred in any way or form. I wouldn't have a problem with this game if they released it as some sort of spin-off or something. I mean it would still be a bad game, but with the ""3"" in the title, it drags the entire series through the mud.To me it seems like Deep Silver witnessed Blizzard's success with their overly simplified Diablo III and ordered Keen Games to do the same with Sacred 3 in order to make a hit game. That plan failed, although the game is fun a short while... but like Diablo III, it gets boring really quickly.			"

												This is not the Sacred 3 that I and many others wanted.I'm sure it's a good game but it should be called Sacred: Citadel 2 or have some other subtitle, it's not at all like the previous two entries in the series.In my opinion the price is unjustified, it plays like a £10 XBLA game. Combat doesn't seem to have any depth, there's no real equipment system. It just makes me want to play Sacred 2 again, and I think I will.Let this be a lesson to me: stop buying games without waiting for customer reviews.			"

												It’s a shame this game has received so many negative comments because for what it is, it’s great.  I have no experience with this franchise, so going in I held no nostalgic preconceptions or expectations and the game is exactly what I was looking for: straight forward hack n’slash with great characters and upgrades.The story and videos are long, so I skipped them.  The graphics are great.  The gameplay is fun, challenging and smooth.  There is no open world, so the time I spend in the game is spent tackling hordes of monsters trying to level up and collect gold to unlock new special moves.If you are looking for a Gauntlet-type game (but even better than Gauntlet), then I highly recommend Sacred 3.

												Oh my god, what has become of this fine hack&slay rpg game... it may be that i should have informed myself a little bit better, but i'm utterly disappointed. I saw the ad for the game today in steam and having played the first two iterations to the extend that afterwards i doubted my decisions in life, i had to have the game immediately. It was total news to me, that they even made another one, so that absolutely brightened my so far dull saturday. But it wasn't for long... So at first, everything i say is just based on the first mission and maybe i can bring myself to play it a little more, even if it was just for the money i spent, but i doubt it. But here are some warnings for some people like me, who are extreme fans of hack&slay rpgs like Diablo, Dungeon Siege, Torchlight etc. It plays more like a beat'em up, something like Devil May Cry or something similar, with some minor rpg ""components"" and here are some points why (and again, i haven't played much):1. No item dropsYep, thats right, no item drops, just some cash here and there and of course health etc. No stash, no backpack, but then again, what would you store in them...2. Straight as Hugh HefnerThis game is so linear, that i can draw you an exact replica of the first mission in ascii art (not really exact, but you'll get the picture):_________      __________        |___|         |____           |_______________  fin3. Missions?There seem to be no quests (and therefore no side quests of course), no maps, no running around tryin' to get every corner of the map light up, .... nothing. Just Mission 1 - 27 (don't know the actual number) which you have to wade through one by one.4. No in-game shops If you wanna buy something, you have to complete a mission and after the outro of the mission, you get to the lobby. In the lobby you have some (utterly ugly) menues, where you can level up, buy potions etc. No merchant, no blacksmith, just a plain menu between missions. I've seen 1,99€ indie games with way more innovative or at least cute versions for something like this (of course real in-game merchants is by the far the best way to go in my opinion).5. The HUDThe HUD looks like it comes straight from Street Fighter 2. If you liked the gothic style HUD from Sacred 2, you will be disgusted by it. The whole time you play the game, you just wait for a camera pan into 2d and a fiery text saying ""ROUND 1 ... FIGHT"". Okay, so far so bad, and by any means you could say i should have informed myself better, but to call this game Sacred frankly is ridiculous. This s not an action rpg, this is a 3d beat'em up game with some minor rpg elements! And the last thing i wanna add is, the voice over is totally idiotic and annoyed me after the first three sentences (and i liked the sometimes witty sometimes even a little cheeky humor of the first two parts). Everytime your guide popped up (of course in a comic style which reminded me of some classic games from the early 90s, which is totally fitting for a medieval style game...) i got so angry i started smashing the screen close to where her picture was, just to get some release. And i've been playing the game for 10mins at that time! So, in conclusion, i wouldn't recommend that game for rpg fans, especially the ones who like the classic hack&slay games like Diablo. I wouldn't recommend it for beat'em up fans either, there are far better games in that genre. If someone thinks this review is not justified and show me some footage or can persuade me otherwise, i will update this review if possible and give it another shot. I would be extremely thankful for something like this, since i paid way too much money for 20mins of gameplay... :(  "

												I have been playing Sacred since it first came out years ago. I have played every version so you can imagine the drool when I heard I could pre order this game. I could not be more disappointed if I tried. This version is nothing like the original game and looks more like a spin off of Diablo 3. I played this game for only a short time before my heart sank completely. I was not happy that I was not able to build my own character from the beginning. ANd it just got worse as I went along.

(Every mission is a smal arena, and every mission has one after the other +1 lvl for you in stock....but why? no meaning of levels)Terrible controlls!!!!Every character has 2 basic skills!! The 2 skills are the same for every class, just with an other animation!!! Kivel törölhetem fel a padlót? "

												Just don't buy this game! It's so dumbed down that you want to cry. Sacred 2 had lots of skills and gear. This has nothing. I'm insulted by the developers and how they♥♥♥♥♥♥a good game (S2) just to make a few bucks. It should have been named something other than Sacred.			"

												Went into this game thinking ""Great another sacred game"", sadly it's not. The links to the previous sacred games are few, little more than characters, classes, and locations. If you want a poor diablo 3 clone with sacred elements then fine. BUT if you want a open world, RPG sacred 1+2 type game then don't get this.Missions are linear with only slight deviations for loot, with side missions being survival against waves or kill all enemies on a small map. RPG doesn't really exist, the only customisation is what weapons to equip and which upgrades to get for them. End of mission scoreboard reminds me more of several console games than anything else, merely lacking a D,C,B,A,S, etc for it to be like DMC.Gotta say i am disappointed with this.			"

												Do not be fooled by this game, if you are buying it because you enjoyed Sacred 1-2 and other Diablo-esque isometrics you will hate this game. The classes and world are familiar and the combat is actually fairly decent and dynamic, however the game has changed from an open world explorer with massive character customisation to a linear scroller with almost no customisation and no loot. Some of the pathways and environments are so linear you almost have no room to move your character.The best way to describe the change is what happened to Dungeon Siege going from 2-3, the disconnect is exactly the same. The open world with quests has become set ""missions"" in a bound area which you complete, get a score, cash reward and a lackluster item.Its very pretty, production values are high, fights are fun but it is NOT Sacred.Oh yes, it has hands down the most painful and embarrassing NPC voice acting and scripting I have heard in a game in, well, as long as I can remember. I seriously considered playing with no sound so I didn't have to listen to the idiotic banter. You feel bad for these little digital people being forced to recite lines that would cause George Lucas to kill himself.If you have never played Sacred or Diablo and are around age 10-12 and want to bash things, you will probably like this game. I however regret the purchase. =(			"

												Sacred 3 has absolutely NOTHING to do with the gameplay that made Sacred 1 and 2 so amazing. This is plain trash.  DO NOT BUY if you are a fan of the sacred series and are looking for more of it. This is like a cheap God of War rip off with the ""Locked-in-until-you-kill-every-single-monster-here"" sections of Devil May Cry tacked on. No more open world.No more LOOT... Just coloured orbs and weapon unlocks at X character level.No more RPG elements and stats. Just bland character archetypes  that auto level-up.Extremely grindy.Completely linear.Terrible one-liners with bland voice acting that remind you over and over of the current objective.CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH - Nothing like the Sacred series, this shouldn't be called Sacred 3 and even if it had a different title and wasn't sending a loved series to it's grave (RIP Sacred) - it's still TERRIBLE.They missed the entire point of what loyal fans loved about Sacred and what made the IP a classic. This is just a cash in.Thanks to @Amiculi for the info. The still in development spiritual successor to Sacred by the team that actually created Sacred 1+2 is called ""Unbended"". Highly suggest giving it a look.			"

												Highly dissapointed, a disgrace to the Sacred series. Linear gameplay, poor controls, no character customisation, no inventory, no loot and overly repetitive grinding for zero purpose not worthy of the Sacred name. Cannot believe I wasted money on this poorly slapped together mess. If you want to play a good Sacred title buy Sacred 2 instead as it is by far a better game in every aspect. Seriously cannot believe this has been released like this...... very very poor effort.			"

												After reading all the negative reviews I was surprised to find this game as fun as I did. I have not played the first or second game in the series so I can not make a comparison. I actually liked the cheesy B grade narrative. This is an action RPG with a pretty interesting battle/combo system. I found it to work pretty good with an XBOX controller, since its more on the console side of things as far as game play goes, playing with KB/mouse it just felt clunky. To me it felt more like a simplified Shadow of Mordor in an isometric view. The game is easy to get into and relatively simple to pickup and get into. For a casual gamer its a blast, but I definitely can see anyone looking for substance, this definitely would not a good choice. I use the arcade style gameplay loosely here, in the respect it doesn't really feel like an arcade game to me, but the way in which you fight through hordes of bad guys then fight a boss as the end of each level, there is definitely an arcade style concept being used here. Sadly there dosnt seem to be any game saves, starting over at the beginning everytime you play is just wrong on every level. Also I get a black screen when starting up the game, can be fixed by alternating into window mode and back to fullscreen mode(alt+enter), not a big deal, but just goes to show that the game obviously still has bugs and some people may not be as fortunite to even be able to run the game at all.

												I was really wondering why this game received so many negative reviews and upon trying it out myself for nearly an hour or so I now know why.I totally ignored them fact that this game has ""Sacred"" in it's title as it has nothing to do with any Sacred game ever before, mechanics included. This didn't put me off in any way though and I decided that this will not have anything to do with my opinion of the game itself.Moving on, I started the game without any issue. Mind you, I have the ""gold edition"" with all the DLC bought with a bundle so I had a big selection of the characters with quite a satisfying number of picks.Happy, I chose a champion and my journey started.The intro already slightly put me off with the ""oh so funny, ha-ha"" worthless dry dialogues setting the whole thing into an stereotype American pseudo-funny-like fantasy casual♥♥♥♥♥♥ I hoped that perhaps just one or two characters act like that but well... no. EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER IS OH SO VERY FUNNY AND HAS TO INSERT A 90S STYLE OLD AS HELL JOKE LINE WHENEVER POSSIBLE making the story into an American B or even C class movie.The mechanics are totally aimed at console players and that is not a game I'm looking for. I was looking for something at least remotely looking like an Action RPG game. Instead you have no character customization, no changes in move sets or skills (as far as I got, perhaps I'm wrong, maybe it changes somewhere further in the game but I'm doubting this).ADDING LEVELS AND XP ALONE DOES NOT MAKE A GAME AN RPG.The game seems boring as heck, I strongly advise not to try it, even for free.

												Sacred 3 has only a parsing resemblence to the previous games.Nearly all RPG elements from the earlier games have been stripped out of the latest game.The open world is gone and replaced with linear missions.Quests are gone and replaced with nothing.Loot is gone and replaced with nothing.Money is plentiful but there is nothing to buy with it.Skill trees are gone and replaced with 2 special attacks.Mouse is not really supported and the game should be played with a XBOX controller.The nearest comparison I can make for gameplay is Gauntlet.It is just a hack and slash action game with an attack, dodge and a couple of special attacks.If you are after a sequal to Sacred 2 then avoid.If you want a multiplayer arcade action game with a Sacred theme then you may not be as disappointed as I am with the game.

												At this point I think it is pretty obvious that this game is not Sacred nor is it a true follow on to the Sacred series and is just a pathetic little money grab on the part of Deep Silver and Keen Games.That being said because it carries the name of the Sacred name it is hard to review it as another game....very few “new” games start off with [name of a franchise] 3.With that in mind, it almost seems like the developers made calculated and deliberate decisions to make the game as cheap, nasty and bad as possible. So bad in fact that it all borders on being malicious.  I can only assume that the developers had a meeting at some point to look at what Sacred 1 and 2 was and then made the decision to take everything that was not so good in 1 and 2 and make it even worse. Of course there where some good things in 1 and 2 as well they had a look and these and decided that the best thing would be to do exactly the opposite.  This is sure to win the hearts of the Sacred fans....oh wait. I guess they rather went out to win the hearts of some new fans.....why then call the game Sacred 3, why not something else, why go through the tedium of some small references to the previous games and it world when you could have done your own thing. Oh but it slipped my mind, this in not intended to be a good game the intention of this was to cost the developers as little as possible so they could put out a piece of software shaped faeces that they could sell for a quick buck. Speaking of the quick buck, as it it a pretty substantial buck, what does this actually buy you? You get a bunch ruler like linear levels, sewn together in a way that makes zero sense, half decent graphics, voice acting that would have been better if they were done by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gorilla with a railroad spike through its head. The only thing that seems half fair considering the price it the download size of the game....it.....is...huge. This is probably the only thing that the developers Keen games achieved, I wouldn't have though that it would be possible for such a large download to translate to so little content, but they managed it. Just so the noteworthiness of this is not missed, games the size of single a CD translated to hundreds of hours of playtime, where they managed to get 4 DVD's worth of game to only last 10 hours, nice.... Speaking about the size, at the end of the credits it actually gives credit to some or other compression algorithm.....everyone should be well warned never use this as it is clearly beyond useless.It also struck me from the credit that there were probably 10 times more QA's involved with the game than anything else. They, as along with everyone else, were clearly not doing their jobs. In conclusion what you get with Sacred 3 is a shameless, pathetic money-grab turd dressed up in a Sacred frock. Done by a bunch of useless developers that should probably look for a different line of work. Hopefully the curse of Sacred will find them as well. (Curse of sacred: every development studio that has worked on a Sacred game has gone bust)			"

												As a HUGE fan of the Sacred series, who loves both Sacred 1 and 2 - this one is the worst of the lot!I have played only 1 hour of the game and finished only the 1st Boss on Warrior difficulty with some effort...I usually put some time into my reviews, but this is gonna be a short one. Here is my list with PROS and CONS:---=== CONS ===---(1) They put 80s american action movies humor (or something similar) in it which doesn't fit at all with the atmosphere of the old-feel melee and ranged fights...(2) Bad voice acting and the narrators are nagging you to rush through the game, instead of enjoy the game at your own pace and find the secret areas.(3) You have NO loot and cannot change your weapon either (I heard there are weapon and armor upgrades when you complete a mission, but it's not the same).(4) You gain XP and Gold and level up - but there is NO active skill tree, but you can select skills after missions.(5) When you roll - you can NOT roll into the directions you want (no matter what WASD keys or key combos you press), but always at the bottom of your screen - BOSS battles are impossible this way, except on the lowest difficulty (Warrior) with lots of effort... If you have a controller - absolutely try that - it should be better...(6) Base price is TOO DAMN HIGH - do NOT buy, unless you are 100% sure you want to try it or have it in your collection, don't buy the GOLD edition before trying it and aim for a 75% discount or more.(7) Everytime you ALT+TAB you have to press ALT+ENTER when you are back in the game to get it to Full-screen.---=== PROS ===---(1) Great graphics.(2) Great physics, animation and an okay art style.(3) Well optimised for PC - not heavy on computer resources like memory and CPU usage.I cannot really think of any other PRO right now - I will edit the review if I get more experience with the game or remember something else.I do not recommend buying this game...EDIT: After finishing the 2nd mission I see that there are other weapons and you can upgrade them, as well as if you don't press WASD in combat, the roll mechanic works 80% of the time in the right direction...

												Do you think is a good idea to get Sacred 3, after playing Sacred and Sacred 2? well, that's not a good idea, and I'll explain why:Do you remember this open world where you can walk wherever you want and take main and side missions? forget about it. Every stage (yes, there are stages, not missions) are just walking a corridor fighting some foes, then run a little bit for another corridor where stones fall from sky, then some more foes and then a final boss. That's it. Every stage. There are some where the stone falling is skipped and you fight some foes and then the final boss, though.Lets talk about customization:You get a weapon and you can upgrade it. Forget to get loot, besides some gold and heal. You have two potions that you can use when you die and thats it. Then, when you finish a stage, you can ""upgrade"" your weapon. But only a little bit because you dont have enough level to buy next.And the worst part is that every two steps you do, someone is talking. I dont even know why, it is supposed to be funny comments, but they are not, its just annoying.I got it in a bundle, but it is not worth even being installed.			"

												I'm very upset with this game and I wish I would have bought a Physical copy so I could return it as defective. I'm a huge fan of the previous Sacred titles with the mass loot amout customizations and open world gameplay. This game has turned into a childs version of a Diablo ripoff. If you expect customization, loot, and a noticable feeling of advancement and success as your character progresses through the ""story"" then this is not the game for you. I advise buying the sacred collection pack and enjoy the games that gave Sacred its fans.			"

												Recommended, but DON'T PAY FULL PRICE! I got it as part of a Humble Bundle so it was basically a dollar.Sacred 3 is co-op arena combat. The game FORCED does it better but Sacred 3 is not bad. It's just that there's not a whole lot to the game. Fun with friends, I wouldn't play it single player, though it might be worth $5 if you like the genre.			"

												Alright. Not recommended. but where should I begin when there is so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t?Okay I believe I should start with the very important thing.THIS is indeed NOT a sacred game.After Ascaron Entertainment, the original developers of the sacred franchise, went bankrupt and had to close (It always hits the ones that do not deserve it) they gave the right to make the next ""Sacred"" game to Keen Studios, a company that doesnt seem to have ever played any Sacred games or make a lot of decent games in the first place.Sacred fans, like me,  are not gonna get reminded that they are playing a game called sacred if it wasnt for the title or the Seraphim.-GameplayThere is none. combat devolves into mashing left mouse button a lot and sometimes using right mouse and occasionally use the 2, yes TWO abilities that they can bring into the mission they are playing.But what do you mean with mission, Rank Bobbers? Sacred always had an open world!Oh yes. it HAD an open world. But not this one. Here you just go from linear mission to mission that goes like this-what I mentioned with the so called ""gameplay"" earlier-dodging-Occasional bossfightThere is day one DLC. Also you could have gotten it with the pre order, but still, the more and more I see of this game it looks like they gave the rights to make a new game to EA.-ProgressionYou do not feel like you want to advance in the game. THERE IS NO FLAPPING LOOT! The gameplay sucks. So why play in the first place? Also, the Weapon Spirits ARE AS ANNOYING AS ♥♥♥♥ING JUSTIN BIEBER!Ah you know what? Im gonna stop here. The outcome is the same anyway and you should know it too.DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS DEGENERATED DIGITAL ♥♥♥♥♥SLAP!You can use the money to buy both Sacred one and 2 both in gold edition and even then save money.I am deeply sorry for anyone who pre ordered like me. I hate myself for it too.Update: It wasn´t Keens idea to make the game like this, Deep Silver pulls all the strings and wanted to make... this!Also, a developer from Keen apologized for this being Sacred 3.Thank you for reading all this. Get yourself a cookie. No seriously go out there and get a box full of cookies. better investment in your money than this.			"

												Definitely not going to recommend this to anyone. If you want it for the sake of collecting the whole series, as was my own reason for getting it, go ahead. Just make sure you don't set any high expectations for this game, and most of all don't compare it to anything you know of the previous Sacred games.The in-game graphics certainly look better this time around than they did in Sacred 2, but the gameplay is not nearly as nice - from a fixed camera view, which can impede certain moves in battle, to doing the map one mission at a time. It's true that Sacred 2 was almost tedious in how large its open world map was, but comparatively I'd much rather go back to doing whatever missions I feel like doing at the time and be done with it.The upside of this is that Sacred 3 is definitely more competitive in nature now than its predecesor was. You need to reach checkpoints in the game versus saving whenever you want to and dying and respawning at a checkpoint will cost you some of your gold gathered in the mission.Overall, I really think it wasn't nearly worth the wait for the game to have been released and they could simply have ended the series with Ice and Blood. If you want to play a Sacred game, play Sacred 2: Fallen Angel.			"

												Positive:- Pretty graphics- Good sound- Humor- Fun when playing CoopNegative:- Boring/repetitieve when playing solo- Unsatisfying leveling progress- False name branding.- False promotion art & trailer (see below)- Expensive compaired to valueThe game itself looks pretty, sounds good and is sprinkled with allot of funny oneliners.The user interface responds well, but everything from start to finish screams: ""use controler not keyboard + mouse"".Playing the game means fighting trough an instance like zone earning points/gold which you use to buy skills with after completing the the zone. So if you are looking for ""loot"" to satisfy your inner packrat munchkin you are out of luck. The playstyle is buttonsmashing in coop and is allot of fun to do with people you know. However when playing solo you will start to notice the repetitiveness of the buttonsmashing and the ""rails"" of this rollercoaster ride.The game is called Sacred 3 and as such it is part of a  brand line (the 3 in it's name would be a big hint)However where sacred 1 and 2 are open world games with multi tiered skill and loot gathering, Sacred 3 is more of a hack and slash on rails. Also the Seraphim player character which has returned in every sacred game does not look like the ones used in the previous game or even like the one used in the boxart and trailer!The above mentioned odities really give the impression that the publisher has been abusing the name and image of a fairly populair brand to  milk some extra cash.  This does not mean it is a poor game, as it is actually a fun game in short bursts, but when you look at similar games, the pricetag of Sacred 3 is really on the expensive part of the comparison scale.So if you are like myself who buys a game on faith and happy memories of previous installments.... then this is an excellent example of why you should always read reviews before buying.

Co-op is a joke and I was so disappointed with it that in shared/split screen co-op the second players character doesn't save and restarts every mission. uhhh what a load of crap.

												I was really looking forward to this game as I loved Sacred, and really liked Sacred 2. But this game has changed so much it is unrecognisable. Its no longer a fun point and click, the controls are completely different,(you have to use a controller to be useable) the characters are not customisable, and the story (what there is of one) is over the top cheesy and characters are badly written. There are no mounts,  you cant loot weapons or armor except from boss drops, and is so watered down its barely even an RPG, no open world content, its plough through level by level. It should be an xbox arcade game worth about £10.  Since Deepsilver took over Ascarons  Sacred legacy the game hasnt had the same heart. Now they have ripped that heart out and fed it to their dogs. This game is a waste of what could have been a great sequel.  I feel cheated by the games company, now how do i get my money back?

												I wanted to like this game. It's a isometric action-fighting game of the type I really like. However, it's very linear, without the open world questing and the diversity of loot and skills that were in the previous games in this series. That can be ok since the various missions are fun, and the graphics/animations decent. I would have enoyed it enough to finish the game if it weren't for the ridiculous difficutly spikes you encounter when you reach the bosses at the end of each mission. Many of the bosses can kill you in just a few hits, and they frequently stun/trap you so you can't move. You have very little diversity in skills or attacks, so all you can do, regardless of the boss type, is brute force attach them while trying not to get hit. Not creative or fun. Given the poor dodge mechanic (see below), how hard bosses hit, and the lack of diversity of skills you have, the boss fights are immensely frustrating. When you die, you go back to the previous checkpoint. If you quit for a bit, you have start the entire mission over again. So the only way I could pass some of the bosses was to replay missions until I leveled up enough to survive them. Very frustrating. So, whereas I can play Grim Dawn, or Path of Exiles, or Torchlight, or any of the similar games all night and enjoy every minute, I find that I can play Sacred 3 for a short bit before I am so angry at a boss fight that I want to uninstall and curse the game's designers. I keep hoping it will get better, but it doesn't. There are some pros of the game:- Generally fun combat.- Decent graphics and animations.- Multiplayer works fine, though there aren't many people to play with.Cons:- No open world gameplay, or RPG elements, or any of the standard features of a Diabloesque game.- Linear missions, and entirely linear maps.- Horrendous difficulty spike when you get to the final bosses for each mission.- Bad dodge system. The doge system is essential for the boss battles, but you always dodge in the direction you are attacking, not the direction you are moving. The movement is with WASD, but the dodge direction is controlled by the mouse direction, same as your attach. So, as an archer, if you are shooting at a creature/boss and it charges you,  when you dodge you just roll right into whatever you are shooting at, no matter which way you are moving. You have to stop attacking and move the mouse away from your target before the dodge, which is too slow and defeats the purpose of the rapid dodge mechanic. Stupid.Mixed:- The story and voice acting. They designers went for over-the-top humor. Sometimes it's funny, but mostly it's lame, I bought this game for very little, so I got my money's worth. If you get it for a couple bucks, you'll probably wnjoy it enough for a bit, until you get frustrated and quit.			"

Because it isnt sacred 3. its just a liniar basic dungeon crawler with little story line and npcs that try to make jokes. the leveling system doesnt make any sense, the weapons and armour seam to level up of their own free will because they can. the spirits dont level up at all so far. there is no customisation for armour, when your armour decides to level up because it can, it will remove clothes from your already naked player. do not play a male. you will end up wearing a corset (if you have the dlc guy) with your hair chest hanging out like some ♥♥♥♥ing tramp at a bus stop on a sunday morning.this game makes me want to vomit into a cup, drink that vomit, then vomit the vomit up. if you want to play sacred 3; buy sacred 2.buy sacred 2buy sacred 2			"

I am sure there are fans of the Power Rangers but it's no Avengers.There are many reviews out there that share my opinion of the game so I am not going to bother.

												What a heap of rubbish.  I have played and played and played the first two games, Sacred and Sacred 2 for years and LOVE them (despite the rough, unfinished edges).  This is barely any better than the other heap of crap Sacred Citadel.  The only real difference I can see so far is that it's not a side scroller.  The immersion is RUBBISH, the graphics are WORSE than Sacred 2, in fact they're more cartoony than Dora the Explorer.  I wanted to mute the stupid introduction and poxy voices just about as soon as they started up.  The lack of customisation with characters is worse than SPACE INVADERS.  I had such high hopes for this game.  Been looking forward to it for YEARS.  Played about 5 minutes and will never play it again.  May be ok for 5-10 year olds but NOT for anyone who actually enjoyed the previous games in the series.  Deep Silver, Deeply Disappointed.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												First off, THIS GAME IS NOT SACRED. It has absolutely nothing to do with the other Sacred games, and please, for the love of sweet merciful crap, DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BE ANYTHING LIKE SACRED 1 OR 2. Abandon all hope of anything Sacred-esque being here. Disappointment abounds if you want this to be anything even remotely similar to Sacred. If you're a huge fan of Sacred and are/would be upset with #3 changing the formula, just don't buy it.*ahem*, now that I've said that...I enjoyed this game (NO NO WAIT, don't downvote me yet!) for what it was. It's dumb, hokey, cheesy, and mindless, but sometimes that's what you want. It doesn't take itself seriously AT ALL, and you have to be in for the ride or you'll hate the entire experience.In fact, the game I would most equate Sacred 3 to is the recently-redone Gauntlet. It's formulaic as all get out, linear as it can possibly be, button-mash-tastic, full of dumb humor, and complete with so-streamlined-I'm-embarassed-to-call-them RPG elements. And yet, it's fun.There's an overworld with scattered, self-contained short levels, there's a few classes to pick from, leveling up is handled automatically a la Diablo 3, there's no loot drops (but your gear levels up and gains new abilities), and then there's the dialog. Ohhh boy, the dialog. Sacred 3 apparently takes itself as a joke, with corny, hammy, 4th-wall-breaking, innuendo and pop-culture reference filled, joke-a-riffic dialog. Did I mention yet that you really need to go with the flow to enjoy this game? I was enjoying it, but I uttered more than a few ""ugghhhh""s during my time.This is a great pick-up-and-play game, easily digested in small chunks. From the overworld, there's a series of story missions and little side mission things that you can pick from, and after 20 minutes at most of bashing and smashing, you're back at the level select screen and on to the next one. The side missions are the shortest of the bunch, lasting only 5 minutes at times, but they're rather essential as they help you level up (the recommended level on the story missions will quickly outrank you if you skip all side missions), and they give you additional potion slots of various types (health, energy, defense+, etc.). The story missions are quite a bit longer. They almost always include a pre-rendered cartoony cutscene with voice-actors hamming it up, they almost always include some sort of turn-this-wheel-6-times-while-enemies-spawn mechanic, they almost always include some sort of dodge-the-falling-stuff section, and they almost always include a big huge boss fight.I found the bosses to be quite fun. The combat itself is a blast in general, but the bosses up the ante. They almost always spawn other enemies around them, they usually have some sort of environmental hazard around them, and they're not too difficult as long as you can read their patterns. Don't expect to be frantically gritting your teeth while you're on the razor's edge of life or death, but you have to be somewhat coherent to surive.Speaking a little more on the combat, in the first few levels, you're just mashing attack over and over, but the combat evolves. Dodging becomes crucial, there are shielded enemies you have to bash, you can leap in the air and slam down on stunned enemies to insta-kill them, and there are spell attacks you have to interrupt before they can be pulled off. It's great. You'll be flipping around the arena, bashing a shield enemy and beating on him a bit before leaping to smash a faraway enemy in order to get out of harm's way. There are combat skills and such that get recharged with dropped energy, but they're nothing really special. Big slashes, aerial attacks, some chain lightning, shouting to stun enemies, etc. They can get you out of a pinch, but they're not enough stronger than regular attacks to be THAT useful. They recharge quickly, though, so don't feel like you need to save them for clutch moments.The only real weakpoint I experienced with combat is the QTE ""restraining"" mechanic. Essentially, if you've really been wailing on the boss or mini-boss, there's a little QTE section where you can mash a button for about 10 seconds to ""restrain"" them and do small bits of trickle damage the whole time. It's kind of pointless, since you could do just as much damage by just continuing to wail on them, and even though for the most part the enemies stop attacking you (in single player. Multiplayer they keep going), if your objective is to defend a crystal from some grenade-lobbing goblins, they'll keep attacking THAT while you're locked in the QTE. Luckily, you're never required to do the restraining, so I just opted to skip them most of the time. No big deal.All in all, the gameplay is fun, but rather basic. Slog along a linear path listening to cheesy, jokey dialog, slaughter some easy enemies and minibosses, turn a wheel 6 times, dodge some falling debris, and then kill a big boss. Do a couple short little side missions, and then rinse-repeat. In fact, repetition is a bit the name of the game here, almost as if it was intentionally designed to be that way. This game will take around 10 hours to beat if you don't grind or backtrack, but it's repetitive enough that you DEFINITELY don't want to do it in one or even two sittings. I've put 12 hours in, and that's over the course of maybe 4 different sessions. I can't recommend forcing yourself through much more than that at a time. You'll know when the game is starting to wear on you, and listen to that little voice in your head. Quit while you don't hate it, and come back later for more.The graphics here are a lot better than I was expecting. The geometry isn't Crysis-levels of complex or anything like that, but the texture work is phenomenal, the areas are all colorful and bright, and clearly a lot of work was put into designing unique ""biomes"" to progress through in the campaign. There's a bit of repetition, but nothing wearying. It's INCREDIBLY well-optimized, too. You could max this out at 1080P with a 4-year-old midrange card and still get 60ish fps.Sound and music are nothing worth remembering, and some of the little spirits you can bring along (they each have certain passive effects) have annoying dialog lines, but the worst offender here is the ""help"" text. When you're beating the crap out of enemies and not doing, for example, the leap-smash, expect to hear your spirit chime in with ""helpful"" advice every 5 seconds about how you should be leap-smashing. ""Looking for peace? SMASH the enemy... with a hug!"" Yeah, okay, I saw... ""looking for peace? SMASH the enemy... with a hug!"" Yeah, I SEE IT! ""looking for peace?"" AAGGGGGHHHHH! Luckily, you can turn that crap off in the options, which I did with vociferousness, and you should too. The mechanics of the game are not tricky in the slightest, so why they thought an overzealous ""help"" mechanic was needed is beyond me.Overall, if you (and a friend) are looking for mindless, slaughtering fun, and you're capable of taking everything for the joke that it is, you should have fun here. I know I did. If, however, you're a big fan of Sacred and were excited to see a 3rd one come out, RUN AWAY, there is nothing for you here.The big test is to watch a video on Youtube. Any 5 minute chunk of gameplay will be indicative of the whole game, and if that doesn't turn you off, check it out! It's worth the $6 I spent, in my opinion. Oh, also, USE A CONTROLLER.			"

												I haven't played much of the game yet but I can tell you that it's a real yawnfest. This isn't an action RPG game like any Diablo game or Torchlight game or Path of Exile, It's a beat 'em up game just like a host of other people are saying. No loot system only an upgrade system. You can unlock other weapons and upgrade them individually but it would require a lot of grinding to do so, since gold progression is relatively slow. The upgrade paths for each weapon don't differ from one another much either. It will come down to which one you think looks the coolest and that is the one you will use. You unlock 'combat' abilities very slowly and then you have the option to upgrade them much like your weapon/armor. But it's just too damn slow. You can upgrade it at lvl 4 and then you have to wait until lvl 12 and then lvl 20 for the next and lvl 33 for the next. Some have even bigger gaps it's really annoying. Why do I have to wait that long to do +20% more damage and or +50% radius or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's just bonehead design. Also these upgrades will cost thousands of gold. If it's a weak ability it will start at several hundred and increase to several thousands. But the better abilities in the game start at quite a lot and will cost you tens of thousands in gold combined just to finish the upgrade tree. Why would this game be such a grind fest? Especially when it's boring and repetetive in the first place. If you have to absolutely play this game do it with friends because solo is just boring and yes like many others have said the NPC chit-chat is obnoxious.Honestly the game insults my intelligence as will it yours. It does have bugs including getting stuck on invisible walls, bosses, corners and other♥♥♥♥♥♥that will force you to restart the entire level. Also much like people are saying, the game is not worth $50 or even $25. It's a $20 and under game. There isn't enough gameplay variety and it's a grind fest. Also if you like to make your own character you cannot, you can't even name your character they're just pre-made. It doesn't bother me but some people are really into customization and this game has very little, if any.I am playing the game on the hardest difficulty and it's just easy-peasy. Play it on the easiest... You would probably die in-game from falling asleep at the keyboard/controller.Steer clear of this. It's a complete consolized game. The graphics do not impress. They look a little better than Titan Quest graphics with better atmospheric lighting. "

												If you've played any of the other games in the Sacred series, then you know what to expect from this one.Oh, wait. It's NOTHING like those.This is, as best I can describe it, a prettied-up, expensive game of the old coin-op, Gauntlet. Sure, it's good for some mindless hanck-n-slash, but there are no RPG elements in it. At all.If they only had a voice that kept saying, ""Warrior needs food... Badly!"", I think the experience would have been much improved.As it is, I can't seriously reccomend this... lukewarm, flat pepsi of a game to anyone.Wait till it's on sale for a buck. Then it will be worth the money.			"

												Sorry to say this is not Sacred as we know it, this is simply a game with a stolen name. Nothing in it is as you would enjoy if you bought it based on the previous 2. No inventory, no items, no real levels, no free roam, no diversity (the characters while all different, all play exactly the same often known as balancing) no challenge.   At absolute best this game has an entertainment ceiling of about 14 years old, anyone past that will find it hard to maintain interest. There is another game available on steam called Dungeonland, this is pretty much a prettier version of that game that also costs 10x its price. whilst the game does look quite pretty and smooth, it seems more like a 3d version of Golden Axe. I stopped playing this after i bugged out and got stuck in terrain. This happened a few times, i simply exited the level and then began again, however, it happened multiple times and so that was it for me. This is not the reason i do not recommend this game, however everything does contribute. If you are still interested in this game, i suggest checking youtube for some in game clips, or maybe see if anyone is playing it on twitch.tv or a similar streaming site. I was really in the mood for something with such a rich and lustrious history and reputation as sacred too :*(			"

												I'd like to clarify some of the negative reviews.  This game ""isn't that bad"".  I won't say it's good, and I'd give it a neutral rating if possible.  It IS NOT WORTH full price.  But it has gone on sale for 3.75, and even been in the $1 tier of a Humble Bundle, and it is a fine/fun game for that price.This game's negative reviews are primarily given for one reason: Expectations.  It is disliked, even hated, because of what it isn't.What this game isn't:- Not a Diablo-clone (action RPG) like Sacred 1 and 2.  It can't really be considered much of an RPG at all.  It only has minor RPG elements.- Not made for keyboard and mouse.  It's made for a controller.- Not a high quality AAA title.  It has good graphics.  It has a terrible script.  It has intermediate voice acting.  The game mechanics are unoriginal.- Not worth $50;  probably not worth $15.What this game is:- Overhead beat-em up.- Minor RPG elements, like leveling up.- Designed for a controller- Designed with local co-op in mind. (I've not played it local co-op, so I can't speak to the quality of that experience)- Worth $3.75.This game will not be the next big thing in your library, but it could be a fun beat-em up to play with a friend.  A positive review on this game is gonna get some hate, because, like I said, this game is HATED for what it isn't.  It actually offends the fans that this game isn't what one would expect from a sequel to Sacred 1 and 2.But if this game wasn't called Sacred 3, it wouldn't be getting all this hate.  If it were called Sacred Citadel 2, or some obscure name like Arcania Heart, it would probably have much more positive reviews (except for the unreasonable price-tag).			"

												I bought this during the sale for $3.74 and still cant quite bring myself to give it a thumbs up.  This game is a very simple, very linear, hack and slash.  You travel along on a terribly confined, predetermined pathway killing mobs.  At the end of each pre-defined pathway, there is a ""boss"" style mob.  You kill the boss mob and finish that pathway.  You move on the the next ""pathway"" and do the same thing again-over and over.  That is the game in a nutshell.  The scenery isnt engaging in the least and there arent any ""drops""(random or otherwise) of items or equipment to make the game interesting.  All that drops is gold but I havent played long enough to know what the gold is supposed to be used to buy.  I may never play that long.  As far as comparing this game to previous Sacred games;  In many, many cases I have found that a new game in a series is pretty good but doesnt meet the expectations of those who played previous installments so the new installment gets a bad rap.  That is not the case with Sacred 3.  Sacred 3 deserves a bad rap all on its own merits.  Previous Sacred games are very busy games with a ton of things to do, tons of plot and sub-plot to remember story and quest wise, and lots and lots of interesting equipment drops and so on.  In truth, Ive always thought that previous Sacred games are TOO busy lol!  Anyway, Sacred 3 is not busy at all.  Sacred 3 is mindless in fact.  As I said above, you travel down relatively short corridors killing everything that comes at you, kill a boss and then you're done till the next corridor.  That is it.  Also, I think the charector scripts are supposed to be amusing but it comes of only as juvenile and silly.  Like another reviewer said; ""Turn off the sound to make the game a little better"".   Bottom line is that $3.74 is pretty cheap.  If you've got it to spare then buying this game probably wont be the worst decision that you've ever made.  BUT, should you chose NOT to buy Sacred 3, you wont be missing anything, I assure you.			"

												The good:1. I knew the game is as craptastic as it can get.2. Paid very little for this junk.3. Felt like this is one of those game that will help me understand the the stupidity of developers. Well, it kinda did help me on that subject.The bad:1.♥♥♥♥♥♥GAME.2.♥♥♥♥♥♥GAME.3.♥♥♥♥♥♥GAME.The ugly:1. Whoever made this game should not be put into gaming industry ever again. IF they are in it yet, they should be supervised by REAL game developers.2. Learned lessons: A) Never make a game for console when it was meant to be for PC at first.                                 B) Never develop one if you think you are drunk or too smart to change what was already a solid                                      game.                                 C) Human stupidity is very contagious. This game is a prime example of human stupidity manifesting                                       in their intellect, which caused ruins and failures.3. Whoever wrote the script for the game:  You ruined your career and personal image by doing so in this game. If you must write, know what you are going for before you even bother taking on the project. Sometimes word hurts more than the gfx. Painful dialogues are worse than bad gfx in a game. The gfx you can look away from, but the words: they stick with you and cause internal intellectual-level damage to the brain. The questions:1. Why no inventory?2. Why no customization?3. Why no click and move option?4. Why no in-depth gfx setting?5. Why no....nevermind...			"

												This is another 'maybe recommend or maybe don't' so I'm going with 'recommend' but I want to disclaimer it a bit.Most important, Sacred 3 is not a DIablo 2-style ARPG like the earlier Sacred games - it's more an arena/ stage brawler with a fixed progression of unlockable gear.The menus - esp the stuff for upgrading your characters - are seriously obscure - I found how to buy upgrades more than luck than anything else!!The writing varies from sharply witty to massively crass with reckless abandon.  Some of the dialog is absolutely CRINGEWORTHY - some of the VO work is so similar I've no idea who's talking (and frankly I wish they'd just shut-up most of the time)Online play seems to end/disconnect/crash quite a bit - so I stopped trying that tbh, it's playable solo so...There's fun to be had but it's an odd package - maybe wait for a deep sale and then think twice and then - if you still fancy it - go for it.

												They have changed a good game into a 3D look down side-scroller. It is very difficult to use computer controls. It is designed for 12 year olds on a console, not adults on a computer. DO NOT BUY. It is a rip-off of the worst kind. If this is how Steam protects its clients, I will never buy a game thru Steam again. I guess games are only for kids with a twitch response and not for grown ups. I REPEAT ""DO NOT BUY"". Steam should be ashamed of itself!!			"

												On first impression this is a brighter, prettier version of diablo 3. Within about 20 minutes though you will realise there are very few fun abilities to use (meaning extremely dull and monotonous combat), no loot system at all and the character customisation and progression is all more or less irrelevant and uninteresting.The bright setting and constant cheesey humour are the only things the game has to offer but the terrible gameplay is distressing enough to make that moot.

												Terrible controls. No loot system (in an ARPG: NO LOOT SYSTEM. At all.) Linear levelling (i.e. you have no control over the progress of your character). No overworld or questing. Lots of ""funny"" comments and pop culture references, very occasionally including comments that are actually funny... but usually not.Sacred 3 is quite possibly the worst ARPG I've ever played. It's not because it's buggy or incompetently implemented - I haven't run into any actual bugs yet. It's because they took the basic design template for an ARPG then removed all the reasons why people actually play these games.I find it astonishing that nobody flagged these issues during development. I imagine a QA team asked to find bugs but told not to comment on actual gameplay. I imagine a producer with a ""vision"" of simplified play and nobody in a position to call bullsh*t. I imagine a dev team told to shut up and get on with writing code.There is no other excuse.			"

												First, this game has almost nothing to do with the previous Sacred Universe, neither in Story nor in Gamplay.The story is almost not present and is only an excuse to guide you over the map through the levels.The combat System is easy to learn and not complicated. You can take 2 Abilities on the missions which you also can alter between 3-5 between missions(so not much diversity). There are 3 Weapons per Class which are only different in their special ability. There is almost no such thing as Character development except the look of your Armour every few lvl ups. The Enemy types are repetetive and the level design is like a tube. After a few missions you get the feeling,you are playing the same lvl just with other skins and in another environment (which looks very pretty i have to admit). The Bossfights are somehow challenging at first try but then rather easy to accomplish. Sacred 3 is definitely a nice game for casuals and people who want to play with their friends a quick and simple coop game but for fans of the Sacred series and (i have to compare) Diablo like games, will be disappointed.After 9 hours or so i completed every mission and the day one dlc missions (5 in the Underworld).All in all this game is fun but has almost no replay vallue or longtime motivation and is never worth the 50€.

												If you can get this and play with a friend with all DLCs paying 1$ go ahead. Else avoid.Why ?-This game is very repetitive: spin the wheel, dodge rocks, kill minions, kill boss.-Characters are very similar and just few skills. Not real RPG feeling, but I guess this is not a RPG.-The game is quite short.-Boring in general, maps are very linear.-Very bad humor and pointless jokes by ""narrator"" voices.-Lack of items.Also, you buy a DLC and instead of having MORE CONTENT you end up playing less because if you want to play cooperative all the players must have your DLCs as well. Even if you are playing with a non-DLC hero in a non-DLC map.I cannot recommend this game.			"

												I generally don't care to write reviews, but this one did deserve a short one at least:DON'T BUY IT!it MIGHT be worth 15EU...definitely not 50! It's shameful as a Sacred, bad as a Gauntlet-like arcade and definitely not an RPG of any kind worthy of such a name: it has no loot, only 4 and a 1\2 buttons worth using and you won't need much skill in using them nor will you need to use most of them most of the time, skills are barely noticeably customizable and very few, treasure chests only hold gold and not a lot...not that you are desperate for gold, so they are not even worth looking for, replay value is negligible, even multiplayer isn't enjoyable, one of the main reasons I bought this game is that I could play with my friends on the same computer, shoulder to shoulder, like old times, the problem is that it's so bad that no one has ever wanted to give it a second try!...etc: DON'T BUY IT!On the bright side, that little story there is, even though it doesn't really look like a storyline, but rather a comedy and it's nothing bright, it's actually quite rough and dull, is enjoyable enough, if you are willing not to take it seriously and forgive a couple of very bad lines...it still is not enough to save the game: DON'T BUY IT!

It would be like if rockstar announced GTA 6 and when you bought it you find out its an ""on rails"" shooter game. That is how my reaction is to sacred 3 i did play through the whole thing hoping for somthing cool in the end the only thing i found decent in this game was being able to play as an orc but you have to buy him as a DLC. Sacred 3 can die i hope someday for a real sequel to sacred 2. Or even a new expansion to sacred 2 would be amazing. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME PLEASE.			"

The intro movies looks great tbh...but the game itself is a total let down.It's just a mindless hack and slash game, which can be fun if that's explicitly what you're looking for when buying a game. I was not. The game mechanics are for 95% just attack, dash to interrupt and an occasional roll away, rince and repeat.The graphics are ok. And as some said before the voice acting is well......let's say that if you got the sense of humour of a 4 year old it can be fun.It's not worth the money.			"

												This game has nothing to do with the previous instalments of Sacred and this is probably why some many rate it like crap.  This game is a basic arcarde monster bashing and not a RPG like Sacred 1 and 2.  Fully playable with the Xbox controller (probably recommended), this game is more appealing if you are looking for a quick pace arcade gauntlet like game to kill some times rather that a long quest endeavor.  That is probably why so many players are dissapointed, I was not. Probably because with so bad rating, I was not expecting anything great and consequently I was pleasantly surprised by Sacred 3.Does it worth the full retail price? Probably not and if you are lucky you can get the full game with DLCs for a singe dollar at Humble Bundle (or wait for a decent discount) and possibly have fun playing in co-op for an evening or two... And this is not THAT bad!The only con to me so far seems to be that the developer haven't figured out yet that the voice over in Sacred 1 and 2 were stupid and the bad humor should have been ditched for Sacred 3 (or at least the player should have the option to cut them off...).  But from circa 30min of play, I surprised myself to laugh at some of the stupid voice over, so assuming you only play this game once in a while to kill some times, it should still be OK.  "

												If you are looking for a legitimate sequel to Sacred or Sacred 2, do not play Sacred 3.  The vast majority of the reviews for this game are simply based on disapointed fans that were expecting a true Sacred experience. If you can see past this, read on.If you are looking for a decent, linear hack and slash ARPG with some above average combat mechanics, its worth picking up on sale (under $20). There is not much character variety, but the actual enemy encounters and bosses are fairly well executed. The environments are nicely laid out with overall good art and have some unique mechanics to keep it interesting. I suggest playing on the hardest difficulty from the start to keep it challenging. Once you beat the game it unlocks a brutal difficutly called Deity for the hardcore. There is no loot in the game in the sense of dropped or collected gear or items. Instead they decided to unlock new abilities and weapons through leveling up. Its an interesting change of pace and makes the combat feel more like god of war than Diablo. Which can be a good thing if your looking for something more than a button masher. You will need to have good timing and strategy with your blocks, dodges and stuns to be successful in the harder stages. Play with a controller for the best experience. The dialogue is probably the worst in gaming history. If you want to constatly cringe and see just how bad it can get, prepare yourself for an interesting ride. You can easily turn off voice and you wont notice the text since it does not affect the game at all. The game can be finished in about 10 hrs and other than trying to max out character abilities or playing on higher difficulties, there is little replay value. The Orc playable character DLC is worth picking up for a couple bucks. Hes strong and has some fun, skill based abilities. If you are an action RPG fan that is fine with more linear console style gameplay, its worth playing.			"

												This game is a devastating end to a, in my opinion, great series. It's more like the bad ripoff copycat of tube-leveliness. It could be a diablo 1 -clone if it wasn't so damn linear. There is literally no choice for you. The Weapons are determined and level up leaving you no choice but to chance it every now and then. The enemies are straight for your level. And did I mention the ""Whoops, look there is something falling from the skies... at you... everywhere...you better run""-Levelpart that will leave you in an agony of boringness and repetition. Again and again. I played it trough in every difficulty on 1.5 days with 2 players. Not every level but you get the deal. If you love wonderfull designed areas with a story that will lead you from cutszene to tubelevel to cutszene then its a perfect game for you. Like interacting with a determined story, while feeling you are not really needed. It's watching a film while smashing your mousebuttons. But if you want to see Sacred 3... then I have to disappoint you. That is as much ""Sacred"" as a Bollywood movie. It's bright and flashy and somekind of funny. But in the end you ask yourself: ""WHY THE HELL DID I BOUGHT THIS CRAP?!""			"

												Sadly if your after something that resembles the first 2 Sacred games - this is not it. If you want a Gauntlent style hack and slash, non linear gameplay, with very little RPG elements then this is the game for you. Sadly this game reminds me of Titanfall or even Diablo 3 - without the character customisation. Given that the game has been given a ""SACRED"" branded name this is nothing like those - this is something I cant stomach for more than 10 minutes without getting bored - if I wanted an old 80s hack and slash with modern graphics in isometric 2D style then I would have stuck with this but I havent really been engaged in SACRED since the first one which was amazing.

												This is the first game that I've bought on Steam where I want my money back. I have dozens of games I've not even played and never plan to and I don't want to get a refund for them - I know that if I play them I'll enjoy them and that I'll have paid for that privilege. Not this though. Hell no. This game fails at every level.Firstly, it's not Sacred 3. It's a completely different game by a completely different development house. I've heard that they have been working on this since 2010, so I don't understand how they could have failed to have any kind of focus group or input from any gamers who had played the originals in producing this item. It's not an RPG, it's has no lastability, no in-depth world, no enjoyable storyline or characters, no exciting loot drops or character builds, none of that.Ok, so let's take it at just what it is, a new hack'n'slash rather than a sequel to an awesome game or two - this has no character variation and very little variation in the mobs, a short game world, no replayability, dreadful script spoiling good voice acting, but it does have very vibrant graphics and fair sound. Controls are poor with keyboard and mouse but fair with a controller. There's certainly a lot of action in each fixed arena you fight in, but it doesn't change, even the boss fights are mediocre. 4 hours into the game I'd given it a good try, struggling to find some nugget of gold in this midden heap. It was halfway complete and I didn't want to play it ever again.If this was released on a phone or tablet for $2.99 I could see someone buying it and playing it once before deleting it, knowing that that was what they were expecting, but £40 or $60 or whatever it is, after 4 years in the making??? I want my money back.			"

												I've never been a fan of the sacred series having found sacred 2 to be rather bland as far as ARPGs go & this 3rd installment is just as bad if not worse.Having hollow game play mechanics the art is ""meh"" at best, their system of level access is confusing (turns out play missions instead of having a level progression like other ARPGs... seems almost to be intended strictly for multiplayer) & includes vocals worse then having Navi around... not only are the voice actors poor & talking ALL THE TIME but includes stuff the developers thought would be funny for some reason. The ""humor"" sounds more like youtube comments than actually being funny.The action comes in swarms which is the game's only selling point really. If you want mindless dungeon bashing then it can be fun. However as far as ARPGs go you can buy just about anything else & be assured it's better. Even the lesser know Iesabel is better. The only ARPG I can think of off hand that may be worse is the poorly conceived RAW - Realms of Ancient War.If you're going to buy this buy it on DEEP sale. $5 is about right but not a penny more.

												At the time of writing this, Sacred 3 has a 'Mostly Negative' rating on Steam. I honestly can't think of a game I've played recently that is 'mostly negative' other than this game, and that includes quite a few garbage titles acquired through greenlight bundles and the like. 'Mostly negative' is an extremely low rating for Steam, frankly, it puts the game in the same kind of expression as one would describe taking a shortcut through an alleyway to discover a dumpster fire.Or I guess in this case, someone wrote 3 on the dumpster fire. Anyway: Sacred 3's two biggest problems are likely that it was launched at an AAA price-tag and that it is marked a sequel to Sacred 2, instead of a sequel to Sacred Citadel, the latter being a side-scrolling beat 'em up but from what I've read far closer to Sacred 3 than Sacred 2 was. The game is now $15 and I was kind of astounded to see it in the dollar tier of a recent humble bundle, so I picked it up.Anyway goods and bads:+Beautiful, AAA level graphic quality for a game of this genre. Tons of scenic variety, lots of beautiful details. I really can't overstate how nice the graphical and aesthetic work is here.+Fun, frantic, high energy combat with some RPG trappings... Reminds me a lot of small dungeon WoW, but more frantic. Contary to other reviews, you can and do change up your skills, weapons and some other minor stuff, but it's not anywhere near a RPG really.+Lots of fun boss fights+Excellent, abundant voice acting. Your character, your weapon ""spirit"", your telepath and usually the boss of the dungeon all talk. Gives the game a lot of personality that changes up as you play.+Good score-Incredibly lacking in enemy variety for game length. Mind-bogglingly so. They put together more models and skins than actual enemy types. The enemies you do fight have personality, but you fight the same guys over and over.-Combat gets repetitive due to lack of enemy variety, game can be a bit grindy-Some visual elements don't translate well, and often enemies winding up a tell can't be seen, or they're allowed to attack from offscreen, or there's just too much stuff constantly flooding in to move properly. Game is missing that last bit of polish and gets real janky at times.-Game has SOME RPG trappings, but not nearly enough and a lot of it doesn't make sense. There is only one kind of random drop in the entire game, everything else is scripted and often nonsensically. The talent trees are simplified, and you only have 2 skills with four other inputs at a time - attack, dodge or block, light art, heavy art, bash and execute - and the two you can change aren't staggered well so you don't end up switching a lot. Most of the weapon spirits aren't well balanced, so again, you tend to get stuck with certain set ups for long stretchs of the game.-Your telepath who feeds you instructions is usually charming, and the voice actress does good work with what she is given, but in some cases they didn't record enough dialogue or re-use/repeat dialogue way too quickly. It can get really annoying at times. Again - that last bit of polish.-Story and humor have tone all over the place. Some of the jokes are just awful. While most of the voice acting is excellent, the ""big bad"" is poorly written and just sounds way too hammy. The game is about 25% more shlock than it needs to be.Anyway, is Sacred 3 great? Well, it has great graphical assets, which I assume the original pricetag was informed by. The rest of the game is ... Okay? Good in parts, but usually just above average, kinda terribly unpolished in patchs. It's certainly not the 'mostly negative' hobo in a dumpster fire it sounds like. I can totally understand people who paid $50 being upset at it, but for the current asking price or out of a bundle, I think it's pretty okay. It should have been a much better game, and titled Sacred Citadel 2, and it's a real shame I doubt anyone will ever do anything ever again with the excellent art assets.			"

												Biggest let-down this year. I actually didn't watch any trailers or read any reviews, i just preordered it because it was a Sacred game, Sacred 1 and 2 was awesome so i just asumed this would be as well, how wrong i was. After playing for a few hours, im asuming the developers picuring the players to be idiots, ""lets not make them think too hard about anything"". There is no Inventory, the ""skill tree"" (pains to even call it that) is a joke, the combat system is the most repeatable i ever played: hold down left mouse button until mob dead, Oh it's got a shield, press right mouse button then the left until dead... more mob coming? rinse and repeat (I know it's suppose to be a hack 'n slash but come on!)And the levels are the most linear i have ever seen, it's even a one way trip, you can't go back because it put up some wierd barriers when you pass checkpoints. Gone is the wonderful open world with mounts and everything  :(And then it's the voice actors, saved for a handful they are awful, like whats up with the moaning horny battlemage spirit??One thing that anoys me about the controls is that you doge in the direction of the mouse not the direction of where you are going, so you always has to know where the pointer is less you want to doge right in to the firepit...Conclusion, if you like Sacred 1 and 2 DON'T buy this game,this is not a Sacred game, keep your memories and pretend that this do not exist.

												Sacred 3 is alright for a mindless sesson of hack and slash, but i was rather disapointed with the game its self. I was a big fan of sacred 2 which was a good rpg game. What bugs me the most about this game is the set liner gameplay with no no customisation of clases, and the fact that you never change from the default wepons you start with. If you are in the mood for a hack and slash game where you dont have to think about quests and find yourself constantly forgetting what is happening in the story, i recomend this game. How ever if you are more of a classic rpg fan(like myself) stay the hell away from this game it will just annoy you.			"

												This game had alot of potential but didnt' really live up to it.+The graphics are good. The backgrounds and character models are all great.-The voice actors are good, I recognize many of their voices from other games. However the lines and accents they are given are pretty terrible. Almost all conversations are filled with ""dad jokes"" told with a bad accent. not funny at all.-The gameplay is very repetitive. On almost every level you will have to dodge stuff falling from the sky. You will also have to spin lots of wheels ( 6 times, always 6 times). The enemies are mostly the same throughout the entire game.-The combat is very easy, it's difficult to die unless fighting a boss. After beating the game you will unlock ""Deity"" difficulty. On Deity many regular enemies can kill you in 1 or 2 hits, which just makes it frustrating/annoying to play.-There is no loot except for gold. Progress is very linear, weapons & items are unlocked on certain stages, new abilities are unlocked at fixed levels and require gold to ugrade.-Gaining levels is a grind, gaining gold is an even bigger grind.-The game has built-in voice chat. It does not have an option for PTT (Push to talk), and you cannot mute yourself, but you can mute everyone else. I really wanted to like this game however the bad far outweighs the good. If you play with friendsand ignore the story then you might have fun just mindlessly killing things.			"

												I've been a member of the Steam community for over 5 years now. This is the first review I have ever written. YES, this game is THAT bad. First let me say that I really enjoyed Sacred 2, which is why I commited to pre-purchasing this game. The character classes in this game don't really differ from one another. Yes, this one has a sword and that one an axe, and then another with 2 swords. With the exception of the bow, they pretty much do the same thing. A short arc swing in front of you and the ability to use a bash (no shield required or available) which also is a short arc swing in front of you. You can hold down the button to ""charge"" a bash to give it some range but it's still a very weak attack and all but useless except to interrupt enemies who are engaged in any long duration ability use. In this game you will find yourself going from map to map using the same abilities over and over against enemies that vary little. The terrain is tediously boring and there is no room to explore. You go the way they want you to go or you can go back the way you came. The weapon varieties are laughable as they all pretty much do the same thing with very little difference among them. Leveling up is a major let down. No stats to increase, no growth of your character. But every few levels you get the option to upgrade a weapon or one of the very limited abilities you want. You cannot switch armor, you can only upgrade what you have when you reach the appropriate level and graphically it is such a let down as there is no real change to how it looks. The voice overs from ""weapon spirits"" are laughably horrible. The plot is weak and shallow and all but non-existent. Online play: Your character will NOT be unique. Your Seraphim will be exactly like anyone elses Seraphim of the same level and since each class has only 1 viable weapon choice, (the others are just filler weapons that won't do as well) then you will each have the exact same weapon and be doing the same 2 or 3 maneuvers over and over until you finish a map. Gameplay: Run through each map killing whatever set monsters they throw at you until you reach the end of the map. Hit the portal then go to the next similar map again killing whatever set monsters they throw at you until you reach the end. Every 4th or 5th map there is a BOSS fight at the end. Boring combat of dodging predictable boss attacks and hitting them in the butt until dead. Then hit the portal and be prepared for yet another map of absolutely unexciting combat. This game lacks any variety, sense of character uniqueness, or flash. What you do in the first 2 minutes of game play is exactly what you will be doing after 3 hours of game play, it doesn't change or get any better. It is the biggest let down I can ever remember purchasing.			"

Posted: August 6, 2014
												Sacred 3 is arguably one of the biggest disappointments in my personal gaming history.  The sequel to its predecessors leaves little to the ""Sacred"" title series, as it is far different--the ""red-headed step child""--the ""oddball"" of the three.  Unlike the first two games in the hit series, Sacred 3 is a very linear action RPG, and the term ""RPG"" is held very loosely and walks a very thin line.The graphics in the game are beautiful, detailed, and the environment rich and fairly interactive, and the combat is flowing and can bring a fun challenge, but it simply is not enough to save this game from the broken chains of what made this franchise so popular.  In Sacred 3, there is no exploration--so put away your maps, and every bit of directional video game intuition you have (or think you have).  Everything is based on a standard, linear, pre-planned map you choose from an overview screen after each level, with no way to go but ""forward"", and the occaisonal random dead-end so that you can loot that very special treasure chest.Speaking of loot, this game does not offer loot in terms of items, but only health and energy (used to cast your TWO powers you are able to use at any one time) and gold.  I repeat:  Loot DOES NOT DROP from mobs or foes that you so diligently vanquish like a good little hero.  Instead, weapons and armor (you only use one of each) are ""unlocked"" when the game says so--usually when hitting a milestone character level or completing a specific storyline mission.As far as storyline missions go, the story is decent and follows a logical path, but the side quests seem out of place (even for side quests), and the only objective you are ever given is ""kill them all""...all of them...again...and again.  And if you are too low for the recommended level of a certain quest you want to trudge through, guess what?  Tough luck.  Keep replaying missions until you ARE able to get to that level to defeat those quests.While I somewhat enjoy the fact that you must acheive certain character levels to unlock weapons, armor levels, and abilities, the idea in its own entirety seems hollow.  You loot gold, gold buys you skill and weapon upgrades, and you set those upgrades as active skills that you can use (you use one light skill and one heavy skill)--and normally when you find the best combination of skills, you stick with those, and the endless piles of gold you can grind out may as well be valued as worthless pebbles on the ground.There is no character development, other than the ""customizing"" of your two skills, weapon slot, and armor slot--and they all fall onto a linear path.  There is no developing character stats, no adding talents, no feats, no kind of character traits, no type of roleplaying element whatsoever.  And if you have seen one area-of-effect skill, you have seen them all.  The characters, while they each have their own personalities, offer very little difference in comparison to each other.Without a doubt, the game's strong point is its combat and its cooperative playstyle--and it gets old--quickly.  The hack 'n slash button mashing is very similar to the Dynasty Warriors style, with combos, shield breaking, knockdowns, executions, etc.  There isn't much combat variation throughout the entire game, and the fun feel you may have when starting to play the game quickly wears off after a multitude of repetitive side quests.  It's always fun to play with a buddy or three, which is what Sacred 3 offers--and is fantastic.  The difficulty scales to the number of players in the game, and while this CERTAINLY makes the game more enjoyable, there is very little synergy between characters, and it leaves you to visualize a bland series of attacks and abilities being randomly used on the map.Another neat addition to the game is the use of ""weapon shards"", which is just another item the player can equip to his or her character--and these shards will add a buff to you and/or your party members, but also offer a debuff.  For example, the Vampire weapon shard gives you the ability to lifesteal on hit against most enemies you will face, with the drawback of making health orbs (health pickups) less effective.  However, these weapon shards, as well as all of the other voices, in Sacred 3, leave most normal people wanting to pull out their hair and throw on music in the background to drown out the INCREDIBLY annoying dialogue.  You are led and directed by a female named Aria, who helps you constantly on your journey--and you often wish she doesn't--as she jokes about every area and situation your party goes into.  Your weapon shards talk back to you, and after every single fight and combo you go through, you are battered with really terrible one-liners by a mage that consistently hits on you, or a vampire that has a ""drinking"" problem (funny, right?  not when you hear it 100 times...in one level), or a dragon that is scared of everything and literally SCREAMS in fear after every fight.While the graphics are extremely beautiful, and the combat can be fun at most times--especially on crazy boss battles--it does NOT make up for the features taken out from the legendary Sacred 1 and 2 games...features that, according to the developers, ""made the game worse"", which is a sorry excuse for laziness and flat-out burglarly using generic propaganda with the word ""Sacred"" in their game title.  If you are expecting Sacred 3 to be a part of the Sacred games you loved so dearly, then STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.  It is NOT that game, unfortunately.  If you go into the game with an open mind, like I did, after reading awful previews and reviews saying this exactly, it can be fun for some hours--and then you can write a disgruntled review like I am, expressing the sadness and anger of being conned by the developers and wishing you had done a little more research before purchasing.  In short, Steam asked me if I recommend this game--Yes or No.  They did not give me a **** NO option, so a simple ""No"" will have to suffice.  Stay away.			"

												First of all, I haven't played Sacred 1 & 2 and somehow I think the developers of this game haven't done that either.Even tho  I like Point-and-Click RPGs as well as Action RPGs alike, this game is just no fun at all. The game is linear, repetitive and annoying. It's fun for like .. 30 Minutes until you grow tired of the same stuff over and over again. The VoiceActors are terrible (at least in the German version of the game) and the jokes are just horrendous. After the first 30 minutes I could not stand Aria (most likely your guide for the game) anymore. For every phrase I would happily punch her in the face.I could write a long review of this game, but most other players already done that I don't really have to add something to that, that hasn't already been said.My conclusion for this game: It's neither a Sacred Sequel nor a good Action RPG / Hack'n'slash whatsoever. Levels are unrewarding, the enemies are repetitive and the fun of collecting loot is plain missing. The bosses don't add anything new to the table as well .. it's just the same strat over and over: dodge -> attack -> dodge -> attackI regret buying this in pre-order.(I will likely give this game another 1 or 2 hours of gameplay as a chance to persuade me that it's not a terrible game, but I have little hope)			"

												Bought this with the illusion it would be like Sacred 1 and 2, fairly decent diablo clone. However, it's not. There is no loot, aside gold, health and energy. Gold is used to buy new skills between levels, health heals you, and energy is used to power your skills. There is 4 classes, 2 male 2 female. I don't understand why in this time and age there can't be 4 classes and they can choose gender. Item upgrades are earned when completing a level, so doing mission A will always give weapon upgrade B. Stupid imo.then its the thing i'm hating the most with the game. It's humor, the game doesn't know wether to take itself seriously or be a joke. And the jokes are so bad i'm actually cringing in my seat as i play it. The voice acting is apalling, or rather its voiced, there is no acting whatsoever in it.			"

												If you are searching for a SINGLE-PLAYER experience and then activate the CO-OP mode when you choose, forget that… Sacred 3 is always in CO-OP mode.First launch, I changed the resolution (yep the game doesn’t even check what your desktop resolution is) (Score -1),I changed also some key (sorry but WASD is not the best option with a AZERTY keyboard, when will the developer learn that QWERTY is not the only keyboard in the world) (Score -0.5)Finally I launch the game, after ~4 minutes a player join my current game… WHAT ? I never said I wanted a CO-OP session right now. (Score -1)It seem the only way to play a semi-single player game is to finish mission 1, quit, reload your save & after that before choosing a mission put the game in invite or friend mode. And after finishing a mission don't forget to change the mode again, as it seem the game reactivate the Public MODE (Score – 2)FINAL SCORE : 0.5/5CONCLUSION :The game is advertised as a SINGLE PLAYER / CO-OP / Multiplier Game, but it seem the developer forgot to put the SINGLE-PLAYER MODE in it.Meaning, don’t buy sacred 3 if you want to try the game in Single Player mode, before playing with your friend in local/internet CO-OP mode.If I could, I would ask for a refund for being lied by a false advertising saying I could player the game in SINGLE-PLAYER MODE.

It's boring couch beat'em up, each character has only few skills (near 2-3 for power attacks and same for weak ones). Equipment drops somethimes in the end of a mission, and your only loot is gold. There is no interesting gameplay or plot and jokes here are written by dumbs for dumbs.			"

												Wow, this game is NOT what I expected. If you've played the previous two parts, be warned that this game does not resemble part 1 and 2. No loot system, awkward user interface, terrible ""funny'' dialogs.This one is all about run and fight, nothing more.If you didn't play the previous games, I guess maybe you can enjoy it.....blindfolded....

												I am not recommending for immediate purchase, but perhaps a future purchase, and here is why:To begin with, I must admit that I was excited when I first heard of the title as I am a fan of the Sacred series. I became a little more skeptical after reading about some of the changes made (no longer open world / no more signifigant variety of loot), but I figured I was up for a new hack and slash experience, and it's Sacred III after all (What could go wrong?). In the end, I am rather more disappointed in that it feels more like a combo-game of Sacred and Dynasty Warriors, in the sense that it is interesting at first, but after a while (3-4 hours) I personally find myself getting bored. Graphics are solid, gameplay is fun, and the comedic charm is a matter of personal perspective as always. However, in the end, I must admit I have little interest in playing through on all the different characters, only becasue it feels like it might be a drag. I tried them all out through the first mission (apparently necessary at this point if you want to take them into the multiplayer feature) just to see which I liked the best, and after picking a favorite have decided to complete the game (whatever that might mean) with this character and then move onto something else.The biggest disappointment for me was how the whole image of competing with others for treasure was hyped (IMHO) and all it seesm to add up to is getting a little more gold / exp and the completion of a mission. I have no trophy display case or homebase to improve with all my glorious and hard-fought loot, rather I get a screen that is like, ""Hey, you killed the most guys, good for you, here is an extra percent to add to the pile.""Now all that said, if there was a signifigant increase to the amount of RPG / Loot /Upgrading side of the equation, whether through a solid patch, or more likely an expansion or DLC, I might consider playing the game further, but for now, I would recommed a purchase only if you are a fan of the Dynasty Warriors type experience, looking for a bit of a time sink, and the game is marked down for sale (think 50% off or more).

												Having had tons of fun in sacred 2 to the point where i rebought it on steam, I can only say I am throughly disappointed. Gone is the open world of the prequels, the nice break away from the main storyline through sidequests. This is simply A long hallway with predetermined mobs and bosses. Granted, it wears sacred's skin, but the substance is almost, if not entirely, gone.			"

												Pros:+Fun, bit challenging gameplay+Colorful graphics+Good variety of heros to play with+Co-opCons:-Money is meaningless in the late game-All of the item's (besides the health potion) are useless are you just forget that you have any.-Story is a bit bland and packed with humor that isn't really funny, more like iritating at some points.-Dlc content is weak. There two new mini-campaing consisting of four missions each. There your typical mission. No new enemy types in there.Then there are two heros offerd like a dlc and a weapon spirit that is just now good.-On the begging I thought that the bosses were actually really well made and you need to use some kind of tactic to get around them. But unfortunetly after few fights you can see I HUGE amounts reskins that were made and you could clearly see that this demonic boar is nearly the same as the ice golem you fought seconds ago.-The constant diaoulog can get very irritating.-Mission structure is very repetetive. The missions are a copy-paste of another mission.-Difficulty spikes-Side-missions and Dlc campaings are making you a bit overpoweredLongevity: 10.7 hoursVerdict: 5/10This isn't a bad game. It's just clearly not developed. As the core gameplay is fun, the missions aren't after a while, which make them a chore to go thru.But I had buckets of fun even alone. Now a very important thing I have to tackle is the game franchise. Sacreed 3 isn't the same genre like Sacred 1&2 BUT it doesn't mean that you HAVE to hate this game just for it's name. Of course I have to agree that the game had really stupid amount of Day One Dlc and the price wasn't the best but this game doesn't deserve such huge amount of hate on steam just for that. And it's completly functional. I have only encountred ONE bug. For me this game was an enjoyable game for the weekend and if you are a fan of brawlers I do recommend buying it.			"

												Please turn the wheel 6 times to continue reading this review....If you are a fan of the Sacred series, just avoid this game entirely as it will likely lead to depression.  While the name of the game is Sacred 3, it really is just a basic hack and slash game similar to the Sacred Citadel title except priced at $50.  If you were hoping for an open world full of quests, loot, and character customization look elsewhere as this has none of that.Should you be able to disregard the name and what Sacred 3 really should have been, you might find some enjoyment here.  However, it is not likely to justify price tag.  I will briefly cover some of the pros/cons of the game.  For reference, I have finished the campaign entirely with the DLC character and have seen all the game really has to offer.PROSSoundtrack - Though it is not amazing and lacks something as epic as Blind Guardian's concert from Sacred 2, the music is fine and has, at times, a dark mood that should fit the game.Stage Art - Some of the stages look good and there is some variety in their look.CONSNo Loot - With the exception of weapon spirits, gold, and health/power orbs, you will find no loot.  Weapons and armor are dropped and upgraded on a set schedule as you finish particular stages.  Sadly, weapon spirits are often not particularly useful with the exception of a few.  I honestly can deal with no open world but no loot is a low blow.Repetitive Gameplay/No Open World - You just enter stages from an overworld map.  Here is what virtually all main stages look like.  Enter -> Fight Group -> Open Gate -> Fight Group -> Dodge Traps/Projectiles -> Fight Group -> Find Key (on enemy or in chest nearby) or turn switch (always 6 times) -> Boss.  Smaller stages will have just 2-3 small groups of enemies or 5 waves in an arena style.  You will probably find yourself fighting the enemies like so Regular Attack -> Bash (when icon appears above enemy) -> Combat Art -> Repeat Until Dead.  If you want to test out the A button on your XBox controller, this will do the trick though.Little Customization - You can select 2-3 combat arts for each of the two slots.  You can upgrade these using gold at set intervals.  Often you have no choice on what upgrade you get.  In other cases, you have two options.  In my experience, the combat arts I got later in the game were not powerful enough to bother with.  I used the same initial ones throughout the game.  The same applies to the weapons.  The later ones were not powerful enough and thus were not used.  After trying a few other characters, the feel is similar with one direct combat art and another that does AoE damage.  If you are looking to create wonderful builds then look elsewhere.Length/Replayability - Even when spending some time repeating levels, I beat the campaign in about 8 hours.  If you played straight through on normal difficulty, I would imagine it could be done in 5 or 6 hours.  The DLC appears to add about an hour to the game.  While you can continue to play the game after the final boss, the incentive is just to level up which, as stated, seems fairly pointless as you do not get much to really make your character better.Technical Glitches - Often I have had the game change resolutions or exit full screen mode for no reason.  I have had it crash several times.  It also has caused a popup saying I lack the memory to continue playing.  I am running the game on a laptop with 8GB of RAM and a 2GB graphics card.  I can run games like Skyrim on max settings and this should not be any more difficult to run.  So it is clearly not optimized and has bugs which may never be fixed.HIT OR MISSDialogue - Honestly, I believe they tried to hard to be funny.  However, some lines and interactions might amuse you.  Overall, it seems forced but it might depend on your sense of humor.In summary, avoid this game like the plague if you want something like Sacred.  You might consider Torchlight 1/2 or Grim Dawn instead.  You could also wait for Unbended (by the original designers of the Sacred series).  Even Diablo 3 is a much better option given it actually has loot.  If you want a mindless button masher, I'd still wait for a price drop as much cheaper titles (such as Castle Crashers) provide just as much in terms of replayability and honestly Deep Silver/Keen Games does not deserve support for what was clearly a quick money grab using the Sacred name.

												Like everyone on here, I too am absolutly gutted with Sacred 3. I even love a basic Hack n Slash from time to time, but Sacred citadel offers more than this. We were all duped by the pre order, as many of us are Sacred fans and we needed part 3. It is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of a much beloved game that hurts so much. I do love steam very much, but on this case they should fight for all of us and get Deep Silver to offer us a refund for being the most expensive con in gaming history. I know if Steam flexed it's might it can happen, as I got a refund from GAME for a fighting game that made claims it was the next Street Fighter. It was not and no fault of GAME, but they stocked it and a little conversation with their Head Office, I was fully compensated and recieved a £25 gift voucher for the inconvenience. Misrepresentation is fraud, so Steam would have a good strong legal case under Consumer Law. Anyway, just avoid this utter delusional title and play SACRED 2 GOLD as it is far superior in every way. If a good corporate shafting is your thing, then this title is for you. -10/10. Disgraceful.			"

												Sacred 3 is more of an ""ALL NEW"" Sacred 3 game and has very little of the orginal game that made Sacred 1 & 2 what they were. If you liked have an open world to explore and not just a fallow the path that you are forced to take kind of game. Then this game is ""NOT FOR YOU"". But if you are looking for more of a Diablo clone. Then this game is for you.The graphics on the PC version are very pleasent to look at and that is about the only good thing I have to say about the game.The interface on the PC needs a lot of work. I've found some very noticiable BUGS that should of be extremely easy to of found during beta testing and fixed before the release. Finding bugs are one of the few things that reminds me of the first two installments in this series. Deep Silver's marketing department really needs to give they heads a shake. Most people don't want to play a Diablo clone, cause their going to buy the real thing and not a clone if that is what they are looking for.Please return Sacred back to it's ROOTs or lose the rest of the fan base that might still be around.I can NOT recommend this game to anyone looking for a Sacred 1 & 2 type game. It's just not recommendable!			"

												Not impressed,looks and feels like a mediocre console port, doesn't behave like a sequel (spiritual or otherwise) to the previous Sacred title(s). While this wouldn't be entirely bad, it's almost a completely different game. If I had to compare it to something, I would compare it to what happened with Dungeon Siege 2 & 3, the latter being re-worked and again, turned into a console port-esq game. While it's not a terrible game, I don't think it merits the price tag and it certainly doesn't follow along the open-world, Sacred 2 style of gameplay. Instead you end up with an instanced game that loses a lot of the depth and customization of it's fore-runners. It's not a bad game per se, but I can't help but feel let down. I really enjoyed Sacred 2 and looked forward to a sequel. If anything, this feels like it should be a seperate, stand-alone game. tl;dr It's not a bad game, but it doesn't feel worth the price tag. If you like this sort of game, you may like it, but if you expect a sequel to Sacred 2 (or the expansion), the gameplay is different, there's less depth and it's no longer open-world.			"

												Sacred 3 is not Sacred or Sacred 2. Its like every aspect of the game has been downgraded or removed. It's not an RPG with an open world where you can run around and complete quests. This is what many people expected and why so many are disappointed. Sacred 3 is an extremely linear Hack'n Slash game with lots of action and (in my opinion) nice graphics. It takes place in Ancaria. That's pretty much all it has in common with its predecessors. Other then the graphics this game is garbage with repetitive gameplay . There is a lack of any synergy between skills, players, and no depth. It is utterly ridiculous and insulting to fans for Deep Silver to serve this♥♥♥♥♥♥up on a silver platter and look at us expectantly as if to say ""well why aren't you eating? isn't this your favorite?Do not purchase!

												Oh my, look like Koch Media GmbH got one over on everyone.  Just think if we all would have taken out our old Atari Gauntlet game and played, we all would have saved money (except for those that lost all those quarters playing the game at 7/11 stores).This is just an updated game of the old Gauntlet game from Atari.***Do not spend the money***Sacred 3 has nothing to with the base Ancaria game story line and as many have already posted, the game has no open world to play in.  Just linier lanes to move around spinning, slicing, dicing, jumping and way out of topic voice over of the in game characters attempting to be funny.  I had to turn it off when the kids walked in and heard a few of the in game comments being said.How could you call this a sequel to the games of the Sacred line. No wonder no more world music bands wanted anything to do with this music score being developed.  Once they saw the game betas, they went running trying to find BLINDFOLDs.But now if you like the old hack'en & slash game, with no real story line, jump online and find a few people to waddle away some time with nothing to do, spend the $50.00 and buy then game and waddle the time away.How dare they call this a Role Playing Game (RPG).

												UPDATE: You may want to search around and find out what happened to the devs of Sacred 1 & 2. Even if you don't care about those earlier titles. It's has nothing to do with the gameplay and as such I won't change my review. But Deep Silver (who the devs lost the franchise to) is now on my blacklist for being real life vilains.I enjoy this game, had it a different title to ease minds and a 20$ price tag I'd recommend it as is.Yes the levels are really linear but I wouldn't call them boring, they challenge you in a variety of ways that will have you adapt your gameplay. The options you get aren't that limited as many make it sounds. The cut-scenes are well-polished, the dialogues are funny, I like the different characters (heroes and vilains alike) and they are supported by a more-than-decent voice acting.About the franchise: I don't care much. I played the 1st and 2nd titles as time wasters while waiting for game able to outshine D2 (or at least come close). You probably know that already by now (everyone seems to be mad about it), Sacred 3 is a very different game. But it has nothing to do with the fact I do not recommend it. However, if it bothers you, well, that's another reason why you should stay away from it.To me the root of the problem is that it wasn't meant to be played on PC, it's a really poor port of what seem to be a good console game. From the settings to the controls it really doesn't fit (yet). Some examples:- It's easy to lose sight of your cursor and on high difficulty it often means insta death. It wouldn't have been hard to design one that is easier to spot.- Pressing space to dodge (if you still use dodge that is, you should get block) will have your character rolling toward your cursor even if you were moving in the opposite direction. It's very unintuitive. That also could easily be fixed.- Limited options due to the initial target (console).- Zero way to use the keyboard to chat, you'll have to use the in game voice over IP that everyone mutes so it won't be much use. Unless you playing with friends using skype, TS, ... you won't be able to say anything to your ""co-op"" partners.On that last note, I wouldn't call it a co-op game. Multiplayer? Check. PvE? Check. Cooperation? Very little. It doesn't mean it's not fun to play with others, but you do not need to cooperate.TL;DR: Different from Sacred 1 & 2. Good casual arcade time waster that can even be a bit challenging at times. Poor PC adaptation. Way too expensive for what it is.			"

To me it looks like unfinished game and it's definately not worth the 50 euro they're asking for it.After 7 hours of gameplay i got really bored. Poor design of levels, you're very very limited in where to go. Poor leveling system (if you have expcted some points to be spent to better your character ? well forget about it). Story just doesn't deserve to be even commented.It's like 180 degree turn away from what Sacred and Sacred 2 where in terms of gameplay/levels/design.			"

												I came in to this game expecting more along the lines of Sacred 1 and 2. I watched the intro movie, it seemed similar as well. Stupidly enough, i did not watch any reviews before getting the game. The two things I loved about sacred were the open world, where one could go whereever one wished, and the equipment. There's something gratifying about finding that new special weapon, or upgrading it just so.Then there's Sacred 3.  Linear storyline. No open world. You are driven from room to room in ""mission"" like episodes instead of picking up a bunch of quests and picking and choosing. There is no loot. None. Nothing. Zilch.The weapon upgrades you can get are once every 4 levels from what i gather.The hack and slash is still there, the combat is fun, but this is not Sacred. Sure, you can pick from the original classes (still no gender choice of course), You play in Ancara, and the battleskills are still there. But this is not the game i thought i bought.The story so far seems... an odd mix between an attempt at comedy and a tacky storyline. I might play on, I'm not sure on that yet, just to see how it continues, but so far? This is not Sacred 3. This should bear a title like Heroes of Sacred, or some such alternatively named game, to indicate it deviated from the original that much.On a whole, severely disappointed with what i thought would be an awesome title.

												This game received almost nothing but hate from the community and critics didn't like it as well. I get why fans of the series hated it, because it had nothing to do with the first two games and they felt betrayed. But maybe because i had not been a fan of the original series, that fact didn't bother me much. From graphics to presentation (i love the intro) to controls Sacred 3 is a very solid product. In a way pretty much the opposite of it's often clunky and buggy predecessors. There's nothing really original about the game, but i had fun playing it both in single and multiplayer mode and would it have been released under a different name the reviews would have looked a lot different.

												Having played Sacred 1 and 2, this seems to be almost nothing like those two games.  They got rid of most customization and loot.  It is like the developers forgot that people like getting loot.  It is the reason games like Diablo and Borderlands do so well.  The storyline seems almost non-existant and most of the time when there is story you just wish the people would shut up so that you can deal with the inevitable threat that is showing up while your character is in it's cutscene talking.  The graphics are nice I guess, but for how much space the game takes I honestly expected better.  My advice would be to a game like Guantlet.  Gameplay and graphics are similar but you feel like you get a little more reward for your effort and the game costs about half what Sacred 3 does.			"

If this product were called something else, like ""Hack 'n Slash Xtreme!"", it might have been good, but using the amazing sacred franchise and recreating it from the ground up to make this game was a terrible idea. They're trying and failing to draw in new audiences to the franchise while keeping their previous players.Do NOT recommend this game.			"

												Sacred 3 doesn't really belong to the Sacred series, which isn't the problem I'm having with the game. The game is interesting, seems like it'll have some fun aspects, however, the screen is jittery and there can be a lot of slowdown. Within the first level I already encountered a crash, constant slowdown on a rig that can play Crysis 3 at full spec, and a lot of jittery movement. I also encountered quite a few glitches, including an achievement popping and then promptly bugging out. I'll continue to play through the levels and I'll even come back and add to this review, but at the moment, the game needs some work. Unacceptable.			"

												Havent been this disappointed in a game, in so damn long. The game poses absolutely no replay value, the characters are sleezy and run out of things to say very quickly, may make you smirk at some stages, 1/5. Story isnt that great over all... about 2/5 for the story. As for combat, very damn limited. you can roll or block, attack and use offensive skills. thats a bout it. if you are not playing on the hardest difficulty, most of the enemies dont even pose a threat, seriously the game is very damn easy 2/5 on combat. after you finish a mission, you get presented with your character, that image, is so damn ugly, that you wont even recognise the character that you picked. Its as if they didnt even bother creating a seperate image for that matter. Over all, game is not worth the money i payed for it. Liniar as hell, not complete (many bugs), and once youve done one mission, you have done them all, just have to complete them over and over and over again. kill this, turn that, survive this, go there. done.

												Any fan of the Sacred series should not even bother entertaining the thought of purchasing this game! It will honestly make you want to cry.  The only thing it has in common with the original games is that it's the same world.  It is ~not~ an RPG.  It's a linear hack and slash.... thing.... The voice acting is horrible and the humour that came hand in hand with the Sacred we know and love has been replaced with a shoddy attempt at what could be..maybe... considered humour.  Just trust me and make yourself believe that Sacred 2 was the last game and that this one does not exist.			"

It doesn'y follow Sacred and Sacred 2 game formula (which is what made them both so strong) at all. It is an entirely different formula, that just doesn't work.So many reviewers have already spelled it out, repetitive, cheap, they really relied on the name of the game to make a buck, and sacrificed the quality of the franchise to do it.

												First 10 minutes of the game were quite promising, but once I finished the first mission, I realized how primitive the game is. First of all, everyone expected the game to have open world which is not. There are no variation to what you can do. The only thing available to you is to kill rather boring single-pattern monsters (melee, range, block... duh!..). If you buy the game for 30$ remember it's a waste. I recommend you to steal the game if you ever wanted to check this out. They ruined the Sacred series, but I'll finish the game if I'll get really bored, because the campaign doesn't seem storyless. The real price of the game is no more than 7,5$, so you should wait for at least 75% discount.			"

												how to make this game worse? i dont see any possibilities.the campaign is way to short. the ""video"" sequencies are just crappy painted pictures with some sub text. with an attack on left, one counterattack on right mousebutton and 2 special attacks(a 3rd for koop) you have to fight a waste multitude of about 5 monsterclasses + some not very challenging boss mobs. when you are done with your campaign and want to do the next difficulty you cant see which maps you have cleared on that, cause all are visited from mode before. Your weapon spirit gives you for every killstreak a comment, that stays the same. all the time. and in a hack'n'slay...well you probably know, how often that happens. good and evil-well of cause you fight for the good, no other option here-give every waypoint some ridiculous play of words or comment, that isnt even near funny. the maps are even more linear than the story itself. a look at skills and equips: you have 3 weapons to choose from that differ a bit in crit or damage, that can be leveled up and refined a bit - with 2 choices on its way, same is for skills and armor. armor you only have one. skillset is 3 for each mousebutton. 2 for evade/block move. you cant customize your char. no personalization. i dont think, that i can find a positive point at this game. it is not published by Ascaron, but deepsilver. maybe that is the problem. even in a F2P game like kingsroad you find better maps, more variations, a longer campaign.my opinion: this game isnt worth to be called Sacred, nor the dollars it costs, nor the time(that was short enough).

												jeez, this is probably the worst game i've ever played, it beat Dynasty warrior and i truly dislike the saga...I've played sacred 2 countless times and i was HOPING for something similar...Do yourself a favour, dont waste money on this, go eat a pizza instead.			"

												Well ... What can I say about Sacred 3, bought this game to play with my girlfriend, who was a huge fan of Sacred 2. Within 5 minutes of starting the game, we both looked at the screen, wondering what was going on, the first 2 missions were enough for us to drop the game all at once.+ Graphics aren't too bad, although the HUD is annoying+ Controls aren't too aweful either, though different from other games within the same genreGame Breaking CON- voice acting is terrible- lines are what seem to be, dialogues written by pre-teens- seriously, the game is ruined by the spectre (or w/e) yelling ""sexy pants!"" and ""baby cake!"" the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time, not to mention the constant ""yea, threeway!""If you want a game like this to play with your friends, try Diablo or Sacred 2 .. this game is rubbish.

												Sacred 3....has nothing to do with the old Sacred games but the name... just terrible piece of S H I T...the only good that this game has to offer are okay graphics and good arcade controls... and that´s it.... buy this game only if you get this for a couple of cents... also this game has no loot, no inventory.... and you advance to a new section that is blocked, and you can advance forward when you have killed all the enemies... and... the voice acting is horrible and the damn weapon spirit keeps driving me insane with his ""sexyyyyy, that´s hot"" comments....WHAT THE HECK????!!!!!..... just S H I T in a barrel...PS...about 5 to 15 minutes gametime and you already know how terrible this game is...

												i bought this cause i have played sacred 1 and i loved sacred 1 but they have really messed up here. It's no longer open world, you don't have the equipment change, simplified skill setup and all in all just a really crappy system. it's become more of a Diablo type game wich would be fine if this was the only one with that game style but as far as this play style goes this game sucks. also whoever wrote the dialouge should never be near another game again i was a dark demon kind character that sounded like a grease monkey from the 60's. all in all it just sucked, i'm really really dissapointed. so if you liked sacred 1 stick to it cause this was not worth it			"

												Some girl telling me what to do every 5 seconds, cringy phrases, characters that say same freaking thing every 2nd killed enemy makes this game unpleasant to play. Controls, camera, ui is on another level, like a level bellow that competitors of same game genre offer. Although visual style is very nice and some levels look very well made. More likely to recommend diablo 3 or torchlight than this one.			"

												It is a great game! It looks awesome and plays awesome. A linear corridor slasher that looks like it has been ported from console.The only sad thing it is called ""Sacred 3"". Marketing ruined it all. If it name was something like ""Sacred : Linear Slasher"" it would receive much less negative reviews, I believe. Because damn, Sacred once was a LEGEND of a game that has uber-giant world and is non-linear as diablo-clone can be. Now it is even no longer a diablo clone. It is called ""Sacred"" by a mistake and called ""RPG"" by a mistake.Everything else is excellent! I love this game.			"

												This game game basically didn't do what Sacred 2 did very well. Awesome progression system; A lot of customizable skills; Looting; Open world; Loads and loads of quests;Mounts;Decent story.If you're looking for above mentioned experience go look up Sacred 2. If you're looking for a very casual hack and slash game with very little progression system without all the above mentioned traits, buy Sacred 3.I think a lot of (die hard) Sacred 1 and 2 fans were very excited when the Sacred 3 was announced but were very disappointed when it was finally released. I am one of those disappointed fans...			"

												This game... what can I say, has put me off from ever pre-ordering again. This is a huge letdown for this IP, the previous titles were great and now they created this monstrosity for which they dare asking 50 Euro, for 5 Euro I could see the value since you will be able to get a few hours of mindless buttonbashing with some friends but anything over 5 Euro is just too much. Not to mention the fact that from day 1 selling dlc's means you are effectively selling half a game from day 1 onwards. This company is now blacklisted for me as they clearly give a rats about their actual customers and only the depths of their pockets matter. It is a shame that with the comfort of digital copies we are no longer safe from these legal scams as returning is no longer an option.I advise everyone to never ever buy this game for more than 5 Euro and even then you may feel like you paid too much. Way to kill an IP.			"

I didn't play long enough to really start upgrading my characters, but I didn't like combat enough to upgrade any of them.

												The lack of being ble to move by clicking on an empty space: being FORCED to move by pressing WASD, usually in combo as the screen isn't left-right-up-down, but AW, or WD, ect, makes this game unplayable. This appears to be a port, with little, to no changes, from a counsol system. This my be playable if you get ax XBOX controller. But way to anoing otherwise. Such a shame, I loved Sacred and Sacred 2. This is like Dungeon Siege and Dungeon Siege 2, both great games, but Dungeon Siege 3 was awfull. Sacred 3 is WORSE than Dungeon Siege 3, at least it was playable. Do NOT get this game / disaster. The voice acting is painfull / degrading to be force to listen to.			"

												First off i cannot describe the utter sense of dissapointment i felt on august 1. The 30 gig install went smooth, i was looking forward so much to play sacred 3, a game I imagined to be much more enjoyable and with more depth than diablo 3. When i started i was already baffled at the char selection. You simply select 1 person, no name change, no customization, NOTHING. It felt like chosing a fighter in streetfighter 2.From then on the game went on, linear hack and slash, braindead button mashing without any thought into it.The voice over is terrible and the attempted humor is so sad its worse than a so called hollywood *parody*.I have stuck in there and played on, to see if any shred of the old game returns later on, sadly i have to say about halfway into the game (after a measly few hours), nothing changes, the bosses dont get any better. Sacred 3 - Worst game i have EVER played, mostly because it should have been this other game..If refunds were possible, this would be top of my list to get my money back on.			"

												I enjoyed the mindless hours of playing Sacred 1 and Sacred 2. I pre-ordered this game expecting the same. However, within the first few minutes of trying to cope with the console controler oriented control system with mouse and keyboard I knew I had made a mistake in purchasing this game. But it was when I reached the first Boss and my character remained comatose due to the creatures stun attacks that I realized I had waisted my money.My advice... do not buy this game. If you do really want to give it a try, wait until it makes it into the Steam under $10 or even better the $5 section.			"

												LOAD OF S.H.I.T! THIS IS NOT SACRED GAME ANY MORE....I'm really disappointed in this game.A few months ago, I pre-ordered X Rebirth on steam, and received a console-recycled, bug-ridden, unplayble mess. I promised myself that I would never buy a game again without waiting for reviews.But I was fooled again, blinded by the pre-order bonuses of Sacred 3, and the fond memories I had of S1 & S2. S3 is pretty, but that's it. The controls are clearly made for a console. On PC, you move your character with WASD, and you have only 4 attacks/skills (2 on mouse, keys 1 and 2). You evade with space, but have no control on it's direction. Lot's of destructible elements, but you'll often have to strike 3 times before one of your swings actually hit what's right in front of you. All of that make for clumsy control of your character on PC.Don't expect much of character personnalisation, either. There is no cosmetic or gender choices to make, and only 8 skills per class.There's also a ever-present comedic routine, fun for the first 10 minutes, but it gets old very fast. But the one thing I can't forgive, is that there's no loot. Sacred 3 is a Hack&Slash without loot.Imagine Diablo 3 without items, choice of weapons, dumbed down controls and with only a handful of skills. Would you like to play it?TL,DR: Never, ever buy a game right when it's release, and Sacred 3 is a fraud for using the Sacred licence.			"

												Yes yes this is not Sacred, they shouldn't have named it Sacred 3 but find a spin-off name like Sacred Citadel. But does that make it a bad game ? No.It was fun, except for the terrible writing, humor and mostly bad voice acting ( I only liked one of the villains, Zep'Tik ). It lasted for longer than I thought, it was a bit challenging, but not too much on normal difficulty, and the gameplay is simple but doesn't get boring.Environments are nicely done and have a lot of variety, sound design is good, music is not memorable but not boring either. Take it on sale if you want to spend some hours bashing monsters alone or with your friends.For a game made by a small team it has a really good quality in terms of gameplay and visuals. Too bad the humor and voices are so bad.			"

												My girlfriend and I are enjoying this game very much. However, we haven't played the previous Sacred titles as most of the bad reviewers have. It plays very much like Gauntlet. It's a linear hack 'n' slash. You can level up your character with the XP and gold you collect in each mission. Sadly, in offline co-op, the second character will NOT BE SAVED. Every time we start the game, the second character needs to be created from scratch - at least it starts with the same XP and gold of the first player. But how hard can it be to save some character data?Still very enjoyable if you get it on sale.			"

												I did not expect a follow-up to Sacred 2 like many others did. I started playing this game with an open mind and I did like the visuals, the UI/UX and the narration. The game really looks like it was designed for consoles mainly but I had no problem with that since I was playing it with a DS4 controller. Unfortunately, the game basically does not allow proper couch co-op (if you're playing in front of 1 PC with 2 controllers) since second player won't be able to save his progress and assign his skills. This essentially made the game worthless for me because I was going to play it with my friend locally.			"

												As I started the game, i was amazed by the brilliant graphics and the three teasers in the menu and couldnt wait to play.Just to find myself disappointed merely seconds later by just EVERYTHING: The storytelling is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the narator sounds boring and even annoying by desperately trying to be funny. The great atmosphere set up by the images is ruined by too flashy texts and the queaky teenage voice of Aria makes you wanna strangle her, why is she even there?Can't I explore the world on my own, without an annoying girl wathing my every step?The grave setting of great pictures is totally drawn into ridiculousness, and the streetfighter-like ingame display completely prevents you from sinking into this world.The RPG part is not even there, I mean why would you choose from 5 protagonists when after all you have no chance to evolve your own character ingame? There is NO point in leveling up, you dont get to pick any new skill and there is NO way to equip your character. Not to mention that the combat system can be quite annoying for those who played Hack&Slash before.So please, do not buy this game just because you liked Sacred&Sacred2 (or other H&Ss)			"

												Unfortunately, I bought this game prior to reading any reviews of it. I bought it mainly because I loved the previous versions of the games called ""Sacred"". I don't understand how the folks who created this game had the gall to call this ""Sacred 3"", since it has no relation to the previous games. It plays nothing like its namesakes, its controls are unwieldy, it has a cookie-cutter, uninteresting premise, and it's just plain not fun to play. Sadly, it was a complete waste of money. Avoid at all cost.			"

												Can't believe I played this game longer than 9 hours straight. Nothing compared to the first and second sacred parts which were amazing. Sacred was an open world rpg with more than 800+ missions and tons of extra options for your characters.This game however is the std that waits around the corner in a club. What I mean is, once you buy it, you can't get rid of it. This STD of a game will linger in my library forever and probably infect other games.DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!! Thx Obama			"

The negative reviews are mostly due to sacred fanboys but honestly, if you like dungeon crawlers/hack and slash games and fun coop games? Buy it you will love it ! (it is a little short though - took around 7 hours to finish) But I would not recommend this for the full price.			"

												You ever purchased a game and within the first five minutes of playing, thought oh, god, what have I done?  Have I ever wasted my money on a worse game?  Probably, yes, but at the moment, nothing's coming to mind.  It's got some vaguely redeemable features but it's lost in the pure crap that is the plot and the dialogue and the gameplay just simply isn't good enough when nobody in the game will shut up (if you thought the things the characters in Sacred 2 had to say were dumb, wait until you meet the telepathic idiot who directs your every move in this one... or hell, just sit through the first video with all the characters in it) and everything that comes out of their mouths convinces me that this game was written by a teenager who thinks he's the wittiest thing ever because none of his small circle of friends has the heart to tell him he's annoying as ♥♥♥♥.  It's like this game took everything that was even slightly redeemable about Sacred 2 and tossed it out the window, then ramped up the content on everything that wasn't.			"

It reminds me too much of Diablo, and I like Diablo but they have changed the game heaps, I miss Sacred 1 and 2's combat style and freedom to roam where ever you want. Everything is in stages now, and you don't even have an actual inventory to open up within the game, everything is done after each stage or round. I miss sacred 2, it was a great game. Might have to go back and play it just to forget what they have done here. It's not a bad game but it's not what I expected from them nor what I wanted, and so for that I will give it a bad rating.

												This game isn't bad so long as you have no expectations of the third Sacred game being like the first and second installations.  They should've just given it a different name.  If they wanted to tie it into Ancaria, then yeah, go ahead - but it doesn't have to be called ""Sacred"".  I can't really recommend it because it basically doesn't really follow the series.  I'll still play it, but to be honest, I wouldn't have pre-ordered it if I knew it wasn't going to be like the last two installments (which I loved).  I might've checked it out, and maybe waited for it to go on sale or something.The game itself isn't bad graphics wise but I'm not a fan of the keyboard turning.  I might continue to play it, but I'm honestly just confused as this isn't really the game I expected.  It is odd to switch genres in a series this way.  If you have no expectations of this game being remotely like Sacred 1 & 2, then wait for the game to go on sale and buy it.  If you're a fan of the series and expect this to be an upgraded, fancier installment that mirrors the last two games, then don't buy this game.			"

And that Keen Games are the new developers...They seem to have taken the name Sacred and plastered it onto some crappy cheap (if not ""free"") android arcade hack and slash... and are charging as if its an actual FULL game.I played the first level and thats all I needed to know, this is not sacred, and it never will be unless the developers pull the game, demolish it, start again and add some ACTUAL SACRED GAMEPLAY into it aka...

												This is a game that certainly shows it wasn't made by the original development team or it was heavily controlled by another team alltogether. The cringe worthy banter between your weapon spirit,the npcs etc etc its like a really bad B-movie was merged with a even worse 1980's action fantasy movie's dialoge that skipped from straight to video to a syfy special that failed to meet sharknado standards of quality pasted overtop of Gauntlet style game play (I was honestly looking for the timer on the top of the screen that told me how much time i had before I died)This game really shouldn't be called sacred at all. Gone are the robust character options,gone is the open world gone is the normal humor. (yes I am glad I picked this up on winter sale because I would not even recomend that people who I extremly dislike (like my ex-wife) even buy this at its full price)but for what it is. this game does have some charm (if charm is forcing myself to drink enough to forget that this is a sacred title) but the gauntlet style game play does work if I am looking for a mindless twin stick style adventure romp.

 Sacred 3 This is a fun hack and slash, action, rpg type game. So far what I have played of the game is fun, and I am really enjoying it. The bosses are tough, but once you learn a good strategy they are not so bad. After you complete the first big boss you can spend your gold and upgrade your weapons and abilitys, but so far during a mission I have not been able to spend my gold only at the beginning of a mission, I have found that I can.The game is not perfect and is very playable, and it plays great with the Xbox controller with no issues that I have found so far. All I can really say about this game, is if you enjoy hack and slash type games similiar to Torchlight, then you should enjoy this game as well.


This is your checkpoint.

I dont understand why there is so many negative reviews, because I dont have an issue with this game at all.Price wise at 75% off sale price at the moment its a steal, but I do recomend getting the "" Sacred 3 GOLD edition"" as you will get all the dlc's included, so watch out for this if you decide to purchase this game.

												As a hack and slash game it's okay - but it never should have been called Sacred 3 - it has very little in common with Sacred or Sacred 2.   Those are open world games that let you make your character what you want.  This is a very linear direct path game that forces you to go down a certian path.    The only reason I don't recommend this - is it's nothing like the first two Sacred games.   On it's own with a different name I probalby would have said buy it for some quick hack and slash fun.			"

												I usualy do not write reviews. But I just felt obligated to write a few words about this game.Sacred 1+2 Was both fun and good games. Comparable to titles like e.g. Diablo and the free to play game Path of exile. Not as great, but good fun and worth playing. Well... I can't say the same about this game, exept, Sacred 3 it is not. I can not with good conscience recommend this game to anyone. And if you should buy it, prepare to be disappointed. Pure Hack'n'Slash, no open world, and no loot what so ever. In other words, they have taken the things that makes these games fun to play, and left it with something that feels hollow and boring. Save your money for something else guys.Now if you will have me excused. Im going to find a hammer, so I can hit myself on my head, for buying this game without reading a review first... Hmm maybe I'll get lucky and drop some loot.			"

												I didn't play Sacred 1 & 2 yet, so unlike many other reviews, I'm not comparing it to the previous titles (as I understand it's not made by the same company anyway, someone bought the rights). My judgement here is based purely on the games own merrit. The game has good graphics, controls and general gameplay are O.k. but nothing special (except the evade command, it throws you in totally random directions and as such is quite terrible). I also would say the voice acting isn't bad... but the actual scripts the voice actors had to read are REALLY REALLY bad. I feel sorry for them. Whoewer wrote the scripts has no idea what a fantasy RPG entails. It's simply terrible. You defeat some enemys and as you pick up loot you hear stuff like (and I quote) ''Sexy!'' or ''O baby!'' or ''Feels good!''. There is also no atmosphere in the game worth mentioning.If you want to even remotely enjoy the game, turn the character voices OFF! You also might want to considder turning off the games music and using your own for better atmosphere.After I turned the voice acting and music volume OFF and used a atmospheric black metal compilation to give it some dark atmosphere, the game was MUCH more anjoyable. That said, I would never recommend it for the current regular price of 14 Eur. The game is very linear, very repeatitive and feels in some ways like a cheap mobile game. Personally I bought a hard copy for 3 Eur and I still at times feel it wasn't woth it - for me. Buy only if you're O.k. with using your own music as you play.FINAL VERDICT: 3/10 (or if you follow my suggestion for better ambience: 5/10).p.s.: if you have a limited budget and want a good but cheap action-RPG, try Path of Exile (free to play) or buy Victor Vran when on sale. Judging by the reviews, the older Sacred titles are most probably a much better pick as well, specially when on sale).			"

												This game basically leeched off the Sacred franchise name and wrote their own console hack n'slash game. If you are looking for a follow-on to Sacred 1 or 2, this is not it. The graphics are pretty, the gameplay mechanic is simplistic. As stated in the game's forums on Steam, it's not worth $50. Oh how I wish I could return Steam games :(			"

												I would absolutely advise against this game, especially if you've played EITHER of the first two. This game is not Sacred. It just isn't. It's some crap hack'n'slash game that doesn't look, feel or play like any of the Sacred games. It's not the same style, it doesn't even feel like it's the same world. The game isn't just different, it's also bad. The combat is literally spamming a button until a big enemy spawns, then using an ability, then returning to the same routine. Bosses are scaled to seem incredibly difficult but they also all have their own built in routines, stand back and dodge everything the boss throws at you for the first run of the fight and then you know exactly how to fight him, without even being close to being hit. I was excited about Sacred 3 as soon as I heard it was coming and now that it's out it has no similarities with the original. I wouldn't be so annoyed if they had just called it something other than Sacred, as it stands this does not fit into the ""trilogy"" if you even want to acknlowledge this as being part of the Sacred series.

												Hello,I do not give negative reviews ( I try to make do with what I have), but this game... is running at 7 FPS instantly (from the menu). There is no fix from the developer or any warning that this might happen. I suspect its from the nvidia physx. If you found a fix please tell me! It's sad to give a bad review just because the game is running bad (for some people) because I might have enjoyed the gameplay. Now I have to waste time trying to fix your game (yes you developer!) and write down this review. This propblem is known from the launch of the game and guess what, its been 2 years and nobody did anything about this. ( if you could confirm its the physx then add a f******* disable button ingame )Things I have tried:-installing older/new nvdia physx drivers;-running in compatability mode both game and steam;-disabling/enabling Vsync;-checking game files integrity;-lowering resolution to 720p to both desktop and game (windowed/fulscreen).PC specs:FX 8150 @ 4.2 GhzAMD R9 Fury12 GB DDR 3 1866			"

												NOTE: This game specifically is the reason I do NOT pre-order games anymore.Yes, I have not spent much time on this game, but cannot stomach playing a game that is not an RPG as I had believed going by the trend of the first two Sacred games. I did finally almost reach an hour...If you enjoyed Sacred 1 & 2 and expect the same type of game play from this game, do NOT buy this game.If you enjoy arcade hack and slash and clicking the button on your mouse or control thousands of times over and over killing the same lookalike enemies. Then you might enjoy this game.This game has no depth, it is a very shallow game. The voice overs and jokes are atrocious in the least. The jokes are not funny, but just ignorant. The price on this game WILL drop, wait till then to try it. With the backlash this game has recieved over butchering the series, it will have to drop it's prices to get any buyers.			"

Product received for free
												First and foremost mistake the developers / publishers / copyright people / w/e have done is called it Sacred. Their second mistake was naming it 3. Period.Does it have any other flaws - sure. Are they that severe the game deserve this appauling rating - NO!Being an oldtime fan of the series - I took a lot of time gawking at the world of ... (forgot the name, sorry) in Sacred One. I kinda played Sacred 2, but I don't remember it properly.Now we have Sacred 3. Why 3? No clue. I bet the game'd've gotten a wave of more positive reviews had it been smth like ""Sacred an ARPG story"" ""Sacred Haxxxorz r3v3ng3"". That way people who really care about the franchise would not get really p/o at getting a very different game from what they've expected.Now, is it a good game? Yup, definitely it is. You will play it for like 10-15 hours (get a couple of buds - much more fun this way!) of fun relaxed gameplay and get a few laughs (for some, myself included, their humor is on the sillyish side really), move on to the next title, no biggie. You will get experience comparative with the much warmerly welcomed and appraised titles (Victor Vran... ahem).			"

												Not quite the game I expected, but still quite fun.  I admit I haven't played the first 2 Sacred's, which is probabaly why I am giving this game a recommend.  From what I hear the first 2 were open world Diablo like Hack and slash games.  Sacred 3, they changed the game to being a more arcade type hack and slash game, similar to Gauntlet.Some of the games design doesn't make much sense.  Its an arcade style game, where as you kill the enemy, they will drop HP and action type regen potions?  The action is quite outlandish for an RPG styled game, where you get skills that make you jump across the screen and butt flop on the enemy to kill them.   Instead of an open world styled game like Torchlight or Diablo, instead you are put into on the rails played short missions, usually ending with a boss of some kind to finish the mission.  The game does allow for Co-op play, which seems easy enough to get a game, but you must finish your first mission (The hardest one I found so far in the game), before it will allow you to play in Co-op, which may leave some players behind.Unlike other games, where there are loot drops, or you earn gold in the game to spend on gear, you pick up gold, but at the end of the round, all that gold disappears (???) no idea why, and you get a seemingly static amount of gold for finishing the mission.  You can then use that gold given to you in the end to upgrade your skills and weapons, but there are no skill trees or really anything in terms of different equipment to save for.  And the skill and equipment upgrades are limited to level unlocks.    The characters in the game also dish out tons of badly voice acted one liners, similar to Duke Nukem, but not as good.  I have played 2 male characters so far, and both are constantly hitting on the female ""narrator"" in the game, with really cheesy pickup lines, topped with super bad voice acting that kills the humour. All the bad being said.  The game does have a AAA title type polish to it, and plays well.  Just don't expect the next Diablo/Torchlight/Van Helsing.			"

												Sacred 3 is a very good game. It's a beat-em-up brawler similar to Gauntlet just better, although that's probably a matter of taste. The only thing this game is not is Sacred.I am not aware of any other game on Steam that received as many negative ratings as Sacred 3 has. The reason for this are unfulfilled expectations. That's because Sacred 3 has nothing to do with Sacred 1 or Sacred 2. The game is neither an open-world game nor a role-playing game and the only thing Sacred 1 and Sacred 2 share with Sacred 3 is the name. If you can accept that and you like hack and slay games Sacred 3 is a very enjoyable game.Pros:- nice graphics, beautiful landscapes- character specific weapons, armor, special attacks- weapon upgrades- armor upgrades- special attacks (upgradeable)- 15 diversified levels in the main game- good DLCs- good music- co-op- multi-player, lobbies are currently full (October 2015)- co-op in combination with multi-player (two co-op, two mp)- you only collect gold (which keeps you from searching for scrolls and any other hidden stuff)- very easy to join games- you can join or leave games at any time- four difficulty levels (last difficulty is accessible after first play-through)Cons:- it's not Sacred- leveling up can get tiresome. Once you reached level 30 it takes a lot of time and fighting to collect the necessary experience points to level up further.There are dissent opinions about the dialogs in the game. Please take into considerations that the game supports different languages with different translations and speakers. During your journey you are accompanied by Aria, a telepathic, informing you about upcoming events, enemies dangers, areas, etc. She keeps talking all the time and at least in German her voice acting is great. Then you can select a god that inhabits your weapon, providing some special abilities. The selected god keeps talking too. The gods talking strongly reflect their diverse personalities and they tend to exaggerate.Dialogs are often childish with a strong use of youth slang. They tend to not take the game seriously and are very grotesque. It's the grotesqueness that makes the dialogs funny again, provided you have the right sense of humor.I like them, especially Aria is great in German.			"

And worst of all, the game has linear levels with some obnoxios character constantly making cheesy remarks about everything. It's supposed to be funny, I guess, but it's just infuriating.If you haven't figured it out yet, the game is nothing like Sacred 1&2. Don't buy it if you are fan of the series!Anyway, regardless of being a part of Sacred series it's just a bad game. But the fact that it's a sequel to acclaimed franchise makes it even worse.Btw, if you are looking for a good action-RPG, check out Victor Vran. It is very similar to Sacred 3, but is much better in every aspect.			"

												Frankly speaking I don't understand the negative reviews on this game. I think it is a good isometric hack-and-slash game. It is not in the ligue of top games like Sacred 2 Fallen Angel used to be. Rather it should be compared to such games as Bastion or Lara Croft The Guardian Light. If positioned, priced and named correctly The Sacred 3 would be a great game. Still it is a good game. Fun to play it with an Xbox Controller. Don't be fooled with overwelmingly negative reviews. It can bring a lot of fun. It is just not a classic Action RPG.			"

												I enjoyed Sacred 2, which was the first game of this series I played, so I was curious about this game, having picked it up recently in a bundle package.  I finally installed it hoping that it might have some sort of semblance to the game that I had played a number of years ago... I suppose that idea was dashed within moments of starting the game.  Instead of a semi-open world it has been changed into a series of select a location, fight through the enemy lines, rinse and repeat.  There is no replayability as you just do the same thing over and over and over again through the course of the game, finish an area, get an award screen and maybe a level up, start the next scene, get an uninspiring introduction voice over.  There is no longer a loot system, just pick up gold that you use to unlock new inventory items that are gained through level unlock... if the boss is too hard, just go back a section and grind it a few times...  I slogged through ten levels of character development and don't ever plan on looking at this again as there are much better wastes of my time.			"

												A linear and boring third-person hack-and-slash with a very simple levelling and skill system.I haven't played the previous Sacred games extensively so I'm not particularly upset about the genre switch, even though I consider it generally in poor taste to switch genres in a series. But regardless of this, Sacred 3 is a bad game.- Bad writing: The story is the classic ""save the world from evil"", the script makes big use of memes and teenager/twitter speak- Bad voice acting: Voices do not correspond to the characters nor to the situations- Linear level design: Levels are just long tubes with a small dead end here and there- Boring gameplay loop: The game goes in the direction of 3rd-person hack-and-slashes like Devil May Cry but it's missing the exploration, combos and flashiness of the better games in the genre.My review is based on something over an hour of playing this. I can't be bothered to play it anymore. The skill trees are quite deep and go up to cca level 40, but there are much better games to spend my time on.Not recommended.			"

												Sacred 3 is not perfect, but it's enjoyable enough for me to recommend it.Bear in mind that this game is an isometric brawler and very different in style from the previous two main chapter of the Sacred series. With that out of the way, I'll try and judge it on its own merits.I finished the main campaign, the two DLC areas and the secondary missions in little more than 12 hours. I took some time to grab a couple achievements and explored most levels to find hidden chests, so a straight playthrough of the main campaign will be a few hours shorter. However, the variety of classes and the scaling difficulty (difficulty 4/4 is unlocked when you beat the game, so it works as a New Game +) make the game interesting to replay.Story is pretty straightforward: defeat the evil boss and all his henchmen. For the same reason, the setting isn't really that interesting, story-wise, as it only works as a selection of different setpieces where action takes place.The humour is very hit and miss: I didn't enjoy cutscenes that much, but I appreciate that every character has specific voice-acted lines to reacts to the most important milestones of every level.Gameplay is simple but enjoyable. Two main attacks (light and heavy), a defensive move, three active skills (which can be selected from a pool) and 6 consumable items. The game however throws many enemies at you and it mixes them so that you need to pay attention to all their attack patterns. Jumping from one enemy to another to neutralize the most immediate thread is fast and rewarding. Enemy selection is adequate: every major campaign stage one or two new enemies are introduced (or they get new abilities), so you keep facing different challenges as you progress.Boss fights are generally well crafted, with many powerful and flashy moves and some environmental hazards thrown in. Especially the two DLC boss fights are quite challenging. While levels are mostly corridors (with a few exceptions), every major level has at least an optional path with a miniboss and an extra chest. The game tries to mask the linearity by having you explore dark woods, climbing towers and breaching walls, for instance. The setpieces are very different from each other, colorful and with some impressive architecture. Camera mostly works and will help you appreciate the scenery while you move from a fight to the next one, again contributing in making the game feel less linear.My main problem with the game is that there is barely any customization (apart from weapon spirits, which give a buff and a debuff and mix gameplay up a bit, but are so unreliable to unlock and level up). You can pick a loadout, but there is no real loot. Every mission will unlock a new powerup or a new item, so there is no thrill in opening chests and defeating bosses. It's not loot, it's just progression unlocks.Multiplayer works mostly fine. I've had people joining my games during the majority of my sessions and everything seemed smooth. I experienced lag once or twice while joining other games myself, but I suspect it's on my side.All things considered I would recommend this game. I will probably jump in again to clear a few more achievements and to try out another class or two. It's definitely not Sacred and it's not a groundbreaking game, but it's enjoyable.			"

												Shamelessly Bandwagonish, Cheaply made, Cash in on a once Awesome Franchise. AVOID Terrible game, Im sad to say because I WAS a huge fan of the series to this point.I have played mobile diablo style dungeon crawlers that have more depth than this. Its as linear as a game gets without actually being a straight line. The writing is terrible its almost as if an idiot Millennial who had been living in a cave their whole life and knew nothing about pop culture. Then tried to write jokes about pop culture and added them to a script for a game. The voice acting is similarly bad, though it could just be the aweful script these people were forced to read. The combat (if you can call it that) consists of mashing the left mouse button with the occasional 1 or 2 key added for a special move which are kinda useless so it will mostly be mashing left click until an enemy with a shield comes then you press right click to break their guard and stun them for a second so you can, yep you guessed it spam the left mouse button.

												It's not Sacred 1 or 2. But an arcade Hack and slash like they always stated that it was. If you liked the previous games, don't get this. Stages are linnear with some hidden treasure and tons of enemies to kill. Choose one of 5(6) characters to fight the enemies, each chracter can assign two skills besides the light and heavy attacks. You can also choose between skills and different weapons. Earn money to upgrade skills and weapons to improve your fighter in differernt ways. You also have to make some gamechanging choices on whether you want to use Block or Dodge roll. The writing and script is rather terrible though, it makes Trine 2 seem serious.Strange relations: Dungeon siege 3, combat is pretty simmilar with limited skills. Although DS is a lot more open and has loot. Drakengard 3 with the pretty similar gameplay of simplistic battle system and linear stages ended with bosses. Heavenly Sword, with the combat system where you are expected to break guards and fight different kinds of enemies in different ways. Also, the villains kinda remind of each other. Old Action hack and slashes like Excalibur or any Warriors game. Devil May Cry because - nah just kidding, this has nothing on Devil may cry. Would be better if this wasn't Sacred 3 but rather Sacred Capitol 2 or something.PS: If you are looking for a coop hack and slash to enjoy then I would suggest Forced. Kinda simmilar but puzzles to solve and most stages are arenas rather than pathways.			"

The combat as well feels very fluent and satisfying. The only thing I have found to dislike in this game is the childish commentary every few minutes, and the creepy weapon spirit that keeps wanting to date my character. Other than those two things, however, the game is extremely enjoyable. As the game is right now: 7/10If the stupid dialog was changed: 8.5/10			"

												Honestly, I don't get why the game gets so much hate. Yeah, it's not Sacred as we know it. Yeah, it's fairly simple in design. But it's fun, very pleasant to look at, the commentary from Aria and Ghosts are often quite funny, the characters are diverse enough to not be bored to hell, from mallets to bow, to scythes there's something for everyone. It's a great time-waster in my opinion, a solid product with no pretence of being something more than a good ol' fanshioned fun pad-smasher.All I'm saying is, if this game had a different title, people would approach it very differently. It's a terrible Sacred game, but it's pretty darned decent as its own thing. Nothing newsworthy, of course, but a solid product nonetheless.			"

If it was called ""Sacred Citadel 2"" or ""Citadel: A Sacred Tale"" people would likely have been more forgiving.Naming and false-advertising aside, the game in and of itself is mediocre.

												Be careful of reviews with less than an hour of playtime, this game has too many and from the little I've played I feel they're way too unjust.Only played about 20 minutes or so, so far, but had to write a review because I feel the other reviews are unfair. This game plays fine with zero issues and the feel isn't much different than Sacred 2 on the PS3. Graphics for Sacred 2 on PC are great as are the graphics here, but I haven't played that version yet. Mainly just stating this as there's probably zero reason to trust the reviews on this game, if you're a fan of the other Sacred games then this isn't that far off from them. I'll update this more as I have more time to play.• First level plays smooth and is fun. Would have to state that it babies the player a bit even on ***, and the the voice acting is a bit purile; That may or may not be an issue. So far it plays 4 out of 5 stars for a Sacred game, and 3 out 5 for games in this genra. Worth the $4.99 it's on sale for right now and the pack for $12.99 makes perfect sense if you liked Sacred 2 but don't have it. For some reason I felt like was back in the 80's watching Heman.			"

												There are no spoilers in this review.To begin,-This game is a completely different genre from it's predecessors.-The mechanics are more suited for handheld console play (think PSP/ 3DS/ mobile app). I would even go so far to say that this PC port felt more like an afterthought.Game complexity: I am not against grinding as a game mechanic, because there can be good grinding games where you're constantly on your toes, and then there's bad ones. Sacred 3 falls under the latter - I fell asleep while clearing mobs because there's virtually no challenge - press button, monster dies. HP/Mana management? Choosing the right equipment for the right fights? Fret not, you are released from that burden in this game. </s>Replayability: The only reason to try out other characters is to see their skills. You can get the same experience from watching a YouTube video of the characters, then you're back to facing the same levels all over again.I wrote this review having owned a PSP myself, and played hack-and-slash games such as Dynasty Warriors, DMC3, God of War, Ryse, and many others. Avoid this game at all costs - even if it was free, your time could be spent on other games instead. "

												The game's like a cross between gauntlet and diablo with idk borderlands like corny quips. Fun but doesn't have random maps and item drops like diablo. More of a gauntlet style already made map grind for loot and to unlock stuff while you play with buds for braging rights. Single player is quite fun but can get tough, limited health items  and dying right before a save point can make you frustrated. I think the game is fine, its a grindy game for gold and to level up so if you want flashing lights and whistles you might be turned off. I honestly don't see why the game has mixed and negative reviews. Graphics and art are fine, music is good acting is ok a bit silly, bosses are just hard enough, if they are tough just lvl up and try again.  i didn't see many people online so I didn't get a chance to party, but if you have extra controllers you might just get away with no shows online.

												It's very, very different from previous Sacred Titles. Streamlined and simplified in the most extreme way. Once you accept that it's a very enjoyable game in it's own way.But if you seek for a classic Sacred Experience, you'll hate this.It's well made in it's own way. It's only big, big problem is the name. It will never be the successor that the title suggests. It should have been named differently. Other than that it's one of the few games that i really enjoyed in the last years.			"

												There is no problem with this game! It isn't an original Sacred experience, but it can be fun!I think it is not an RPG game, it's an ACTION GAME! And not a bad one! I recommend this game if You want to kill millions of enemies. And i recommend to use a controller (i have an xbox/ps3/pc controller, so i can switch it to ximput)! I recommend this game for buying at price-off periods! Give it a try! It isn't a bad game! But yes, as i mentioned before, it is NOT an original Sacred experience...			"

												Why so much rage? Disappointed much?When getting this during a sale, and approaching it without overblown expectations, this is quite a decent game - not great, but not as bad as some reviews indicate it to be.If you like fast-paced button smashers/monster bashers, and look at a few hours of simple, relaxing gameplay, this is an OK game in the vein of Gauntlet and similar (Dungeon Siege without loot), with some decent graphics. Don't expect much RPG content, though.Most boss fights are doable (some quite hard, though - especially the Dark Seraphim), and tbh I found the worst part (except for the Dark Seraphim) to a map with the spike traps around Level 20, where you start pretty far back when you die.Replayability, though, is so/so at best.Worst game ever, as some reviewers have stated? Not by a long long distance - there are literally hundreds of games worse than this.			"

												Well, I have never thought I will write this about a game in my library... Sacred 3 is probably the worst videogame on a market. At last it is the worst game I have played and I have COD: MW3 in my library. I make jokes about the quality of COD series all the time, but this game is realy bad. I have played this game for 9 hours - this is its actual gameplay value. It is considered as the RPG! 9 hours realy? 100% complete? I think that I could finish it even sooner, but I had to test it. Sacred 3 has got poor gameplay, story, awful sense of humor, boring level design, dumb characters, dumber enemies... Please, do not buy this ""game""! Someone wants to give you a free key of this game? Run! Run and do not turn your head! Nobody will return you wasted hours of your life. This game will give you nightmares. At this point, it is much better than Outlast or Five Nights at Freddy's.			"

												Don't even consider buying this crap, there are many better games in it's more action oriented hack'n'slash genre with the RPG elements kept to minimum.I really enjoyed Sacred 1, mildly liked Sacred 2, but this... They just made a game and needed to brand it something so it would sell, so they marketed it as the third main entry in Sacred franchise. They slapped on a generic story butchering all the stuff set up in previous games. I've seen fanfiction written better than this. They probably realized it's♥♥♥♥♥♥so they added 4th wall breaking self-deprecating humor to everything characters say, probably to shield it from criticism about how bad it is. It didn't work, and now we have a product with a♥♥♥♥♥♥story that just tells you how♥♥♥♥♥♥it is. Amazing.This is a disgrace to the series, as Arcania was to the Gothic franchise.			"

Good: -Incredible scenarios. Very, very detailed and interesting. -Fun dialogues. I loved all the corny jokes. -Simple to play.-A couple of boss battles are actually fun.-Decent soundtrack. Bad:-Too much humor. The serious tone is thrown aside with corny jokes very often.-Item usage is wonky: you need to select the item with the right stick and then use it with the D-pad.-Only two active skills per mission. I believe more buttons could've been used. -Somewhat easy even even at the maximum difficulty selectable before finishing the game.If you get it in a sale, go wild.			"

												There is no support for this game. If you encounter a problem you are basically on your own. The game worked fine for me for a couple hours then just stopped working. It now freezes constantly and is unplayable. I would not buy this game by itself. That said it wasn't bad before it reminded me it was a deepsilver game.			"

												I would go to my Cousin's house and take my laptop so i can play Sacred 3 on xbox and he plays Witcher 2 on my laptop,and we had so much fun playing and staying awake all night for Sacred 3 coop on xbox,all this happened on the summer vacation June 2015 so today 25th of November 2015 i decided to get this game on pc,and here's my review of this pc version of the game.POSITIVES*Nostalgia hit me so hard in the head when i played this game and i remembered them good ol' days.*Decent enviroment design.*I liked the classic arcade feel of the game overall.*Decent looking skill animations.NEGATIVES-The Audio is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad that it broke my headset,internally ofcourse.- It clearly says FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT on the store page,but when i plugged my controller it didn't work at all and no the problem isn't my controller because its fully functional on other games.-Same case with the controller,Mouse doesn't work sometimes.- I did mention that the skill animations are decently looking on the pros section but the actual combat itself is all button mashing and gets repetitive really ♥♥♥♥ing quickly- You can't play on Fullscreen,it just doesn't work even if you go to settings and enable fullscreen and highest resolution it's still in windowed mode.* The voice acting is so bad and the charecters try so hard to be funny and they're not. not at allRefundedand im not going to talk about the sacred 2 genre migration,im not going to ♥♥♥♥ing do it.

												The in-depth custumization and character development, as well as massive world with many side quests in Sacred 2, which we had hoped from Sacred 3... dissappointment is really what it it. If you are looking for a massive open game like Sacred 2, this isn't it. This is litterally nothing like Sacred 2, except the fact that you only get to pick a few characters and no real customization.They took a whole new approach, and tried to tap into the more action combat gameplay. Although this game does that quite well, it is just like many other games of its kind, but less imaginative. Graphics are pretty decent and action combat is alright. Sacred 2 voice overs were actually pretty decent, but Sacred 3's is absolute terrible. They tried to half heartedly make the game funny, which turned into pathetic. The best voice over would be the first battle spirit you come across. He is quick witted, funny, and enjoyable to listen to. Problem was that the game made very little indication as to who was actually talking. Pretty much I had no idea it wasn't the character I was playing as talking for a bit.Gameplay is average at best, boring as heck at worst. Every single mission basically plays out the same. Waves of bad guys with varying abilities you HAVE to use to even kill them. Bosses with all the same basic skills, then repeat. Pretty simple really, if they have a shield above their head, you have to knock it away. Otherwise you just keep moving and killing. Like Dynasty Warriors, but not as cool.The absolute worst part of the game, is the variety. Every single hero plays exactly the same. Sure you can pick two skills, but most of the skills are about the same. Some are a complete waste to even pick, which lowers the variety even more. You can pick your weapon, but they are very similar so it won't even matter much. For the price tag, I would say this game is totally not worth it. There are many MANY games out there that have more depth to them for a fifth the price. I would only get this game if it is on super sale for 75% off or more.			"

												I get it that the die hard fans of the first two games are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that this is so different, but seriously this game is fun.  The RPG elements are tuned down, but frankly sometimes you dont actually care to spend hours tweaking attributes and juggling gear scores...   Sometimes you just want to dive in and murder the crap out of hordes of monsters!!   This game is very enjoyable, but more Golden Axe than Diablo...  (Or Sacred 1/2)  and that's not a bad thing.  It DOES however feel like it started as one game, and ended up as another in some ways.  The voice acting isnt bad, but the writing seems out of place?  There are a lot of really bad jokes and some dumb one liners in there, but in a way it still comes off as charming, but seems incongruous with the presentation of the rest of the game.  That said, maybe the corn is better than having the game take itself too seriously and come off as unintentionally hokey?  Anyhow, it's a satisfying romp with lots of flying bodies and smashed set pieces, and that's pretty damn fun in of itself.			"

												I don't get why this game gets all the hate. I mean, sure, I only picked up the Gold Edition once it was 75% off. In fact, this is actually a review of Sacred 3 Gold at the total price of $7.50 USD. Ok? Ok.So, Sacred 3 Gold is:+ a fun, if somewhat repetitive hack'n'slash.+ Has a good variety to the levels.+ Gives you access to 6 unique warriors.+ Has a stream-lined, but flexible RPG system that allows you to easily change your specs between missions.+ Weapon Spirits add a bit of extra variety.There are things that are a bit hit-and-miss, though:= Like the humour. Absurd, low-brow, and extremely silly. You'll get a few chuckles, sure, but mostly you'll be shaking your head. (I play with the orc and he's actually pretty hilarious)= The main story levels are pre-set in their level requirements, which you will surpass very quickly. That is to say, the game will get progressively easier as you go. Don't worry, boss fights are still tough and the DLC missions adjust difficulty according to your level.= The story? Oh yeah, I forgot. ... I think you have to save the world or something?There is only, really, one issue I have with the game:- You aim your dodge with the mouse. Whoever though that was a good idea needs to have some sense knocked into them.			"

												I havent got a Huge amount of game time under my belt but in my hour or two (felt like ages) of playing all i can say is this.Gameplay is good, does justice (not spectacular) and is easy to get a feel for and get into which is nomally an issue with games like this. Camera panning, movement etc is fine and it works ok.Basic story... like reaaaal basic as in the kind of story you've seen on most other RPG's its not a terrible story but it feels quite droll.Now comes the fun part the voice acting and dialogue... this was something different.Imagine going to a comedy show and the act starts: ""ok looks good, bit of humour (not normal in most fantasy RPG's) something different. Now imagine 5 minutes in the humour makes you cringe and if it was a live performance all you want to do is tell the comedian to sit down or just leave. Thats the dialogue and voice acting... and the sad part is it gets on you and really detracts from the rest of the game wherein you feel like you're getting the hang of a pretty ok game, something nice to pass the time with and then you get bombarded with humour that is trying so hard to be funny but simply isn't and in all honesty if the game character and story was a bit more serious (including narration, don't even get me started  great voice actor but the narration seemed offish) the game would and could have been a far more enjoyable experience.With this said the game isn't absolutely unplayable and is quite pretty in a cartoony fashion but the story and voice acting really does it in.5.7/10			"

My biggest issue with the game is that the attempted humour is so forced it's quite cringe worthy and it tortures my ears, so if nothing else, if you hate bad, forced humour, then don't even buy or start this game.

												Steam should have had 'Neutral' button for this kind of game. I only recommend buying on very deep sale. This is NOT an action-RPG. It's an old-school arcade beat-em-up that looks like an A-RPG, with very little and linear character progression. One serious flaw for me is that you can't switch characters between stages and that makes the game boring.Aside from that, it's a pretty fun beat-em-up with nice graphics.Set you expectations to 'low' and on 'beat-em-up', not 'A-RPG', and it could be fun playing with friends.

												This game taught me a very valuable lesson... that is...Never, ever, ever buy a game, no matter how much you liked its predecessors, or how deeply it's dicounted... until you've read the reviews. You might say... ""how can you review a game that you've played for less than an hour?""  I'll tell you how... the movement mechanic in this game is so flawed that I can't imagine a single person play testing this game and saying... ""Yeah, that seems alright."" It uses the standard WASD keys for movement but the view is LOCKED at a 45 degree angle to all of the corridors. So to move in a straight line down any corridor you have to either hold down 2 keys or stair step... this is SO messed up! I got Sacred 3 and all of the DLC for a great price... and I still feel ripped off, I can't imagine I'll ever boot it up again. Terrible, terrible terrible design.			"

												I am at the end of the game.First, I really don't understand all the hate about this game, sure it is not diablo or torchlight, but it is still fun.not that many RPG elements, only 3-4 weapons type, almost no armor types, no real treasures or secrets.no epic items or loot or legendary.Strongly build an online or co-op, but still you can play it alone, like I said I am at the end of the game I really like the characters, only a little downside is acting is... like modern, whit the jokes and all, not really great music its ok.I like powers you have, I think 8 types, more than is some rpg only too bad you can only choose 2 Typs not like 4 or 5 in like most rpg every map is different whit different boss fight, I really appreciate that. overall a good game worth playing			"

												Well it deffo don't feel like a sacred game .But tbh it is fun to play , Its really easy to just pick up and play , Straight forward character development no gear hunting and such just jump in and fight ! But ohhh those voice acting comments that your character keeps saying are shocking totally annoying .And if only they took the OTT silly voices and stupid comments out the game would be sooo much better.Fun factor 8/10  ....Story  4/10....8/10 If they sort out those stupid constant jokes. I will be lvling all the classes because they are fun to play , Its nice to just switch over onto the big screen and chill out with the game pad and smash it up and it does look really nice aswell and the sound it great through a good system. I bought it for a good deal with some DLC £8 i think so if you can get a deal on it then yes i would recommend it.			"

												I loved Sacred 2. That being said i did not hate the game. It did seem much simpler, took alot away from it and graphics are not really a huge improvement. That did add alot more story and kinda force you too listen too it. Though the controlls and skills are simpliler it makes is a little more difficult to not get killed, lot of pushing the roll button and switching up combos of hit or break gaurd as well as knowing when to use your special moves and which enemys. Though i feel the developers put to much effort into level design and other features nobody is going to appreciate. Miss character cusomazation.			"

												If you've played Sacred 2: Fallen Angel and really want more of that, but with improved RPG mechanics in a dungeon-crawling adventure; DO NOT buy this game.This game is a top-down/isometric hack-and-slash button-masher. Think of it like God Of War except with less awesome cinematics, a boring story, co-op, and no combo attacks. It's like if Diablo met God Of War and their child had the worst possible combination of its parents' traits. And no/very little customization.If you really enjoyed Sacred 2: Fallen Angel (I know I did), and you think this will be similar, turn away now!			"

												This is a prime example of the often abused steam review system. This game is not, in general terms, a bad game. It has good triple A level production value in almost every area including sound/music, graphics, controls, and gameplay, and it isn't any more or any less repetitive than any other game in it's category. However one downside that the game does have is its overly silly voice acting. It isn't like most other typical top down action rpg button mashers in that it requires you to dodge attacks with its dodge system and be at least somewhat smart while you play so you don't die. I play with a xbox 360 gamepad so I can't comment on how it plays with K&M because I never tried it but it does control perfectly with my 360 controller.It got so much hate because the fans of Sacred 1 and 2 were expecting a game like those and it is nothing at all like them. Good. Sacred 2 is old garbage. My playtime of Sacred 2 included my mage getting 3-shotted by the first couple of enemies I saw, then I went back, summoned my big demon who killed the two enemies, then turned around and killed me..... seriously? That's what they went with when they made the game? Then I made a warrior and ran around for another 45 minutes bored out of my mind. Sacred 2 lacks in every possible area that makes a game like Diablo 3 or even a f2p arpg like Path of Exile so streamlined, user friendly, and worry free. So yea I'm glad we didn't get another bad ARPG Sacred game.7.5/10 I paid $10 for this +$1.50 for the Malakhim character and it was all well worth what I paid.			"

												Let's just get it straight out of the way...This is not like the previous Sacred games.  So if you're looking for that kind of experience then you will be very disappointed here.  Because it is such a drastically different game, I won't be judging it compared to the previous games.  That's just an unfair assessment and this game has gotten most of it's hate simply for that reason.  Since this game is a hack 'n slash action RPG, then that's what I will be comparing it to.  So games such as Champions of Norrath or Dungeon Siege 3 since those are ones I've played in the past.This game is actually pretty decent.  It accomplishes what it's trying to do, which is provide a fun hack 'n slash gameplay.  It's a simple system that anyone can easily jump into and be good at.  You're wiping out big groups of enemies, using spells or combat arts for more wide spread destruction, performing executions on knocked down enemies, evading attacks, and it all happens with just a few buttons.  There's no complicated control scheme of having to hold one button in order to open up alternative attacks or something.  It's just a fast paced, simplified system that allows you to get into the action and accomplish things in a visually pleasing way.And visually, this game is gorgeous.  The environments are extremely well done.  A lot of detail was put into this world and it's something that you can just stop and admire.  The character design is also good, but maybe a bit lacking.  I suppose it's understandable since the camera view is always pulled away and so you don't get a good look at the characters anyway.  As I mentioned, the combat is visually pleasing.  With different colors happening on the screen that are associated with your weapon swings or the different abilities.  It's a very pretty game.So if the game is nice to look at and it's a decent hack 'n slash gameplay, then you're probably wondering why a lot of people hate it.  The biggest problem this game has is there's no real depth to it.  Every good action RPG of this sort will always have the ability to progress your character.  They will allow you to level up the character and distribute attribute points, you will collect ""loot"" or equipment to further improve your character, you will be able to change their appearance, etc.  Sacred 3 has none of that.Character development is pretty much non-existent.  You do gain experience points and level up but it's never shown if that actually does anything.  There is no stats to say how strong your character might be or anything.  So the only purpose I've seen with leveling up is to meet the level requirements to unlock new skills.  These skills, combat arts, spells, whatever you may want to call them, are one of the very few customization that you can do.  You're only allowed to have two skills equipped and you get to choose which ones you want from a handful of them.  You can also upgrade each skill to make it more powerful.  The same thing applies with weapons you obtain.  You don't find any loot in this game but instead you get an item drop from a level boss.  These weapons can be upgraded in the same way as the skills.  There is also ""weapon spirits"", which for the most part are kind of useless, and they mostly will annoy you.Which brings us to the voice acting.  In general, it's not too bad.  They won't be winning any awards for their performance but I've definitely heard a lot worse.  Some characters aren't as good as others and will probably make you laugh at how bad it comes across.  But the worst part about the voice acting is they don't know when to shut up.  Whether you're being told what to do by the guide character, or you're being taunted by the enemy, or just the constant ramblings from your weapon spirit, it gets a bit annoying.  On top of that, somebody thought it was a great idea to include jokes in almost everything that is said.  Some of the humor is good but a lot of it is just kinda meh, and it gets irritating after a bit when almost everything is being said either in a joking manner or they try to slip a joke into the line of dialogue.  Such as the narrator, for example.  The purpose of a narrator is to explain what is happening to progress the story.  But this one is tossing in joke after joke and you just get tired of it and don't want to listen to him anymore.The lack of depth that I mentioned also applies to the gameplay itself.  There is so much potential that is clearly visible with this game, but, whether by choice or not, they stripped it down to the absolute basic stuff.  The environments are so detailed and there is little pathways or doorways and stuff and it makes you wish you could go explore in that direction.  But there's really no deviating from the main path.  For example, in Champions of Norrath there was caves and dungeons scattered around the map and multiple pathways you could take.  Sacred 3 has a linear path that you follow with the odd side path going into a dead end that has a chest of gold.  It's very bare bones and stripped down to just going along that path and slashing away at enemies.In conclusion, I do recommend this game but there's some conditions that go with it.  For what it is, it's a fun hack 'n slash game.  It allows you to kill swarms of enemies with a relatively decent combat system.  There's just not much to it and basically what you see in the first 5 minutes of the game is what you'll be doing for the next however many hours.  It's not a game to sit down and pull an all nighter with because you'll probably be bored after an hour or two.  So if you're looking for something simple when you need a break from everything, then this is the game to do that.As a side note...this really shouldn't have been called Sacred 3.  If they wanted to go down this style of gameplay then it should have been a spin-off game.  A lot of people hate on this game for the sole reason that it's not like the previous two.  Either way, this game has so much potential and it could have been something amazing if they added in more depth to the gameplay mechanics.			"

												First things first.  The game is NOT ""Overwhelmingly Negative"".  It's actually quite damn good.  The reason people have given it such a horrible rating is simply due to the fact that it doesn't follow in Sacred 1 & 2's roots.  Yes, that's a bummer, but the game is a damned good hack'n slash.  Including all the DLC it took me 13 hours to beat it and was level 26.  I did not do any grinding and I did not do any MP or Co-op, but might venture back in and try it out.  They should had named this something else besides Sacred 3.   Perhaps something along the lines of Sacred: Ancaria Adventures.  Then it wouldn't had gotten such a bad rep.  The graphics were beautiful and there's a continued voiced story line which was great to have.  The voices were comical and not to be taken seriously, but acceptable and enjoyable.  Lots of power ups and a few weapons to choose from.  Once you get your weapons that's all you get and then you just upgrade them.  I didn't have a problem with it.  There is NO loot system.  All you have is gold from drops or chests and use this gold to upgrade your weapons/armor and buy items (potions).  This game does take place in the Sacred world and if you're willing to play a hack'n slash beat'em up with this lore you're in for a treat.  Keen games did a fantastic job.  Great game and worth a play through!  8/10			"

												3/10 (I gave it an extra point because I bought it in a pack with 2 other sacred games....1 point each)As a huge fan of the original Sacred when it came out years ago even with its massive multiplayer bugs, I thought that everyone as being unnecessarily negative towards this game and saw it on sale and thought, cant hurt.They werent lying, it hurt.Its terrible. Somehow they have turned a decent idea of a pc game and turned it into a disgustingly bad console port that actually is condescending in its game play.			"

												Overall Score: 7/10 Good gameplay, horrible writing and cringe worthy choices for voice acting. Missions are the same throughout the 41 missions, with 15 of them being main story missions. It is a decent hack and slash game once dialogue is muted and you skip the plot points. It's basically a modern Gauntlet Legends that disrespects those who pay attention to story.			"

												By now everyone should know that this is not truly the successor to Sacred 1 and 2, despite the name. So if that is what you are looking for, move on.If you ignore the history and just evaluate the game itself, it is a solid Hack'n'Slash. It is more an advanced version of Gauntlet than a dumbed down ARPG (the point of view all the disappointed S2 fans take).If you want an ARPG, this is not the game for you, limited skill selection and no loot make this a no-go. If you want more of a brawler, go for it, combat is good enough imo, areas are nice but very linear. You collect some money per mission and can upgrade skills with it.Notice that the controls are better for a controller, so if you use keyboard and mouse and do not like WASD movement, do not get the game either (WASD works, controller is better).You also will have to overlook the stupid attempt at humor this game has in really all narration and that you unfortunately cannot turn off.If you can look past that, want a Hack'n'Slash, not an ARPG, and are ok with WASD (or better yet with using a controller), it is a solid game. Not outstanding, but also not deserving all the bad ratings from the disappointed S2 fans that are predominantly upset about this not being a true successor.			"

												Game is not that bad as others write. Is much worse than Sacred or Sacred 2 fact, but combat system and co-op mode was good designed. Personally I like hack and slash like this and playing in co-op mode but if you expect great games like previous Sacred parts I highly do not recommend this game because you will be disappointed. In my opinion game is rather average, it has schemathic missions, no loot and open world. If you looking for cheaper version of Diablo 3 or quite reliable hack and slash for co-op playing you can play this game but like I wrote earlier this game is not of the highest caliber.			"

Would get real boring single player due to the repetitive hack-n-slash nature (which hack-n-slash doesn't eventually).- Lot's of funny jokes and references to various other RPG's and fantasy history- Excellent graphics- The dodging sux on the PC with keyboard and mouse, controller recommended. Though I've played with K/B and mouse and a friend with a controller- There are no weapon and armour loot drops like other hack-n-slash RPG's, here you can only customize which of the 3 weapons and your special powers you can level up and use.

												Lets strat to say i stareted to play sacred franchise from sacred 1.1st part was lots of fun for me. 2nd part was ultimate with its own + and -.But we are talking about 3rd part. This one, The disaster.Unlike previous parts, this one is not realy diablo like hack and slash.Developers cuted out all mouse ""click to move"" things, control, inventory, skills points remastered.All ""runes"" was cuted out also.Even voices of characters, and they words is like from any hollywood trash movie.Perhaps it is becouse ""Chief text editor"" possition was closed too soon with 5 years old boy - son of ""Chief game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dirrector"".Even when you trying to use mouse, it controls only direfction that is static, so if your character dirrection is up, even if you move down, atack, character is becoming to atack Up dirrection. And misses also. That is lame.So lets say sacred 3 is not really RPG anymore, it is Aracde for kids now.Developers were to lazy, or whatever i dont care.I bought this game for  $0.50 (50 cents).Steam shop told me that is very good offer coz it was like $200, but for me, i dont want it even for free. It's lame.Conclussion: If you were awaiting Arcade from this one, - than it is noat really so bad.But for me as true fan of Sacred franchise - it is dessaster.			"

												Honestly, you guys are whining about this game, just because it isn't what you had expected of it. But it's a great game!I've never played any other Sacred than sacred 3. My gues this game is just another type of game, but really good. It's a great local co-op game which plays fluently with xbox controller, no bugs, lovely bosses with different skills, which create some tactics to defeat a boss. I love the way they let you customize each character with their different skills. I do recommend to play it on the hardest difficulty right from the start. Once you beat the game another difficulty becomes available ""Deity"" which offers replayability. I had lots and lots of fun with this game, played 6 hours straight more than once.One of the better hack'n'slash games out here, with lovely RPG options. A definite recommendation for people who like local fluent co-op games with replayability.			"

												Jsou hry, které zaslouží své místo v síni slávy a jsou hry, které bych byl raději nikdy ani nespatřil.Kde jsou ty skvělé zážitky, které jsem strávil v prvním díle Sacred? To byla skvělá doba a skvělá hra. Otevřený svět, tolik možností, skillů a zábavy. Je to pryč. Místo toho jsem měl možnost vyzkoušet třetí díl a jsem fakt zhnusen, co se může stát, když někdo dojí jméno slavné hry a zplodí brak jako tento a ještě to pokládá za plnohodnotnou hru. Toto není totiž plnohodnotná hra, ale bohapustý hnus.Dejte zbohem otevřenému světu nevídaných možností a zažijete graficky sice pěkné mapy a zajímavé efekty, ale to je tak všechno. Prvních 5 minut vás to možná i bude bavit, ale tím tahle sranda, chlapci a děvčata, jednoduše končí. Lineární, hnusně nudné, bez nápadu. Takto by se dal napsat první dojem ze hry. Vězte, že jen velmi nerad píši recenze ke hrám, které jsem neodhrál dokonce, ale mám se dost rád na to, abych podnikl toho utrpení až dokonce. Nerad bych skončil jako pacient Chocholouškova ústavu. Příběh hry je trapný a zpracování hry tomu dalo korunu. Procházíte mapu ve stylu Diablo, kosíte nepřátele, využíváte pár základních dovednotí stále dokola, občas narazíte na truhlu, ze které vám vypadnou buď peníze nebo zelené lahvičky, které jaksi doplňují život. Pokud čekáte na dropy nebo loot z nepřátel, rovnou na to zapomeňte, nepadá z nich totiž nic než prachy a zelenej chlast. Nic, prostě nic kloudného z nich nevypadne, jako z našich politiků.Hra nemá pauzu, což je tedy fakt super. Má občas jakési kruhy, které slouží jako checkpointy přes které když projdete, zamkne se vám předchozí bod mapy a můžete jen pokračovat dál. Když umřete, přijdete o 20% penež a vrátíte se na checkpoint. Jenže co když nějakou dobu hrajete a potřebujete odběhnout, třeba na záchod? No tak to vám nedoporučuji když máte nepřátele poblíž, ESC totiž zvedne menu, ale hra jede vesele dál. Asi vám nemusím říkat co následuje - vaše smrt nebo plné kalhoty. Nebo vám nejde finální boss v misi, tak si řeknete, že se k němu vrátíte například další den. Prošli jste checkpointem, takže fajn, a tak si hru zavřete. Jenže to by nebyl Sacred 3, kdyby jste po spuštení hry nebyli opět na začátku té stejné mise, co jste hráli, checkpoint je tedy naprosto k prdu. To by musel mít člověk neustále zapnutou hru. Hratelnost samotné hry je jednuduše trapná a stařičkým klasikám jako byly diablo nebo klasický Sacred 1 tento výplod choré mysli nesahá ani po kotníky. Tady to nějaké efekty a grafika za 22 GB stahování rozhodně nestojí. Postava se pohybuje jako kdyby byla předchozí den na návštěvě Modré ústřice a tak jste místy prostě děsně pomalí, což může mít často ve hře dost fatální následky. Skilly jsou nedomyšlené a ovládání kláves jde sice nastavit, ale kombinacím při pohybu a útocích jsem vůbec nepřišel na chuť, o nějaké logice ani nemluvě. Ve hře sice sbíráte prachy a zelené lahvičky na léčení, ale tyto lahvičky si jednoduše nemůžete ani sbíráním nakumulovat. V domění, že je zde něco podobného možné jsem potom celou misi chodil bez lahviček. Doměnka, že si je můžete tedy alespoň nakoupit za nasbírané peníze a mít v inventáři byla opět chybná, protože ve hře v misi nejde otevřít ani ten blbý ochod, aby to šlo koupit a lahvičky co padají prostě nenasbíráte, hra nemá inventář (!). Skilly a lahvičky jdou sice nakoupit v obchodě, ale ten není přístupný přímo ze hry v misi, nenašel jsem na to v konfiguraci ani klávesu a ESC opět nefunguje. Ten obchod jde otevřít teprve až potom, když vylezete ze hry, tedy z mise, což pokud jsem ji ještě nedokončili znamená že si ji pěkně od začátku zopakujete. Léčící lahvičky v zásobě tedy máte v určitém počtu před misí, ale během mise nelze lahvičky sbírat, ale pouze instantně použít (nedávají však až tolik života), navíc pokud je rychle neseberete, tak se ze země jednoduše vypaří, včetně peněz. Neuvěřitelné.Tato hra mi hla žlučí jako málokterá hra co jsem za poslední dobu hrál a to mě mrzí. Pokud by ji dávali někde zadarmo, řeknu vám, aby jste se podívali co může chorý mozek zplodit a zahráli si to. Ale né za 15 euro (!) a ještě 22 GB stahování tohoto braku, který nemá se Sacred nic společného a hlavně se to jednoduše nedá ani hrát bez toho, aby si člověk mezitím nemusel zajišťovat rezervaci v blázinci.Pokud se chystáte, že si tuto hru chcete pořídit a hrát, od srdce vám fandím a doufám, že to přežijete ve zdraví. Dejte však raději ruce od tohoto špatného vtipu pryč a zahrajte si třeba něco 100% napaditějšího, jako byl kdysi například stařičký Corridor 7, rozhodně dopadnete lépe :)Hodnocení: 1/10 (za odvahu toto vydat a ještě na tom rejžovat. Na to člověk musí mít fakt koule)			"

												Wow. Wow no. Oh god no. Okay. First off: I got this game as part of a bundle with six other games. Total price payed for just this game, less than a dollar US.I massively overpayed for this pile of excrement.This might have theoretically been a mediocre game, if for some reason it didn't attempt to shoehorn in the literal worst attempt at comedic writing I have ever suffered through. Lines with no coherence delivered by voice actors with no timing.No. This game is bad. Do not pay money for this. I would not reccommend playing this even if it was free, or bundled with something you did want to play. If you are given a key for this game, do yourself a favor and throw it away so nobody has to suffer through this absolutely pathetic excuse for a game.			"

												A beautifully detailed, I liked the fluid gameplay and the special effects. Levels are designed like arenas, defeat all enemies and you can move on. There is no inventory and constant looting. This makes the experience more arcade-like, and ultimately a different experience but still very interesting. Team up with three like-minded friends for a bunch of monster-smashing, and Sacred 3 has plenty to offer. For all intents and purposes, Sacred 3 is a beat ‘em up that can be very fun. Game is so very different from previous installments in this series, this game dedicated to consoles and ""couch gaming"". But if you put aside your prejudice, you could enjoy Sacred 3 - it's a pretty good action game with a epic fantasy setting.			"

												This is an uncomplicated, easy to pick up, mission based isometric brawler with smooth drop-in co-op (both offline and online, up to 4 players). The main campaign can be played entirely in co-op mode, which is always a big plus. You choose between four different classes, which all feel appropriately different to play. More classes can be bought as DLC. This is not an open world game, you will be running down narrow corridors most of the time, but that kinda comes with the genre. There is no loot to speak of (only gold + health and mana orbs), instead you unlock new items and skills by leveling up or beating bosses. You can upgrade your stuff by paying gold. Bosses are varied (one can be a troll, another a ship, etc) and you need to employ different skills for each fight. XBox360 controller is recommended.All in all I must say I have enjoyed my time with this game so far, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something fun to play with their friends.

												My Specs: 16 Gogs RAM/GTX 1070/Intel Core i7-7700kThis game is good if you like these kinds of RPG Action games. It is pretty linear. You kill, do missions, level up and upgrade and get stronger. Don't go into this game thinking it is an extension of Sacred 1 and 2. Thsi is kind of in the theme of it but all its own. The main thing that bothered me about the game is using a K/M. It wasn't bad and most people may get used to it but I need fluid mechanics. I am used to doing everything about steering and targeting with my keys but your avatar attacks in the direction of your mouse pointer so that was throwing my brain off a little and making it harder to play. As time went on I was getting used to it but it was still kind of annoying me. That being said, if you can use a game controller this game would probably play very well with one as you wouldn't have to worry about the WSAD and pointer issue. Although I did not try the controller so I am just assuming that you wouldn't have the steering pointer problem with a controller. Overall, the game played well but felt a little generic. You still have the same Ancarian humor. One line joking. I was playing the game in 4k so it looked very nice. My video below will show you some basic gameplay from a nooby who doesn't play these types of game much anymore. I was always used to the mouse mover games like Diablo, Titan Quest and the first two Sacreds. Sacred 3 Gold is worth a buy especially if you get it on sale. Enjoy. My video of first play in 4k:

												So far so good,i am enjoying it a lot!Lets face the one simply fact the main argument against this game is its tittle,I agree its not Sacred 3,it should be called Sacred arcade or even Sacred Citadel 2 or 3D,whatever.Its a spin off,arcade one,that is a very good game in its own genre,to compare it to Sacred RPG`s is a mistake,and the reason for all the fuss.What that dev did,apologised for the game,that was just adding fuel to the fire,I have no respect for what he did,instead of taking responsibility for his game,standing behind his creation he washed his hands and basicly said i dont want a part in this,well no Pilat you did take the part in this,the least you could do was to influence the title,you failed.To the game,like i said its a solid piece of arcade hack and slash,you choose 1 of 5 heroes(3 of which play basicly the same)and kill mobs and bosses,collect gold and potions and thats it,which is ok for an arcade tittle.There some minor RPG ELEMENTS in it,you lvl up your character aswell as weapons,skills(you can have 2 equipped at a time,which actually works)and guardians that give you certain bonuses.Now all the content implemented to the game is good and works as a whole.Its a good and fun game,with multiplayer aswell,again the only major minus of it is its tittle.Oh and you seriously need a pad for it,keybord is a torture.Another oh,i payed around 5 euros for it,i get my moneys worth,I wouldnt pay around 30 euros no way.

												Things first, I haven't played any of the prequels. That said, I find the hack and slash quite entertainment. There is just a small array of skills you can use and just two you can equip. That's quite odd. Though, I the actual combat isn't really bad. You have a set of variety in enemies and how you take them out. You need to bash them for shields or take out timers before you melee them. Using a bit of environment objects as you playground .. yeah. Nice.. Just don't expect it to be a top A Game.They characters are stereotypes. You'll quickly learn what type everyone is and expect them to say things, they will. There is a story, but it's just to keep you fighting. No extreme demons from hell raising to overwhelm the planet.. there is an invasion, mwah. >.< I also don't really give to much about the humor level. Still considering the medium story and cheap characters, it actually is fitting.Characters .. story, not so much. Battle system is quite entertaining. ( again, I haven't played the prequels! I review this game as it is, standalone ). 29.99 ... far too much. Can't recommend it for that price. 14.99 , fine, that's doable. Whenever it gets around the 9.99.. go for it.			"

												If you look at Sacred 3 as its own game, it is not a bad game at all. The way the upgrading and equiping works is a bit hard to get used to and the game itself is ment more for a controller then a keyboard. If you are a fan of the Sacred series I would still recommend trying the game, however if you play it and expect it to be like the first 2, you'll be disapionted. Unlike Sacred and Sacred 2, Sacred 3 is not an open world, nor do you feel any progress as you go through the game as you do not pick up any items from monsters and can only have 2 spells equipped, that can only be changed in the character menu between missions.

												This game got many negative reviews, which I find rather unfair. Sacred 3 is not Sacred or Sacred 2. It's not an RPG with an open world where you can run around and complete quests. This is what many people expected and why so many are disappointed. Sacred 3 is an extremely linear Hack'n Slash game with lots of action and (in my opinion) nice graphics. It takes place in Ancaria. That's pretty much all it has in common with its predecessors.Nevertheless, it is a decent game. The visuals are well done, controls are intuitive (if you play with a controller) and accurate. You constantly need various buttons which are much easier to reach on a controller than a keyboard. Further, the game has a online as well as a local co-op mode. Playing with others is much more fun and something I would definitely recommend to do.The only thing I found annoying after a while are the comments of your companions. I guess, the developers aimed at being funny. They are not. I prefer a more serious tone in the dialogues while I'm saving the world. It's not the right time to hear about wannabe romantic approaches of whatever kind of ghost I'm carrying around with me.TL, DR: This is a good game with some minor flaws. It missed the high expectations from its loyal fans and got many undeserved bad reviews for it.			"

												First of all: this game in terms of gameplay, it has absolutely nothing to do with the first two Sacred. NOTHING.This important premise goes done, because it can help you a lot to not judge the game negatively from the begin, without any reason particularly founded.I wanted to give it a chance, after having read the users assaults in the forums, a hatred which, however, was almost always motivated only by the fact that ""this isn't Sacred"".Said that, I like the game. From begin I have found friends to play co-op, and also in single objectives to achieve allow you to play for many hours.In co-op is great fun, the locations of the missions are very varied and graphically detailed, a nice isometric game that sometimes offers beautiful panoramic views.The interactivity with the map is quite varied, you can break any small object, even if it has no utility except for the energy or health orbs.Each weapon has its own power and skill tree to upgrade, although the RPG elements are few.The replay value is very good, after the ""normal"" level there are two levels of high difficulty, and the map of the world starts from the beginning, even if you can go in all the main missions.Sacred 3 can give you many hours of carefree fun.The online system works well, and play in co-op (especially 4) is really fun, and it is this that matters.If you can disinterest that has nothing to do with the previous chapters, and you can catalog it in a completely different genre, then you can definitely like Sacred 3.However, if you expect a game similar to Sacred 1 or 2, I do not recommend it, because you will be disappointed.7.3/10			"

First of all:Yes this is not Sacred.It isnt open world,it hasnt any characteristics of any popular hack`n slay (besides the iso view maybe) and its by far not a perfect game.Everyone who was interested in Sacred 3 before its release should have known that since it was announced the way it is(without loot,no open world,easy actioner) and blaming devs for not changing their mind on the idea they announced to you months ago is a bit stupid if you bought the game nontheless.Anyway if you are able to lower your expectations to a point where you will not judge the game by the fact that it isnt sacred and/or the new Diablo then the game at least brings a bit of fun with it.The Review Discussion:You might have seen the game got a lot of neg. Reviews and Hate.This mainly contains due the fact that most people judged the game without giving it a real chance at all.Most people simply started the game,saw its not like sacred 1 + 2 and instantly downvoted the game.Most of this reviews have playtimes less then an hour and remind me more of some ""true believers""driven by their own madness then actual intelligent people.The Game has a lot problems and is by far not a AAA Game but its not THAT terrible as many people wanna make others think.The GameThe Game itself is fairly easy to explain : Its a very simply Isometric Action Game with very little till no real RPG Elements with its focus on fast-paced Multiplayer Action.Basically you run around with a variety of very little combat skills/attacks and try to kill as much as possible as fast as possible.You gain xp and level up`s and you can collect gold(which is your only ""Loot"") with what you are able to buy new skills/abilities for yourself,your weapons or armor.The Game is devided into 4 Difficulties in total and has a max level of 50.The Storymode is not open world,its divided into Missions,which come along with a Recommendation of the level you should have for the particular mission of your choice.Anyway you can jump into every Mission at any point(Eg. playing a lvl 25 mission with the player level of 5 and so on)The DownsidesFirst the game is massively overprized on Steam.So like everyone smart should do with any other game aswell : Go check the Keyshops of your trust or wait for a sale...The Game itself is pretty buggy : From Resolution bugs till Random Crashes it involves everything.Graphics are okish but really look outdated,especially textures,backgrounds in general and the very lowres Overlays.The Soundtrack tho is great.Really nice composed and fitting and definitely one of the best parts of the game.The Voice acting on the other hand not so much... Partly good,partly wierd,partly really bad.The Game itself and the way it plays out is somewhat fun.I mean it doesnt have any depth or real challenge but for a one-time run especially in multiplayer its fun to play.Where it disappoints the most is the lack of inspiration imo.I dont care if its like Sacred 1+2 and I was 100% sure it wouldnt be on any level close to D3 or PoE and i can totally live with it being a better melee combat game but its really sad how less inspiration devs gave into the combat system.I mean when i focus a game on fast-paced action then ffs i have to take care that the combat system is more then just 4 button mash.Involve some Combo possibilites,more skills whatever to keep people challenged or motivated also in single player.With 4 people it doesnt matter that the fight and skill system doesnt have any substance since its about having some fun but in single player it really bothers me,that its that one-sided and plain boring after a bit.Thats btw the biggest problem S3 has overall : Long-Term Motivation.Yes you have a max cap of 50 but srsly after you beat the game once (pretty much with level 25 around) the problems with the missions are kicking in.Basically you can just replay the whole game exactly the same way as you did before just with a higher difficulty.Challenging/Motivating : Not so much since voiceacting,level design,waves whatever is exactly the same as you played before so that it feels like the additional 25 more XP level where added later to make the game look as it would have a longer playtime.The EndAll in All its not a terrible game.Its a short,fun,multiplayer-focused action-slasher for a few hours.Nothing more,Nothing less.If you want a Sacred 1/2 Reloaded or a new Dia 3 this is not a game for you and you will end up disappointed but if you can take it as it is it at least gives you some hours of fun.Anyway I´d recommend waiting for a sale or use other sources since 50 bucks for this seems a bit overprized at this point.5.5/10			"

												First things first.  Banish the idea of ""Sacred"" from your mind.  Erase it.  Done? Good.  This isn't Sacred.  The closest existing Sacred game is Sacred Citadel.  But that doesn't make this game bad.  Remember those good old days you spent during your youth? Pumping quarters into a game called Guantlet?  Yeah, this is that, except conveniently located on your home PC/Console, where you can love it forever.Despite others calling it a ""mindless button-masher"", there is a bit of thought involved when combating a massive wad of enemies.  You have standard attack, ""Bash"" (shield breaker), dodge/block, throw/power attack (used on boss type critters to deal a decent chunk of damage), a Light and Heavy Combat Art that use energy, and an Execution to 1-hit knocked down enemies.  Trust me, nothing feels quite like knocking down a group of enemies and then hopping from one to the next with murderous force.Main levels generally consist of moving from arena to arena, mashing through waves of enemies until the barrier disapates, or you get a key drop from some sub-boss, or you clear X number of waves.  But since you enjoyed Gauntlet back in the day, that's not a problem, right?  The only ""loot"" is gold, which you use to upgrade your character between levels, unlocking boosts to combat arts, weapons, and other things, as well as buying potions and the like.Is this Sacred 2++ (thats ""2 incremented by 1"" for you non programming oriented people)? No.Is it fun? Sure, why not?Ignore the fact that it has Sacred in the title, embrace the fact that it is an ""arcade hack and slash"" (as it says in the description, for those of you complaining about it being exactly that), round up some friends, and bludgeon some goblins or whatever they are to a bloody pulp for fun and profit.PS: You really want a controller if you're on PC, cause it may or may not destroy your keyboard.  And it was designed for controllers, so the keyboard controls are probably awkward.			"

												This is NOT like Sacred 1 and 2. If you are expecting that coming into buying this game do not bother. If you like hack and slash games that are similar to Gauntlet with a little bit more polish and some rpg elements (skill / weapon leveling etc.) this game is for you. Most people assumed that this was going to be Sacred 1/2, Diablo 1/2/3 rehash #9000 but it is not. It is hack and slash game straight up. You kill monsters, get gold, level up characters, skills and all the normal stuff. There is no loot and to me it is a good thing. There are already too many games making monsters / chests drop tons of worthless loot. I would rather have this, get fun skills for the different characters and go blow up tons of monsters.Go watch some un-biased videos and reviews to make an ultimate decision on this game. Do not just pass it up because its the Sacred name rebranded with a 3 and not like the first two. People who loved the first 2 games need to take their nostalgia goggles off and look at this game for what it is....a fun hack and slash where you just collect gold and kill tons of monsters.			"

												I like the game so far but it is NOTHING like the other Sacred. I saw in gameplay videos it looked more like a Diablo 3-ish sytle but even that has been dulled down to a basic hack&slash with no real reward for it. The game is enjoyable but all the reasons I pre ordered it are not there and to me is a great let down. Good example of developers believing better graphics surely make a better game but really a weak combat system and dulled variety of gear and powers. I'm fine with the limited character selection and even the limited move set but the game is nothing like it was hyped to be or what the previous entries were like. The game itself is not bad but you can't play it in respects to the other titles in this series. I recommend it only if you don't mind limited level sizes and a very linear story line			"

												It is certainly a departure from the more RPG-like approach of Sacred 1 and 2, which felt more involving, more in-depth and a lot more customisable. That doesn't mean Sacred 3 is bad, it is just -- very different.The game seems to be geared for 15-20 minute short sessions of gameplay, either on your own or with friends / strangers, focussing on quick gameplay and hi-scores, with over-the-top effects and repetitive sections of enemy waves to re-iterate the notion of ""Kill all the monsters, make sure you get the highest score!"" While the story is very cheesy and is rather boring after a while, the sound effects and music work well, and some of the enemies are quite nicely designed. Again, nothing amazing, but good enough for a bit of fun.I've certainly enjoyed playing the game with other players so far, and I must say I enjoyed it. Don't think of it as Sacred 3. Think of it as a co-op-geared action game in the Sacred universe. Is it value for money? That really depends on who you play with, if you're playing on your own then definitely not. If you play as a group and take on all of the optional challenges to see who comes out on top, then do give it a go			"

Just going into it though, it's a pretty fun hack and slash. There's no loot, but you can change your characters playstyle a bit. It's more of a loadout at the beginning of a level kind of thing. All in all, other than a Sacred name slapped on it, this game is enjoyable... for short stints. Not a huge timesink like an ARPG. Just a hack n' slash.			"

												It's a decent game when you get passed that it does not fall in line with the other ""sacred"" games.  The game itself is not too hard, being there is diff levels, play at your own toughness.  I really wanted this game to be a good timewaster but I feel that it's going to be one of those beat it and be done with it kind of games.The loot is pretty much non-existat there are a few things here and there you get, however, I don't think they in much RNG involved more of where you are at the level or the story/The skills and abilites are nice, but the lack of attacks make me wonder why, one of the warrior attacks does not even do damage is more of a debuff or stun/interupt which is fine but when you only have 4 I feel it's a waste of a free action move.Graphics are ok.  Playing this at 2560X1440 helps it look good, with some odd very odd coding, as my 780ti will ramp up and get as hot at 79c while most of the time it sits at 66-67, seems as if parts of the game were not optimized fully.  No sli support out of the gate, (should not need it though)Biggest Con for me though is the very bad voice over scripts not so much the voices but what they say.  Very corny,The telepathic helper if you call her that can be very annoying, when you have 500 mobs on you and she deemands you spin the wheel, I mean wtf can't you sense that I am trying to but have to deal with the mobs first. I understand why they did it, to move the story along for perhaps the ""unaware"" Oh and don't get me started on the spirits, the ones the fuse to your weapon, most of the time they bad stats out weigh the good ones or they become a wash to what's the point in them.  All they do is provide more ""Corny"" dialogue that is not needed, I mean you already have one annoying person talking to you, do we really need another?   Not to mention the enemies scripts.  It's just really really bad.  However, if you can get passed all that, and I mean it might take a strong willed person, there is a good game under it all, as it stands it is a beat em up, with a small RPG element to it, and I say small because its more of a straight line RPG, sure you can go back and gain some levels, but then all you are doing is out leveling the content to make it easy, why not just change the diff then.I don't feel rewarded enough in the game, but I will finish it and most likley edit this review, as it stands it's a good game, with many holes.Worth the 49.99? NoIf you can get it cheaper the better imo. I feel this game should of been released at 29.99 being what it is right now.  Finishing the game and seeing what is beyond might change my tune, but I paid full price and knew going into it I was not going to get my moneys worth at least right away.			"

												If your intent with this game is a big, open, exciting world full of lore and loot, you will be sadly dissappointed. Though, discounting this game simply because of experiences with with the prior titles would cause you to miss out on a world of fun. While it lacks the deep story and customization of Sacred and Sacred 2, the new combat system is a blast to use. The story, so far anyway, is lackluster and disinteresting, but that's not what this game is about.For those of you who have gotten this far, you'll like this game if you're a fan of games like Dynasty Warriors as, ironically, that's what this game feels like. In my opinion, if Sacred made a baby with the Warriors games, this is what I'd expect it to look like. Given that, I'm not surprised by the lack of story or deep customization because the intense combat is the focus. In the future, I personally hope that this combat system is kept and the old system of loot and quests brought back. I really believe that this is a step forward for the combat of the ARP genre.If you can just look past the Sacred title and the history of the series, I think most will enjoy this game. Worst comes to worst, wait for a sale, but I do not suggest those interested in the ARP genre should pass it up.			"

												Only giving this game a positive review because its not a bad game for what it is, Its nothing like Sacred 2 if you loved that, which I did... You cant customize your gear at all other than weapons every few levels, armor is not customizable so far as I can tell but i'm only like 1.5 or 2 hrs into the game, and most importantly its NOT open world, its level to level. Its not a bad game to waste some time on if your just looking for some hack n slash action, but if your looking for that classic RPG style questing game like Sacred 2 you'll be very disappointed, going to play it since I blew $50 dollars on it already... As a hack n slash game I would rate 7/10, as the next installment of sacred I would rate it .5/10.. Only similarity is name and it has Seraphym class or whatever the angel girls are called. Be more careful that I was BEFORE purchase.			"

												-It is not like Sacred 1 and 2. It is a fantasy-themed brawler, light on role playing, heavy on action and fighting.-The graphics are great.-The controls are pretty decent, console controller-oriented.-The story tries to be humorous, but so far is not engaging.-Customize your character between levels. Choose between skills, passive and active effects, and upgrades.Overall: Play it for the gameplay and graphics. Good multiplayer fun. Rating: 7/10			"

												This is a classic hack 'n' slash game with advanced animation, graphics and effects. It is fairly simple in its storyline and plot, but with strong history behind the Sacred world, characters and locations. As far as the game itself is concerned; it is a lot of fun experiencing the comically interluded levels and enhancing one's character to progress, until one tries to complete the main missions on 'Deity' difficulty level, which is a great challenge. I have had a lot of fun playing it and would recommend it to anyone who likes Diablo style games, although it is more science fiction than archaic lore. A good game to play until the true fight begins on the hardest difficulty when it becomes a real key-tapping festival. Despite the 'franticity' as one gets towards level 50 (Max.) in trying to overcome the baddies and complete the storyline missions, it is well worth a crack and maybe you will overcome the challenge. (Good Luck!:)			"

												This game differs of previous Sacred titles but it dose not make it worse. Many players complain it is very bad game. IMHO it is not true. It depends how you perceive Sacred 3. It is a slasher, nice and tasty slasher I missed on PC.  If you are looking for a complex story , crafting, gearing you will not find such stuff here but! If you are looking for a cool arcade way of slashing monsters with fast actions and humors - this game is for you.  Cooperative couch play is the best this game offers to you. Dont forget to cold the beers for a such event ;-) You dont like control your character by WASD? Why dont you invest in game controller and bust the arcade style of the game.   It is a slasher and I like this!			"

												The first two Sacred games were ARPG Diablo clones; in a countless list of those going towards the early 2000's Sacred was one of the best alternatives for those that already destroyed Diablo. Sacred 2 more recently took a page from other ARPGs, but remained a stat-based action roleplaying game, just like Diablo.Sacred Citidel would have been right at home on Kongregate or at an Arcade - it was a mediocre Castle-Crashers style beat'em'up side-scrolling RPG. SACRED 3 hads a lot of people frothing at the mouth about how it was not true to its own roots, and it's being accused universally of being a bad game, it is not!People are reviewing what they expected, rather than what the game is. Sacred 3 is a mixture of Sacred 1/2 and Sacred Citadel, that does not try to be an alternative to Diablo 3 (Torchlight 2 is better). In fact, what it is, is a Really Decent classic hack'n'slash adventure game. There isn't much of a loot system, there are no real stats, you sort of have levels, it's not really an RPG. It is better at being what I expected from the Gauntlet reboot (Coming later in August 2014) than what Gauntlet 2014 looks to be.Fans of Diablo? Stay away. Missing the smashfest days of Dark Legacy? Come get some. Bring a friend and a controller.			"

												First off it is true that this game is nothing like the first two games in the series, action RPG it is not. I was hoping it would be a less buggy Sacred 2. That was disappointing. But being the old school gamer I am I still ended up liking it and having fun. This game took me back to more arcade like action most similar to Gauntlet Dark Legacy or Legends rather than the 80's Gauntlet. I loved those games! Sometimes a little mindless action is a good break after wrapping my head around Divinity O.S. If you like old school arcade action you will enjoy this like me. Maybe they should just have given it a different name.			"

Be that as it may I feel that sacred 3 is entirely worth it if you enjoy hack and slash cheasy humor games with friends. If you want an open world game with lots of loot this is not the game for you.There will be new game glitches and errors but I personally have not encountered any as of yet. Go watch some videos and see for yourself before jumping to forum conclusion.			"

												I've played the game for about 10 hours.  and I have to say that for what the game is... it's an enjoyable distraction for awhile.  there is definitly a lot of variation in the levels that you will come across in the game.  Also I would say that the character's abilities are different enough that you would want to try each of them to see what best fits your play style.  As for the name of the game Sacred 3, many people are getting stuck on this.  Yes I've played and have beaten both Sacred 1 and 2.  aid if you are expecting to find a game like that,  then unfortunatly you will be sadly disappointed.  and like many have said, perhaps giving this game another name would have most likely been a better option.  About the only thing that this game holds true to the sacred name is some of the characters and of course the setting of the game itself.  Pros for the game:- Good graphics- Drop in/drop out multiplayer.  - the player level advancement is well paced as you move through the levels- varied boss and monster mechanics- Unique enough playable characters that you would want to try all of themCons for the game:- It's sacred in name and name only this is for the most part a top down hack 'n slash- Character development is extremely limited you can only unlock/upgrade skills by reaching certain levels- Finding upgrades is linked to specific levels in the game- Game really isn't mouse/keyboard friendly, was definitly designed with consoles in mindOver all.  the game is a nice nice distraction for awhile and also a good addition to the Sacred Universe of games but has been preveriously stated, this game really doesn't desver the title of Sacred 3 and in face this type of game could possibly spawn it's own series within the sacred universe and would have honestly been a better idea.

												Love Sacred 1, mainly because of the Vampire. Didn't really like Sacred 2, the open world was too big and you could wonder aimlessly with little progress. Sacred 3 is basicly Diablo Story Mode with multiplay, I must perfer this type of game play than the open the world. I stopped playing Sacred 2 because of the world being so hugh and getting anywere even by horse/way points was annoying. If you like Diablo then you'll love Sacred 3. The voice acting is a little poor, sounds like children but it doesn't distract from the game (though it does try).			"

												Russian and EnglishИтак - к делу. Очень неплохой hack-and-slash в стиле Диабло, но с сильным уклоном в сторону аркады. Аркадность игры компенсируется РПГ-элементами, однако без системы Диабло - то-есть теперь снаряжение открывается за уровни опыта, а берется за золото. Процесс уничтожения врагов не заставляет ""сильно напрягатся"" с одной стороны, а с другой - хотите серъёзней - ставьте уровень сложности повыше. Экипировка и умения дают возможность подобрать собственный стиль - здесь игра идеальна для всех игроков. Игра в ко-опе помогает немного быстрее набирать опыт и золото - здравствуй Диабло. В целом что сказать - здравствуй Sacred 3 после бездарного Sacred 2 - хорошо во всём - но... Во-первых почему нет звука в стартовой заставке? Во-вторых не совсем удачно подобраны реплики ""духов оружия"" - обещали нам что те расскажут историю Анкары, а на деле они просто фоновая озвучка игрового процесса. В третьих - графика: неплоха, но что-то маловато по сравнению с первым Sacred. В четвертых - камера иногда совершает повороты в связи со интро-сценами и в тот момент не очень удобно бежать, благо там нет врагов. И последнее - слишком много не нужной секс-тематики в репликах, слишком простенькая экипировка со старта и, самое плохое, консольность - хотя управление на ПК нормальное.В целом - берите, но из ДЛС советую только доп. миссии - остальное позже.So - lets start. Very good hack-and-slash Diablo style but with big shift to arcade. Arcade elements are compensaded with RPG-elements allow game to avoid catch-the-loot Diablo style - gear is opening for exp and equipping for gold. Process of cleaning mobs aren't difficult - but if you want challenge, just switch to higher difficulty - gear and skills allow any player mix their own combo - on that this game is ideal for any player. Co-op game allow to boost exp and gols - hello Diablo. In general what can i say - hello Sacred 3, after poor Sacred 2 - good in all, but...First - where is sound at the intro. Second - not quite good voice acting of spirits - devs promised that they will tell us story of Ancara, but they more ""talk in action"" when we killing mobs. Third - graphics - not bad, but that is all - compare with Sacred 1 it's moderate. Fourth - camera make some rotate in game intro-scenes, run at that moment isn't very comfortable but good that there are no enemies. And the last - too many intimacy at the voice-acting, too simple gear from beggining and the last and most worse - console-style - however on PC cointrols are normal.In general - game is worth, but in DLC advise you to take only story expansion - rest later.

												It's no sacred 2 sequel, but after playing gauntlet, it definatly feels like a guantlet inspired game. Played with that mindset its more enjoyable than expecting sacred rpg equipment leveling and open world. so its a alternative more fleshed out guantlet.. and as that, its quite good! It's just not good as a sacred 2 follow up :(For the price though, its not that much, and sadly not even any visible progression in technical features. if anything theyre heavily dumbed down in all aspects, from graphics, to speech, to lack of open world. you would think with such restricted maps, you could have better graphics than sacred 2 did with open world.. and with so many years of technology between.So i thumbs the game up with a grain of salt so far. it is okay to play.. but it it tedious, but. its possibly better than gauntlet at being gauntlet.. co-op hacking through waves of challenges. but if you want an rpg. get sacred 2.. or torchlight 2			"

												Yeah, it's not Sacred 2 open world style, with classic quests like escorting a little girl home. You know, when I'm playing as an Undead, evil-aligned shadow warrior devoted to demonic worship.Sacred 3 is all mindless brawl, choose 2 skills per level, choose from the weapons you've unlocked for that character with different bonuses like increased crit chance, chance to stun or just outright damage, I'm only level 5 on two characters so haven't unlocked armour upgrades for either yet, got a bunch of weapon spirits, some of which would only be useful to a team (-10% from health orbs for you, +10% for the team)I admit I pre-ordered off the back of Sacred 2, found out that it was all corridors, didn't cancel my pre-order anyway  and having enough fun rampaging. Difficulty is pretty good on legendary, I'm not storming through the levels now and I'll have to start co op soon as dying in the same spot, near enoughThe humour is clearly aimed at kids, the voiceovers from General Aria annoying at best, the writing is poor, only the starting weapon spirit is useful to me so far so can't comment on their voiceovers, but expect them to be as bad as the rest. Even the main characters sound stupid but, as far as mindless rampage games go, this one seems ok.It's not worth anything like full price though, £10-15 at best			"

												Despite all the bad reactions this game has been getting, I'm going to try and give this my honest opinion.First off, the game is called sacred 3. That name is all wrong, the only thing it has in common with sacred 1 and 2 is the universe it plays in. Sacred 1 and 2 were giant games, with a huge open world and lots and lots of loot.This game has none of that. It's a pretty standard isometric top down view brawler in a fantasy setting. But does that make this game a bad game?Well if you bought it expecting the same kind of content as part 1 and 2 had, then you most likely will not like this game.However, if (like me) you've read the gaing news and previews and reviews about this game, you could have known exactly what it was. And im gonna say that, if you accept this game fro what it is. It's not bad, not at all. And actually very fun to play in co-op with some friends.Is it the same quality as sacred 1 and 2? no, not even close. It should not have been called sacred 3.But that doesnt mean it is as bad as a lot of people say it is.			"

												I've played it for few hours, didn't explore much of the game, but I managed to experience most of the mechanics.It isn't your usual hack'n'slash game. I'd say the mechanics are like you would mix these of Sacred and Devil May Cry.Overhead view mixed with mashing buttons to spam spells. You don't drop equipment like in any of this kind of game. You sometimes receive new weapon for you character after a mission. Also skill/spell gain is totally different. You don't drop skillstones as you would in previous games. You buy skills with gold. About gold, it's pretty much only thing you drop from enemies. Apart from green healing orbs and yellow 'mana' orbs. This is kinda similar to these from God of War games. With gold you upgrade your weapons and skills to have additional effects, so having less skills/equip in general is not that bad as you can 'evolve' them with coins. Combat is really action packed! Much difference comparing to old Sacreds. For me it's even more fast-paced than Diablo 3, but that's just an opinion. Throwing minions into each other or executing them is great. I'm too lazy to write more, but I might edit this reveiw once I'll play more of the game.			"

												Do not expect that you'll take the game like Sacred or even Sacred 2 when you bought it 'cause it's hack'n'slash arcade, it's not the old school style RPG! It's more like Bastion! And if you change your point of view the game is very nice. It have awesome weapons/skills system and beauty co-op mode with skills and spirits usefull for your teammates.Playing on third difficult now (maximum avaliable at start) and have a lot of fun and action.Also love the voices of heroes and the phrases (full of humor) of protagonist guide that follows you and help you understanding the game mechanics and missions targets.So.. we all got not the game as we expect.. but that game is very nice for me for sure! If you love Bastion or Magica, take this, you love it too I promise ^_^			"

												For all those who are crying About This GameSacred 3 is an arcade Hack ‘n’ Slash game for up to four players, set in the war for Ancaria. Choose from legendary heroes and fight together against the rise of evil. You will face hordes of grimmocs, brute beasts, legions of mercenaries and undead wizards. Develop your character’s skills and abilities and band together to use powerful co-op abilities and tactics. Victory Is Ours. Glory Is Mine.doesnt sound like a Playstyle Sequel to Sacred 1 and 2 before you buy it .. get some information about it			"

												NOTE: This review is writte from a neutral unbiased point of view with the goal to create a review for these who will like the game for what it became.Alright now let us jump into it.This game is nothing like the series. It is not an open world RPG with hundreds of different weapons and armors, the number of skills and things you can level up on your own is also limited.So if you were looking for the old Sacred experience this is the point where you would like to leave.Now let us get to the part where we talk about what the game is.* It is hack'n'slay!* It is kind of like a sidescroller* It has 100s of mobs swarming around you waiting to be killed* It is a mission based gameSo who would actually enjoy that kind of game? Well if you are the type who both enjoys the Devil May Cry series as well as Diablo then it might be the solid mix between the two that you MIGHT enjoy, especially when playing with friends.While i do enjoy it so far it is not what i expected but i remain neutral about it. As far as the price goes, if you have a lot of money to spend then sure why wouldn't you wanna buy the game if you are the type of person that would like it? However the game is not worth it's price and it is the only point that makes me sad  about it so far.It's ok to go in a different way. It is ok to try something new. It is refreshing. In some way.Now it's up to you to pick a side.Will you leave having been looking for the old Sacred experience? Or will you appreciate the work that has been put into this game?I am a gamer and so i say that every game has one aspect or the other that one can enjoy if the game is actually really really bad which Sacred 3 is not.Edit: Final thoughts: The game is not what Sacred used to be so the title Sacred 3 is missleading. Just a different project name would have saved the game from a lot of negative reaction. The game itself is not bad... Just overpriced... And different...And here some ""TL;DRs""Player Case 1 (Old Schooler):You are looking for the old Sacred experience? It is not here. Might as well leave.Player Case 2 (Open Minded yet a bit poor):You still DO want the game but you do not have too much money to spend? I suggest waiting until a big sale bring it down by at LEAST 50% then it is worth the price.Case 3 (Open Minded... With money):You have the money and you like the direction of the game despite the developers having moved away from what this game is? Take it.Oh i also appreciate the developers having tried to introduce humor in the dialogues			"

												Much like Dungeon Siege 3, Sacred 3 has little in common with its predecessors besides a name, setting and bright, colourful visuals. It's not so much an 'action RPG' as it is an 'arcade RPG' - more Gauntlet than Diablo. Pick one of four (five via preorder or DLC) pre-made hero/ines and get down to the business of clicking stuff until it dies.In many ways, Sacred 3 has more in common with the download-only Sacred Citadel than its heavier RPG brothers - it's a button mashing brawler at heart, with linear levels and only as much level-up and customisation option as necessary to give the player some agency. Collectibles are limited to helth, energy and gold - the latter being used to buy upgrades or new skills when you level up.There's no denying Sacred 3 won't be everyone's cup of tea - it is practically designed for couch co-op with friends and beers, or breezy online play while you and your mates mash buttons and talk trash. It has that quirky European sense of humour that made Sacred 2 surprisingly funny, although tempered by what the developers clearly think an American audience will find funny (and spoiler alert, you probably won't). That said, it has an awkward charm about it that'll either make you snicker, or at least roll your eyes with a smile.Performance wise, the game runs flawlessly on my machine, the first $50+ game in quite a few months to do so (Wolfenstein, Watch Dogs I am looking at you). The visuals aren't amazing and shouldn't tax most systems, but the art style is big and colourful and mostly pleasing on the eye. Playing on my 46"" TV it can be a bit hard to make out what is going on when there's a lot of enemies on the screen, but it's usually only a few seconds until everything is dead from one of your combat abilities.The music is good and the voice acting is serviceable, although leaning towards the annoying end of the spectrum. There's a surprising amount of it too, with various 'souls' you can equip for a passive bonus, and each one has its own personality and one-liners. Word to the wise: the default guy you get is super annoying, so don't forget you can switch him out after a mission or two.All in all, Sacred 3 is a competent hack & slash adventure, one best experienced with friends and in shorter sessions. It's far from perfect, and it's a departure from its predecessors, but with Divinity: Original Sin out there to get your more traditional RPG fix, this is the perfect antidote for when you just want to switch off your brain and bash some orcs.

												Apparently people don't bother to read a description and expect a game to be just as previous parts simply because it has the same name.It's a decent arcade Hack 'n slash, and yes that includes some repetitive game play, but it make it a great game to play for a bit if you're in the mood for something simple. It's not open world, it's not immersive, it's just something nice to play when you need  a break from one of those other games. It's simply what I expected before I bought it.As for the price, of course don't pay the full price on steam, get it elsewhere and you can save about half of the price even in the preorder phase. But most games aren't worth the full price Steam starts them out on, I would say $10 - $15 would be a reasonable price for a game such as this.			"

												The game holds the name Sacred 3 upon itself, but it's a very different game from its predecessors. There is no open world here, there isn't real loot you'll find dropping from your enemies, just gold, health globes and energy globes.The story seems silly and from the start it's apparent that the game doesn't take itself seriously at all, beginning from the narrator, continuing to what the NPCs say including even your own character and the Souls attached to your weapons.You play in confined levels that can be pretty short or somewhat long that you pick from a map, after which you get dropped into the level and that you'll navigate until the boss fight at the end, after which you'll leave.After certain fights (usually Bosses that I've seen) you'll find new Souls for your weapon, as well as new weapons that you'll be able to use (and upgrade if you are high level enough and have enough gold) after completing the mission.The action is pretty hectic, with enemies attacking in droves while the player has to try and dodge out of the way of powerful attacks, break the shield of bigger enemies to be able to hurt them or stop certain enemies from casting (or interrupt althogether their spell) all the while managing the use of skills that use a limited energy resource.Personally, I wanted this to be closer to the old games, something more akin to Sacred 2 but, so far, I have been having fun with what this game has to offer. The action can get very busy and even at the normal level of difficulty I found that dying can become rather easy if not paying attention at getting out of the way. Killing the groups of enemies coming at you and emerging victorious is also another fun aspect of the game.The commands are responsive, the game looks quite nice and performs really well even when downsampling from something like 2880x1620.I have found a problem with the game crashing whenever I open the friend menu in game but I'm not sure if that's the game or something on my PC.All in all, the experience with the game so far is really positive. Probably not an experience worth 50€, but I didn't pay that much for it when I preordered, so it's more of a problem for anyone that would want to grab the game now.			"

The makers of those games started making Unbended.Want to enjoy yourself with a nice addictive beat em up? Play THIS!!***Korte preview versie:Sacred 3Sacred 3 is een 3D beat ‘em up met een RPG-achtig verhaal. Kies een klasse en bevrijd Ancaria van de slechte Zane. De omgevingen waar je dit in doet zijn wisselend en kleurrijk.Versla massa’s vijanden en bazen. Versterk je moves en wapens. Verken nieuwe gebieden. Ram bekende gebieden opnieuw leeg voor meer goud en xp. En doe dit alles met vrienden: het spel is gemaakt voor vette multiplayeractie.Waarom gaat dit spel slagen?Dit belooft een hele degelijke beat ‘em up te worden.

Het enige wat het goed doet is de verslavingsfactor en laten we eerlijk zijn, een spel heeft niet veel meer nodig. Denk maar aan Minecraft als een recent voorbeeld.Waar kan het misgaan?Het spel heet Sacred 3 en vele fans wachten al heel lang op een vervolg dat een hele vette actie-RPG zou moeten worden.

												Sacred 3 promises a third person isometric hack n slash arcade RPG, and it definitely delivers. Sacred 3 brings all of the wit and humour of Sacred Citadel to a faster, more arcade feeling gaming experience with engaging story, interesting characters and completely functional, highly competitive 4 player co-op. Though, the price point may be a little high for the content.	The loot is all but gone from this game, staying true to the arcade feel. Instead you are awarded weapons and weapon upgrades, items, item slots and armor upgrades by completing story and side missions. The weapon and armor upgrades are given to you in a cycle through completing story missions; Weapon 1, Weapon 2, Weapon 3, Armour. Start again with the next four story missions. You progress through these missions through a hub-based world map guided by the Seraphim Aria, and each node on the map can take between 2 and 20 minutes to complete. These range from clearing out a single pathway, surviving 5 waves of enemies to sieging a fortress.  You can visit any node on the map at any time, in any order and however many times you wish, though the final encounter only unlocks after all other story missions have been cleared. A single clear through the map will take you roughly 8 playing hours, 10 for the second. The replayability comes from multiple characters, chasing high scores and playing with your friends.	As you traverse each map node, of which there are 40, the telepathic Seraphim Aria will attempt to guide you. She is only a novice, so don't be too hard on her! She will give you helpful pointers for where to go and roughly what to do, though it is worth mentioning that if you ignore her suggestions, she will harass you until you do it which can become a little bit annoying at times.	The game's difficulty settings ARE actually what they say they are. Knight (Easy) is mindnumbingly easy for a skilled player. You should be in absolutely no danger on this mode, even if you've never played a video game of any kind before. Champion (Medium) is a little more difficult, but nothing short of bosses should give you any trouble. Legend (Hard) is the first difficulty in which health potions should even be needed. You definitely don't want to look away from a fight here! Once you have completed the map on Knight, Champion or Legend, Deity (Impossible) becomes available. Deity increases the suggested level and difficulty of each node on the map, and will be very difficult if attempted without at least one other party member, and it is here that the co-op multiplayer really shines. 	The co-op multiplayer is entirely optional, however. Drop in/drop out co-op can be disabled by setting your play session to 'private' if you're more the single player type. You will not be forced to play with any AI companions for doing this either. If you'd rather not have the Online feature at all, Sacred 3 does have an offline mode. Should you choose to partake in the co-op multiplayer, you will be in the same playspace as between 1 and 3 other players. You will work together to clear the map in a strange but kind of fun blend of cooperation and oneupmanship. Exactly how points are awarded is unclear at this point. Simply killing more enemies than your cooperators is not enough to come out with the high score. HOW you kill them matters too. If one of your party members falls in battle, reviving them will also score you some points. 	The combat is fast and functional, with new combat arts for each of the four new classes and the returning Seraphim to use, as well as weapon spirits and three weapons each. Each weapon has it's own unique specialty to suit your playstyle. Do you like to keep enemies on their back? Plough through them with brutal force? Dance around the battlefield? It's up to you! Though it is worth nothing that some features/actions are shared between the five classes, so to a certain degree once you have played one it will be very easy to get into another one, and after a while the cycle of dodge and attack starts to feel samey.	Weapon spirits are shards that you collect at random throughout Ancaria, each with it's own personality and modifier for your abilities, ranging from lifesteal, party buffs, shielding, damage reduction, enemy debuffing and more. The spirits have voices, and speak to you as well as your party. This companionship between weapon and wielder adds quite a bit of fun to the game, as the running commentary brings out a lot of laughs. You level them up by finding more shards, boosting their power and thusly, the effect they pass on to you.	Every aspect of your character (with the exception of weapon spirits) are upgradeable using gold found throughout the game. Once you have reached the level requirement to be elligible for the upgrade, you can buy it with gold to boost or change the function of your weapons, armor, combat arts, as well as to buy consumables. There is plenty of gold to be found in the game, so you will usually have more gold than upgrades to spend it on, taking the grind out of the equation.The enemies vary in strength and skills as the game progresses, though they seem to share some abilities from level 1 and on, only adding either extra abilities or extra effects to make them more dangerous, though there is very little variety in the enemies themselves. Most of the bosses feel bossy, but these can be usually be navigated simply by dodging away when they attack and not standing in the goo. Only a handful of the bosses have any mechanics that make fighting them different from any other. The game does start to feel samey in this regard.		The game has full mouse, keyboard and gamepad support as well as built-in voice communication service. However it is readily apparent that this is a console port as it feels way more natural to play the game with a gamepad. The default keyboard and mouse settings feel somewhat obtuse. Though you are able to map the keyboard and mouse as well as the gamepad to your preference, so with some tweaking the game is very playable with either.	The visuals, special effects, voice acting and optimisation are phenominal. The game is pure beauty, with amazing environments, smooth camera angles and lively and vibrant voice acting. 	All told Sacred 3 and it's prequel, Sacred Citadel are GREAT games, and I recommend that any isometric RPG or arcade brawler fan play them. However it is my personal hope that Sacred 4, should there be one, return to the loot-crazed, open worlded and more serious toned Sacred and Sacred 2: Fallen Angel crafted by Ascaron. There are only two jokers in a deck. Deep Silver has played both.Notable bugs/issues(PC):-The game is 20GB for no apparent reason.-The game does not remember your resolution setting from one session to the next-The game locks up without warning and without reason from time to time-Crash to desktop-Sometimes can't equip certain weapons for no apparent reason-Steam overlay sometimes sticks to the edges of the screen in-game.

YouTube™ Video: Sacred 3 review - no nonsense Hack 'n' Slashing 

			Views: 14,147		

			A review of Sacred 3 from Deep Silver which is available on Xbox 360/PS3 and PC. Enjoy the video please subscribe to help grow the channel.		

In a nutshell, Sacred 3 is a solid hack and slash game that offers a no nonsense approach that's easy to pick up and play for those who want to hammer away at few attack buttons and little else for several hours. There's no menus to wade through or complexity of character progression which means players who thirst for killing can do so without hindrance.  In this regard the game succeeds, but at the same time does become repetitive quite quickly unless you're well in tune with levelling up your character, or willing to try the others classes to add some variety. As mentioned, if you're a fan of the previous games that afford more depth and exploration, then you're going to probably feel a little let down with what's on offer here as the game is Sacred by name, but certainly not in execution.Score 7/10 - Review By  Robert Cram			"

Sacred 3Rating: 6/10First of all this game should not be called Sacred 3. Sacred 1 and 2 were open world games RPG games. Sacred 3 however breaks with the previous iterations and aims for a more console like gameplay. A similar thing happend with Dungeon Siege III. The game is situated in the same world as before, but that is where all comparisons end. Really.Sacred 3 is a extremely linear, controller-friendly hack-and-slash game, with virtually no RPG elements. It looks pretty, the sound is ok albeit that the comments and voices are very cheesy and becomes annoying soon. Always a lot is happening on the screen so it get's kinda messy sometimes. But that's ok, just hack and hope to survive. With this game and mechanics, you either like it or you don't. I kinda like this game for what it is. Only if you could shut up that woman...One very, very annoying thing is that it doesn't have a pause function. This is really lame so you have to complete the mission or find a safe spot.So if you are looking for a open-world, customizations, character-building rpg \ hack-and-slash game, look further. This is definitely nothing for you. If you want to have a nice couch game with scarce dressed women, lots of actions and easy drop-in\drop-out give this a try.Played it single player.			"

												The only thing this game has in similar to the previous titles are the names, the Seraphim and the setting. They took the things that made the first two great and tore them out.If you want something that's like a cross between an interactive book and an arcade beam-em-up, this might be for you. If you're a fan of sacred in any way like the rest of us, it's the biggest load of rubbish ever. The only good side I see to it is that you can get a refund ^_^			"

												Playing through the first 3 levels alone i felt that the game is a bit lacking. But when i tried to connect with other players online it was instantly much more fun.You can combine your powers and wreck minions instantly while battling who get's the highest score, oh and the mobs scale with how many players are involved. Deity difficultywith 4 people? Yes please.I was a bit dissappointed that i couldn't in any way mute my microphone, so if you have a microphone and are going to play online, prepare for a chat. And the DLC'S doesn't seemto work as it says ""You own this dlc"" on all three of them but i can't play the Malakhi and ican't seem to find the spirit weapon either, oh well.... This might be a bug. So in light of the multiplayer experience, the boss mechanics, the comical villain8/10 so far.			"

												For all the haters! I'm fan of sacred and sacred 2 and i can't see bad thing when they make hack and slash game with all our favorite heroes. If you don't like that it's not rpg don't buy it. If you want to play rpg get something else. I just can't get your problem. When they anounced the game like months ago, before steam i knew what it was gona be and i don't hate, it just not rpg, lol. The creators clearly defined the product as hack and slash. Maybe you are mad cos you buy the game and then realised it's not like sacred and sacred 2, but if you don't want to buy it cos it's hack and slash it your desition, don't hate, just dont open your pretty speaking devices ^^.For hack and slash it's rly, rly good game. It tons of fun. Voiceover is amazing and weaponspirits are craaaazy. It has legit story. Played it 2h and def gona lv up all chars and play lots of co-op with frds. There are different weapons that you unlock and can upgrade with lv and money. Different skills, passives, defence skills that you upgrade. You upgrade and unlock different armors.  It's what you will want to play if you like good hack and Slash.  "

												Hey,What I like:* superb graphics* good gameplay* look and feel of a polished product* controller support* oriented more to casual players, who want to play a limmited amount of time and don't want to waste thousand of hours and get screwed by RNG )* hilarious dialogs ( ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ american jokes, but hey, I'm a big fan of retareded amrican comedies :) )What I don't like:* too few customization of the hero:THIS MUST BE ADDRESSED IMmEDIATELY IN THE NEXT PATCH/DLC/EXPANSION, GOT THAT KEEN GAMES/DEEP SILVER??!?!!? Anyway, I think this one is fixable If they want to* overpriced for what it offers ( 30 - 35 euros would have been fair )* NO LOOT ( also fixable if )* no open world* why did they name it Sacred ??!?!?!?! ( big mistake )Ok, so generally I'm recommending this game because it's better that Dungeon Siege 3. Which I've also enjoyed and finished.  I mean you can't deny that it's a pretty well made game, yes with some HUGE mistakes, but guys, If they can fix the loot/customization in a future patch or so, then maybe it will get better.However, I think it's a clear sign of what we want Keen/Deep so get your asses and give us what we want. I've bought the game, and will support it in the future, but only if you improve character customization/skills, to be much more.  "

												Nothing like the previous titles, but pretty good nonetheless.First of all, I'd suggest avoiding the game completely if you don't have a controller. The keyboard and mouse set up is awful.Secondly, it isn't open world, so if that's your thing, the game will disappoint.As for the game itself. It's exactly as advertised. An arcade hack 'n' slash. It's fast paced and linear, but pretty fun with 4 players.You collect gold as you play to pay for any skills/weapons upgrades you want once you reach the minimum level requirement.There's no real emphasis on depth or builds, meaning that anyone can pick up and play.Where they went wrong was calling the game Sacred 3. We all wanted Sacred 3 to be an open world/dungeon crawler/adventure rpg and possibly some more Blind Guardian. ;)Having bought the game £10 cheaper than for sale on Steam and having all the DLC thrown in, I can't complain.I'd much rather have an open world Sacred, but so far I have been enjoying the game.Definitely not worth the £40 Steam are looking for. And if open world is your thing, avoid at all costs.Seems like it'll be a great little time killer, though. If in doubt wait for a sale. :P			"

												If you LOVVVVED sacred 2, then you will hate sacred 3. It has been the biggest disappointment. you have like 8ish abilities per characted, which are all about the same, they are over powered and most of it ITS COMPLETELY LINIER, NO OPEN WORLD. Worse buy so far, the best thing i can say about it is its easier to use, play and it looks better.			"

If you read some of the other reviews, many of them are about how this game sucks as a Sacred game. I don't know, if thats true, but on its own, it's pretty fun.

												The only thing bother me so far is the full screen setting. Every time I tab to destop, it would go back to windows mode again (  so I need to do the full screen setting again). For the game, I enjoyed pretty much. It is a very nice try to make a ""dataless"" ARPG. You don't need to worry about your DPS,you HP, your armor..your strength..your AGI..your INT.....your..your...and you don't need to loot the legendary. Quite a new experience for ARPG. And also the stunning graphic. Like it so far. But, right now, not so sure if it is a lasting game.			"

												This game is so bad....... If you have played Sacred 1 and 2 and you enjoyed the open world, the loot drops and that you can make your own combo attacks, then you should never ever in your entire life, not for a split second even consider of buying this.....abomination.....of the Sacred series..... The open world isn't there, not even in the slightest form....if you completed a section of a level, a wall of force is created behind you so you must keep going. The only adjustments you can make to your character are so limited that you think: Well this is a waste of time.I cannot image who in the whole multiverse would ever has the opinion that this game, is a great game. This game is so bad that not even in the alternative version of our world anyone would think this is a great game. I played it for 3 hours to get a good opinion of this game and i regret the day I was thinking: Well maybe I might enjoy this game. I regret the money I used to buy this game, would have prefered to give it to some drug addicts, atleast they would buy drugs and feel happy for a few hours and I regret to have spend 3.3 hours into this game cause I could have hit my head against a brick wall and experience more positive feeling while doing that..........If you still buy this game now........ Imagine the next situation: Your chained to a bomb. Infront of you is a computer, the main screen of Sacred 3 is shown, next to the computer is a timer and a television screen. As the screen turns on you see the puppet of the Saw series: Hello [insert name]. I want to play a game. You decided to buy Sacred 3 and now you must free yourself from the thoughts of enjoyment given by this game. You as sitting on a bomb which will explode in 6 hours unless you manage to really enjoy this game for atleast 4 hours. Next to the timer is a happiness-meter. If the meter goes into the :-| face it won't count towards the 4 hours of enjoyment. Live or Die. You decide.You are screwed......... Goodbye			"

Oo) || - even the levels have a specific routine, you have to kill enemy waves and activate some dumb levers or♥♥♥♥♥♥and there is something you have to dodge like trolls throwing rocks or smth...Summary: I absolutely NOT recommending to buy this game, if you played Sacred 1, Sacred Gold or Sacred 2... this game has nothing to do with Sacred !

												After quite some time and thought i decided to change my point on Sacred 3. After playing the original titles it felt like this game shouldnt be called Sacred at all. The game has some nice graphics and the gameplay is intuitive and doesnt require any skillcap so its a game for the casual player.I as the complete opposite of the casual player felt like the game didnt have enough content. I miss browsing traders, farming area bosses, hoping for the loot that enables a certain playstyle.I simply feel like the game is too simple in its structure and doesnt offer much to play.I can see how it can be fun sitting on your couch with your buds casually doing a playthrough once, or maybe once a year and having a blast, but i cannot recommend this game at all.

												Sacred 3 is a bit of a mixed bag, and innovates the series in an opposite direction, but is a decent time waster when on 75% off.I had never played a Sacred game before this. So when I saw this game I was impressed by it's art style and the dungeons in it's screenshots. However the game was immediately swarmed by negative reviews and as it stands it is one of the worst games on Steam.But does it deserve that distinction.As someone who only now (as of this review) just played Sacred 2, I have to say I had better first impressions of Sacred 3, but that's not to say that the criticism is unfounded.First of all, the game is level based, instead of open world. The story is about generic evil bad guy overlord called Zane tries to take over Ancaria. And the Seraphim form a team of warriors to fight him off. Pretty boring stuff. The levels while linear as hell are at least nice to look at, and the visual effects as enemies are slaughtered are satisfying. However, the combat is poor. Clicking the left mouse button attacks, right mouse button counters (in a way, it just stuns most opponents when they are about to strike.) Pressing 1 or 2 activates a special ability. Yes, you can only have 2 abilities instead of a full bar. And as abilities go they are pretty generic. You can also dodge roll, but it sucks. Because you roll in the direction of your MOUSE, and not in the direction of your WASD or whatever you use. At least with keyboard and mouse controls. It might be better with a controller.Customization of characters and equipment, ready for it? Is ♥♥♥♥ing NONEXISTANT. Weapons are gained at certain points in the story, and upgrades are basic up damage, up crit, up range etc. You cannot get new armour or anything, and levelling up just gets you more upgrades. It might actually be better if levelling wasn't in the game at all to be honest, but they had to make this as RPG-y as possible I guess.The story and dialougue is the most unfunniest bull you will ever hear and read in your life. And this is someone who loves games like Stick RPG 2 and Duke Nukem Forever (DNF's writing anyway, the gameplay can go to hell). I find the writing in Sacred 3 some of the dumbest♥♥♥♥♥♥I've ever had to hear, and it looks like a game script I would write at the age of NINE. Freaks sakes. But I actually enjoy the writing, because we all need some lame humour in our lives every now and then, and Trump jokes are overdone.And the dlcs are kinda... mediocre. You get basically more missions of the same friggin gameplay, which is actually my biggest complaint about Sacred 3. It is repetitive as hell. Even the side missions are killmobs.gif. Because it repeats. Over. And. Over.The game, in my opinion, can be best described as an unfunnier Borderlands, with no loot worth playing for, and cringier dialogue. So why do I recommend it then?Like I said at the start, I find it a mixed bag. I have stated all negatives so far, but there is one thing that I recommend it for.When you are bored as hell, or stressed, and just want to play something stupid. Something you don't want to pay much attention too. Just an arena for you to beat up orc and trolls. That's what it's for. It also helps if you are drunk, but hey.Do get this on a sale though, you don't want to pay full price for something that is basically fun for 5 minutes at a time.			"

												Not a bad game, but if you're looking for a game even remotly as it's predecessors..Keep moving, this is nothing like the previous Sacred games.This is a pure hack n slash, so have that in mind buying it.I'm as dissapointed as anyone else that isn't more like Sacred 1 and 2.But It doesn't feel right to give it a bad review on that fact alone.It's a ok game and pretty fun with a friend or solo if you like the type of game.Tried it on Steam/Pc, but actual gameplay is done on playstation if you wonder why I have 0,1h logged ;)			"
