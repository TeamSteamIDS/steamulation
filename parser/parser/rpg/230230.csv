												The short version:Divinity: Original Sin aims to be a modern day Ultima 7 and is reminiscent of many of the older games in the genre, it will make many of you who did like games such as Baldurs Gate II and Planescape Torment very happy indeed, especially if you also like turn based tactical combat. Players will be able to create a team, make choices and see how the consequences of their actions bear out. The long version:This is a game with little to no hand holding and it does not insult your intelligence by making this game accessible to your five year old sister, no this game is a deep tactical turn-based RPG experience.  Not only will you have freedom over your choices in the story (consequences and choices, even disagreements, will affect how things go), but also in how you get there.You will be forced to interact with the world and speak to the people in it to gain information and quests, this is especially true as there are no exclamation marks over their heads telling you that this person is important or that they have information you need. It's also a game that rewards exploration, should you be careless enough you could find yourself completely missing out on certain quests. You can even kill most npc's in the game should you wish to do so (with the exception of a very few plot specific ones), but be careful of what you decide to do, there will be consequences for your actions.There will be puzzles, lots of traps and mysteries to solve and interesting ways to approach many of the quests, you have the freedom to go wherever you want and the areas/monsters -wont- scale to your level, meaning you could die a very horrible death by exploring too far when you are low level. You could also be very skillful with the items/weapons at hand and somehow actually kill that level four troll while you are just a meager level two knight.Being a rogue is especially fun as you can steal nearly everything, including snatching paintings off the walls, pick pocketing their weapons or even keys to their homes for a later ""visit"". Stealth is also very viable when stealing, but be careful, if you are caught people will dislike you and that will affect prices and information you can get, eventually you will be thrown into jail. Once there your partner can either come and bust you out or... well.. i wont spoil the surprise for you, suffice to say that there are more ways than one to get out of jail.Party-based turn-based combat will encourage players to shape and control the game's environments, and to discover and utilize various skill and spell combos that you can choose for your party membersBut the best part is the superb co-op experience, gone are the days when only player 1 gets to decide upon important decisions. You can both talk to any and all npcs and you both take part in dialogues during important events or with certain npcs, and should you two disagree on how to resolve a quest or dialogue you can have your characters argue over it. They will also react to certain things, for example, if you steal something your partner can start up a dialogue with you to either condone your actions or condemn them.As to not spoil anything in the game this example is merely fiction and not present in the game. (Not to my knowledge at least)example: You find a valuable gem on the beach and player 1 wants to sell it while player 2 wants to try and find the owner of it, stating that its immoral to take such a valuable object from someone who obviously dropped it.  Player one then gets a few different dialogue options to try and talk some sense into the other player's character, he can choose between a string of diffrent types of retorts and some might be intimidate, persuade, charm etc. After he has chosen his retort player two can choose a counter argument and will utilize the skill you chose and a game of rock, paper, scissors will commence, you will utilize the skillpoints in that particular skill you choose to gain an advantage over your friend in this game.  Depending on the outcome it will either be in favor of your decision or not, this will also give you points in various personality traits such as romantic or pragmatic depending on what you choose to say and these points will net you bonuses to your personality and other skills. Also it can be quite possible to make the two characters hate/love each other in the end.This went on far longer than i intended so i will end this here by saying that the game is great and hopefully it will stay as amazing as it is now throughout the whole game (currently playing through it). Also, im Swedish so my english and grammar is not perfect, apologies for that.			"

												In a gaming world full of handholding, uninspired battle systems, and just sheer crap, Divinity is a shining diamond in the rough.Graphics - 9/10: Loot-based, dungeon-crawling RPGs are never known for their graphics so I will rate it on a level equivalent to similar games like Torchlight 2 and Diablo 3.  I'm going to put this simply - Divinity is ****ing gorgeous.  The art direction is spot on, the colors are bright and bring the world to life, and the character designs are great too.  You won't feel like you're trudging through the same damn dungeon or cave for the 50th time in a row.  Everywhere feels unique.  You'll traverse vast forests of green, blistering cold mountain tops, firey fields of skeletons and so much more.  It's a well-imagined world that makes the game worth of a 9/10 score in the graphics department.Sound - 8/10:  So don't expect full voice overs or anything like that.  There will be spoken dialogue from time to time- particularly from your main characters, but for the most part NPCs' dialogue is all written (but very well written mind you).  So why am I giving it an 8 for sound?  Because the music is some of the best I've heard in a video game...EVER!Story - 8/10:You're a Source Hunter (yeah I know...just another cliche name for a hero that's received his title and known for aboloshing evil magic and foes from the land).  But don't let that make you overlook what's an otherwise pretty good story as far as loot-based RPGs go.  You start out by coming to town to solve a murder.  I think this mystery-style beginning really helps drive the games gameplay.  Divinity: OS expects you to listen to NPCs, pick up on subtle hints found in text and side character dialogue, and really just discover, discover, discover to unravel the story and new missions.It's worth noting that some may as a result get really frustrated by this lack of handholding; I on the other hand think it's great and really helps add to the game's charm.Gameplay - 11/10:This is where the game shines.  All aspects of this game are fun.  As stated earlier, the clue-finding and unravelling of the story are fun.  You'll be posed with hints, clues, and puzzles which will lead to scratching your head, yet always persistant on unlocking the next series of quests.Beyond this, the interactions amongst your party's characters and NPCs is fun.  Divinity includes a rock-paper-scissors style mini-game to determine the outcome of conversations.  I know it sounds weird, but it's actually really fun.  If an NPC is not particularly interested in giving up information to you, then you can try to beat him at a game of RPS.Where this game truly shines though is in the battle system.  Everything is action point and turn-based driven.  Depending on speed and initiative, an order to character turns will be determined at the beginning of the fight (similar to FFX).  Character's can obviously use special skills and spells to influence their turn postions.  You also have action points for each turn which again is stat-driven based on a characters constitution among other things.  Obviously different skills and spells take different amount of points to cast depending on their power and your overall skill level.So far I'm sure this sounds like a pretty standard turn-based battle system.  BUT WAIT - THERE's MORE.  Truly the best part about Divinity is the unique use of elemental environments.  Characters can cast spells, blow up barrles, and manipulate the environment in all sorts of ways to overcome foes.  Group of enemies standing in a puddle of water?  Shoot an electric bolt to make them all stunned for 3 turns.  No puddle of water?  No problem- cast a rain spell first across the battlefield to create your own puddles then shock it.  Of course that's a simplistic approach that you'll learn how to do in the first 10 minutes of the game.  I won't mention the other awesome environmental elements you can manipulate 'cause I think Divinity is one of those games where part or if its spirit is the unknown.  There's A LOT to learn in this game.  There is, for instance, both crafting and blacksmithing skills in the game, that is so deep and complex, that after 40 hours of playing, I haven't even begun to scratch the surface yet.Overall 10/10:  It's one of the best RPGs I've ever played - hands down.  You're really not doing yourself any favors by passing on this game.  In fact, I'd call you a fool if you did.  This game should be played by every and any person that considers themselves a gamer.

Early Access Review
								I backed this game on Kickstarter and have had lots of fun in the alpha so far. If the bugs that are currently in the game can be worked out before release, then I'd heartily recommend it to anyone who's a fan of RPG's.The game has some interesting ideas, and from what I've seen so far I think the experience can only be enhanced by playing it in the two player cooperative mode that will be available on release.The turn based combat is fun, beyond the generic ""villager"" conversations that crop up everywhere, the dialog is interesting, and little puzzles keep you from facerolling your way through without putting any thought into what you're doing. The game doesn't hold your hand, but if you're into RPG's, your so interested in seeing what the next person is doing, or how to solve the next puzzle that you wouldn't want it to anyway.			"

												Here's how to game basically sums up:ME: ""Hey, you see those skeletons up there?""MY FRIEND: ""Yep. We are level 6 and they are level 8. There's no way we can beat them.""ME: ""Okay here's what we do. I'll drop a barrel of oil here and you send Wolgraff stealthed into the middle of them. Have him place a line of oil barrels weaving through them. Then I'll run in and stun one of them to start the fight. As soon as they see us, I'll shoot an exploding arrow and ignite the chain of oil barrels we placed. When they turn to attack Wolgraff, just send him the teleporter pyramid and he can teleport back to us. Finally, they will all try to run out of the burning fire, and as soon as they step into this little puddle of water in front of us, you electrocute them. Since they will be stunned, we can pick them off slowly with our pathetic weapons. Sound good?""MY FRIEND: ""Uhhhhh. . .""ME: ""Great! Here goes!""10 seconds later: BOOM. ZAPPP. THUD.ME: ""It worked!!!!""We walk away without a scratch			"

												I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.The combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.This game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.If you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.Well done Larian.

Divinity Orginal Sin = Baldurs Gate 3! Seriously, after i started the game and played it for the first hour i had to shut it down and make sure, that i actualy started Divinity: Original Sin[/b] , because it was just THAT good! :DIts basicaly Baldurs Gate 3 and it will also be one of the best coop games ever. You can play the wohle game with drop in/drop out co-op with some friend/random guy. You can have a total of 8 Characters (2 starting chars, 2 henchman and 1 summon each). There are currently 4 companions (full story) and 42 Henchmens (hireable for gold). More will be released for free.On game start you create 2 Chars. You can fully customize em, like gender, class, perks, skills, stat points etc. There are no restrictions and you can actualy make some crazy characters.Fighter with earth magic who uses 2 hand weapons, crossbow and tanking skills? check.Rogue with teleport powers, haste, backstab and charming skills? check.Witch that curses, throws fireballs, heals your party while beeing guarded by a huge lighting elemental? checkRanger with cooking skill, sneaking, able to talk to animals and trading + crafting skills? check The visuals Spell SFX are realy amazing. And bloody hell, this game is challenging! No, there isnt any crap like flys or rats to kill. An undead knight is actualy as strong as your own fighter char. If you make one wrong descision or move, youre dead....thats simply it :D.For example, if you fight an undead army (3 fighters, 1 mage, 2 archer for example) and just one undead fighter gets near your mage, he will kill your mage in 2-3 hits :).i recommend playing the game in co-op with 2 chars that have the lone wolf perk. This way, its basicaly 2 vs the rest of the world, while each player has a realy strong and epic char due to the lone wolf stat bonuses. Lone Wolf makes the character unable to hire an companion but he gets huge bonuses (like 70% more life, more AP) but you can still summon. So in the end you can have the 2 chars + 2 summons if you play with lone wolf perk.Combat in this game is turn based. All actions use action points, the faster (dextery + speed stats) your char is, the more AP you get. There is a huge range of skills + spells and not 2 of em are the same. Each spell is unique and you need to decide round for round what skills youre going to use...there is no ""press X to win"" ;)Also, the soundtrack used in this game is realy epic...its kinda like skyrim one, with drums and chanting womans and stuff. i just think 130 different soundtracks are a bit to much, but hey...more is allways better, right?Now to the bad points:i dont recommend the game at all to casual players. Its like the ultimate anti casual game, because if you just run around, clicking through npc dialoge and run like a chicken into the next fight, you will end up dead, with no way of winning. There is alot of lore around in the game and if you just skip through it all, you will have no clue what the heck is going on around you.All loot is random, which can lead to some crazy playthoughs. Its perfectly possible to have allmost no chance of winning anymore, because you only found crap or you used all items. Even the merchants have random stuff. On the other side, its also the reason why the game has a huge replayability. You never know what you find around the next corner. The game also has a realy complex crafting system, from cooking to crafting new sword, there is something for everyone.Edit: Having now played 60+ hours, this game is my new all time favorite RPG. By reading the forum, i found out that, i have finished around 1/3 of the game. Crazy!  :)Overall, i give Divinity Original Sin a 9 out of 10.If you have any questions just add me in Steam :)			"

												-Lacked the money to buy a minor heal spell for my knight. -Infurated, began to murder every npc in town-Their blood now serves as a healing source for my leeching talent11/10-----Edit (since people actually took the time to read this)I play this game along with my girlfriend in co-op mode. While i wouldn't consider myself new to this type of games, i was soon reminded of how hard RPGs can be.For people that are new to the genre, this game can prove to be quite frightening, especially at the beginning, even in normal difficulty. The lack of direction given, or... the freedom of choice you have... makes the game quite confusing at first, which is why its highly recommended to always read the dialogue carefully. The game even gives you the option to read again the whole conversation through the conversation log tab.Co-op mode adds to the fun of the game. The fact that you can play the entire game along with a friend makes it the more enjoyable to go through. While people can argue that co-op can make any game look better, Divinity: Original Sin, gives a further meaning to play with your friend, having the NPCs actually acknowledging your companion and not just simply having it there for the sake of having someone around. You can get to talk with your allies at any time, getting to know them more. At certain times, depending on your actions, you will even get short interactions with whoever is in your party that can boost certain traits based on the answer given. There is a meaning for your friend to be there, is not like other games where your co-op companion is just another clone of yourself.The gameplay is fun. Turn-base combat system based on AP (Action points) is self explanatory, the more AP's you have, the more actions you can make in your turn. Each character has its own APs that are boosted by their attributes and gear. You are given several classes to pick from though you are not prohibit from learning other classes abiilties. For example, my knight can use water-based skills which are the ones that can grant healing spells along with other water/ice abilities. As for character appearance customization, its not really deep, in fact, i believe it might be one weak point of the game. Overall, the game is incredibly addicting and fun. While the early levels might discourage newcomers, this game sure is one big reminder that classic-style RPGs are not dead and can show up at any time to surprise us and remind just how fun and frustrating they used to be. I was lucky enough to encounter no bugs so far, which is something i am grateful for seeing how i read some bugs around that can make progress quite more painful than what it should.I would hate myself if i had to give a real numeric value to the game, so i will say this: ""If you are curious about the game, buy it, you will simply not regret it""One last thing, save often. F5 will be one of your strongest allies. (Not kidding, really, save often)			"

Early Access Review
								This game is so good I can't even write a joke-y review about it. Even though it is in early release, it is still one of the most fun games I have played this year. It draws heavy inspiration from older games such as Baldur's Gate and Planescape:Torment , and with its beautiful graphics, the isometric gameplay makes myself (as a fan of those games) feel right at home.What makes Original Sin so good, is that it fills a gap that has been missing in the past couple of years. Character driven RPGs that don't hold the players hand through the whole ordeal are far and few between. The isometric view gives combat a strategic feel, and gives life to the world as your character interacts with the environments around it.The combat is challenging, satisfying and very strategic. Using rainspells to create puddles, and then electrifying those puddles to stun opponents is a strategy which the developers try to tout in many of the dev diaries. I went in thinking ""great, thats going to be it, oh well."" But when I pulled off feats such as teleporting a skeleton with a bomb on his back into a crowd of enemies, I felt a magical little feeling in my belly.The story is pretty interesting so far, and follows two Source Hunters as they Hunt Sourcerers (Yeah, okay, its a little dumb). But its good. The game however isn't for everyone. It may not be for those who don't enjoy reading and paying attention during their RPGs, as there is very few instances of voice acting, and even fewer instances of quest markers. Everything is derived from the well-written dialogue between your characters and NPCs, and from exploring your surroundings.The game runs great. Let me stress that. I don't have a gaming computer, I don't even have a gaming laptop. I have a crappy Dell thats a few years old, and doesnt have a dedicated graphics card. And the game runs smooth as butter on Medium/Low.It really is a great game, and I urge anyone who is in the mood for a very fun RPG that doesn't hold your hand to pick up a copy.Oh, and there is co-op multiplayer! I haven't tried that yet, but if I had I'd probably be telling you how sexy it is.			"

								ALPHA REVIEW! Will try to update once release has arrived. Most of the problems have been solved now so it can only be better then this review :PCertainly an unexpected arrival of triple A qualityTopview action-rpg with turnbased combat, the graphics are nicer then most topview games though ofcourse not that near to next-gen quality ;DThe movement is smooth, it reacts nicely to mouseclicks and the pathing seems to work very well mostly (at waypoints it still tends to stand behind the portal instead of in front). The dialogue is nice and allows for alot of changes in the world that actually really affact you (even in this early stage.. ive almost tried murdering everything/everyone once to see what would happen XD)Sometimes there are a bit to much choices (like 10 or more) but thats rare and doesnt bother to much as you dont need to talk to everyone anyway. The combat is nice. Atm some spells might need a better visual effect showing what area it will do damage in and ofcourse alot of the spells and stats are still missing. Nonetheless the combat system works quite well and it feels really good. The turnbased system is one that ive not been used to in a while but its almost like second nature anyway. At higher level mobs and bosses it can get quite tricky and will require tactics. Luckily enviromental stuff works great .. some things arent in yet but making people slide and fall with ice, guiding electric dmg with water, burning oil etc. you spill out of barrel or lighting poisonous gasses is funny as hell.Aside from that.. exploration and gazing. I kept looking around at all the wonderous things at the side of the road and i hated every sign/roadsplit for making me have to choose.. i wanted to see everything XDThe itemsystem is compact and simple (atm sorting inventorydoesnt really work well). This means you have a nice amount of combinations you can do.. you can combine nails with wood or a stick to make a spiked mace, buckets to make bucket helmets etc. etc. I myself havent fully gone into this but accoding to Larian there will be a massive amount of funny combinations.The one thing i really feel lacking atm is character customisation. Which includes customising character at creation, amount of skills available atm and amount of character-relationship stats. However as these are a big part of the game, they will come.The graphics are nice. At first i thought it was slightly bloomy but after a while you realise it just fully fits the game and it just looks great. The performance.. depends. On low-end PCs it runs amazing mostly, at high-end PCs it still runs well, but not as good as expected and people with SLI sometimes have problems with it.Thats about it.Do realise... this is alpha			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is a classic example of how old-school RPG is made anew. It is the product of old-school gameplay coupled with its own niche and original features.Old-School Features (Present in most CRPGS):- Slow-paced tactical turn based combat- Widespread treasures in the form of clickable debris and vessels (barrels and the like) - Multiple non-linear quests completion- Multiple character builds and party compositions- Free roam and exploration- Massive lore and dialogueWhat Makes Divinity:Original Sin fresh:- Use of elements and Terrain where they cooperate and collide as a gameplay mechanic (water channels electricity and such): Imagine Magicka meets tactics- Conflicting opinions of Main Characters determine the outcome of a quest (only applicable if you play co-op).Negative:- Bad interface- Starts strong with many things presented as well as a variety of quests, but severely diminishes against the end, content feels rushed.- Story drags out.- Little or non-existant voice acting for games with pre-made characters (story-wise).- Certain decisions/negotiations with NPC revolves on the result of rock-paper-scissors match with the NPC, this absolutely destroys immersion where whether the decision of walking away unscathed or ended up massacring them rests on luck.Personal ExperienceOverall, I had a blast playing this game with a partner and there are many memorable moments throughout the game. However, I do feel that this game is highly overrated and it is nowhere at the top of my list. It is still a game that I would recommend to RPG fans out there simply because there are not many well-thought out and engaging RPG games that you can play with your friends out there in the market.

												So far this game is turning out very well! It is by the same makers of one of my favorite RPG's of all time, Divine Divinity!Divinity: Original Sin has some great dialogue, tough choices and handles very well, even for an early release. Do yourself a favor and buy into this now if you love roleplaying games! The whole game will be playable in coop with a friend or two, these choices are hard as hell to pick even in solo play but I can imagine in coop these decisions in the game world will be realy ahrd to agree on!Awesome dialogue, good controls, fun gameplay, interesting characters and a gameworld that is fantastic. And that is only the begining! This game is looking to be one of 2014's best rpgs, buy now!If you enjoyed the old ultima rpgs, old Icewind Dale or the old divinity rpgs, this is JUST what you need! As with many of my favorite rpgs this does start a tad slow but things pick up and get better and better as the game goes along. Tons of ways you can go about combat and building you're character, it really is a masterpiece of a game that you can tell Larian put in alot of love into this one.I have now played 185 hours now on the game and I just beat the last boss to beat the game. Overall this is a wonderful rpg and a breath of fresh air. There is a few small issues such as the ui could be a bit better, writing of the story could be improved and I had two small bugs but overall this is a very special rpg. Can't wait to start up a new game with some friends in coop. The combat is perfection, the game has funny humor, jam packed with content and it is fun as hell to play. CRPG's are back people! How great is this?9.5/10			"

												The next Baldur's Gate/Neverwinter Nights/Fallout.  Two-player coop for the main story line, with an editor that supports creation of 4-player coop campaigns (similar to NWN's editor).  Combat is turn based, built from what appears to be Pathfinder's table top combat rules, (attacks of opportunity, etc), but with Fallout's AP (action point) system, very elegantly done.There is also a ""social combat"" system, where you and your friends can ""fight"" over dialogue choices in which a final winner ultimately decides the outcome of the conversation; this is done via rock-paper-scissors.  Character's can gain or lose personality points based on the outcome of these conversations as well, (whether they are altruistic in nature or perhaps more cut throat).  These stat changes also help in other areas later on.Finally, a living, breathing world in which there are often times multiple possible solutions to a problem.  Can't pick a lock?  Bash the door (and possibly damage your weapon in doing so).  Can't bash the door?  SET IT ON FIRE!  Etc.  Want to try to steal something but someone is watching?  Have your friend distract them with conversation!  Is something burning that shouldn't be?  Cast a rain spell or dump water on the fire.  Want to combine abilities for combat?  Have someone cast a poison cloud, and then ignite it with a flame arrow!  The list goes on and on.Crafting is similar to the Android game ""Alchemy"" or Minecraft, in which you start with basic items, combine them, and can ultimately craft higher level items.  This game should be a crafters dream.  The voice additions really bring the world to life, but can be a bit annoying in crowded places, as you hear multiple conversations going on at the same time.  The developers will hopefully tone this down a bit.The world is gorgeous, filled with little details that can be seen by zooming in closely, and your characters perception trait will help you spot items (press and hold alt).  Characters range from dark and evil, to light hearted and humorous (see if you can find the very old talking clam), and is reminiscent of Baldur's Gate.  Also, NO QUEST MARKERS!  The world does not hold your hand in this aspect.  It does give you tools, such as waypoint markers for your map, that help you keep tabs on where certain things are, and it will auto-populate the map with buildings of notable remark, but the rest is up to you.  You will have to enjoy reading. All that said, for old school RPG'ers longing for the days of old, with a new modern technology, wait no more.  Divinity: Original Sin should scratch that itch.  I've spent too much time typing this, game on!			"

								If you enjoy isometric RPGs I highly recommend taking a look at D:OS. The combat is Turn Based instead of Real Time with Pause and they did a good job leveraging some of the added tactical depth such a system allows for. The elemental reactivity in the combat system is a feature I wish more games would utilize. There are tons of skills, items, and multiple solutions for quests. It's very well written and the comedy fits nicely.			"

								Have you ever asked yourself, ""Man, why doesn't someone make a cooperative fantasy RPG with all the nifty RPG-ism's that I love, like skills and talents and crafting and that I can play at my own pace with my friend and we can decide how we complete quests and treat people in the world and if we disagree then there was a mechanic in place that supported that and NPC characters we could hire and have join our adventures and instead of mindlessly blasting through hundreds of monsters like every other action RPG out there, we could fight in some nail-biting tactical, turn-based combat with spells and abilities that would affect the environment and turn the tide of the battle and the whole thing is wrapped up in a fantastic looking package with great looking characters and animations and some genuinely good and at times humorous writing?""Guess what? It's your lucky day.			"

												PC GOTY 2014 no doubt!!People who love hardcore RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, or Arcanum will surely fall in love with this game. It's so rare these days to find this kind of games when most RPGs are action oriented.PROS:+ Beautiful world, beautiful graphics+ Environmental effects!!! For example: You can wet the grounds and cast air spells to electrify all enemies who stand above it or cast oil spell and burn the grounds.+ So many possibilities when creating a character. A two handed warrior/sorcerer hybrid? Sure. A mage who good at sneaking and backstabbing? Sure.+ It's quite hard and challenging without making you frustrated. Make sure you create a balanced team without overlapping abilities and skills between your characters. For example: Only take bartering or charisma skill in one of your character, not more.+ A long RPG. It could litterally takes 50 hours or so to finish the game.CONS- Rock Paper Scissors. Too bad in many occassions, you have to play this mini game to win an argument. Daft.- Annoying NPC especially in villages. They keep talking, shouting and mumbling the same dialogues over and over.In short, get this game! You won't regret it			"

The Golden Age of the RPGThere are so many outstanding titles out there at the moment, Wasteland 2 and Shadowrun: Dragonfall DC are out, there are new Witcher and Dragon Age titles on the horizon. It's a good time to be an RPG fan, but where does Divinity Original Sin fit into this hall of RPG fame? Let's fire it up, build a character or two and find out! A game with a lot of character For a crunchy RPG the character creation doesn't feel as daunting as you might expect. It's certainly not as initially intimidating as the also excellent Wasteland 2's character creation screen, that's not to say that character creation here is shallow, far from it. You'll get to create two characters from the start (unless you pick the ""lone wolf trait"" which will give you some extra perks at the expense of your customised travelling companion.) Experienced RPG'ers should be right at home here, pick a character class as your starting point, Knight, Wizard, Ranger etc, then tweak your attributes, skills and spells until you've got your perfect novice source hunter, ready to go out into the world and hunt some serious source! Serious SauceA great power called the source exists in the world of Rivellon, a power once wielded for good but no longer. The Wheel of Time turned and a great darkness invaded the land leaving the source forever tainted, its users driven to madness and destruction. Now only a brave few stand between Rivellon and this dark power which threatens to destroy it. That's where you come in. Murder She Wrote In Divinity original sin you take on the mantle of a novice source hunter (well two novice source hunters, but who's counting).You've been tasked with investigating the murder of a councillor in the town of Cyseal, It's suspected the source was involved and now, like a sword and magic wielding Jessica Fletcher, It's time to figure out ""who dunnit"" There's your trouble! As the game opens, you'll find yourself being unceremoniously dropped off on the sunny shores of Cyseal. It seems a murder isn't the only problem the town is facing. The undead are at the walls and the Orcs are attacking from the coast. Cyseal is a town with more troubles than you could shake a level 10 elemental staff at. You Go First!The game doesn't pull any punches, even before you make it into the town of Cyseal proper, you'll have your first tactical encounter which introduces you to the turn based combat mechanics. Action points are the order of the day here, each character in your group (up to a maximum of four at any one time) will have a specific number of action points dependent on their stats and equipment. You'll spend these points moving, hacking, slashing and casting your way through these turn based encounters.Combat in D:OS is a meaty and very satisfying experience, but it's not just about sorcery and swordplay, your surroundings can play a huge part in these battles too. An Inconvenient TruthEnvironmental destruction is par for the course here, and at first, you will probably do as much damage to your own group as you do to the enemy via environmental effects, that is, until you've figured a few things out. Is the floor covered in oil? then you might want to be careful of stray sparks, a misguided fireball could send the whole lot up in flames, if you happen to be standing in the oil yourself, don't expect the environment to be forgiving, you'll burn along with all the rest. The game can be punishing at times but you'll learn to use the environment to your advantage as you progress and after a short tutorial battle and dungeon crawl, you'll progress into the town of Cyseal.It's here that the hunt begins. The Great HuntWhen you make it into the town, you'll be greeted by a wealth of varied and interesting NPC's. A whistle stop tour of the dock front will start to open up various side quests quicker than you can say ""That ships on fire!"" and ""Do I look like a recruitment agency?"" Don't worry, the in game journal does an excellent job of keeping the ever-growing quest details in order, a feature which I've found invaluable as a memory aid following those frequent occasions where the real world dares to interfere with my  investigations. Eye of the Beholder The graphics do a fine job of enhancing the atmosphere of the game, from dark oppressive dungeons and gloomy rain soaked woodland to bright sunny beaches and the vibrant town of Cyseal itself, everything on screen adds something to the isometric glory. Ear of the... Earholder Whilst some NPC's are voiced, most are not. However, there are enough lines of dialogue scattered around to give the game flavour, most of which are so full of character and voiced with such vigour you can't help but smile. Lines like ""I wouldn't let an orc within 500 yards of my loving nature"" and ""No one has as many friends as the man with many cheeses!"" are great examples of the wonderfully written and often funny dialogue that awaits you here. Schizophrenic EncouragementThe writing is sharp and witty and the interaction between your characters can be hilarious, you can even get into arguments with yourself! A good example of this happened to me early on in my play through when I wanted to dig up a body to follow a lead in my investigation. I was just about to start wielding my trusty shovel when my comrade in arms objected. In situations like this, you can find yourself choosing the dialogue options for both sides of the argument. I couldn't help but get on my high horse about the sanctity of the grave and disturbing the dead with my second character, whilst my first glared on, shovel in hand quipping about short sighted sensitivity derailing the investigation. If arguments like this reach an impasse then your comrades will resort to a quick game of rock, paper scissors to resolve the conflict. This is amazing fun and can lead to alternate paths you might not have considered previously as part of your investigation. The road is longDivinity is long game. If you're the obsessive type and feel the need to complete every side quest on offer then you can expect to spend nigh on 100 hours in Rivellon, so you'll definitely get your monies worth with regards to content...................

												Divinity: Original Sin hails from the golden days of classic-RPG gaming.  It takes portions of what were great about past CRPGs like the Baldur's Gate series, Fallout, Icewind Dale, and the like, and stirs it into one big pot and offers you Divinity: Original Sin.  While the Divinity series is not new to some of us, if you can recall their other RPGs like Divine Divinity, Larian Studios pays great attention to detail and it shows.  Almost everything you do in D:OS has a consequence.  All the careful planning by Larian went into every little detail in Divinity's world.  Original Sin is text-heavy, so do not dive in expecting complete voiceover work for every main character and NPCs.  There are the occasional voiceover work, but they are few compared to the text dialogue.  This does not spoil the great writing though, but it gives it a very ""right at home"" feeling for those that enjoy classic RPGs.  The dialogue is wonderful, well-written, and full of humor.  Even dark humor which is not easy to pull off.Divinity: Original Sin is a challenging game, but it is fair.  Right from the start, it does not hold your hand, but it begs you to search every corner of its vast world.  Every battle, not just boss fights, requires careful planning, strategy, and good tactics.  Your party could be wiped by a small group of common mobs.  But do not be discouraged.  Original Sin is not unfair and cheap against the player.  It simply means, you cannot just lay back and push a few buttons to win a fight so easily.  Allow me to give you one example where I was fighting this one boss, and I was down to my last party member with low health and the boss was also at low health (one hit away from death), and I managed to get off one last shot with my bow, killing it.  At the same time, there was joy, and relief.  You should also know that you can sometimes take on enemies that are 2-3 levels higher than your characters, but it requires great strategy.One of the gameplay mechanics that really stood out for me was the ability to create different effects by applying magic and ability effects to your surroundings. For instance, if an enemy is standing in a puddle of water, you can target the water with an electric-type spell and stun your enemy for a number of turns.  Strategically speaking, you can also place oil barrels in position before battle in your enemy's path and strike it with a fireball spell, or an explosive arrow.  This gameplay mechanic fosters dynamic gameplay on the battlefield, and it rewards players that plan out their strategy.The presentation in Divinity: Original Sin has been well executed.  The menus are easy to navigate, without all the clutter and needless micro-management.  The user interface is slick, clean, and simple yet complex in good ways.  I did not notice input lag.  The controls felt very intuitive for the most part, but not without a small learning curve.  Those that have played CRPGs before will feel right at home.  Those that have not played CRPGs before will get used to the controls within an hour or less.  The controls are very responsive, smooth, and it does not have input lag.  Mouse and keyboard work great.  I have not tried it with a controller.  Moving your party members in the levels feel responsive and fluid.  While Divinity: Original Sin does many things right, the ending was very anti-climatic.  Without spoiling it for you, I will just say this:  Try not to think of the end and enjoy the journey.  D:OS is all about the journey, the gameplay, and the rich detail.Divinity: Original Sin was one of those games that took me by surprise.  It was a refreshing new release in 2014 that blew me away by its shear depth and classic feel.  In a sea of videogames that tend to hold your hand, Original Sin was the complete opposite of that.  It required motivation in thinking; planning out your strategy and tactics to win battles.  The reward was satisfaction from battles where you did not always know going in if you will win.  The tide turns, and you do not know if you will be the victor.  It allows for dynamic gameplay, unlike static gameplay that just lets you hit the ""win button.""  Larian Studios designed a game that respects the player, with a high risk, reward system that works.  - Runner-up for GOTY 2014- Tons of Charm- Humoristic - includes dark humor, as well as light and funny humor- Classic-RPG done right in modern times- Most-improved developer of 2014- Continued Customer Support - Highly responsive to customer's needs with technical issues and difficulties- Developer/Community Manager responds to posters- Amazing graphics and a beautiful game engine- Optimization is well done - D:OS runs smooth at 80fps+ on maxed settings at 1080p (as of this review, GTX 670, i5-2500k CPU)- Several display and graphics options - There is a NO-DRM version from other suppliers like GOG if you choose not to buy it from Steam.  More options is good.You really owe it to yourself to play this RPG.Rating:  9.5 out of 10			"

												Divinity: Origin Sin is a top-down, turned-based Role-Playing-Game that does without the hand-holding, 'let me guide you through my story and you'll learn to love it' experience. There's a huge emphasis on freedom; genuine freedom, not the kind that lets you do what you want for five minutes before prompting you there's a quest you should be doing. In short, Divinity: Origin Sin raises it's middle finger to the concept of guidance and allows the player to decide what to do and when to do it. Graphics:In every aspect, this game is beautiful, and arguablly one of the best looking games, not just within it's genre, but within in all games, ever. From the huge towns filled with NPC's to the lonely mountain passes, the game world feels alive and genuine; never do you feel like you're following a path, you feel as you should, as if you're exploring this huge, open world with a story behind it, and everyone within. It's difficult to describe the graphics in this game purely because they're done so well. There is particle effects, high-quality textures, gorgeous lighting and a strong sense of atmosphere everywhere you go. You might be exploring an old celler, in which case it's misty and gloomy, whilst in town centres the sun is pumping pure beauty upon the entire world. The game is simply gorgeous and without doubt, the best looking game within it's genre, by a large margin. Audio:From the subtle creeks of floor-boards to the raging torrents that is the mountain pass winds, Divnity: Origin Sin delivers a flawless experience in auditory experience. The best possible way to explain the quality of audio in this game would be to ask you to think of a game, any game at all that you think has the best audio. You might say Amnesia because it's subtle but terrorfying or perhaps you might say Child of Light for it's amazing soundtracks, and both would be correct, and I'm sure other examples you might have suggested would be too, but most games have one particular aspect within it's audio that's memorable or excels in some aspect. This isn't true for Divinity: Origin Sin. This game excels in every aspect, from voice acting to the empowering shimmers and charges that spark when casting a spell. It's simply perfect - And that's not a comment I would make lightly. Gameplay:Divinity: Origin Sin is a turn-based game, but only within combat. Outside of combat you're free to explore and roam the world in any way you please. You might find yourself engaging enemies that are a few levels higher than you; you might help an old man steal some fish, then report him to the guards and watch him be dragged away to prison or perhaps you simply want to go around the entire world slaying every single living thing that stands in your way. Freedom is what makes Divinity: Origin Sin so immersive and enjoyable, you're never tied down or told what to do, or when. This game is hardcore, but not in regards to it's difficulty, more in terms of how it presents itself. There are no exclimation marks above NPC's heads to signify importance. There is no charts or tables to show you crafting receipes. There is a lot missing, but it's a very positive aspect of the game that makes it so much more enjoyable and immersive than other Role-Playing-Games. To find out how to craft a weapon, a potion or how to cook a pie, you must find a book, or a note and read it. You won't unlock the receipe, everything is available to craft as long as you know how to do it. Once you find the receipe, you simply need to refer back to it when creating the item. When deciding to complete quests, to find out where to go or what to do, you must talk to NPC's and listen. The information given to you is only useful if you read what was said. There will be no waypoint given or a 'Hey, good job finding that clue, i'll remove all challenge from this game and simply tell you what to do now'. It's challenging, but rewarding. The combat is much alike what you would expect. Every character involved within the combat scenario will take turns, have a set amount of action points and, if they choose, can reserve points for future turns. The system is very fluid and intuative. What makes the combat, and gameplay so enjoyable however, is the emphasis on environmental interaction. See a group of enemies standing in water? Why not zap them with lightning and fry them? -No? How about we freeze the water and stick them in their place. Perhaps you want to spill some oil and ignite it, or perhaps use a teleport spell to throw an enemy off a cliff. If you can think of it, you can probably do it. Narrative and Lore:Now I'll admit, I'm not the kind of person who is likely to sit down and read every piece of lore or material in a game, especially not role-playing-games. I generally don't have the patience nor' interest, so perhaps this next statement will give some meaning to the quality of the writing in this game. I've played for about 15 hours, at the time of writing this review, and have read every single piece of material I've found, and generally find it annoying when I then switch to co-op, and have my partner skip through it all. The writing in this game is really well written, and because of the nature of the game, enaging and meaningful. I know if I don't read it, I won't know what to do. It's almost like a very intelligent scheme plotted by the developers to discourage skipping through material, and I like that.Co-op:The game allows for four characters to be played at any given time, in co-op, you can play alongside another player and control up to two each. There is no limations in co-op, everything you can do it single player, you can do it co-op, but arguablly, it's more enjoyable when played with a friend due to a feature that allows you to argue amongst your characters about what choices to make it quests. Perhaps I want to slay the target, whilst you want to help them. Lets discuss it with in-game dialouge, then argue and see who wins. It's genuinally enjoyable and adds a new layer to the immersion of the games experience.There is also a mod, for those interested, that allows the game to be played four-player co-op, so if that's of interest, good news for you! Mods and Editors:That game supports workshop, mods and even comes with the developer tools to create your own custom campaigns. I've toyed around with this a little, and not being a guru of game development software, I can say it's actually pretty easy to use. There is some script-writing to do when creating dialouges, cutscenes or combat sequences, but there are plenty of easy-to-understand tutorials that can be found within the discussion pages of the Steam community hub as well as on media sites such as YouTube to help guide beginners in creating their own mods. Whilst I'm unlikely to spend much time using these features myself, it's a great addition to have and ultimately means there's a huge pool of endless content to play with once you've completed the main game. That's never a bad thing.Overall:Divinity: Origin Sin is a beautifully crafted RPG that was obviously created by developers who genuinally cared about their product. Every aspect of the game feels polished once, and once again. The game runs perfectly at maximum settings on my GTX 760 and AMD FX-8350 at more than 120FPS solid, without hiccups. The gameplay is hugely enjoyable, the lore is engaging and the hardcore approach to giving the player complete freedom makes this one of the best turn-based role-playing-games, ever. No game is without it's flaws ~ I just can't single out anything I dislike, honestly it's near perfect.It's a masterpiece, a genuine must buy for any RPG fan. ~One of the most enjoyable and engaging experiences to be found within gaming.[/b] "

												Fantastic RPG game. One of the best in years. PROS-No fetch quests-No grinding-Great leveling system that rewards you for exploration, fighting, and arguing with npcs-Enormous amounts of skills and freedom to build you're own party (up to 4 people) any way you want-Fun story with lots of depth.-Perfect soundtrack to catch the feel of the fantasy world-Amazing turn based combat with a lot of emphasis on the surrounding environment. Gameplay is superb-One of the best AI in a long time. They can do to you anything you can do to them in combat. Very unpredictable-Fun and smart sandbox elements that can only be rivaled by Bethesda games.-Challenging puzzles that will take you back in time when those old Resident Evil games picked your brain-Co-opCONS......No cons. Game is a masterpiece. People nitpick small things like inventory being cumbersome or lack of hand holding. But none of those things are big enough to be worthy of a con. This game is too good. 5-10 years from now it will be even better because people will realize how much better it is than most other game released in todays industry. Its one of those things thats gotta slowly sink in. The first couple hours of the game can be very overwhelming. But once you get past that inital learning curve you will be sucked into an amazing fantasy world. One of the most addicting games I have ever played.10 out of 10. Would fall for trap again.

												This game is wonderful. In a year otherwise flooded with terrible games and inexcusable moneygrabbing plain awfulness, Divinity: Original Sin stands out. The developers loved it and listened to the community and it shows - A passion for RPGs and a love for the setting is poured into this game. More specifically, this game has the best combat seen in an RPG ever. Ever. Character development is interesting and every combat is tactical enough that it always feels like it matters how you play. Did you die in a combat and have to reload? Try a different tactic, some different spells and different movements and even the thoughest enemy can be beaten. To clarify, what makes it so beautiful and awesome to play is that it manages to be tough and challenging without being unfairly punishing.That said, the story is so-so - A half-bad fantasy novel with a run-of-the-mill story. It's not terrible or anything, but you will soon forget what you were doing in favor of just finding another exciting battle to put your sword in.9/10.			"

												It's been a while since I've fallen in love with a game as hard as I have with Divinity: Original Sin. It is a game with many glaring flaws, and those flaws are part of the reason I've come to love it. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but those who can stomach its initial few sluggish hours will find a meaty turn-based RPG that pays thorough respect to its CRPG predecessors like Baldur's Gate.Those familiar with pen & paper RPGs, as well as roguelike elements, will feel right at home here. Combat is tough and involved. The game uses mechanics familiar to paper players while being relatively accessible to modern gamers (none of that THAC0 nonsense!). Larian has developed a smart, stern RPG that offers its charm in its unforgivingly old-school game design with absolutely zero handholding. Very few map markers. No quest arrows. Why am I surrounded by level 15 invincible enemies at level 10?!If you like Dungeons & Dragons or TBRPGs in similar veins like Shadowrun Returns, you owe it to yourself to play Divinity: Original Sin. Best enjoyed with a friend who will antagonize you.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is far better than anyone could have reasonably expected. While its excellent world interactivity and in-depth crafting system were things which were talked about and demonstrated before the release, and the typical Larian humour in quests and writing could be expected, its sheer level of quality in other regards is simply off the scale.The battle system may be the best in any computer role playing game ever created. The combination of a full set of modern features, including attacks of opportunity, with an initiative / action point system, free movement and a highly polished user interface is a joy to play and strategize with.However, what truly sets the game apart is the versatility in terms of player agency which it offers. Ideas which you might never even consider in other games, or which might not even be possible to attempt, are not only possible to execute but actually work. This level of interactivity, combined with the very well developed system of elemental area effects and their interaction, allows for an almost infinite number of possibilities for solving situations, both in battles and during exploration.I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes using their head while playing.

												Rating - 76/100Recommendation - Grab it, but wait for free enhanced edition upgrade (Edit: I've been told the upgrade is no longer free, so get the Enhanced Edition instead!!!!)Classic PC RPGs have absorbed hundreds (even thousands) of hours of my life since I was a teenager, but after all these years, I can't say for certain that I love them. There are aspects about them that I absolutely adore, and there are aspects of them that make me grind my teeth.Take Baldur's Gate, for example. It's classic. Iconic, even. For good reason, too. It's solidly-built, has a beautifully-designed world, interesting characters, a great story, and a fantastic open-world feel. It also has brutally-difficult try-try-again fights, a moderate lack of direction, and quite a few bugs/glitches. The first time I played BG, I had a game-breaking bug 30 hours in, and was dead in the water.Divinity: Original Sin is certainly similar in that some-good-some-bad regard. During my playthrough, I found a lot to love, and a lot to hate. The story is well-crafted and interesting (although it does ramble), the characters each have their own motivations/backstories (and quests), it's open-world enough for you to miss important things if you aren't paying attention, the graphics are pretty good, and it's a meaty enough adventure to please anyone flying high off a recent dose of Baldur's Gate 2.Now, before I list the cons I found, I have to re-state that I did enjoy the game. I definitely recommend it overall (especially since the enhanced ""remastered"" version is coming out for free soon), but there are bound to be people out there just as nitpicky as me, so I have to list what bugged me.First of all, the difficulty in the first half of the game is RIDICULOUS. You will always be in an area, able to explore at your heart's content, surrounded on all sides but one by enemies that will curb-stomp you into oblivion. As a result, this ""open-world"" game is ostensibly linear, given there's only one area you can go to unless you want your face and limbs rearranged, redesigned, or removed. Then, once you hit somewhere just after the mid-point, battle difficulty falls off a cliff, and you'll be skating through gigantic brawls with ease. I can't really count that as a con, though, since it was a welcome relief for my poor molars.Following right along with the difficulty, the balance in the game is really bad. For the first 50 hours, I built my main character as a ranger. She had high dexterity and speed, a fantastic legendary bow, and a full complement of gear boosting her bow skills. Battles were difficult, but doable. Then, 51 hours in, I found a unique dagger with high damage. I equipped it just to see what a dagger was like (changing literally nothing else I had equipped, even MY SKILLS), and became untouchable. Having spent 2/3 of the game outfitting myself as a ranger, and barely having any dagger skills at all didn't matter. One tiny equipment change, and I was zipping around the arena like a meth-head on fast forward, poking fatal holes in enemies left and right. I wasn't sneaking or backstabbing, just walking right up to mages and barbarians alike, and handily beating them toe-to-toe.Granted, in RPGs, certain builds will always be more viable against certain enemies, but there were no scenarios that proved difficult for my little stabbing princess. It was funny and all, but when there is that big of a difference between build strengths, there is a problem. To be fair, there were a few pretty solid mages behind me providing support, but that half-♥♥♥♥♥ little dagger build was making even Madora (who is a BEAST of a warrior) look silly. I kid you not when I say I alone went head-to-head with the final boss while the rest of the team was cleaning up the trash he repeatedly spawned. It was so overpowered, it reminded me of the old JRPGs of my youth, when I would give all the best gear/upgrades to the main character, and trickle the hand-me-downs to the rest of the team (and it would be perfectly viable).I wasn't trickling anything down to the rest of the team here, though, since each character had an almost completely unique set of equipment requirements. I had a ranger, a warrior, a spell-mage, and a wizard, all of which were focusing on different stats.Before I switch down to talk about the smaller niggles and quirks, I have to talk about the combat system, the glitchy, buggy, nothing-short-of-poorly-designed combat system. The main problem I had with it is that enemies dance around a bit while they're idle, and there's no way to pause while giving orders, so targeting is a big fat ol' pain. Essentially, when you click on an enemy to attack, there's a chance the enemy's idle animation just leaned back and roared, making the game think you want to move to the spot of ground right where their head used to be. Even taking off my shoes won't help me count the number of times my character wasted an entire turn running across the arena to stand next to the enemy I just told her to shoot. Plus, there is no way to pause or cancel orders, so bye-bye turn, and good luck standing right next to that massive flaming demon, ranger. Literally the entire game, I was on edge about pixel-perfect mouse positioning and idle animations when I attacked.Plus, getting the mouse cursor to recognize enemies is not the easiest thing to begin with. If a small enemy is standing behind a larger one (according to the camera), they can literally be impossible to target, even if the character you're controlling could reach out and slap them. I was BEGGING for free camera rotation (it only swivels maybe 30° currently) and a dedicated pause button.My final issue (and the big one) about the combat system is that it straight-up lies. For example, Madora will be standing right next to an enemy, and to attack him, she requires 4 AP (action points). In reality, though, once you click to attack, Madora BACKS UP, giving the enemy an attack of opportunity (despite never leaving melee range), and costing an extra movement AP. Your turn plan is now screwed up, and you're injured. Sometimes those little details are signalled to you beforehand (it shows movement and attacks of opportunity), but sometimes they are not. Plus, it's not unheard of for skills that cost 6 AP, for example, to show you on the hot bar that they're only really going to cost 4 AP (they really do cost 6), so pay attention. Let's also not forget that the game often incorrectly calculates how many AP you will need to use. I noticed this a lot towards the end of the game. My dagger girl's attack cost 2 AP, but sometimes when I'd be standing right next to an enemy, it would say 3 AP required. When I attack, only 2 AP are used (as should be the case), but then it again says my next attack will cost 3 AP while it really costs 2. Repeat until you only have 2 AP, when the game will hold up its hands and stop you. Nevermind that you should only be using 2 AP and ARE using only 2 AP each time you've stood in that exact spot and attacked that exact enemy that exact turn, if the game thinks you need 3, you're done.There are a bunch more problems with the combat system, but to sum up, it can't be trusted, and it is the undeniable weak point in the entire game. I would have very few complaints if they fixed it.Other than those issues, the game is pretty great. It has 70+ hours of content, enough exploration/quests to keep you busy the whole time, full campaign co-op, multiple companions you can bring (Madora and Jafar were my 2), a whole slew of attributes/skills/perks to build your unique character with, and just about anything else you would expect from an isometric RPG. It's a fantastic example of how isometric cRPGs can be brought forward into the future.			"

												Complexity. It’s an old RPG trait largely forgotten by a lot of gamers and ignored by most developers. If you like your RPG’s action-oriented and filled with commodities such as quest markers, move right along. Divinity: Original Sin from Belgian developer Larian assumes you’re prepared to actually figure out quite a bit all on your own. It provides a large game world and simply lets you wander around in it. Areas aren’t closed off, all quests can be finished in at least two different ways and you won’t be punished for playing your own way. It brings about the kind of design philosophy that really should exist in every RPG, regardless of its style, combat system or any other differentiating feature.The story follows two main protagonists who start out as Source Hunters trying to figure out a local murder mystery. Naturally, soon they find themselves involved in something much bigger including an orc invasion, undead uprising, mad kings in a frozen land inhabited by elementals and they’ll even visit other dimensions and take to the heavens. Unfortunately, this is the weakest part of the game as the writing isn’t particularly compelling and the characterization is awfully shallow, especially regarding the playable characters. Speaking of which, apart from the two main characters, you’ll be able to recruit more people along the way. However, you’ll only be able to keep up to four in your party. Any others will await for your call in a place called the Hall of Heroes if you get the urge to switch them up a bit.The only real reason to switch characters is to try out different classes and tactics. The character upgrade system is extremely deep and customizable, each class is extremely different with a load of unique traits, abilities and spells. And it’s extremely flexible as well. Just because you committed to a certain class at the beginning doesn’t mean you’re stuck with it if you change your mind. On the contrary, you can mix things up and create something like a rogue specialized in fire spells. You can customize all characters further with weapons and equipment you find along the way. And there’s a ton of loot in this game. Upgrading and customizing your character as well as constantly finding new loot is a huge source of addiction and probably the biggest motivation to continue playing.Original Sin has a turn-based combat system which is awesome because it’s not an under-the-hood system with pause, but with actual turns akin to a regular turn-based strategy game. Apart from being able to witness the myriad of different combat styles, the combat shines thanks to its fantastic convergence of elemental powers. For example, summoning rain will create puddles on the ground and will make your enemies wet. Throwing a lightning bolt onto one enemy will fry him, but will also zap anyone standing in a puddle nearby. Then you can throw a fireball which will dry out the puddles and create mist that will cause enemies to have limited sight. Frozen surfaces will make characters slip and fall, spilled poison can be ignited for additional damage, the possibilities are nearly endless. Naturally, considering that everything you cast on the battlefield will affect your party as well, you have to be careful what you’re doing at all times. It’s just a superb system that never gets old.Divinity: Original Sin is a fantastic looking game, however the art style isn’t particularly distinctive and falls under usual fantasy tropes a bit too often. The same can be said about the soundtrack, it’s definitely pleasing and appropriate, but just doesn’t really stand out in any way. My biggest complaint about the game is that it can be incredibly obtuse at times, particularly regarding the puzzle design. You will actually get hints from books and other sources, but I honestly don’t know what frame of mind you have to be in to figure some of this stuff out. This can get especially frustrating due to how big the world is and considering that a lot of quests span across multiple huge areas.Divinity: Original Sin is one of the big Kickstarter success stories – a rewarding, addictive and unapologetic hardcore RPG brimming with complexity, gameplay depth and content breadth. If only it had a more motivating story, more interesting characters and a more unique game world, it would have been a masterpiece. Still, a few design quibbles aside, this is a great game that will delight anyone looking for a true RPG that brings back cherished genre values and wraps them up in a modern package.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)			"

Early Access Review
								I'll save myself the time and list the major bullet points that make the game based on the Early Access version imo worthwile for purchasing:- modern take on the classical computer RPGs of the 1990s- single player and/or cooperative experience for 2 person of the whole game and the funny part is that even when you play with a friend you dont have to stay together- tactical combat system with action points in a turn-based system which allows for strategic and tactical play- party based game: 2 costumizable characters at game start which can be helped by hireable NPCs and henchmen during the game - 11 starting classes give plenty of options that can be tweaked further to your own liking- classless system to develop your characters the way you want- systemic & interactive gameplay: combine magical spells and manipulate elements like fire, water ice to your own advantage, teleport items around, or become a famous box stacker- deep crafting system: from a pumpkin helmet to simple bread there are lots of possibilites- choices and consequences: disagree with your companions in dialogue and solve quests in a multitude of ways which technically allows you to kill anyone you want- talking to animals with the right skills opens new possibilites and adds a lot of flavour- enjoyable writing (english version cant comment on translations) with a nice humorous undertone- vast gameworld: the full game will feature 4 mas the size of early access gameworld plus multiple smaller maps and dungeons - game will feature a mighty editor and steam workshop integration for fanmade campaigns and stories- nice devs who listened to lots of feedback and implemented it. That is how Early Access should work and they deserve every $- and yes the graphics look gorgeous and beautiful and the game isn't even that hardware intensive Note: Release is on 30th June savegames wont be compatible till then ;)			"

												I've got so many pros to say about this game, that I have to make a tl;dr for the tl;dr!!! If you ever were a fan of Baldur's Gate Series, Icewind Dale, or other rpgs like them, this is a MUST-PLAY (only this one is a turn-based and not a real-time pause)!I also recommend it for PnP (pen 'n' paper) players (as I am one). The thing I love about games with this concept, is that they aren't typical dungeon crawling and boring games. Your characters develop with almost every click you make. Many options in dialogs, and you are free to do almost anything you want inside the game's borders.(DUAL WIELD)Just a comment for the dual wielding, as many seemed disapointed that there isn't that feat-skill in the game. I know it would be cool to have a 2*1h character, which can attack multiple times, but as it seems the developers didn't implemented it. Was it difficult to make changes in the code they had so far? Was it because they thought 1h is easier than 2*1h to handle (as the offhand has to have some penalties)? Was it because of the game's balance? Either way, with a rogue and a dagger at level 3, you can make 8 backstabs in a single turn. This overflows the gap for me, and makes me laugh.Thank you for your time reading my review.Sincerely,eThi.			"

Early Access Review
								Did you like those late 90s isometric RPGs? Planescape, Fallout? Did you like those games because they felt like a great mesh of adventure game and RPG character building? Well this game gets that feeling spot on. You'll want to solve quests and explore the world not for the sake of ""epic loot"", but because the world is just so well crafted, and the people who populate it are fun to talk to. The quest design is excellent, with long quest chains that involve multiple characters and multiple solutions, rather than being the simple collect x amount of y or fed-ex quests that are expected in modern RPGs; the dialogue is genuinely funny (I recommend taking the trait that lets you talk to animals); and the game actually gives you a chance to use magic for things other than killing people (put out a fire with a rain spell, or set off mines by pouring oil on the ground and setting fire to it)!

Divinity: Original Sin[divinityoriginalsin.com]This Divinity game goes back to its roots. The world is one of the most interactive worlds of every game I know. There are always different ways to solve a quest and you are able to kill ANYONE! In the Alpha only the town Cyseal with its surroundings are accessable but you will have 15+ hours of playtime nonetheless. The combat system makes a lot of fun. Instead of making a mainstream hack'n'slash system, Larian developed a very good balanced round based one. Furthermore the elements play a big role in combat. E.g. you freeze water to ice and your enemies will slip when they walk on it. This game will be a gem (if it is not already). With its old school combat system, the interactive world, the well written dialogues, the typical Larian humor and tons of ways to craft different things, Divinity: Original Sin is a game you should keep an eye out for. It has the heart to do something different and it does it better than a lot of games of the last decade.			"

												I zapped a dog who was standing in a puddle. I didn't notice my entire group was also standing in the puddle. We all got stunned for 2 turns. Since I was stunned I couldn't even hit ESC to reload my game. I was forced to watch as the computer killed all my group.10/10			"

												After completing the main story line, I can honestly say this was really good game. My thoughts are based on co-op game from top to bottom. Pros:+ Character interactions with each other are well made and bring nice touch to game. It's too seldom when you can argue with your co-op partner in these games. But luckily Divinity delivers nicely with this. + Battles are well made and there are plenty of different aspects you need to take into account. Personally I was little disappointed that hardest battles where in the first 20 hours of playing. It might be that towards the end you know the battle system better, or you are overpowered, but I would have hoped last fights would have been a bit harder. All in all battles are still a huge plus for this game. + Puzzles are challenging and it is fun to complete them, you need to study the environment and lorebooks and talk to other characters. But puzzles are not too hard for you to complete, they just might take some time. Better have a character with good perception, it helps a LOT. +Side quests, a large diversity of different quests, some totally random and some so obvious, but these side quests bring plenty of diversity and they challenge you on different ways than the main story. Cons- Maybe a bit sloppy main story, and it felt somewhat forced. Don't get me wrong, it could have been a lot worse. - We completed the game with the same ""sidekicks"". Once we tried to hire a new hero to our party, but they seemed to be a bit useless, and changing from your normal sidekick to the new one was made little bit annoying, as all the stuff that the other one was carrying needed to be transfered first to your main characters inventory and from there to your new sidekicks inventory.- SPOILER!!!  You can't continue to play with your characters after beating the final boss. Personally i would have liked to return to town as hero and still keep doing some side quests. Rating****/*****			"

												This game came out recently and I've dropped about 20 hours in, so here are my thoughts!In Divinty: Original Sin you play two source hunters who have come to Cyseal to solve a murder. From there, the plot escalates and the setting becomes increasingly varied and interesting. Exploration is a highlight in this game with tons of secrets, quests and character to be found often tucked away in little hidden areas. You are given the chance to create both source hunters at the start of the game. Original Sin follows a classless system that encourages minor multiclassing without becoming a jack of all trades, as certain enemies are immune or even absorb certain elements.The gameplay of D:OS is a highlight and one of the most talked-about features. There are dozens of interesting reactions between spells, skills, status effects and different types of terrain. A charging warrior can slip on ice, a cloud of steam can be zapped to turn into a cloud of static, or a wet, chilled enemy can be frozen on the spot. All of this makes for fun, tactical combat. It initially seems slow but you'll want the time to plan, as the game is incredibly difficult, especially during boss fights are fights against large amounts of enemies. They too use status effects often.Now, for the graphics and sound. The visuals are highly customisable via the settings, allowing the game to run on old machines, whilst also allowing for some impressive visuals and effects on newer rigs. Animations are average, but spell and skill effects look very nice. One negative is the enemy animations. Some get unique effects, but I often saw generic enemy mages using generic animations for spells of different elements, which was boring and a little confusing. The sound is fantastic, the game has high-quality voice acting for both the player characters and NPCs. There's ambient dialogue which repeats a little too often, but has a very charming Fable-like to it. 'Noone has as many friends as the man with many cheeses!' The music is absolutely top-notch in every respect. Eargasms all round.Thank you for reading my review!			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is one of the best RPG's I have ever played on the PC. Larian Studios have really put their heart and soul into this title.The dialogue, voiceovers, and especially the music are all well executed. I very much enjoy the art style of the game, and all of the vibrant colors in the envorinment and abilities.The interaction with spells/abilities and the environment is phenomenal. Cast an oil spell that will slolw enemies, and follow it up by casing a fire spell that does its initial fire damage, and 100% chance to inflict the burning status ailment.Larian Studios' decision to use turn-based combat instead of real-time combat has paid off. You will question your moves on every turn in combat. If there are too many enemies to deal with (within your level range), look around, there is almost always a way to equalize the battles, you just need to have the right tools.The ability to have companions/mercenaries is great. Equip your comrades how ever you see fit, and make them your mule by stashing all your crap in their inventory!* Do note that Divinity: Original Sin only supports 2-player co-op in a drop in/out type of game. At the start of creating a new co-op campaign, you'll create two new heroes. Those two heroes will be the playable characters for you and your friend for the remainder of the campaign. If you wish to reroll, you must start a new co-op campaign with two new heroes! If your friend has to leave for a bit, s/he may log off, and you can do mundane things like sneak around town and pickpocket everyone until they get back! Their character will become AI until they log back into your game.** There is apparently a Divinity: Original Sin 4-player multiplayer mod! I have not tested it, but I'm sure it's awesome!---My rating: 9.3/10			"

												UPDATE JULY 2, 2014  The game has been officialy out for 48 hours now and I have put in 30 play hour's A play trend I cant contine since I need to return to work.  I had no crashing or other major bug issues though I understand some people have had some issues. The most irritating thing is probably the looping dialog which the most recent patch should now have fixed.   As an old school RPG fan this game hits the spot perfectly.  I am playing only the single player version. Combat and exploration requires a small amount of strategy, it is an open world to explore but if your normal play style is to charge and attack you may be frequently frustrated.  Enemy have set levels and may greatly overpower you if you engage the wrong group to soon but you have many options to deal with them and defeating them may be possible with the right strategy or you can simply turn around and find a fight more at your level.     Quest locations are not maped and marked out for you, you will have to explore and find them, despite my 30 hours of play I dont feel I have gotten very far into the game yet and at this point I couldnt tell you what the main quest line is in the game there are several important issues that need resolving and perhaps they all tie in.  Addmitiedly I havent bothered to look in the quest journal very much yet but I have felt no need except in one case.  So my guide to the game has not been I need to go here and do this but more of can I go here and survive at this point.     The first part of the game dose start out a bit slow since it is in a large city area that needs to be mostly explored in order to do well once you head into the wilds.  There is an issues that for me is minor but could use some work, so far I have found only Two NPC that are scripted there are also hirelings that you can replace them with if you wish but they are not scripted, I am not sure if there are other scripted NPC that can join you but at this point the game could certainly use more veriety there.I would rate this a 9.5 and possible Game of the Year for me.  Below here is my original early access review.This Is one of very few games I didnt wait on for a sale price.  This is an ambitious game and Larian Studios still has thier work cut out for them.  I dont like to spend much time on forum boards or trying to find all the bugs in betas to report them, but I have faith in Larian Studios and I belive they are going to deliver one of the best RPG experiences in years, so I decided to support this on early access.  If your looking to be entertained by polished game play of any sort then I can't recomend you buy this on early access.  The pop up menu to start the game was sized wrong and while I could see three buttons they where cut off and I couldnt read what they did. I tested them and learned the first button was to start the game.  I went into the game set up screen first thing, as I do with all new games to make some adjustments. Pre set graphics and sound seemed fine but I decided to change key binding configurations and several of the buttons on this screen had no text discriptions. After testing the buttons I figured out which ones did what I wanted and had a key binding set up that I desired but once I started the game a loading screen showed me that several of the keys I had set up where used for something else that had not been listed on the key binding page and within the game dialogs would show the original key bindings and not my selected ones as the correct keys to hit.  So I went back into key bindings and set them to default figuring that was the best way to go for now.    In the game I had some difficulty with controlls, the mouse would scroll the screen as expected when I moved curser to the edge of the screen except when I moved it to the center of the bottom area, in order to scroll down I had to either hit the down arrow key or move the pointer to the left or right side of the bottom of the screen.  Next I was confused by what I expected from normall left click movement. I was not sure at points if this was terrain I couldnt walk on or a realy buggie AI but them I accedently clicked on a region that was on the other side of a fairly long cliff and my characters went thier on thier own very smoothly.  After fooling around with movement for awhile I learned that single clicking on near by locations would frequently result in buggy or no movement while distant locations worked well and holding down left click to move worked well.    After that things went fairly smooth.  There was an easy combat, then I found a city and was amused by the caracter dialog exchange, In single player there is an option to have each of your character be able to take part in conversations similar to how it will be in multi player.  After a few conversations I decided to explore randomly looking for something to fight I ran into a pack of skelletons that where to powerful for me so I fled then I ran into a pack of orcs that where to powerful for me and fled then on a whim I blasted some guards with a fireball and fled.  That was about the end of my play session and I doubt I will play to much more before the full game release.  So if this sounds dreadful to you do not buy this early access, unless like me you have faith that a polished final product will eventually be delivered and want to throw in your support. I  do not regret buying this game at this point, it is no more then I expected.Just an update since the game has moved into beta all of the issues above have been cleared up, the game dose seem to now be in a more enjoyable playable state, but it is to early for an overall review as there are still many bugs that need polish.

												Divinity: Original Sin (D:OS) serves as a testament to counter the culture of modern gaming.  Larian allowed nothing to hinder their vision for their creation; their love for games and the players who enjoy them serves as the greatest foundation in the making of D:OS.  From gameplay, design philosophy, dedicated patches post-launch, Larian has such confidence in their product because they have faith that their players would appreciate their steadfast, dedicated approach than cave in to the poison of modern culture.Whether you love or hate Divinity, one could not deny the amount of love, respect, and effort Larian put into this game.  It's an example that anyone should  be following in their daily lives.As a result, D:OS performs marvelously on all fronts.Graphics: It's a CRPG, so let's set the bar realistically.  Rivellon in D:OS is simply gorgeous.  The colours and art bring out the atmosphere of the locations.  Weather effects are sharp and clear.  Spell and weapon effects are a charm to behold.  The attention to detail and polish makes this play like a modern game.Sound/Voice Acting/Writing: The sound effects are solid.  There is nothing I do in game where the sound effects were inappropriate or unconvincing, from combat to walking through different weather terrains.  Not all NPCs are voiced, but when they are it is definitely well written and acted out convincingly.  Voice acting was always a strength when it came to Larian's games and I really did wish that there were more of them in D:OS.Writing is another one of Larian's strongest skills.  Taste in writing is subjective.  The two previous games share this trait and D:OS doesn't escape this formula.  Unlike them, most of the writing is read rather than voiced.  It doesn't make the writing any less effective, yet the voice acting in the previous games also displayed the skills of the voice actors and how Larian will not attempt at anything less than stellar. Music: Although taste in music is subjective, you cannot accuse Larian for doing their soundtracks poorly.  The quality is excellent.Story Progression: The beauty about how this game works is the content comes to you the more you talk to people.  The more people you talk to, the more quests you get, the more variety of solutions to solve quests open to you.  Character abilities could be enhanced through dialogue.  It also gives you the freedom to kill quest givers, emphasizing on the lack of hand holding in this game.  For those who complain about the main story progression is in reality linear and how it is pretending to be open world, I might need to remind you that Dragon Age: Origins was also linear in spite offering 5 factions to recruit.  In addition, in Fallout: New Vegas you were not advised to take the shortest path to get to Vegas from the beginning.  I loved both games and they both failed at attempting to make the main story feel non-linear.Combat: Combat is turn based, and that is subjective.  The use of environment as a key addition to your tactics, however, is worthy of praise.  The game encourages you to make good use of all the elements at your disposal so you are capable of winning a battle you would not otherwise win by capitalizing the terrain.  If the terrain is not in your favour, the option of making your own environment is there.  The doors of variety are open, making every battle a different one.  DRM/Microtransactions: It has no reason to exist.Free Companion DLC: This action is extremely pro-consumer and it speaks volumes of how Larian treats their players.  These two members give your party a good mix up and adds variety to the game.  Larian had no reason to do this for free, but they wanted players to have more experiences than less.Kickstarter Success: Larian proved to us that they are very capable of not cheating money that came from good faith.  Given the amount of abuse and horror stories from many developers that failed to create a game to live up to the expectations or simply scammed the contributors, D:OS is a beacon of example.All said and done, no doubt this is a 10/10, right?No.  I adore the game and it's my favorite game of the year, but it's not a 10/10.  D:OS does so many things right so well that it's all the more glaring when it does something wrong.Character Customization: Due to how the character progression is designed in D:OS, hybrids can easily become mediocre if points are allocated wrong.  This limits one's creativity and encourages pures to be made due to simplicity and efficiency.  Despite that, pure builds also have a problem from the inaccessibility to crucial spells.  The best example is the Two Handed Knight.  Both AoE attacks are very limited in the game.  One of them can only be selected through character creation.  The other one comes very scarcely.   Respec removes all abilities you have, thus you cannot make any errors on an AoE Knight.  How could handicapping a build and punishing trial and error exist here? Players won't know any of this information unless they read up all the info before hand.RNG: Although it's a necessary system, this makes an already slow game even slower.  Players want all the legendary gear vendors sell and will reload the game over and over until they find the pieces they want.  Vendors reset their inventory every level and thus this happens with multiple vendors on every level up.  Any loot-able source that can drop legendaries will have the player reloading the game until a desired piece drops.Crafting:  As wonderful it may be to see that there is little hand holding and the abundance of freedom, I wish the crafting wasn't so overwhelming.  It's annoying to be bombarded with so many different items and have little idea regarding how to use them.  I don't want the game to be simple, but it would've been great if there was something to point players towards the right direction.What do all have in common?Time Consumption: The above factors all contribute to many very time consuming activities in addition to the 80 to 100 hours it requires to finish the game.  The game is marvelous in its own right indeed, yet when it demands this much time from its players it's vital to make the experience as efficient as possible.  Let's face it, we all have a limited of time each day to play games due to real life commitments, and Larian needs to figure out how to make the most use of our time when we offer it.  It's frustrating to be engaged in a game for hours just to find yourself accomplishing little.What's even more tragic is that Larian had no intention of doing this.  They embraced all the ideas they wanted in a great game, worked so diligently to create a masterpiece, and yet in oversight their creation caused a dilemma that would've easily destroyed games of lower caliber.  That proves just how powerful and brilliant D:OS is.  When you're doing stuff it feels like DA: Origins.  When it doesn't it leave you hungering more for what could have been if the pacing was more efficient.  I believe it could potentially surpass DA: Origins with the last stroke of polish.Regardless of these flaws, due to my adoration to Divinity, I'll be giving all the time that's required of me to experience D:OS thoroughly.  However, not everyone will be compelled to give Larian such grace, and this notion hurts the presentation of the game.  No one can justify why there's little to no progress in a game after putting hours of their free time into it.I pray that there are upcoming DLCs and detailed patches that could remedy the issues.  D:OS was ever so close to perfection.Final Verdict: 8.7/10 (How I wish this was a 9/10)This package of love, respect and care is only $40.  Support Larian for what they do and there will be hope that their next Divinity game will outperform Original Sin.  They are real risk takers, unafraid to make whatever they feel is fun, and have the integrity, talent, character and dignity to back it up.			"

												Beat the game last night... My overall thoughts:Pros:- It's a classic RPG style game in our modern day of gaming. Yay!- Decent enough graphics for what it is.- Good length to the game - doesn't end 6 hours after purchase like so many titles do nowadays.- Interesting changes in terrain and level design.- Interesting use of elemental interaction for spells.- Love the allowance of coop play. It's nice to have an RPG I can play with my partner.Cons:- Dialogue/story is overly verbose and unnecessarily convoluted. Everyone has countless paragraphs to babble on through when the message is often very simple. I get that it's meant to be old-timey fantasy speech, but plenty of other RPGs succeeded in that feel without dragging on text forever.- Lot of game crashing bugs still. I'm running 64-bit Windows 7 on a top end custom built computer, so I truly believe there are no issues on my end (heck, I run everything else just fine on ultra settings).- Lot of bugs and glitches in general, actually.- NPCs dialogue spam (particularly in Cyseal) is just obnoxious.- If my partner is initiating dialogue, why can't I just read it with him? I can get past this using the Journal or whatever, but why can't I just flipping see it like in any other game if I'm standing RIGHT THERE? Stupid. Oh, and aforementioned NPC spam does not help this issue.- Combat seems to become repetitive upon reaching higher levels. You end up using the same tactics against enemies, and none of them really pose a challenge once you have your resistances set up. Seems mostly a game of ""Who can stun lock who the longest?!""- Crafting and inventory system could use several improvements. - Really bad loot system. - Broken achievements.- And my least favorite thing of this game - Rock paper scissors to determine winner when it came to dialogue debates (intimidate, charm, reason) as opposed to rolling checks like DnD style based on stats. Made me nerdrage to the max having to go through that crap over and over and over again.... and so on and so forth. I could make a bigger list or go into further detail, but I think this gives a good summary of my beef with it. I'm disappointed. Divinity: Original Sin could have been a great game. In fact, it's style of play is one of my favorites in gaming, and yet it falls short due to all its bugs and game design choices. I have no idea how the developers could have even remotely seen some of their decisions as good. I ultimately rate this title around a C- due to my lack of enjoyment in story, end game combat, and due to the amount of game breaking bugs.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game yesterday, downloaded it, fired it up for a quick 5 minute peek before going to bed for the night.6 hours later it was close to 5am, and I was torn between logging off for an hrs kip before getting up for work, or just playing through.I haven't played an RPG that sucked my life away so effectively since Baldur's Gate essentially redefined the genre over 15 years ago.  At the time of writing, the game is still in early access, and it is a truely excellent experience.   With the exception of turn based combat, the game is entirely free flowing, and the mechanics really truly and honestly finally give you the option to approach a situation in pretty much any way you can conceive of.  Every thing you do, from quests to minor 2 line encounters with npc's feel fluid, and for the first time since a certain ranger yelled ""Go for the eyes Boo!"", I feel like a dev has finally gotten the humour right.Divinity: OS is simply amazing, and if you enjoy RPG's, you need to add this one to your cart immediately.Do I recommend this game? absolutely, most emphatically, yes!

												By far and away, the most fun I've had out of a modern RPG in a very, very long time... and that's no surprise, because it has much more in common with classic RPGs than those that have been released these past few years.It's as if the developers took the best bits of the Baldur's Gates and Neverwinters, added a splash of Dragon Age, and finally trimmed the edges and polished the embellishments. All that, on top of the fact it seems it was designed from the ground up with a co-operative multi-player system in mind, such that the game doesn't suffer at all if you play it alone, but if another player is present, it effects every part of the game in a positive way.There are very, very few games that I will give an unreserved recommendation for, but this is one of them, because I feel that if you've played Divinity: Original Sin and don't enjoy it, then you're probably an alien lizard wearing a human's skin, and you should be out conquering our planet not playing computer games anyway :P			"

								Great game, but it is very much still in alpha. Co-op and companions literally just got implemented in todays live build, and the character customization is littered in 'Disabled in Alpha' features. Besides that, from the time I spent I enjoy it immensely, the animations are truly wonderful, combat is great turn based fun, and the world is immense and so open ended. Like the Deus Ex style of quest solving. Highly recommended.			"

Quests are meaty and engaging, Dialog is compelling, arguments with fellow NPCs/players is a great plus. Random events get you thinking. Loving the map + custom placemarkers just like in the old days.

DAMN BLEED Y U CONNECT ME TO THE ELECTRIFIED PUDDLE""+ side:*Very deep and original game mechanics (if you like D&D, this game is for you).*Nice story and art direction.*Nice art, very few CTDs (though they tend to annoyingly happen when you are about to forget about them).*Class and character customisation.*Item stats, diverse enough to really make you wonder which item you should use over another.*Good replay value since the game can be replayed with totally different player choices.*Coop can be a bit weird, but still really fun.*Larian Grade humor material.*Connected to the other Divinity Games.-side:*Item appearance, very limited appearance customisation with armors (the lvl 5 basic plate has the same appearance as the lvl 20 unique one, which is unforgivable!)*Easy to get stuck as Larian Studio is a master at devilish puzzles! Or just get lost, not knowing where to go.*As in Divinity 2, level is everything: if you are one level under the enemies, you are usually in for a hard fight, but if you overpower them by at least a level, the fights become way more simple. This allows the player to know where to go, but also feels very punishing.*Rewards are exploitable through quicksave >.< (and this makes the game a looooooooot easier)*Saddly the modding community for this game didn't seem to pick up though there is a real potential.Having played this game since it was available on steam, having seen it grow from an edgy rock into this fine jewel, I recommend this game. A first blind playthrough with a friend is also recommended :D8.5/10 "

Early Access Review
								First of all my background.. i've played games/rpg's/jrpg's since back in the snes days of lufia and chrono trigger.. also crpgs since before baulders gate lol.As of the beta update this imo is one of the best isometric party based rpg's of all time... the only thing that will hold this back is budget and size from eclipsing even baulders gate or the original fallout. So if you like those games go ahead and buy it now.Graphics... As of the beta update the graphics are awesome.. especially for a kickstar crowdfunded game based on thier own in house engine which heck how many devs just rent an engine these days.. The art and graphical style isn't as cartoonish as wow but maintains that vibrant colerfull look.. completely opposite the drab muddy look i personally hate in games. Spell effects are awesome and when you zoom all the way in its really nice with depth of field and Ambient occlusion and smaa anti alaising.. basically all the goodies one expects in a modern graphics engine. Really have no complaints in this department. (And i am a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥).Combat.. You control up to a party of 4.. 2 main char's then 2 hired char's which have backstories and can be leveled and equipped just as your main's yet if they die they are gone.. you gotta go find another to hire somewhere.. they are more than just henchmen.. they are companions. this along with summons and you can potentially be controlling 6 char's at once for a period of time during combat.. its turn based combat  All i can say is way to hit the nail on the head in the turn based combat.. i was never really a fan of D&D based rulesets and the drab nature of the spells and such in those games yet don't get me wrong i still loved them.Divinity OR gives you that great tactical turn based combad of old yet breathes new life into them with more colorfull and just plain fun array of spells and skills to use.Your actions during a particular turn are based off action points ... every skill requires a certain amount (which you regain them based on talents and the way you build your char every turn).. moving requires them... using items .. moving an oil barrell over to some enemies so your wizard can in turn cast a fireball and blow em to crap.. ya u can do that.. more on that later.. all based on these action points and on top of that they also have a cooldown based around so many turns.. one spell maybe u can use again in 4 turns another in 1 or 2 .. between the two systems and the amount ot skills/spells you have a ton of diversability.The elements:  Every element reacts with the others... rain whether by spells or natural puts out fire and makes enemies/char's wet.. then they  can be frozen via ice spells then shattered by your meelee char's yet are more resistant to fire... fire spells can catch enemies on fire.. Rain can make puddles which can be hit with an ice spell to freeze the puddle so enemies fall.. or you can cast lightning into said puddle to stun/electrocute enemies.  Oil slicks can be ignited by fire... etc etc..The combat is good enough to make you want more combat instead of dreading combat. I believe even a person who is usually turned off by turn based combat would like this.Gameplay.. Everything in the world is interactable.. move things around.. destroy them.. stack them.. etc etc..The loot system is great.. you have many equipable slots and find many different variety of items along your journies that all can have many substats... magical properties .. this is common in many games these days just feel good in knowing larian didn't mess it up.. its done well in this game. Nothing really new with it just done well and not broken.Its a quest based game yet its not WoW.. no quest markers and the such.. back to the roots with a quest log and using your brain here... your told general directions/ideas then its up to you to figure out the rest. Quest log is done very well and also you have a dialoug log and recipe log and that brings me to crafting.Crafting is ingenious in this game.. you just combine items in your inventory and see what you get simple as that... (there are more complex crafting later which really in the game is blacksmithing which you use an anvil and furnace and other things in the game world but its the same principle drag item from inventory to said anvil and vice versa no immersion breaking crafting menus and the such).. Example 1.. combine knife with pumpkin and you get a jackolatern which turns out to make a good temporary helmet early in game... or hammer with cooking pot for similar effect..(and you actually have in game models for all these strange combinations so you run around with a pumpkinhead) nails with branch for a basic spiked club... arrowheads with shafts which you make by combining knife with tree branch.. then mix up some poison by combining certain mushroom with empty vial then apply poision to arrowhead first then you have poison arrow so simple yet thats what makes it so great. its based on logic not some magic formula that doesn't make sense.Dialoug is handled well also... .. there is choice and consequence but i have yet to see long term effects as we only have 25 percent of the game. Surrounding dialoug are the reasoning skills such as charm intimidate reason and so forth that is a dice roll based on your stats in the background which is a staple these days and nothing new yet as before rest assured larian hasn't messed it up or broken it. Now what they have done is put conversations between your two main chars (for co-op which i wont review as i've not experianced it yet but its built around a very sound principle and others seem to love it).. but you actually talk to yourself and discuss certain in game events with other main char.. seems silly but it works as you can think of them as another person in real life you know and answer for them accordingly and it effects certain background traits such as... romantic vs pragmatic and this will have an effect on these char's relationship and the story later on. there is really no right or wrong but this adds a depth to the two main char's that isn't achievable just through scripted chit chat between them like in most games. (If you don't fancy talking to yourself..you can select an A.I for your other char for these conversations but you still control them in combat)  Exploration is fantastic in this game... loot galore yet not meaningless as in diablo... such a huge map to explore just in the beta which is only 20 percent of the game.. Sound.. i'm not too into game music but lets just say its not bad enough for me to notice it and it blends very well with the game atmosphere.. its composed and relaxing and soothing and fits the tones of the in game events at the time. Spells have nice effects and sound stereo instead of monotone.Char Development.... Completely free and classless .. enough said lol.. Many talents to choose from along with stat point allocation and many many diverse skills/spells to learn/purchase broken up into schools... as well as warrior/ranger/rogue skills  for those that like that style of play. Stat points are spent on the norms.. int str dex ...etcSkill points are spent on schools/disciplines or on personality stats such as barter/leadership .. etc or on the norms like lockpicking crafting blacksmithing... its all done very well and fits together and exactly what one who likes this  type of game would want.Hold alt key to highlight items in game world is tied directly to the perception stat and how many points you put in it.. enough said.. the fact larian had enough sense to do this tells you alot.Conclusion: They have done what i thought would never be done again with the route gaming has takn . .Simple as that. The perfect blend of exploration/old schoolness/tactical and turn based yet feels full of action/quest based gameplay i've been waiting for since the infinity engine days.			"

								In D:OS it's not long before I forget what quest I am on and find myself miles away in the wild wondering what I am doing, or spending an hour looking for some useful ingredient. From the get go I just felt like going in some direction and the world which I could access is littered with items and events. When it comes to a dialogue decision, you are often given a dilemma and it is designed well to make two people have a conversation - or argument - about said decision. I found the options were never black and white and I never found myself thinking about quest rewards, which is unusual.As a kickstarter backer, I was pleased with the alpha and Larian is certainly open to feedback. I believe they have a good vision and are interested in preserving the essence of the game.			"

												This game reminded me strongly of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, though with true turn-based combat and more humor. Instead of creating an entire party of adventurers, though, you only create two (you can pick up two more pre-made companions of pretty much any configuration later on). Overall, I think the developers did a great job, and the few nitpicks I have with it will hopefully be addressed with patches or mods later on. For me, the game's main appeals are the strategic combat and the vibrant level designs. Almost every combat was interesting--just around the time you start getting bored, you'll gain a level and some new abilities or weapons to freshen things up (as will the monsters). My first playthrough was maddeningly difficult because I chose a rogue as my main character and, worse, tried to explore a harder part of the map before I was ready. In general, you should find areas where the monsters are the same level as your party. I find that even a single level difference will make the combat frustrating if not infuriating, with the mobs resisting pretty much anything you throw at them. Unfortunately, it's not always clear where you should or can go next, so you might need to resort to a walkthrough or quest guide occasionally to make sure you haven't missed something important. I know a lot of ""hardcore"" types were responsible for the lack of guidance in this game (it was Kickstarter-funded), but a bit more detail in the quest log sure wouldn't have hurt anything in my opinion.I ended up starting over with two fighter types, a wizard, and an archer, and ditched the rogue. Unlike most CRPGs, lockpicking isn't a big deal here, and any character can be trained to do thief skills anyway. I found stealthing and backstabbing to be more trouble than they were worth, and there's no dual wielding. I liked my archer much better. The only real complaint I have is the pace of the battles. Inexplicably, there is no slider bar for ratcheting up spell animations and the like. After you've seen the same 4-second winding-up animation for the hundreth time, you may be yearning for a way to skip over them. I actually found myself getting up to refill my tea during combat, and the computer still wasn't finished taking its turn when I got back. Another vital tip is to learn shields as soon as possible. It wasn't clear to me what these were, since they are titled something like ""fire resistance shield,"" which makes it sound like they're just good for, well, resisting fire. To the contrary, they'll protect you from anything, but have bonues and penalties associated with the element. Another major concern are ""surfaces,"" such as oil slicks, water puddles, blood, poison gas, and so on. These will often react quite violently to elemental effects, and can easily destroy your own characters if you aren't very careful. I found myself just taking lightning bolts and such off my quick bar, since most of the time I just stunned my own characters with them. Still, overall I enjoyed this game very much and looked forward to playing it more. It's been awhile since I had to stop playing a game because I was too sleepy, rather than too bored, to coninue. If you liked Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale back in the day, this is about as close to that experience that I've been able to find in a modern release. Enjoy!			"

												Cons:The inventory system can be frustrating because there are LOTS of things to collect, but: a) no sorting options; b) no \'shift + click\' option so you can work with more than one item at a time.Pros:- The storyline is solid. A little mystery, a couple of big hit surprises, and unusual characters involved in different ways. - There is a good amount of variety in settings, ranging from rocky, to green, to frosty, to morbid, etc.  This plays into the environmental & elemental effects system well; and the quests are often particularly suited to the setting. - Gameplay is loads of fun.  A good mix of playing around with characters abilities (especially trying out different combinations between party members), turn-based strategy, and making use of environmental effects.- Maybe not for everyone, but what I really loved about it was the way I would often die in a battle and, rather than come back later after gaining a few levels, could just replay it trying a different strategy and win.  Sometimes the battles went absolutely terribly the first time; badly a couple more times; then ended up in a win... Trying out different strategies made the gamplay unique; and winning after such a challenge is hugely satisfying.- A decent range of abilities and character builds.  Not amazing variety, but good.- Some very different \'bosses\' that require tackling in different ways.One of the most enjoyable games I\'ve played in the last 10 years; and WELL ahead of all the stale 3D first person actioners.

												Divinity Original Sin is a great Crpg made by Larian Studios. The story takes place in a fantasy world, Rivellon, like the rest of the franchise. The two main protagonists are source hunters, but there is more to them than meets the eye. And little do they know of the importance of a quest they must undertake that will affect the world. Like in all grand epics the source hunters start off with a routine murder case, and what they discover that day will change them. The story in Divinity Original Sin is one full of twists and turns that will not disappoint. This game has a plethora of colorful characters/villains that will make you both laugh and cry. Your companions (if you choose to have them), have plenty of well thought out backgrounds. Their sidequests tie well with their stories and are entertaining. The game may have a few misspellings here and there but has plenty of depth worthy of your attention. The graphics and art of Divinity Original Sin are top notch. You are also hit with enjoyable music that sets the tone on your adventures. When you start playing, you are immediately immersed by the beauty of this world. It is a welcomed sight to have so many well placed details in this game. But don't take my word for it, let us ""Rock-paper-scissors"" it. The difficulty of this game is to my liking. There will be plenty of quicksaves and quickloads that will go throughout your many battles. There are puzzles that you will spend hours on and will say, ""Oh, that's where the switch was the whole time."" Yes people, using different fields of view will be your best friend on this journey. In Fact lest I forget, the game also encourages using the field to your advantage during battles. This is one gem that I would recommend to friends and family alike. I hope the people in the steam community who haven't played this game or have just given up on it, will give Divinity Original Sin the chance it rightly deserves. This game will not lead you by the hand, and you will appreciate it all the more for solving/winning the game under your own power. Happy gaming.			"

Early Access Review
								(Warning: Looong)First, some background.  Somewhere around December 20th, 2011, I discovered the Divinity series.  I was young, naive, thinking every game on Steam was a great one.  I could have easily been burned, badly.  But I wasn't.  In Divinity 2: The Dragon Knight Saga I found a true gem.  While I never got very far, and I eventually forgot about it for a while, I always knew in my heart that it was a good game.  Fast-forward some time, and I, now more wizened to the terrors of bad games, find that Divinity 2: Developer's Cut had come out.  I wanted to buy it, but to my surprise, I already had it!  The people I would soon come to know as Larian Studios had given me a free copy, just because I bought their game some time ago!  I was stunned.  Right then and there, I said to myself, ""These fine people have earned a customer for life!""  Oh, but what was to come.Sometime in early 2013, as I was perusing the forums as I am wont to do, I happened to glance at a post for a Kickstarter.  I had heard of KS before that; even almost purchased something.  I would've just passed it by, but something caught my eye.  As you might have figured out by now, that Kickstarter was for none other than Larian's Divinity: Original Sin.  It was then that those old memories of searching through goblin-filled tunnels and flying as a dragon came screaming back to me.  Soon it was all I could think about; how I could get money to buy it, what the process for doing so was, even possibly what the game was going to be like.  Soon, it was a done deal.  I raised a fairly healthy sum (at that point $25, just enough to get the game) and soon had myself neck-deep in chatting with the wonderful people there.  It wasn't long until I felt I wanted more.  Then, like a gift from the Game Gods, I found the Weresheep.  For a measly $6, I could join this order of super-fans!  And so, my sum kept rising and rising, eventually passing $100.  I won't disclose the full number, but it wasn't cheap!Now, with the backstory done, let's get to the actual game.  Currently, the game is in an ""Alpha"" state, as told by multiple warnings throughout the store page and game itself.  So obviously, there will be (and are) bugs, some game-breaking.  Also, with most update the saves become incompatible, so be prepared to start again a lot.The game starts with a pop-up asking you to recognize that it's not finished, content may change, etc.  Once you hit the ""Play"" button, the game itself starts up.  The starting menu is fairly basic, and the menus (last time I checked) are placeholders from their last game, Dragon Commander.  Loading screens can be slow, and are prone to freezing (visually only; it loads after a minute or so).  But once that's all done, the game pops you, without so much as an intro cutscene, into a character creation screen.  It's fairly simple; choose your class (Which is not binding, by the way; it's very free-form) and make them pretty, then you're in.  You're immediately put in control of two characters, Roderick and Scarlett, who have a quick dialog before a box pops up telling you that you can click to walk.  And that's really it for an introduction; you're left to fend for yourself in a land which, admittedly, is not very dangerous-looking.  But the lack of controls isn't a bad thing; the game is fairly simple and the system is quick to pick up.According to Larian, there's a good couple of hours in right now.  I think that's pretty modest.  Depending on how you play, you can spend hours in the city alone.  This is a truly open-world game, a game I like to describe as ""Go anywhere, do anything"".  And no other game embodies that as much as Original Sin.  There are an infinite number of choices; if you think killing everybody and prancing on their graves while drinking a bottle of wine and smashing tomatoes with a hammer is your thing, go right ahead!To sum it up, if Early Access isn't your thing, please, do not buy this game expecting a bug-free experience.  This game can and will break, and spectacularly so.  But if you think you can handle it, dive in, and be prepared to be amazed by the sights and sounds of Rivellon.  Speaking of sounds, by the way, those are done by none other then the great Kirill Pokrovsky, who is a musical genius.  And, thanks to the Kickstarter, he has an entire orchestra at his disposal.  Truly, this music has to be seen, er, heard, to be believed.TL,DR: Game good.  Buy.			"

												The Great:-Engrossing party-based isometric turn-based tactical combat that allows for incredible variety in strategy-Highly developed RPG mechanics that allow significant customization of your characters and playstyleThe Good:-More or less classic fantasy RPG story that keeps the game interesting while not taking itself too seriously-Gameplay requires thought and actual tactics as it is easy to blunder into dyingThe Bad:-Combat slightly favors ranged/casting classes due to environmental effects and tactics-Quests and story do not hold your hand, so it can be easy to miss something if you aren't paying attention-Limited companion options until later in the game can make poorly guessed initial character choices slightly too punishingOverall:One of the best CRPGs to come out in years.

												I tend to prefer games that hold my hand.  Know the bread crumb trail that everyone hated in Fable 2, yep, I am the guy that loved that.  When I feel lost in a world, I get frustrated.  I just want to know what to do and when to do it.  Divinity doesn't hold your hand.  It is an unforgiving, old school RPG, and it is one of my favorite games of all time.  Things that normally annoy me in other games don't feel like a problem in Divinity.  I want to explore.  I want to find my own path.  I want to spill oil on the ground, knock some barrels in to it, and then set them on fire.  It is nothing like other games that I have enjoyed in the past, and yet it will be a game I look back on fondly for as long as I play games.			"

												Great game, I wish i could dedicate the time it deserves to it. 20 hours into it I had no choice but to switch to easy and consult google about some of the most annoying puzzles. Since every point of XP is so important I felt forced to complete everything there was, even sidequests I had zero interest in and riddles that are just bad and provide no satisfaction when finally figuring it out. Opposite to all the freedom this game offers, for which I loved most of the time I spent with it, the chore to do these 10% of quests I hated finally led to decision not to continue. Combat is getting boring on easy, but normal is way to time consuming for me, because I refuse to quicksave and reload all the time.Maybe I played it wrong, maybe I should have started over at some point when fully understanding all the mechanics, I definitely wasted a few points now and then at the beginning. I probably should have exploited the random loot generation, like it is recommended by many people and I guess playing in 10h sessions during the holidays until early hours doesn´t make puzzle solving any easier. To come to a conclusion of the above rambling: It is one of the best games of 2014 and I also respect the approach to let the player figure out everything the hard way, even if this means that guys like me who haven´t played such hardcore RPGs for a long time probably need to start over after 10-20h. What would have helped in my case would be a difficulty between easy and normal, where I would be able to skip a few things and have challenging battles along the main story line. Visually, the game is splendid and apart from the annoyingly jumping camera I was constantly amazed. Epic story and awesome writing, makes the massive amount of reading surprisingly enjoyable (the abysmal writing in most games recently infected me with the habit to skip through most dialogues and sequences, Original Sin is a welcome antidote) Looking forward to whatever follows, would crowdfund so I could annoy the heck out of the Devs during early development :)			"

												After over 100 hours of gameplay, I finally managed to slog through this game to the end, if only just to say that I completed it. Don't get me wrong, I don't absolutely hate the game; it's just that it more than overstayed its welcome in addition to having significant flaws.First of all, the crafting system is just horrendous. It's extremely unintuitive and tedious. Let's say you want to create a magic scroll. You must first acquire yourself an ink pot and a quill. Good luck with that, because no vendors sell them. I ended up having to steal them from a friendly NPC. You must then combine them by dragging the icon for the quill over the icon for the ink pot, then stand by and watch a progress bar fill, in order to create an ""Ink Pot & Quill"". Now you have to get some pixie dust. Find a bone and grind it to dust using a mortar and pestle; oh yeah, you need one of those as well. Now find a stardust plant and throw it in the mortar and pestle to create stardust. Now combine the bonemeal and stardust to make pixie dust. Now sprinkle some pixie dust on the ink pot and quill to make ""Magic Ink Pot and Quill""! Now find an axe and a log of wood. Hack up the log with the axe to get a few wood chips. Now find a bucket and search all over town for a well. Draw water from the well into the bucket. Combine the water and one pile of wood chips to make one ""Mush of Wood"". Now search all over town for a furnace. Throw the wood mush on the furnace; lo and behold: One sheet of paper! Now kill a dangerous Water Elemental and take its essence. Rub the water essence on the sheet of paper to make a ""Blank Water Scroll"". Now is the moment we've all been waiting for! Use the magic ink pot and quill on the blank water scroll to create... oh, no sorry, your crafting skill is too low. Now go kill dozens of insane demons and level up in order to increase your crafting. Great, can we craft the scroll now? As I was saying, use the magic ink pot and quill on the blank water scroll to create... wait for it... a random, low-level, one-time-use water magic scroll! You managed to do all of this without any indication in game of what you needed to do! Wasn't that worth it guys? The loot in this game sucks. Mainly you will find more ingredients for crafting and lots and lots of vendor trash. It's hard to afford anything in the beginning, but keep picking up those garbage items and dozens of hours later you'll be swimming in gold! Which goes back to my previous point: why would you craft anything when the items you craft are inferior to the gear you will inevitably have already found by the time you figure out how to craft anything?I like that this game avoids the ""follow the pointer"" trend in modern video games. However, the game world is quite large and it would be nice if there was some—any—indication of where you need to go without exploring every square inch of the map. Want to know where some place is in town? Too bad you can't just ask an NPC, because they don't have that interaction programmed in. Want to delve further into your current quest objective in order to understand what it is you're trying to accomplish? Too bad, because the one relevant NPC can only tell you some generic, fluff dialogue.I could go on, but the final criticism that I want to raise is that the writing is just not compelling. It's one of the most ham-fisted and saccharine takes on the ""world is ending"" trope I've ever seen. It would have been nice if I could just go on adventures with some nuance and intrigue, rather than having to prevent existence from coming to an end by a contrived plot device.Not recommended.			"

												This is by far the greatest PC RPG that I've ever played since Baldur's Gate series! I seriously found myself missing the isometric camera view, and this game fed into my hunger even more! :) The social interaction between player characters are well arranged, laws of physics are all over the battle scenes, main plot is interesting, and the game world is very rich. Using Rock-Paper-Scissors to decide arguments between parties is both humorious and imaginative, and it was my favorite part in the game. I strongly recommend the experience to all RPG lovers! This game is a must :)			"

												This is the first of its kind for me. I've never really played a similar game. At first the fact that it's turn-based may seem like a turn-off (hehe) but that's not really the case. The turn based combat definitely does not feel slow most of the time. Sometimes the number of enemies getting turns in a row requires a little bit of wait. However, this ties in well with a mention of status effects. You quickly learn how to effectively freeze, stun, or knock-down enemies. I found I used these a LOT more than simply slowing, cursing, or lowering the attributes of an enemy force, those effects I'm sure are more necessary on hard (I played on normal) but the results are a little more subdued. The great benefit to me for the first list of statuses is that it means you don't have to wait for 5 enemy zombies to move in a row, hurray! One thing that was annoying at first but learned to avoid and appreciate later was avoiding stunning my own forces with various air/lightning spells. Sometimes I would think a unit was in the clear because she was near but not next to an enemy force but would still get stunned. I learned later on the usefulness of putting a fair number of points (and wearing appropriate gear) into the various Body Building and Willpower (or wearing armor with some form of immunity instead of just grabbing the highest armor value). Of course, this was a little easier to splurge on with the Secrets vendor exploit still in place.Later on in the game it's very easy to just buff up armor/elemental resistance and go to town and watch enemies fail to do a lot of damage. Some late game enemies were actually somewhat interesting in this regard because they rely on brute strength of a few units rather then an ambush where you have to worry about engaging on multiple fronts for a larger number of enemies. I actually had to change my strategy a bit here since I really only had 1 person able to take many hits from them and my other units (2 mages and an archer) were simply too squishy for the heavy physical damage. Luckily I had two people capable of teleporting them to where they shouldn't be to help keep things in check. The game emphasizes strategy, but it's also incredibly unbalanced, which can be a benefit but is sometimes an annoyance.The Act 1 boss fight was the first example of the game teaching me the great value of positioning (rather than just forgoing it since it was previously not something that I needed to worry about.) Early in the game, I could more or less simply turtle, buff/debuff, and then focus fire target by target until there were no more targets left. The four foes in that boss fight just do not go down that fast, so I needed to make smart use of summons, teleporting both the enemies and myself, and really paying attention to the turn order. Seems like basic stuff but up to that point I didn't need to be as focused, and instead would just analyze what should be done as unit turns rolled instead of any long-term planning.Unfortunately, the level of that fight was never really met again until the penultimate boss fight. From the second map on, I had a pretty great rotation of summons, buffs, and engaging that I really didn't need to deviate from. Most of the mid game boss fights I didn't even need to worry about whatever the mechanic was for the fight. King SPOILER had an interesting elemental mechanic but was long dead before I even had to worry about it. Maybe I should have played the game on hard, but in act one Normal seemed like a great balance. I probably should have switched but in the middle of progressing through the game the ease of combat first feels empowering instead of boring. I guess that's what second playthroughs are for SOMEDAYThe last part of the game really dragged on for me and soured me a little bit. I was traversing the last area and would actually loathe seeing red dot enemy blobs since they were just wasting time. I suppose a consequence of the long run time of the game itself as well as the rote-ness that encounters had become by that point. The only interesting encounters in that area involved the a certain goblin enemy type since they were so tanky and I couldn't just take them out quickly. So instead I would wipe out all their friends and then just peg them down slowly or less slowly, far past to point of them being an actual threat. I really enjoyed the encounters around Cyseal and Hunter's Edge because the battles felt meaningful and paced between quest progression. The red dots in that final area and to a lesser extent, Hiberheim, it just felt like I was a cartographer scraping the edges of the map and clearing it out just for a sense of completion. One of my gripes with the combat system, as as been mentioned by others, is that sometimes it's easy to ""miss"" a target if his idle animation moves him out from underneath your cursor and you end up walking up to give him a hug rather than attack. I wonder if a toggle for a snappy cursor would be a possible implementation. Sometimes you can click on the enemy portrait or zoom and wiggle the camera but a lot of times there are many enemies of the same time and you're unsure which portrait is his, and for me moving the camera can sometimes mess with my mental map.The pet talking talent is super useful, and putting it on one of my source hunters was the only real piece of advice I went into the game with. I see a lot of talk about people restarting to try to perfect their characters while I just went with a long laundry list of imperfections that made the game somewhat interesting. It will be interesting enough to see people speed run (fewest turns possible) some of the bosses (assuming at the same level) to see what sort of truly overpowered builds people can create.I only wish the game threw a couple more talents your way. Some of them seems crazy useful (Leech) while others seemed like a somewhat waste of points.I didn't really like most of the indoor dungeons, I liked the encounters in the outside areas a lot more, generally (not in the phantom forest). The indoor areas mostly just felt like corridors filled with baddies or rooms filled with switches. The pixel hunt puzzles were so very grating. The area near where you fight a story boss in a library is especially memorable, as well as hidden buttons in the Dark Cove and the last dungeon. I didn't like the last set of puzzles much at all, until the very last part, which was nice but too easy. A hard thing to balance, surely. Either the solution seems a little obtuse or it's spelled out and feel like it's wasting your time. While I say I didn't really like them, it was still more interesting than finding a switch tucked away somewhere. Not really a puzzle but something I'm reminded of are the reason/charm/intimidate skill checks. I really don't like the rock paper scissors implementation at all.I never really found the need or desire to save scum for loot. I guess mainly because the crafting/upgrading of equipment is easy enough, and the importance skills and tactics is MUCH more important than whatever you are wearing. I recall not replacing Jahan's initial staff until he was level ~14 and I realized my Scarlett had a level 5 cap and boots until very near the end of the game. You could beat the game naked. If they fix the issues with the low level loot dropping from higher level areas, then I really don't have much of any problem with it. It doesn't bug me that I might have an old piece of equipment stick around since since I never happened to find a replacement. You make due with what you get.The artstyle and whole tone of the game is definitely pleasant. The exuberant and over-acted mannerisms of some of the npcs definitely set the tone of the game early on. The environments are great, and the music is fitting, and areas like the Temple of SPOILER are haunting as they should be. Sometimes the character models don't look super when zoomed close, but that's minor.			"

												I've been playing this off and on since the Early Access version went live on Steam. To say that this game, which even in Early Access looked amazingly promising, has come a long way in its development by Larian Studios would be an extreme understatement.At the beginning, you get to develop two characters that will be your primary PCs for your trip through quite an extensive world. Even in just the beta a large chunk of the world was available, now that the full release is finally here, that world is much, much larger now. You can mix and match your starting skills to create anything you might want, from caster, melee, ranged, as well as other things such as making your mage a suave charismatic leader, or your rogue a pickpocket and thief who then turns around and sells the items back to their owners for even more than they are truly worth. Creation of your characters alone can take some time, as the possibilities are near endless.Starting off, the game has obviously had a lot of work put into it. There is a nice tutorial dungeon that does a good job explaining the basics of combat and miscellaneous actions, such as how to deal with traps, pressure plates, locked objects (I love how you can just destroy them if you don't feel like trying to pick the lock, or simply don't have a key) and even then, that's only some of the important mechanics of the game. Your dialogue interactions greatly influence your skills, as you develop traits based on your decisions which can influence combat and social skills by a small amount.Got a friend? Larian has developed a drop in / drop out style of co-op that one can play. Two PCs, two players, you and your friend can create and control one character each, or they can simply drop in and take control of your second PC. It definitely is an interesting system for co-op, and jumping into a game is extremely simple between friends.Even though it says about 25 hours played for the beta, I probably spent close to 50 while in offline mode, and even with all of that time, it still is amazing. Looking forward myself to playing through the entire world now, and I hope that if you purchase this, you'll see just why this game has such amazing potential and enjoyment to be had.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is a mixed bag. There are plenty of positive reviews out there. I personally enjoyed the game enough to beat it, but I will be focusing on the negative.  The main reason for this is there are many mechanics in the game that are frustrating as a player and I think people should at least be aware of these issues. And if RPGs already aren't your cup of tea, these issues are probably enough to make it unenjoyable.Divinity: Original Sin goes out of its way to be misleading, time wasting, and obtuse. If you're someone who enjoys not looking at a wiki when playing a game, you'll be hard pressed to do that with this game. I'll begin with a list of scenarios that have happened to me and then go into more depth. This may come across as nitpicky, but the more you play the game the more you realize scenarios like this are fairly common.In one particular boss fight, I struggled for 2 minutes trying to align my mouse perfectly so I could actually hit the boss. The hitbox of enemies doesn't match the actual sprite, sometimes it is much smaller. This is a problem when the screen gets cluttered and you have multiple people wailing away at a boss. Sprites also move in an ""idle"" animation while the game is waiting for you to make your moves, causing the tiny hit box to move around while you're trying to click. If you click at the wrong moment (very easy to do), well you just moved your character, perhaps took a reaction attack from the opponent, moved through poison or fire, and now you can perform fewer actions as you move back to your original spot to try again. Eventually, I figured out the hitbox was essentially a 2x2 grid (almost down to the pixel) centered on the persons head, but it required so much precision I got so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off trying to stab this boss, I just simply reloaded the game and waited for them to move out of the bush before starting combat. You can rotate the camera or press ""b"" to do a top down mode, but sometimes this doesn't help either (though top down works ~99% of the time, but it took about 60 hours and a friend to find out this particular camera angle usually works).I decided to do a temple of trials for a particular quest line. Halfway through I realized the opponents in the temple are too strong for me to deal with at my current level. But there's a certain set of switch puzzles that took an infuriating amount of time. The game leads you to believe that if you try enough pots, barrels, and boxes the switches will open- but no, you can only use activate two of the switches with those. You need a very precise weight to trigger all the switches. That's okay, if I hadn't tried about 100 pots/barrels/boxes before looking at a Wiki to realize the game was just screwing with me at this point. Now you usually can leave areas without any real penalties, but my party contracted rot- which is essentially incurable by normal means and requires a rare item and ticks down your health by 1 health per turn until its cured (to a minimum of 1 health). Now you can use a rare item later in the dungeon, but considering I had to  reenter the temple and reaquire rot to finish the quest later, I decided not to. But this required me to run around the game for 5 hours until I found the relatively rare item to cure the condition (and it only happened because my friend happened to tell me where two were that I missed). In the meantime I had to heal my party about every minute so the rot didn't chunk my health. There's a perception stat that helps you see hidden things, along with making you have a higher crit percent. If only it actually helped you be more perceptive against enemies.  I was derping around a cave and sort of knew some enemies were coming up, so I casted increased sight. Shame it didn't matter, the invisible enemies lurking in the bushes don't trigger until you trigger an enemy in broad sight further up no matter how perceptive your character is. They also can't be hit until they move once. So if you took the main route and kept your party close, you're now horribly flanked regardless of what statistical and personal decisions you made. Your only option is to reload the game and keep your party further back and then agro with a ranged weapon. Why not reward the player for actually planning instead of running semi-scripted battles and reward reloading the game because now you know how its scripted? It feels like most of the challenge from ordinary fights is from these scripted events given where I'm at in the game, and not the actual fight itself.Other major complaints:1. Nearly every fight in the first map involves fire and/or poison. Contracting one of these twice is enough to kill a party member early without healing, and if they come into contact with each other they explode.  The end result is you spend a disprorptionate amount of time running away to remove poison/fire early in the game. There aren't any real countermeasures available early, at least not ones you can afford/waste skill points on. It's nice in small doses, but it seems like the later in the game it gets the more prone my screen is getting coated with hazards from magic spells. If I had a rain spell I could just clear it, but I don't (party choices- too late to turn back, and I can't find a skill book).2. Vendor randomness severely limits your spell and equipment choices. You don't learn spells/skills like a typical RPG where you level up and learn them- you need skill books. Which would be fine, except vendor loadouts change when you level, and if something isn't there, it isn't there. There are some presets or high probability skill books that are almost always there, but the rarer stuff is hard to get. Later in the game there's more vendors which helps alleviate this problem, but you can go through the game and not know a spell even exists until a boss smashes you with it. Some people would argue this increases the replayability of the game, but if I don't read a wiki I don't even know what I'm missing. There's also not an awful lot of choice in the early game, because what you have often comes down to what drops/spawns in dungeons.  Isn't this typically when characters start to differentiate? Leveling didn't feel particularly rewarding as a result.3, The AI is extremely hit or miss. If you reload a game and play a fight, sooner or later the enemies do really derpy things. An example is my friend ignited an oil barrel which caused a plume of smoke around the boss. The boss sat still and burned to death because it couldn't see outside the cloud and the skeletons refused to cross the fire. A boss just sits there while eating projetiles and spells because it can't see? Another fight later has a boss that can summon a quasi-AOE fire spell that can do like 300 damage. Turns out the best way to beat him is to reload until the boss sits around ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ its turns on other stuff and just pray to your deity he doesn't ever use it. I can't help but feel something is being lost when that's the extent of the AI and how I'm using the save/load system.4. I feel like for being a fairly open game, it goes out of its way to force me down a certain path, Which would be fine, but having to wander around until you find monsters that are about your level and just reloading/running away when you don't feels ham fisted. Enemy level spikes don't feel natural, and often I'm unsure where to go becaues its possible to have 10+ concurent quests fairly easily. The game really doesn't prime the player enough by having difficult but barely possible fights to let them know it might be a bad idea to keep wandering down this road.I could go on, but I'm running out of space. Suffice to say there's a lot of flaws in this game, and it tends to compound as the game goes on. There's so many simple improvements that could have been made.			"

												Blood is wet, right?My swordsman was slashing happily away. I gave him a talent that let him heal when standing in blood. My mage used her nifty new staff of air. It does electric damage. I can electrify a whole pool of water and stun enemies. This time, I zapped an enemy standing in a pool of blood and my swordsman got stunned too.Divinity: Original Sin will end up GOTY for many. It has an impressive level of detail. You get a detailed combat system, but one that doesn't suffer from mind-numbing menus. Or you can show off your cooking skills to the other party members anywhere you can find or make an open fire. Crafting is intuitive, just drag and drop anything that looks plausible. A stick makes a feeble weapon, but mine are destined to become poison arrows.Everything moves along rather speedily. Point, click, and a few convenient keyboard commands. The key commands are reconfigurable. The only thing I could find to improve is the inventory system, but that is already better than the competition. And, you can invite people, or let your Steam friends or anyone else auto-join your game - when that happens, inventory management speeds up as you both pick up and pore through your loot after an adventure. You can also adventure separately and, outside the very early game, teleport immediately to rejoin. (I have not tested the multiplayer.) And there is a lot of loot. You might not deign to pick up every apple you find just to make more apple pies, but there are plenty of enchanted and rare items to make you happy. At Normal difficulty you will hardly use any of your consumable items as long as you play carefully.The starting city has vendors in every item category and magic school. And you can boost some deluxe early equipment if you don't mind being shady. Want extra experience? Perhaps there are some guards you don't like whom you can catch alone in a manageable number. They are quick to get in a scrap anyway. Honestly. I didn't even ctrl-click to attack them. Or sometimes I just made an oopsie and someone got slowed and set on fire. If anyone asks questions later, I just blame it on the undead.The music is appropriate and there is plenty of it. Even after dozens of hours you will enter an area and experience what seems like a new mood from the music. Or the music can remind you that you have a bit too much experience setting off traps. You have the option to play with from 2 to 4 characters. You create 2 and the rest volunteer or are hired. There's a well-crafted tutorial. It's totally skippable, but once you've seen it once you might not skip it. You can run through the tutorial area in 10 minutes for some easy starting loot and a splash of experience.And there are modding tools. So you can expect to revisit this game some year for quite a new experience. "

								My first two hours:A dog agreed to help me on a quest, half (the upper half to be precise) of a zombie decimated my crew, I fell through a hole and ended up in a dungeon, I traveled through time and space where I met an immortal imp and the personification of Time itself, I shamelessly sold a talking oyster even though he begged me not to, a bull read my fortune, I fought a zombie that had a flamethrower, I made a horrible looking fish pie, I convinced a man to keep his charmed orc sex slave, I put a bucket in my head, I stole golden cutlery, I ate raw dough, I joined what I'm sure is a pyramid scheme, I intimidated my own partner, a cat killed me, a sheep told me to look out for were-sheep, a ♥♥♥♥ing chicken told me off, I then helped kill that ♥♥♥♥ing chicken, I convinced a man to steal fish and then snitched on him and I sneaked as a bush even though I was inside a house (not suspicious at all).11/10			"

Early Access Review
								**Early Access Impression**I remember the days of Divine Divinity one of my favorite rpgs of all time.  This game brings me back to that.  There are certainly bugs and some unfinished content.  As far as performance goes I have had zero crashes and with all graphics settings maxed out it runs great.  The graphics style they chose to use is really good imho.  I'm loving it so far and would recommend to anyone that enjoys a turn based rpg with a lot of promise.  This is the first early access game I have been willing to try up to this point.  One of the best features about this game is the coop.  I have not had this much fun in a long time.  I would absolutely recommend playing with another person if you have the option and to use some sort of voice chat.  I will try to update this as new updates are released.			"

												The Larian sense of humor is not for everyone. It goes beyond the narratives in the game and extends to 'practical jokes' in the game mechanisms. Where some may find scenes 'charming' I often found them irritating. Where some may find OP enemies 'challenging' I simply thought they were filler forcing the player to waste a lot of time seperating mobs to pick them off one by one. My playtime here is not long because it wasn't much fun. The character builder was joyless. The 'crafting system' was a migraine. Presumably if you persevere and get out of the first town the game should improve. After all this, why a thumbs up? Because we have a duty as gamers to taste all the fruit in the garden. Just because I didn't enjoy it doesn't mean you won't.			"

												I have commited an unoriginal sin by judging this game before I even played it.Friend: ""Hey dude, check this out!""Me: ""Ah, it's probably not good""WRONG!Divinity: Original Sin is the most fun multiplayer experience I have had in quite a while. You play as two characters that you create known as ""Source Hunters"" in a turn-based RPG game. You have free roam of the world around you filled with story and enemies at every turn. You can play co-op, as the other player creates and takes the role of the second source hunter.STORY:You arrive on a ship to Rivellon. A place filled with Turmoil, under the threat of source. Evil mages are plotting against the world, and it is your job to stop them. As you travel, you will come accross countless side quests for leveling up. Mechanics:It's a free roam game until you spot and or spotted by enemies. Once spotted, imedient turn-based combat begins. this is really fun for working with the other player and formulating a good srategy. Generally I find myself reloading saves quite often because of how difficult the game is. There is such thing as making the ""wrong party"" and screwing up your leveling, each time you level up, you get an attribute (strength, Dexterity, Will, ECT) and rofficiency is weapons, armor, ect.The map is fun, although I will say that for how ""Free"" you are, the game is pretty linear. Anyone who will say otherwise isn't totally wrong either though. You can do whatever quest you want, go where you want, but go anywhere that the enemies are 2 levels above you and you will get *DEMOLISHED* Resistance to stun, poison, prone, and pretty much everything is important in this game. all negative things are deadly. During combat you can use the environment to your advanage. See a puddle? Electrocute the enemy standing it with a shock spell. See a poisonous cloud? Shoot a fire arrow, and it explodes! Is the ground of fire? Break that barrel filled with water to put it out! Is the enemy attacking your mage? use his spell to teleport the enemy on the fire that the water barrel missed. So much strategy in this game. You can learn to abilities by purchasing skill books, and teaching your character new abilities.			"

												A throw back to the classic rpg games we all loved years ago!  Divinity: OS has brought back the ""damn it, I'm late for work"" scenario and it feels so good!  You'll find yourself spending an hour in town looking around, talking to people and looting when all you went for was a simple pickaxe!A beautiful free roam huge open world with turned based combat and no classes, make the character(s) you want to play...customize their look / stats / abilities / traits etc...random loot, a branching story, plot twists, secrets, crafting, magic and plenty of humor along the way, think Diablo meets Baldur's Gate, they have a threesome with Neverwinter Nights...you sprinkle some modern day graphics on the bed and Divinity: Original Sin is born!Sooo many quests, side missions, items and things to see...80+ hrs and we're only about half way through (respec'd a few game hours ago), combat is tactical and the animations are great!!  We've already fought goblins, trolls, skeletons, shamans, wildlife, death knights, witches and even ourselves at times...(when your tank is charmed, RUN! hah)...I can only imagine what lies ahead!?Co-op is a blast, control 1, 2 or 3 of the party members (your friend controls any you don't) and outfit / spec however you see fit, you don't have to stick together either which is very nice...my buddy can be in town selling stuff while I'm off fighting zombies or exploring etc!!The RPS (rock, paper, scissors) mini-game makes deciding wether or not we should rob the merchant we just sold a bunch of gear to much more enjoyable when your buddy can change the outcome of a conversation (disagree with you) and possibly turn that simple transaction into a battle for you life!So far it hasn't been an easy journey...we've lost some good companions along the way...but we'll make it, we will strike down every last bandit and every undead creature that stands in our way...not only to honor those who fought beside us, but to cash in on all this sweet loot we've found hah!  If you're looking for a classic, no hand holding style RPG that will probably end with you sitting alone at the computer while your wife and kids head for her sisters, PICK THIS UP...sale or not!

												This is nothing like the previous Divinity games which where action RPGs or Strategy games and pretty average to crap to be honest. Divinity Origin Sin is in the same league as Neverwinter Nights and Balders Gate. A real hard core honest to god RPG. The first real RPG in about a decade I would say and I am 30+ year gamer not some school kid. Larger publishers have been dumping our games down for about 10 years and the modern RPG now comes with the title Action RPG because its short on RPG and heavy on action. The truth is, old RPGs where heavy on action and heavy on RPG so these action RPGS are really just half a game. This game though is old school RPG, the fully crowd funded no publisher to spoil it monty.... On  metacritics users gave it 91% ands I agree with that score.... Recommended....			"

												Great game, as of now my GOTY 2014.- No handholding, no questmarkers but a comprehensive notebook.- No delivery quest, no kill 5 of these and 4 of that, but interlinked Quest that make you think and experiment (with the enviroment)- Lots of character and skillchoices. Not everything works, you have to experiment, maybe start over.- This game can be hard on normal and unforgiving on hard. Easy is actually easy but still fun and challenging.- This game has one of the best turn based combat system. Line of sight, crowd control, elemental resistances, use the enviroment for your advantage, everything makes sense.Crafting, trading and inventory management are still rough around the edges. It's working but often it's cumbersome.Update: Having finished the game I have to say the late game is a bit disappointing and it feels a bit rushed. Exploration and questing are not anymore the focus and (the still very good) combat (system) takes over, which kind of gets repetitive over time. Anyway, still a great game.			"

Early Access Review
								I really recommend this  game as its lot of fun moving objects around as well as using them to get combat advantage. Turn based combat is really well done  and makes you think about lot of different things you can do for example using environment to your advantage or using combination of spells to do as much damage as it's possible. The game is giving player options on how to develop your character as well as if they agree  with each other on different topics. There are some problems with the game as its is early access and the game isn't perfect yet so people which want finish and well polished game should wait for the full release i also recommend to make shure your pc is powerful enough to run this game as it's not yet optimised.

												If you’re an RPG fan you will have no doubt heard of Divinity Original Sin by now, and in that regard there’s little else for me to say that many others haven’t already done so.It’s not perfect by any means, it will occasionally leave you frustrated and there are basics that it could improve upon, such as an improved quest log but don’t let that detract you from what is otherwise a fantastic game, and experience.The sheer depth of it all is staggering; from the character setup which pretty much just says “here’s a blank canvas, make who you want” and its turn based combat system, which is one of the best I’ve experienced in the genre.Simply put, Divinity Original Sin is one of the best RPGs of recent years and if you’re a fan of the genre it’s certainly a title that you should look at adding to your games library.

												I don't understand the unconditional love and hype for this game. Yes, there are definitely fun parts, but the game is riddled with bugs (some of them game-breaking), flaky behavior, and bad design choices. It feels like the first 10 hours were made with loving care and then it gets progressively more and more rushed until a the end it's nothing but fight after fight with treasure and XPs being shoveled at you so you'll hurry up and get to the end of the leveling treadmill.We experienced a game-breaking bug at the end of the game which wouldn't allow us to get into the Source Temple (the crystal that opens the door was a bugged non-object that we couldn't use and wasn't recognized by the game). I took notes during the game, here's my thoughts. As you can see, there are way more negatives than positives. Overall, I don't feel I could recommend this game.+ Great visuals. Seriously, the artwork is fantastic. A little cartoony at times, and textures are inconsistent, but the volume of eye candy more than makes up for any visual shortcomings.+ Game doesn't level-scale, meaning if you level up and come back to an area that was previously too hard, you will have an easier time of it. It really gives you a sense of gaining power.+ Has co-op! And the co-op actually works pretty well. It was so nice to be able to play this with my wife.- Some undead can be poisoned. But practically no other enemies in the game can be. I eventually stopped using poison arrows because everything was either immune to it or worse, healed from it.- When resurrected, character sometimes comes back in T-pose and stays that way until exiting (no animations, just glides around in T-pose).- Constant falling down if you're on an ice patch. Even high bodybuilding doesn't seem to help. On the contrary, enemies almost never fall down on ice.- Debug draw rays are frequently visible on characters controlled by your co-op partner when casting spells.- Running water (like creeks) isn't treated as water (doesn't make creatures in it wet, electricity and other clouds dissipate on it immediately).- Shooting a stunning cloud arrow on a wet area won't make it electrified, only a stunning arrow will work.- Enemies seem to have an incredibly high level of immunity/resistance to everything (specialty arrows like poison/charm/knockdown are pretty useless past the early levels)- Initial story is interesting (murder mystery) but quickly changes to a convoluted ""save the world because fabric of time is unravelling with demons and ice prisons and blood stones and dimensional rifts"" mess that's impossible to make sense of.- Crafting system is tedious and can mostly be skipped. It feels very tacked on. There's no crafting bench which would help with the UI and recipes. Instead, you have to find and drag things around in your inventory and whether it works or not is a baffling trial-and-error process (two small healing potions can be combined into a larger one, but two medium potions can't?). You can find books that hint on how to craft things, but unless you enjoy paperwork/memorization, you'll do like everyone else and look them up online, which means you'll spend half of your crafting time outside the game.- Enemy AI is very flaky. Enemies tend to get stuck a lot or skip their turns. It's as if they disregard viable-but-dangerous options in their behavior trees (like walking through a fire area even though they have high resistance to fire), and it leaves them in a stuck state where they do nothing and eventually pass their turn. All the while you get to sit there and wonder if you game is frozen.- Enemy AI will also sometimes be stupid and run off - probably trying to take a long convoluted path to get to you - and you have to chase them down because otherwise you're stuck in combat while they run all over the map like an idiot.- Sometimes you ""succumb to death"" without knowing what killed you. I had to look up this one area online to find out why I kept dying for no reason. A little extra explanation of what happened would help sometimes. - My enjoyment of the game was inversely proportional to the length of time I played.- Save scumming is required, and even encouraged by the game. You'll die a lot, or your game will become bugged, and you'll have to reload and replay stuff over and over until you figure out the perfect order in which to do things or how to keep your characters from stepping in the wrong spot.- Pixel-hunting for tiny switches on walls or floors is required. A lot. We had to come back to many areas we couldn't finish after looking them up online only to find there was a small hidden switch somewhere. Main quest lines should not require pixel hunting to finish. That kind of stuff is fine for side-quests or extra loot opportunities.- Too much dependency on levels. If you are two levels below your enemies (especially early on), they are nearly impossible to defeat. However, if you are one level over your enemies, they are trivial to defeat.- Smoke doesn't seem to affect enemies' line of sight. They can target you even in the thickest smoke areas - ones you can only move through because you can't target anything past your face. This has the side effect of making smokescreen arrows completely useless. I mainly noticed this after level 10 or so, it seemed like before then smokescreens would help sometimes.- My game would crash to desktop when exiting about 80% of the time.- Enemy ""idle"" animations are way too exaggerated. Elementals look like they're practically disco dancing when they're supposed to be idle. This has the side effect of making them hard to attack, since you have to click on them while they're dancing around. And if you mis-click, you get to have fun watching your character walk over to them, sucking up attacks of opportunity and walking through fire/poison along the way. You can hit ""B"" to go into an extreme top-down mode for combat targeting, but really this wouldn't be necessary if the idle animations had been toned down.- The game trains you to trust certain things and then pulls the rug out from under you at random times. For instance, there is one place that has mounds of dirt that if you dig them, explode for 32,000 points of damage, killing you and anyone around it instantly. Why do these dirt mounds explode? Who knows! Just reload and don't dig there next time.- It's extremely easy to accidentally double-click the End Turn button, which if your characters are right next to each other in initiative order will skip the following character's turn.- Maps with tons of dangerous fire areas are just annoying, because your party pathfinding AI will not avoid cutting through lava areas and getting insta-killed.- If you drink an armor potion (and probably any potion that ""casts"" a spell on you) while muted, you won't get the benefits of the potion while muted. It's as if the game treats potions as spells, which don't work while being muted.			"

												After 2 very thorough playthroughs and with 172 hours on record, I guess I must clearly recommend this game :-)It is a HUGE, wonderfully modernized but still refreshingly old-school rpg, with an incredible attention to detail, great humor, a decent story and an amazingly deep, turn-based tactical combat system that allows for countless approaches and combinations.It looks georgeous, is surprisingly bug-free for a project this size (and it's patched regularly and fast as well), and it runs well even on older systems. The crafting system is fun and intuitive, and some of the puzzles are very well done.For all the praise, however, I also have to mention the downsides. And there are definitely those:The balance, in general, could use an overhaul. The game has a pretty steep learning curve in the beginning, but once you know the system, the fights are actually very, very simple. Note that I say simple, not easy. The fights, especially boss fights, tend to be long, repetitive, tedious, and, yes, even boring. The enemies usually have a TON of hitpoints, unlimited special abilities and everyone and their mothers, - of the same level or a bit higher than the party - is pretty much immune to special abilities - and thus, most tactical choices. They do, however, do pretty pathetic amounts of damage while keeping your party stunned, crippled, knocked down, frozen and generally annoyed but alive.I would highly prefer shorter, more challenging battles against enemies that are actually affected by all the special arrows I can craft and all those abilities - foes  that are much faster to kill or disable but a lot more likely to kill ME.The numbers/RPG mechanics are yet another problem. Larian follows the old JRPG-style of insane number exaggeration. You start with a weapon that does 10 damage and you'll end with some monstrous obscentiy that can easily exceed 1000 damage on a critical hit or with a special maneuver. Enemies hitpoints and resistances grow accordingly, and the interesting enemies are thus always within about 2 levels of yours. Higher enemies are pretty much untouchable, lower ones pathetically helpless.And, finally, many quests and puzzles are just too damn obscure. I commend Larian to go against the mainstream, and skip all the quest markers, map markers, signs above a quest giver's head etc. But sometimes they fall to the other extreme and there is simply no way to continue with a quest but to randomly walk evereywhere, try everything and finally check the internet, only to learn that you missed some random item 4 hours ago... ;-PMore logic and sensible hints, please!But this is all just criticizing on a VERY high level, and it doesn't diminish the fun at all. And, hands down, you won't get a better deal for your money anywhere atm.			"

												Da good: The combat. It is tactical and fun and makes me feel smart when I beat an encounter. Lots of different ways to approach a fight.Da ok: The music. It sounds fine but instead of there being music to fit whats going on in the game there's just several music tracks that play randomly at strange times, like playing a weird 60s beach party tune while I'm fighting skeletons in a cave.Da bad: Inventory management and selling of things. I don't like games where merchant NPCs have a set amount of money. It's realistic I guess but I end up having to bounce between multiple people all over the city to sell all the junk I get and it gets tiring so I end up not picking up junk loot and now I don't have money.The entire inventory system is a mess to look at and having to move items between party members to inspect or repair is kind of a pain. There's not enough item icons either so if I wanted to find a certian chest armor in my stash I'd have to mouse over all of them because they all have the same icon.fun game though			"

								don't know how else to put it. this game has AAA quality(once the minor bugs are fixed) and indie heart. the mechanics are good, the gameplay is fun, and it is willing to lampoon any number of RPG tropes (giant crabs as enemies and walking skeletons who develop arthritis). it is funny, it is fun, and once the modding capabilities are enabled, it can probably sustain itself for eternity.

												Divinity: Original Sin is a single-player and co-operative multiplayer fantasy role-playing game by Larian Studios. This game was partially funded via Kickstarter, and is a sequel to Divine Divinity (which if I'm being honest I have never heard of, or played). This game was released on 30th June 2014 for PC and Mac. I played this entire game on Steam with my husband using the co-operative multiplayer mode.The customizable protagonists of the game are known as Source Hunters. In single-player the player controls them both, while in the co-operative multiplayer each player takes control over one of them. Gameplay begins in a town called Cyseal in southern Rivellon, and the Source Hunters receive orders to investigate the murder of a town councilor. The plot goes on a journey to investigate cults, relationships, sacrifice, and more.This game ships with the editor that it was created with, and this allows players to create their own single-player and multiplayer adventures, and then publish them online.Divinity: Original Sin is a 3D, isometic, party based, turn based, choice and consequence, strategy RPG. You will need to make optimal use of action points, skills, spells, equipment, and objects within the environment to get the most out of your experience.There are 11 preset classes to choose from at the start of the game, however each can be customised to suit your own personal style of play.There are 6 attributes to select which are common throughout any RPG genre, such as strength, dexterity, intelligence, etc. There are 6 abilities to choose from which are weapons (i.e. single-handed, two-handed, etc), defence (i.e. armour specialist, shield specialist, etc.), skills (i.e. expert marksman, pyrokinetic, witchcraft, etc.), personality (i.e. bartering, leadership, etc.), craftsmanship (i.e. blacksmithing, crafting, etc.), and nasty deeds (i.e. lockpicking, etc.).There are 45 possible talents to choose from, some of which unlock as your character gets stronger and makes specific choices throughout the game. Examples of talents are gaining additional ability points, damage boosts, immunity from spells, increased spell range, etc.There are 9 different skills that you can take, and you can either have spells in each skill, or you can specialise in specific skills. Examples of skills are Expert Marksman for rangers, Man-At-Arms for melee combat, etc.My husband played as the Battlemage, and I played as a Cleric. We used supporting NPC's Madora and Jahan. I felt as though it took me a little time to really get into the combat, but our four characters complimented each other well. My husband and Jahan (specialising in Hydrosophist and Aerotheurge skills) were the casters; I was a single-handed, shield bearing tank (specialising in Man-At-Arms and Hydrosophist skills); and Madora was a two-handed damage dealing tank.Party relationships feature heavily throughout the game, for example if you damage one of the NPC's in your party whilst trying to attack an enemy they can get angry and leave the party; likewise when playing co-operative multiplayer there are specific dialogues that take place between the two 'real' players that affect their in-game relationship.The game plays out in real-time, and only the battles are turn-based and are dependent on Action Points that your character has. The number of Action Points you can use in combat is dependent on your attributes and abilities. These stats can also be affected by your gear. Combat can be influenced heavily by elements within the game, i.e. if one of your characters casts a fireball at enemies, and then poison is cast over the top of the fire, this can generate an explosion; likewise if a fireball is cast at an enemy and it then begins to rain, this can generate a steam cloud; water can be electrified by using lightning which can stun enemies (and friendly characters). All of these combinations lead to a higher level of strategy needed to finish off some of the stronger enemies that you come across.There is an entire crafting and blacksmithing element to this game, however as we were not actively role-playing throughout the game, we didn't actually find these abilities particularly useful. I had my NPC put a couple of points into crafting and blacksmithing so we could repair gear in an emergency if we were unable to teleport back to a town, but we never found any need to make potions, make our own armour, or use any food available throughout the game. Early on in the game we did use health potions a fair bit, but once all four of our characters were able to use a healing spell, they eventually became redundant too.As well as the main story in the game, there are also over 70 other side quests available. Side quests can be the best way in which to find new armour and weapons, as well as getting valuable experience to further improve your characters attributes.I did find parts of this game frustrating as the combat at times can go on forever in a big fight, you can at times get insta-killed by lava when you weren't expecting it, and we also found a few glitches here are there where we had a the game crash completely, or quests that didn't quite work as they should causing us to have to reload. Despite these issues this didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the game, though I would definitely recommend auto-saving on a regular basis.Having played the entire game using the co-operative multiplayer, our total play time came to just over 80hrs (each) logged on Steam. This game is most certainly excellent value for money, although I do think that we could have finished the game a little quicker than we did as we did miss some important quests early on which meant leveling up took us a bit longer than it should, but overall that was all part of the experience, and we would know better if we ever decide to do a second play through.For any fans of Diablo, Torchlight, Titan Quest, etc., I urge you to get a copy of Divinity: Original Sin. It is excellent value for money, and is a great strategy RPG with a well thought out, well explained story, with excellent longevity and replayability.			"

Early Access Review
								I do recommend the game when it is all done. For the early release, buyer's beware. See laundry list of issues below (I am submitting feedback here, I cant be asked to create a larian forum account to submit feedback, sorry devs), I am not mentioning known issues or unfinished areas as they go without saying.Likes:- Controlling 2 characters with different personalities; when they argue with each other it feels schizophrenic.- The elements interacting with each other and the environment is great.- Game is stable, had no crashes. Just one lockup into a dialogue that I couldn't exit, no biggie. Things that need/will/should be fixed:- I saw an Orc attacking his shaman, I guess the latter got caught in an AoE cast by the former. It was hilarious, actually maybe this is working as intended, they are after all Orcs.- Almost all of the inhabitants have a comment when asked about that crime committed in town, ""Esme did it, she is guilty as sin"". Was fun when Esme herself had that comment.- Attacking NPCs... We murdered some 5 guards in town. No one seems to care. No witnesses, but still... somebody should react to that.- Attacking main NPCs... When approaching a certain main NPC weapons in hand confronting him... He literally disappeared in a puff of smoke. Was hoping the game would deal with it a bit better.- Balance. Seems ranged + magic is much more powerful than melee. I have won battles 3 (level 3) vs 10 (level 5+) by environment & AoE spells,  summoned creatures tanking and ranged weapons,... that is great, but my main characters actually had more talent/skill points in melee combat, going into melee was very painful not to mention degraded weapon and armour.- Need killing blow to gain XP; XP denial by allied NPC. Seems it is better to let the NPCs die or kill stealing from them, than actually fighting with them as allies.- I have characters skilled in gear repair and lock-picking,... no idea if they are not implemented or I just haven't found out how to used them or am missing an item to do it (lockpick ? Repair tool ?)- Piles of gold in inventory. So I usually get a bit of gold for every transaction with an NPC. Problem is I now have 10 piles of gold cluttering my inventory, couldn't find a way to consolidate them into a single one.- When attacking if you miss-click you can end up healing an enemy or attacking an ally. I don't mind that in principle, but maybe get a warning ""Are you sure you want to do that ?"" would be helpful. Especially since with the isometric view, it is sometimes hard to target a crab behind a character when only a wiggly leg appears behind her. The most hilarious thing was my character *shield bashing herself* instead of the crab.			"

												Over 10 years ago, I was rummaging in a bargain bin at a local Best Buy. Back then, you see we bought software in boxes and drove home with them. Backwards; i know. Nontheless, I came across an interesting box, for cheap: Divine Divinity.Divine Divinity. Like, Wet Water, or Dirty Dirt, the name was sure akward, but it was friday and was less than 5 bucks.Turns out I ended up loving that game. It remined me of Arkanum, another relatively unknown and awesome title from the era. I continued to follow this, at the time, relatively unknown game company's Divinity series. Through Divinity II, Eco Draconis and so on.These games are all, at their core, well balanced and artfulyl constructed rpg's that don't deviate far from the genre. They incorporate humor judiciously in the games, giving the game a quirky, 4th wall breaking feel from time to time. Most importantly, they are jsut quite fun, all of them.So here is the latest one. From the looks of it, a quite successful game for the company. Truthfully, there are things I preferred about previous games, butt his one certainly deserves its place in the series.Sinply put, this is a solidly crafted isometric rpg that remined me very much of the first time I played Divine Divinity. I even recognise some of the musical tracks from the first game in this game's excellent soundtrack. Very cool for an old fan!If you know how to play a game like this, it is of reasonable difficulty. Save often. If the game seems like everythign is too difficult, you're in the wrong place. I did feel like a few of the 'puzzles' were a bit too 'chancey' in their resolution. *possible spoiler* I can easily see a perfectly astute player never finding the White Witch, due to the mere trickle of information provided on what to do next (and how to do it).Despite any clunkiness, I still resommend the game. This company is, and has always been worth supporting.			"

												I can not tell you properly with words how good this game is.I will try however and I should start, as everyone, comparing it to old school RPG titles. Unlike recent RPG-called titles from this century —mostly made for the new generations of players, with little or no brains needed at all to solve quests—, Divinity: Original Sin looks like a true role playing game reminiscent of the old ages but with very cool new ideas —some of them unique— and fresh graphics.The main characteristic, typical of Larian games, is the freedom to do almost everything you want: the game is classless, so you can choose a warrior in the beginning and later on you can change your mind and provide him with some spells or range skills, if you like it, when he level up; this way you will end up with four characters, two of them from the start and two more later on, with a combination of skills, traits and talents that fits you. You can interact with almost every item in the game: doors, chests, barrels, pictures, chairs, etc, and you can open them to look inside or destroy them if you prefer, or even take them and move them from one place to another. You can also choose if you prefer to talk to every NPC and solve quests, trade with them, or killing them if you like it, or even steal their items and loot their houses. Every action will make the villagers approach you in different ways, turning hostile to you or being polite instead. And if you don't like to trade with NPCs a lot you are able to craft your own gear and even spells if you choose to do it with the immense amount of ingredients and tools you will find everywhere.What makes this game unique, and a gem, is a combination of the role playing part with the interaction between characters —even yours!— and its combat system. Divinity is not a combat focused game, it is more a conversational and exploration RPG title; however, combat is also very important and this is not a real time one, it is a turn-based combat system with action points mechanics that forces you to think about your resources, the enemies, and the environment; so each turn you can use your points to move, drink potions, attack or cast spells if you got enough points for them, or if you prefer you can reserve some of your remaining action points for your next turn, for example if you want to wait when the enemy is far away from you and later on you want to hit him two or three times in the same turn. The best part of the system is, no doubt, the chance —and mostly the need— of using the elements on your favour. It means you can cast a rain spell on your characters to stop them from burning; you can also cast rain on enemies, make them wet and then cast electricity spells for extra damage and stuns. You can also use ice spells if enemies are wet —state than come from your spells or from real rain itself!— to freeze them. You can shoot (after throwing it for example) an oil barrel with a fire spell to make it explode and damage the area, or just hit it with your arrows to make it pour the oil and later on cast fire on it if you wish. You can make an ice barrier to protect, wait until enemies are near it and then fire it, making it water and causing enemies to stumble, and then electrify them. You can combine elements to create clouds to avoid being a target. You can stealth and stab enemies too if you have the right character to do such a thing. You can use barrels and things of the environment to take cover, to protect you and to avoid damage. You can also try to flee if you find the situation too chaotic for your taste. You can... well, you can —and you should— do all these things if you want to survive, because combat is not always an easy task on this game. For all these things I must say this is a heck of a game; I have not THAT fun with a videogame probably since some decades (I'm absolutely for real here). It's also true that there are some things that are not optimal and need improvement. Among the negatives, there is the camera movement, the slow pace of the game sometimes when you need to go from A to B, and the bad interfaz mechanics when you need to equip gear, change items from character to character, sell something or look at the items you got, or pick them. This is not a noob-friendly game; aside from the little dungeon tutorial at the start, you will find little or no help at all and you will find lost yourself if you are not used to RPGs games. However, asking in the forums will help you; there will be trolls, true, but overall the community will end up answering your questions and solving some of your starting problems, I'm pretty sure.But if I take all these things together and put them all in a balance, I have to recommend this game to every player in the world. If you are an oldschool gamer you just can't pass on this. And if you are a new player and you didn't play or didn't even know any of the games other guys are mention, you have to give this one a chance and compare it yourself with the new RPGs. I promise you won't be disappointed.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin - A game with great combat, great dialog, and irritating crafting system.I'll Try and keep this short and to the point as I'm not the greatest at writing reviews in the first place. I just finished the game last night after putting approx 215 total hours into playing it solo. I play taking my time and searching for secrets and sidequests and reading all the text for all Npcs. So my view of the game might differ from someone who likes to get through games faster, only worrying about major quests. Overview of the plot: The two main characters you start with are source hunters which are sent out to investigate the murder of a town councilor. You quickly discover there is much more going on and uncover a massive plot. Along the way you find a few characters which you can bring into your party to help. You can have 4 party members total not counting temporary summons. Each party member has there own story and motivations for joining which you eventually can learn more about. You eventually learn more about yourselves and your role in the past that is gradually reveled to you as you progress through the game. PROS:Combat is fun and doesn't get to repetitive. There are many different skills you can learn and characters are not tied to one ""class"". Elements can be used together to achieve various results in combat along with environmental effects. Fire and poison create explosions, water or blood on the ground can be frozen to make enemies fall, water on the ground can be electrified to stun anything standing in it, etc. There are many possibilities with combat that helps keep fights fresh. There are hidden side quests and loot that gives a reason to explore.The dialog and writing are great, there are some interesting and witty moments that make you smile. The areas and environments look great.Some quests have multiple choices and outcomes. Its nice to have choices and different ways to complete a quest.Turn based combat that lets you use tactics and strategy. Co-op support. Although I didn't like playing it co-op so I played solo I'm sure there are plenty that would rather play with a friend. I like that it gives you a choice and you can play solo or co-op without the game giving an advantage to one over the other.CONS:The crafting system is frustrating and you will find yourself never using it. Good luck figuring out what can be crafted or even how to craft anything without looking it up online. Yah there are a few recipe books you can find in the world but there only cover a tiny fraction of crafting and they are usually cryptic and don't help much. If you want to figure out any other recipes on your own without looking them up on the internet be prepared to just keep dragging random items on top of each other for hours in your inventory randomly hoping something happens... I like games that don't hold your hand sometimes and make you figure things out but this crafting system is not a good example of that at all. Its just a bad design for a crafting system. there isn't enough reason to spend gold. Its easy to amass a hoard of gold by mid game but there really isn't much to use it on. Its fairly easy to get gold selling junk you find and paintings or gold forks you find around. I ended the game with almost 200k just on one character alone. At the end of the game I was still using level 10 ish boots and shoulders on my mage. Finding mage gear other than just the robe was almost impossible. Maybe that was just my luck but I think the balance of gear dropped for each class should be looked at "

												Easily my GOTY so far for 2014. Divinity: Original Sin is a great throwback to old school RPG’s, with some great and varied questing (be prepared for lots of reading!) lots of loot, talent trees, magic/skills, etc. I found the visuals very appealing, with lots of colour and great artistry. The music is top notch and fits the game perfectly. The combat (turn-based) is just heaps of fun, with all the different spells and skills available to use. The strategic combos of elemental magic never gets old.In the end I played almost 90 hours and didn’t encounter a single bug or glitch, which is quite a feat considering the scope of this game. All in all this is a must play for all fans of meaty turn-based RPG’s.  Can’t recommend it enough. "

												Finally.It feels like forever that a game of this scope, of the quality has gracedthe gaming industry. Many turn to Dragon Age are the defacto ""king"",but that is a choice made from a lack of competition. To say that Divinity:Original Sin is satisfying, is to say ""ice is cold"". You just know it as fact.Even those early playthroughs where you just mess up badly, but youdiscover some hidden scene that would not otherwise have been seen.There is a caveat, though. This isn't a console style 5 hour tutorial-stylegame. While you aren't thrown into death itself like Dark Souls, you arenot told what to do, and how to do it every second. It respects the factyou have a memory and some intellect and that we enjoy challenge. The graphics are quite lush, despite not being a graphics-focused game,you won't ever find yourself being unimpressed or let down. It reallydoes feel and come across as a work of passion, of love. The devs hadput much of themselves into this game. If you are a fan of RPGs, or of Larian, you owe it to yourself to play thisgame. Not since Ultima 7 has a game really captured that feel of a reallyinteractive world. Oh, and do yourself a favour, choose the Pet Pal talenton your first playthrough (because there will be more, trust me).			"

												You will like this even if you aren't a CRPG fan due to its co-op nature. If you're an old school RPG player, however, you'll immediately be drawn back into your childhood--of the times spent discovering Fallout 2's world and Baldur's Gate. Even if you spent time with the Final Fantasy series and other JRPGs, you'll still be reminded heavily of the past. Both western and Japanese RPGs are genres that suffered as we moved into millennium. They lost their purpose and games evolved, leaving them behind. It takes games like Divinity: Original Sin to remind us of what a RPG really is. Its combat is old school and turn-based, its loot similarly complex, and its storyline muddied and epic in every sense of the word. It plays like a 1990's game through and through, of a RPG that has entirely too much crammed into its tiny world.Except, well, this world isn't so tiny. In a modern age, the designers can fit as much as they want. In result, they've managed to make a modern CRPG while keeping the vintage feeling. Cyseal is stuffed full of side quests, treasure, friends, and foes. It feels almost alive, bustling with NPCs and activities to do. Every barrel has an ingredient for something you don't know how to make just yet, every area has a few NPCs you don't know their purpose of, and it's easy to get lost. But you won't mind it that much. A graveyard has a secret tunnel that takes you to a few chests and some enemies; cellars can have great riches or just cobwebs; and you can explore so many areas in so many ways.At the end of the day, it's an experience and it's mostly an amazing one. I truly recommend it. There are frustrating moments, confusing game design choices, a few annoying bugs, and, as with every CRPG, the game is unfriendly to new players. But it's not unfriendly without a purpose. It's unfriendly to try to inspire nostalgia which it successfully does, paying homage to an entire decade of gaming. For an indie studio to accomplish this via Kickstarter and to accomplish it so well is nothing short of a miracle.Now please excuse me. If you'll need me, I'll be off sneaking somewhere--probably opening a few chests and stealing a few paintings from the inn.  It's nothing personal, dear mayor. I just rolled a character who was heartless.			"

Early Access Review
								I played this a lot more than Steam thinks I have - probably 12-15 hours or so in bits over the course of it since Alpha.This game is fantastic. It's everything you have ever wanted a multiplayer RPG to be. The conversation options and the asymmetrical dialog (Players each have independent dialog options) make for a really engaging experience where you truly feel like you're roleplaying in a way reminiscent of games from awhile back. I'd say they don't make them like they used to, but Larian's proved that wrong with Divinity: Original Sin.There's a lot of customization available, and while the game in screenshots resembles Diablo or Torchlight with their 3d Isometric views, this is not a hack and slash game - enemy encounters pause the action and pop up action bars, with movement and action point costs. Combat is turn-based, and it feels and plays and looks fantastic.This game is labelled as early access but it is indeed basically done. I've been following the production since Kickstarter, and the actual Launch day is in a couple days at the end of June. If you're looking for a great RPG to play with someone else, with lots of engaging gameplay and the ability to create watercooler moments (few things are as  fun as when you both have different ideas for how you should act/treat an NPC and you just do your own thing), look no further.Also a full suite of modding/content creation tools, so if you don't like the game you were given, use the engine to make your own RPG.If Steam doesn't sell this game in a 2-pack, they really should.

												Gameplay-wise, this might very well be my favorite RPG ever.No worst-of-both-worlds, real-time-with-pause nonsense here. No samey filler battles, either. Each battle is a tough, interesting tactical challenge that can be dealt with in a variety of ways, depending on how you customized your characters. Character customization is great too: the ""classes"" are just suggested default builds, you can ignore them and just mix and match the available skills however you want.The story is... entertaining. Nothing special, but the dialogue is lively and quirky and creates a fun atmosphere. It doesn't try to be more than what it is, which is a pretty big plus. Still, this is definitely a ""gameplay"" RPG rather than a ""story"" RPG. The fact that you control two characters and can roleplay the interactions between them does a lot to keep cutscenes and choices interesting, though.If you're in the mood for a few interesting, tactical battles in a fun fantasy land, you can't do much better than this game.

												I didn't play any of the classic RPGs like Baldur Gates, but when this game came out it promised so many things that I miss from modern RPGs (yes I know, hipster). It expanded on things I love, like turn based and tactical combat, lots of dialogue and freedom to interact with the world in several ways. I loved that questlines could be solved in different ways, including ""cheesing"" it. For me, that makes it feel more believable. In real life, you don't have a set ways of dealing with things, you improvise. I finally finished the game on PS4, because that's more my thing, and I was impressed how well the controls translated.			"

												By far and above the best co-op rpg I have played. My other half and I often sit down in the evening and play an hour or two of this after dinner and its a great way to spend time together. It is so easy to set up a network and play either in the same house or when we happen to be miles apart, with skype running in the background it's a great way to hang out across the distances. Characters are well developed, story is excellently well written and not predictable. The humor is fantastic, and there are so many little touches that add something special to the game. It's really very beautiful as well. Highly recommended as a single player campaign but it really shines as two player co-op.			"

												This is a Gem! A tactical turned based Rpg with tons of spells and skills. The fights r amazing as hard too, u can play with the elements found on screen like use a lightning bold on a surface of water it will cause the creature standing on it to be stuned. Has a lot of that to discover + rich story with very cool ending. Side quests r many and a challenge as well cause some of them require puzzle solving, reading books and have a keep eye to spot clues. Game is HUGE took me a while I totaly recommend it. It can be slow paced so if u looking for an action style rpg this isnt it, otherwise u will love it :)			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is one of the best games I've played in a long, long time. It strikes a very good balance between old school cRPG and modern design. It has plenty of text, quests, exploration, and discovery while including many of the usability improvements we've come to expect these days.The combat system is probably the best I've ever played in a game like this. I've been on the fence of the Turn Based vs Real Time with Pause argument but this game makes a hell of a case for turn based gameplay. The elemental combinations and environmental interactions are exceptionally executed and allow for tactics I've never experienced in a game before.As of this review I'm at 82 hours played on my second playthrough and still enjoy it tremendously. I absolutely cannot wait to see what mods we'll get for it.It's not perfect (which game is?) but it's damn good. At the rate they've been updating the game (every few days) I expect Divinity: Original Sin to settle in nicely with the greats of the cRPG genre.But, it's not for everyone. While the moment to moment writing is generally excellent the whimsical tone may turn people off and the overall plot rather bland. I've seen complaints from people accustomed to modern game handholding - it's true the game does not slap down objective markers and tell you where to go at all times. You need to talk to NPCs and pay attention to quest details. If you love exploring and the reward you get from discovery then you owe it to yourself to check out Divinity: Original Sin. "

												This game is hands down the best turn based isometric RPG to come out since the late 90s- early 2000s. Its mindblowing. It is everything a true RPG fan could want, depth, story, tactics, customization. So many modern RPGs are dumbed down, basically a siries of ""go here, do this"" fetch, kill the whatzit, ect quests with little minimap icons to point you along the way. Not Divinity: Original Sin.  Its challenging. It makes you think, use tactics and your environment in combat, and also to get hidden bits of story. If you just wade in to battle, expect to get pulverized. Its for the die hard RPG fan. Casual players or people who expect to always win and not talk to people and go places just for more plot are not going to like this. People who want a modern take on the great RPGs of the late 90s are going to think their dreams came true with this one.I know I did.As far as the co-op goes, its a cool feature and I suppose some people like it, but I could have totally done without it. Really. RPGs are single player in my world. Fortunately, you can choose a ""personality"" for the char youre not playing, or just pick the dialogue yourself. If your chars disagree a ""rock paper scissors"" type game insues, where you get bonuses based on the type of answer you made (if you have a high skill in a type of answer, you get more points) and the winner of that is the one who makes the final choice. Its interesting to say the least.			"

												Buy this game.  Don't ask questions, don't waste time reading reviews or comments, just buy this game right now.If you are an individual who enjoyed the classic Baldur's Gate games, Fallout 1&2, or any other games in the same vein, you will love this game, I give you my 100% guarantee.My buddy and I started this game Co-op, deciding that we should each build our character without discussing it with the other, and just hope it worked out.  I made a spellsword who can talk to animals, hit things with a sword, and cast an arguably wise selection of spells.  He made a character with no combat skills whatsoever, opting for a character who can talk his way into places and out of trouble, pick locks, sneak around, and steal everything that isn't bolted down using telekinesis.After we somehow survived the first few combat encounters and made it to the first town, we promptly ended up raking in thousands of gold and numerous useful magic items in what could best be described as an ""ownership transferral spree.""So, 4ish hours into the game we've done practically nothing to advance the story, we have way more money and way better items than we're sure we're supposed to by now, and we've had more fun than we have had in most games we've ever played together.Buy this game!

												DivOS is a solid, fun, and often funny CRPG with some pretty unique mechanics for environmental interaction that will greatly change how you approach combat in almost every encounter. It takes some unique twists on standard fantasy storytelling, and has a very relaxing ""stop and smell the roses"" pacing that nonetheless drives its story forward without derailing too often.The graphics, while fairly humble in fidelity, are vibrant, clear, and lovingly crafted, with each environment displaying personal effort in making them look believable. This is doubly valuable in combat, where areas of danger (or benefit, depending), are easily defined and the positioning of enemies is likewise.Playing with a friend in co-op is a blast, allowing both your PCs equal purchase in conversation, and even the ability to disagree or argue with your friend. Outside of fully leaving the current map, which requires you to gather your party before venturing forth, you don't even have to always be together which creates some fun moments of parallel travel and risk to complete objectives simultaneously.DivOS' weaknesses are mostly technical and balance related. Technically, there are just some polish and functionality weaknesses in the product; personally the volume sliders were always binary for me. 1-100 was ""on"" and 0 was ""off,"" meaning my voice chat with my friend was often fighting for audio supremacy, something that would often balloon into a bigger problem with certain NPCs whose audio-leveling-out was wildly inconsistent, either shattering my ears or being imperceptible. On top of this most of the voicework is ugly or weird; it's clear there was a reach for comedy here, but it's way off the mark--the writing is better by far in this case.Balance-wise, the game is all over the map. My personal experience, with a melee-heavy party (two two-handed weapon users, both focused on Man-at-Arms skills), my friend attempting a rogue, and a single wizard, was that melee is incredibly bad in the beginning of the game. Hit chance is very, very low, leading to lots of big wiffs and encounters that SHOULD be simple becoming complex and difficult. While this slowly improved, it took a lot of investment in skills and gear to do so, and even then my character was still inconsistent. Similarly, my friend's Rogue was wholesale useless, and he took a turn into making his character into a support mage, which was what helped propel our party forward.On the other end of the spectrum, magic-users are incredibly powerful. Some exceedingly good spells that can deal big damage AND stun/root/control enemies have a one-turn cooldown, meaning our wizard character could dominate the battlefield with damage and status effects every time his turn came around. This NPC became the linchpin of our party, creating openings for the rest of us to deal damage.So, is it worth it with these issues? What's the good news? All of the above weaknesses were fixed with the Enhanced Edition, which rebalanced combat (especially in the early game) to be less punishing for melee players, gave Wizards better weapons (wands), but fairer cooldowns, and fixed all the technical oddities like the audio bugs. On top of this, they polished the visuals up and, near as I can tell, re-recorded ALL of the voice work for the game to remove the more grating VO and give many NPCs full voice-acting. Even better: if you own THIS version, you can get the Enhanced Edition for free, and it is ABSOLUTELY worth your time, even if only to see the work Larian put into this re-freshing of an already solid game.This is an excellent game, and almost more importantly, Larian Studios is an excellent developer. Few companies would be willing to spend the time to improve an already-released title wholesale, even fewer would be willing to give it to you for free. Support developers like this, let the gaming world know this kind of players-first behaviour should be rewarded!			"

												that one is hard. this game was cool at first but turned out the complete opposite near the ending. the character creation is nice and flexible, and you actually can make real multi-class from any class (and there is the one with the perk of talking to animals!). the quests and dialogues are cute in good old classic rpg style. the fights are hard enough to be entertaining but not impossible, the fighting system is interesting, i especially liked that you can combine different areas of effects to create even more effects!so, those traits were bright and noticable, in the beginning this punch you in the face and make you enjoy every second of game. but after some time this feeling faded and let you see a lot of issues. first of all, there are thons of bugs. i played with my friend, and i must admit, the coop is made not as well as we dreamed it would be. my friend was hosting me, so she had all the saves. the game kept sending her messages that 'the space in the cloud is almost over'  despite the fact that we had a few saves, and all the loadings were really long despite my friend's laptop is good enough to run the witcher 3. we  struggled with a lot of problems with connection, even when we played sitting at the same couch. there was a mindblowing bug when you just had loaded your save and than found out that your character's stats were dropped to the values you had at level one, and now your high-level equipment doesn't fit you anymore, and you need to reload to fix this. the locations in the middle and the end of the game are big and boring. most fights became boring after level 10 or so. and the further you go in the game there more it is clear that all the story is about the lamest love triangle. most quests near the ending are long and contain frustrating puzzles my least favourite type: to solve those you need to push buttons in the order you have no clue about. the worse was the one where you need not just push the buttons, but put a very specific burden on them. that one made us miserable.the ending is confusing and felt rushed. the final battle lefts you with the  'and that's it?!' feeling. but i must admit, i have a suspicion that the huge part of all those issues were fixed in enchansed edition. the only problem is: enchansed edition needs much more powerful hardware than mine, so i didn’t have a chance to test it. i know that this game was fully sponsored by kickstarter donations, and i think that developers tried their best. i also heared that the second part is much, much better than the first, and i think, i might gave it second chance as soon as i'll get a new laptop. so i'll go with 'recomend'. i still have some expectations and there is no option to write the neutral review here on steam.

												Divinity: Original Sin succeeds wholeheartedly in establishing a classic RPG without feeling old. Although it can be rough around the edges, it is easily recommendable to any RPG fan. Original Sin is a game that gives you a lot of room and allows you to solve its odd encounters in numerous creative ways. Every new area has the potential of putting you in yet another highly amusing event and wandering around the colorful world of Rivellon is certain to be entertaining. There are definitely a lot of tiny annoyances (co-op dialogue is clunky, the game poorly hints at which direction you should go, the main story isn't immensely interesting and more companions would be great) but these are all just tiny issues in what is otherwise a fantastic RPG that allows you to interact with a highly engaging world in creative and clever ways. Excellent turn-based combat that highly promotes clever solutions and party interaction, a highly amusing and meticulously filled world and a great sense of player freedom make this one of the best RPGs in a long time.

												Old-school RPG made like it should be. Tactical turn based combat that works great, massive amounts of lore and dialogue to roam through, interesting characters. Art, environmental effects and spell effects, all look fantastic. Co-op gives a nice change for the genre.Recommend for every RPG fan out there. Can't wait for the second game.Pros:- Co-op.- Graphics are beautiful.- Challenging.- Lots of content. Diversity of quest.- No actual class system (might be a con for some people).- Humor, character interactions/banter.Cons:- Little voice acting.- I wasn't fan of the idea of rock-paper-scissors minigame making the decision for me.- Crafting could have been better.- Might be a bit too challenging if you are new to micromanaging RPG games or if you don't actually read the info given to you.- Way too little ingame information about stats/skills/game play mechanics.If you own the original game you'll get the Enhanced Edition free in a bit.

												This game is Great. Best RPG i played this year with Wasteland 2 (waiting for the witcher 3).Nowadays its rare when you need 80 hours to finish a RPG and im glad to see those 2 games showing us what it was to play a rpg like baldur's gates back in the days. The sound track is awsome, the dialogs are goods. This game has probably one of the best turn by turn combat system i ever saw in a video game.Hes not flawless though. The thiefs skills are bads, like very bad. You disarm like 99% of the traps by shooting them because the tools are expensives, and single-use. Anyway there are only mines, nothing more. If you want to open a locked chest its ten time easier to bash his face with an unbreakable weapon than using again an expensive and single-use tool. The stealth is in my opinion useless in combat, invisibility skill (every rogue can have it at level 1 if i remenber well) does the job though so the rogue is still very powerfull in combat).But these problems doesnt change the fact this game is a must have for everyone loving  RPGs			"

												A fantastic game to play with a friend, this game starts off a bit slow and difficult but quickly becomes extremely interesting and provides many hours of enjoyable gameplay. The turn based combat system can be quite deep, allowing you to make use of a variety of combos to lock down or blow up your enemies (e.g. a pool of oil may be cast, slowing enemies, and followed up with a fire based spell igniting the ol and everyone within while the smoke blinds them). There is also far more to this game than just combat: you can sneak around town stealing, use an extensive crafting system to get better equipment and make many changes to the story you experience through converstation.I have played through the game once and plan to do so again.

												Overall, this is a decent game, especially for one that was funded by Kickstarter and did not have the mega-budgets of some of the larger RPGs from companies like Bioware.  I find it generally fun, but there are a lot of issues with the game surrounding lack of information given to the player either int he manual or during game play about how the game actually works.Pros -+ Free-form character development: there are no classes so you can design a character however you want. But this can also be a con, see below.+ Immersive world with an interesting backstory and good motivations for your characters+ Ability to RP the characters in the actual game, not just in local chat, by using conversation options even among your own part members.+ Complete control over the NPCs - there is no need to live with idiot AI to charge stupidly into battle and cause a team wipe. You also control what skills and abilities they take as they level up.+ Graphics and sound are good+ Open world that lets you do just about anything within reason.  You won't see a lot of 'you can't do that' messages from the game, which is nice.Cons - - Lack of *useful* information for the player detracts from the freeform character design. For example, I had to discover online that higher skill ranks cost more to purchase, and would not simply unlock as level went up. There is no indiation of this anywhere in game nor in the game manual. The manual is also very vauge on things like how points you will have to invest, what the max level is, etc. You can easily nerf your own character due to this lack of information.- Prices at the vendors are psychotically insane given what you find while adventuring.  The only way to stay 'on par' (with what the game seems to expect you to have) is to steal everyone blind and sell them back their own stuff. This utterly wrecks immersion unless you have a party full of kleptos.  Not to mention stealing is stupidly easy to do and not get caught, so the claim in the game manual, that stealing leads to a rep hit, is patently false unless you're dumb enough to steal right in front of the NPCs.- Way too many quests make their way into your journal before you can finish even one that you are working on, so this game is like Skyrim in that it suffers from massive quest spam. Also, several quests are really about the same thing, which just clutters up the journal.- Speaking of quests, many of the quest entries are utterly useless because they are too vauge, things like 'You noticed something interesting about the door in Jon's house.' Oh THAT is going to help me next week when I get back to investigating this quest.- In what appears to be a misguided effort to make the game seem hardcore, without actually being hardcore, it is way too easy to die and way to easy to rez in this game. Death is meaningless if you can just resurrect people.  - The economy is completely broken. This is related to the stealing.  You have to steal people blind because you need money, but stealing them blind gives you more than you need, so you are walking around swishing huge bags of gold by level 4. The designers clearly realized this so they made things expensive and forced you to die and buy res scrolls (see above) to help drain some gold. Which they only needed to do because they made stealing so profitable in the first place.  On the whole I think the flaws are serious but not game-breaking.  I am giving this game a very weak thumbs-up. I don't regret buying it, and I am having fun playing with a friend co-op because I have not been able to play a paper RPG with him for many years and this lets us relive the good-old days. But I have to admit if this game were solo, I'd probably have stopped playing it after a few hours because of all the issues, especially the broken economy.			"

												All right, I'll stop playing the game long enough to write a review!  So please be grateful, because I could be playing my game instead ;)  This game is the best computer RPG I've ever played--PERIOD.  I prefer RPG's where you have a small party of adventurers rather than a lone wolf, and this game even offers the ability to play co-operatively with a friend!  The turn based combat is so addictive that it makes me wish there was some type of battle arena in the game, where you could just send your party to go fight groups of monsters or mages in various environments.  This is not to say the game is perfect, because there is the small matter of some puzzles in the game being ridiculously difficult, and I just don't see the need for that.  In most cases, there is a hint or clue that you can find and it'll help you solve the puzzle, but there are a few cases where the only way to solve it is to try dozens of combinations and waste your precious gaming time (possibly getting annoyed in the process), or you have to leave your game and hop on a search engine to locate the tips you need to solve the puzzle.  I feel these puzzles actually detract from the overall experience of the game, because after a couple of frustrating puzzles, I have an almost knee-jerk reaction to all puzzles in the game--that is to say that if I don't figure out a puzzle within a minute, I am tempted to save myself a lot of time and aggravation by just returning to the handy game guide I found on the internet.  A game shouldn't send the player running away to use a search engine--it should keep the player happily engaged in the game.  Of course, I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who enjoy puzzles, but I'm not one of them, and if i was, I'd probably buy a puzzle game instead of a role playing game.  So my advice on puzzles is to try them but cheat the moment you feel frustrated, because the rest of the game is a lot of fun and you shouldn't waste time on the worst part of the game ;)  (Too bad no one advised the developers not to waste time on those puzzles...)Ignoring that one drawback, you are likely to fall in love with this game.  The environments are gorgeous and maps are very well designed, the soundtrack is amazing and really pulls you deeper into the experience.  The quests and adventures in this game are likely to entertain you, and you'll have many opportunities for actual role playing in this game, which is something missing from pretty much every other RPG I've ever played on a computer.  In this game, you get to choose dialogue between the characters, which effects their attitude toward each other and shapes their relationships throughout the game.  I'm sure every playthrough will feel quite different because of the characters you make and how you choose to play them.  One final thing I wanted to mention is that crafting and blacksmithing are more fun in this game than any other game I've played in this genre.  I always enjoy collecting ingredients and combining them to make awesome gear (that is often better than items you can purchase from vendors).  In other games, alchemy and crafting were side activities that rarely ever resulted in something more useful than a healing potion, but in Divinity: Original Sin it's fun and rewarding just discovering new recipes and experimenting with your ingredients.I absolutely recommend this game to everyone who is a fan of role playing games and turn based combat.  It's definitely one of my favourite computer games in my entire collection!			"

Of course, I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who enjoy puzzles, but I'm not one of them, and if i was, I'd probably buy a puzzle game instead of a role playing game.  So my advice on puzzles is to try them but cheat the moment you feel frustrated, because the rest of the game is a lot of fun and you shouldn't waste time on the worst part of the game ;)  (Too bad no one advised the developers not to waste time on those puzzles...)Ignoring that one drawback, you are likely to fall in love with this game.  The environments are gorgeous and maps are very well designed, the soundtrack is amazing and really pulls you deeper into the experience.  The quests and adventures in this game are likely to entertain you, and you'll have many opportunities for actual role playing in this game, which is something missing from pretty much every other RPG I've ever played on a computer.  In this game, you get to choose dialogue between the characters, which effects their attitude toward each other and shapes their relationships throughout the game.  I'm sure every playthrough will feel quite different because of the characters you make and how you choose to play them.  One final thing I wanted to mention is that crafting and blacksmithing are more fun in this game than any other game I've played in this genre.  I always enjoy collecting ingredients and combining them to make awesome gear (that is often better than items you can purchase from vendors).  In other games, alchemy and crafting were side activities that rarely ever resulted in something more useful than a healing potion, but in Divinity: Original Sin it's fun and rewarding just discovering new recipes and experimenting with your ingredients.I absolutely recommend this game to everyone who is a fan of role playing games and turn based combat.  It's definitely one of my favourite computer games in my entire collection!			"

												Incredible game! When I first started following this game, I was put off by the amount of dialog that seemed to be present.That is not an issue.The dialog, while verbose, is broken up into easily read portions. Conversations are handled in logical ways. I have yet to run across any dialog that I wanted to ""skip through"". All of the dialog has added something to my experience, just as it should in a quality RPG.The shear amount of things to do is incredible. I usually play my RPGs as a “good” guy; You know the type. I won’t steal, trespass, or try to break the game’s progress. Divinity WANTS you to do those things! Once I let go of my lawful tendencies, the game opened up on a whole new level.Sneak into a house and rob in blind? Check.Bust open a shop door? Check.Murder an NPC for her possessions? Check.Dig up a grave or three for lofty loot? Check.In fact, had I not done at least a bit of this the game would have been much harder so far. This speaks truths to some aspects of real life experience as well. Not that I have ever done anything like that listed of course, but its possible out here, and possible in Divinity too.Then there is the lovely, turn based, tactical combat. Personally, I haven’t seen enough combat! This system is enjoyable enough that I think it could be a game unto itself. Rain on a fire based enemy, zap it with a water based spell, and cause massive bonus damage, just as logic would dictate. Fire and lava on the map will actually heal those fire-based dudes, too. Nothing feels quite so bad as when that badass sword swinging melee fighter runs off, steps in lava, and heals for 3000 points (When he only has 150 HP to begin with!). Knowing you have to kill this thing in one turn so it can’t heal really puts the pressure on.Opposite to that, catch on oil slick on fire. The fire will spread all over and enemies enveloped by it act accordingly, sometimes casting rain spells of their own to counter. Of course, casting rain now makes then wet, and they can be more easily frozen. I love this system, and many combinations exist. Poison arrow bombs. Electricity streaming through a newly created rain puddle. Teleport that bad dude into a lava flow for virtually instant death. SO MANY OPTIONS!Exploration. The game is HUGE! I have about 25 hours in and have not completed the first area yet (I am told 100 hours for a first playthrough is not unreasonable). I am only at level 6 with my characters, too. I have found a way to “skip” past a lot of the content in the first area, but the next map harbors enemies that start at level 9. So, while possible, it’s not advised. The game does not put up an artificial barrier to block your progress (Or hasn’t so far). In the first town I was warned by the city guards that I was not strong enough but they would still open the gates for me, leaving the choice up to me.The game will require some thinking outside of the box. Some of the boss fights you will face can be brutally hard. But with the proper application of strategy and using the tools at your disposal, all fights seem fair. Nowhere did I feel I had been cheated, either in battle or in the puzzles. And if you do feel so, the quick save and quick load function can be used anywhere.So, tl;dr? If you even remotely liked Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, this game will scratch that same itch. "

Early Access Review
								Having put over eighty hours into the game it'd be pretty hard not to recommend at this point. I had been looking into buying it since it became available on Early Access, but held off. After it went into beta, I honestly couldn't help myself. It looked way too good to ignore any longer and glitches and frustrations would have to be taken in stride. I needed a role playing game with only customizable characters. I got that and the ability to give my characters a personality. It really is an enjoyable game, even in the beta form.     The game sports a delightfully colorful cartoonish look while maintaining a fair grip on reality. The colors themselves feel sort of like pastels. Overall, the style of it looks wonderful in motion. Every area also in the game feels unique enough to where you'll be able to comfortably play without relying on the map. Even the darker areas of the game such as burning forests and dripping coves feel consistent with the rest of the game's appearance. Character models kind of look like clay, but don't look terrible because of it. Instead, they blend rather well with the world. Spells are flashy and when they hit, they make a noticeable impact. Animations all feel smooth. Each spell class (Earth, Fire, Water, Air, and Witchcraft) all have a similar base, but different overall presentation.     The combat is turn based, but flows fairly fast. Attacks don't take a lot of time to execute and given the tactical nature of skills, battles can end in an instant. Some of the more drawn out battles come from larger groups of enemies, rather than smaller groups of tougher combatants. A lot of effort was noticeably put into enemy placement. This was done to make each battle not only feel unique, but keep players on their toes. There are conveniently placed barrels of oil and water throughout the world and using them to your advantage is nearly vital to survival. Elements play a major role in combat as things like electrified water can stun enemies and iced ground can cause a player to slip. Their effects can be null if your character rolls a high enough saving throw based on your stats. You can also remove hazards from the field through the same use of elements. Fire will melt ice and explode poisonous clouds, while water from rain will douse fires.      The number of actions you can take during a turn in battle depends on how many actions points your character has. Everything from casting spells to equipping items and simply moving consumes action points. This ensures that the player thinks about every choice they make for everything that they do. The enemy AI isn't too stupid to walk directly into a fire pit and will generally go after squishier party members before others. They also incorporate tactics of their own will use the environment to their advantage as well if they are able. Unfortunately, melee enemies have a tendency to mob from time to time which makes dispatching them a little easier than normal. Leveling can be a bit of a pain, but isn't too tiresome. Grinding, however, is out since enemies do not respawn as there are a set number of them in the game. There are two side notes I would like to make about the game's difficulty. One, the game does have a difficulty setting that I haven't used myself yet. And two, I'm basing this analysis on multiple play-throughs with only a party of two. There are two companions available in the current build of the game a mage and warrior and there will likely be more when the game releases officially.      What skills a character can learn are based on the number of points put into that particular school. There are eight different classes to choose from. They are simply warrior, air, water fire, earth, witchcraft, ranger and rogue. The first level in a class allows for you to learn three skills in that class and from there it gradually increases with each until you get to level five where you can learn an unlimited number of for that particular class. There are no limits as to what combinations you make with these classes. However, there is a level limit attached to skills as well which makes it that much harder to strike a balance with more specific role playing characters you make. It should also be noted that physical based characters feel really underpowered compared to mages.     The character creater comes with eleven pre-made classes. They all range from your standard to pre-built hybrid classes. What weapons you start with are based on the class you choose before further editing it. So if you want to make a warrior-mage that starts with armor and a sword, you would first have to choose either the knight or fighter class, then edit the skills to liking from there. Cosmetically speaking, the game offers up numerous customization options that allow to make your character your own. There are a dozen different skin tones, hair styles, and faces available. Everything seems well made and a finished character actually looks like it belongs in the game it came from unlike some character creator results.     The story, or what little of it that has been made available in the beta, feels straight forward, tight and fun. The story follows your two created characters traveling to the town of Cyseal to investigate a murder. You are to find evidence of Sourcery and eliminate it with extreme prejudice. Or you could just meander about and until the actual plot comes in. The reason for your characters journey is just a means to an end. What becomes increasingly clear as you move forward with the game's plot is that your characters much more than the mere mortals that they start off to be and they'll learn as much about their past selves as you do as the game moves forward. Your characters can grow to love are hate each other based on the personalities that you give them. Things can even entirely platonic between your characters if that is what you want.     The way this works is that there are instances where your characters can communicate with one another and from there, you can choose their responses to one another. These events can be triggered by any number of things such one character fleeing from battle or even something simple like finding a note on the beach. The dialogue flows pretty naturally and the game manages quite a consistent tone. The amount of consistency is pretty remarkable considering the pretty diverse cast of characters available even in this starting portion of the game. The writing is delightfully humorous, and even when more dark discussions are had, they are treated with a light sense of whimsy. This doesn't mean that everything is a joke, just that the game doesn't want to take itself too seriously.-You'll notice that this review doesn't talk about the online portions of the game. That's because I don't play games online and that even extends to this. I'm not against it, personally, and think that the idea of how it works seems nice enough. I can speak briefly of the global chat: It works. That's about all there is to it. If you have a quick question about something in the game then you can drop it in the chat and people will respond to it. The people are decent for an online community and are pretty helpful too.-The game has bugs to be sure, but every major bug in the two plus months I've been playing the game has been addressed and a ton of smaller fixes are always implemented with each release. The most nagging past issues have been: broken traps, dumb enemies, various graphical glitches, and a few story related makers and queues being ""off"" The game has never crashed on me even while in beta.

												Divinity: Original Sin is Absolutley Brilliant!Dont hesitate thinking you will be dissapointed as you may have been in the past with other games of the same genre!This is exactly what you need to revive the bygone Baldurs gate era, gameplay is slightly different as the combat encounters are based on AP points but it stll has everything you would expect from the aforesaid!The gameplay is challenging just as it should be, Storyline is immersing as there are murders to solve, manic robots to find, udead to dispatch among countless other aborations and you can even talk to the animals given the right circumstances.Just make sure you have some halibut, sheeps cheese and tomatoes !

Early Access Review
								Many ask now-a-days, ""where have all the good [RPG] games gone, and where are all the [developer] gods?  Where's that [Playable] Streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?"", and ain't it all too true?  Gone are the golden days of the old school RPG's that made the genre the gods of Olympus in the world of video games: Fallout, Neverwinter, Wasteland, all genre defining titles.  Where have they gone? Well, they have been replaced with fast paced  3D, in your face, Action RPGs, that look pretty with their special effects and complex skill trees, but lack the depth of the, ""choose your own adventure in an open world"", style of PRG gameplay that everyone grew up on, and grew to love.  Well, the wait is over!Divinity seeks to place the genre back on Mt. Olympus with its phenomenal engineered throw back to the old school era of RPGs, but with its own, unique, ""new school flavor""; all wrapped in a pretty bow - as in the interactable world and environment built around it.  Dvinity plays just like the ""oldies, but goodies"", yet with a refreshing approach implementing new elements to modernize the dead genre while breathing new life into the RPG's of old.  Despite bridging the gaps by filling in the missing components of the early century Golden Age of ""bird's eye view RPG's"", Divinity reaches beyond the limitations of the earler ""industry defining"" releases in the open world RPG genre. Divinity offers an unpredented depth to character development by offering a plethora of archtypes, styles of play, and even so far as each character's personality through an AI setting to be available at release.  The ""AI"" setting is your characters disposition, which I look forward to experiencing the impact it will have with NPC interactions, and the game play as a whole.  Divinity makes the world around the player character come alive and cooexist with the player character's choices offering a synergy unlike what you have seen before in an open world, ""choose your own adventure"", RPG's.Combat is of course turn based, and strategic to say the least; in many situations, survival is contingent on using the environment to garner an edge against your enemies through spells and or skills.  Spells, certain weaponry - particularly arrows bought or crafted by Rangers- as well as skillsets also help the player navigate and negotiate dangerous environmental restrictions such as, poisonous areas, grounds scorched by fire, or frozen over by ice, and environmentally hastened, strengthened, and even weakened, enemies.  Only by negating or taking advantage of these effects can your characters safely gain passage whether they are navigating through dangerous environments, or fighting certain combatants requiring the player to use thought and purpose to progress through the game.You start with two fully customizable characters based on existing archetypes, or you can build their skill sets and spell pools to your own style of gameplay.  During your trevails, you will be introduced to companions who will join your crusade with their own personal disposition towards your actions and inactions with ongoing interactions with your player characters as the game progresses.  Your chacters themselves will also interact through dialogue to support one another's choices or to contradict eachother using skills gained during gameplay through these interactions.Divinity Original Sin offers a deeply enriched environment.  The backstory is that the player characters are ""Source Hunters"", or investigators that quell threats of people using an evil form of necromancy magic called, the ""Source"".  It all begins with the investigation into a murder at Cyseal, requiring the player character to interact with several NPC's to unravel the mystery until their investigation leads to fruition with answers to satisfy the residents of Cyseal.  Quests, in general, are multilayered requring the player to embrace thought and consideration into the process of unravelling the mysteries to find the answers their quest-givers seek.  These quests are not arms length transactions like the RPG's of old: find this, get that, kill that, come back.  Rather, quests are integrated into the fabric of the game.  Some of them require not one, two, or even three steps, but an inumerable chain of steps to achieve your ultimate goals.  This provides a sense of unity and singular purpose in discovering the solutions whereby what you decide to do in one quest, may ultimately affect the results of another or multiple quest chains.  This offers a very unique experience to RPG players both old and new.  Players generally have to interact with most of the NPCs in order to decipher what needs to be done to complete each quest, while certain quests still maintain a simple and direct passage offering diversity.  The several quests that are connected to the main quest never ends.  Once you have completed the chain in one area, it spills over to the next area, and I assume so on and so forth - I only assume because the beta ends with completing the main quest in the first area, as the following areas are currently locked out of Beta.  All the while, quest completion feels organic and intuitive so te storyline doesn't feel disconnectedl.To advance the experience further, Divinity DNA includes crafting sourced from genre defining games like the Ultima series.  You can craft an innumerable number of items, from clothing to weapons, potions to scrolls, magic items to non-magical items, all based on your crafting skills, the recipe books you have uncovered, and the simple purity of trial and error by mixing various ingredients to learn new compounds.  The crafting component offers a whole layer to the game that can keep you entertained for hours, if only to learn more combinations to create items, potions, weapons, and then twice over by mixing crafted items with crafted maigcal items to create magical properties within crafted items.Divinity: Original Sin is truly the RPG, with old school blood, of this decade, perhaps the century.  If you are a purist when it comes to ""top down, open world"" RPG's, you will not be disappointed with the depth, novelty, and versatility of this game.  Not only does the game offer a core storyline for you to playthrough, but upon full release, players will have the opportunity to create their own environments, NPCs, characters and quests of their own to upload to developer servers for others to play.  These tools offer the level of depth that most online games with similar tools could only dream of providing to their player base.You would probably expect that I would be wrapping up this review, but there's more. The game can be played single player. One of the more defining characteristics of this game is the opportunity to have one player character controlled by a second person.  You can play with a friend and divide and conquer, performing whatever actions you choose free from the other player and all across the environment.Although the game is only in Beta stage, the total time to complete this area will keep you engaged for up to 25 hours, or longer, depending upon how many rocks you turn over to find what you are looking for while completing your quests.  I can only imagine what the final release will hold with a multitude of additional areas to play through.  This is type of game that has the highest level of replayability for an RPG.  Your decisions do not weigh lightly in this game, but rather define the your experience, how those act around you, and the ultimate conclusion of your conquest.  This is worth every cent if you are an RPG lover, and Divinity: Original Sin truly sets a new precedent for all RPG titles released after its full publication.			"

												I've never had a more difficult time rating a game than Divinity Original Sin because 1) It's one of a kind. 2) Expectations were quite high for an epic RPG 3) There are so few decent turn-based and even real-time with pause RPGs so it *had* to be good, just had to...or else it was back to replays of old favorites (again).I will give it two ratings, one for my experience and one tempered with others' feedback in consideration (see below) as my personal experience score is both lower and possibly atypical. Overall, I give it 4 out of 5 stars.The breakdown:Interactive environment (5) Story/dialog/pace - drags on, not inspiring (3) Companions  (2) lifeless (correction - 1 point for ability, 1 for existence) Graphics (4.5) Combat  (3.5) --repetitive, but neat spells/skills. Music (3.8) Edit  -- 4+ as standalone and main theme, in particular, but not in-game. Mostly very light and less inspiring in context of the atmosphere, unlike other Divinity games.Overall enemy variety & game world (5) Leveling (3.5) - slow and unrewarding though refreshingly different with Action Points.Dependability/bugs (3.5) --needs a few more patches but is mostly smooth. Replayabilty (4) (if you like it yes, if not, no) Gameplay Hours - (5) Fantastic! 60-150 hours. Tactics -- lots of cheese/repetition (3.5) Mods/Editor - (potentially 5 but to be determined). Voice acting (3) - limited. Loot (5) For loot maniacs. May be overabundant for some players.Quests  (4) --better than average, not so fetchy.Puzzles - Yes - love or hate themAtmosphere  (3) e.g. lack of dynamic weather, immersive sound and dungeons are not scary.Dynamic Events - largely absentConsequences - few or not impacting other than in combat.Map / Inventory/Journal  (2.5 to 3)Crafting - (3.5)A problem with the game is that the sum is not greater than its parts. It would make a much better 30-40 hour game than an  epic-length one, in its current state given it stalls out for story-driven, if not combat, players.But, if you come to the game with no expectations of Baldur's Gate et al. and in a light-hearted mood (for tis not a dark/mature game) your money should be well-spent. You may even love the game, some really do. If you're looking for the next epic classic RPG,though, you're on the road to disappointment. So come equipped with an open-mind for best results.***If you like turn-based RPGs Divinity Original Sin is most worth taking a look at *** and it may well one day be considered a cult classic as the niche following is strong.                                          ----------------------My personal experience rating, however, is 3.5 -3.8.I'm an older gamer and don't necessarily represent the majority of Larian fans, though love most of their games. Original Sin started as a holiday dinner and soon became two-day old, leftover turkey sandwiches after 40ish hours -- stale and bland, though a bit tasty with salt when available. I actually quit the game 3/4 the way through, from boredom,though plan to return to it someday (tm).My standards are rather distinct for an RPG and in disclosure I lean strongly towards Neverwinter Nights series or Baldur's Gate-type games (aside from strategy, open-world and select aRPGs) as well as those with darker undertones. Additionally, I even felt Shadowrun,  XCom and Disciples combat was much more enjoyable. I think with mods this game could turn around. Right now it is a diamond in the rough, or so it appears. Multiplayer may offer a ton of fun and that I am unable to comment on.Lastly, of note, my Steam hours are artificially inflated -- both with Alpha and leaving the game running. The real-hours are closer to 150, but nonetheless I well got my money's worth at that rate. The game is better than average but needs serious work to shine. Most importantly, it needs a soul.Still, future games in this genre will have a new threshold to meet in modernized cRPGs.			"

								This is one of the BEST CRPG games I ever played in a long time! The Early Access is almost over and the release is comming on June 30th!I have allot of fun with this game by providing feedback and reporting bug reports. Larian Studious has done a very good job using the ""Early Access"" feature. They have been pushed to their limits allot in every single update they do and change the game dramatically from story, combat, balancing and more!. This is one of my first Early Access games, that I actually gave feedback as this game have very huge potential and probably will even get allot of awards and probably game of the year for RPG's! They have listened and adding allot of our suggestions into the game and the game is just getting better! Why do I recommend this game?- The best CRPG game I have played in along time since the OLD RPG games.- The game is very interactive from environments, items to NPC's!- They will deliver a strong toolset for modders and players who are willing to download MODS or make their own story into the game! (Yes the campaign can be modable!)- Conversation between your main characters and companions!- Customizable characters by items, skills, talents, armor, weapons and more!- Just go get it now! :PThank you Larian Studiois for this wonderful game - You defiantly will get allot of awards for this game!

												This was a present from my Friend, we played it Multi-player. This was the first time I had played anything remotely like this game, I was out of my depth. I let my Friend lead. It was going swimingly, we'd explored a beach, found a giant talking clam and fed it, and then had ended up at the town gates. I said i'd take the lead as I had more perception and I could see which way to lead the conversation, this seemed like a good idea as the two guards were completely trollied. Oh dear is all I can say. They ended up dead, and we ended up with a cheesewheel and a cook book. I have no idea how it ended up like this. My Friend was laughing so hard at the outcome that I thought he was going to wet himself. Literally. We got into the town and everything seemed to be back on track, we were making headway with the quest and we'd racked up a bit of money. Now it was time to interview a suspect, seeing how it went last time with my attempt, I didn't volunteer. It was going great until my Friend killed the guy. ""He had information we needed, why the f%&* did you kill him?"" ""He was annoying me and not telling the truth."" ""So we go out and find more evidence, then come back and talk to him again."" ""Nah this was easier, plus we can loot the place now.""My Character was too moral and didn't want to loot, so I left to talk to more people in the town. I thought I had another lead until my Friend asked if I could bail him out of Jail. He tried to sell the looted items, got caught, tried to fight the Police, failed and was in Jail. I  didn't have enough gold to bail him out so we had to restart from the previous save point. Oops! Pros:The most unique part of this game is the fact that you can change the outcome of the storyline and quests by what you say in conversations or by what you chose to say. Sometimes, this works wonders and you can make a shy person open up to you with important information or you can calm down an angry drunk to avoid a fight. The dialogue is hilarious, each little joke, each innuendo just made it for me. I especially loved the animal to human dialogue. You can do almost anything you want! You can murder people, you can steal from people, you can wander around aimlessly. You can even use your partner as a distraction and go into places you aren't allowed in. The combat system is neat. I found it easy to understand (especially considering this was my first attempt at this genre) and I was actually pretty decent at it. I could combine attacks to create terrain that would cause effect damage to enemies when they entered it. This made it easier to defeat enemies higher levels than us. The asthetics of the game are beautiful too, I felt genuinely immersed in every area I went into and I really appreciate the level of detail that went into it. In every field, you can see tones of the green/yellow grass depending on which way the sun is in the games sky. You can see shadows in the water which are fish or other objects. Cons:It was a lot of trial and error. I think we restarted the save a few dozen times as we'd managed to ruin it and promptly fail our quest. I'm putting the combat system here too, because you do have to plan out your moves accordingly. I had to think about 3 steps ahead to ensure I could defeat the enemies, or I had to run.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin it is best turn-based RPG which I've played. First what I am like in this game, this is characters creation, you can create TWO CHARACTERS (but only if you play alone), this is awesome. Also game have coop mode, jokes, great gameplay. But what important in this game you have your home, not like in Skyrim, but anyway better than nothing, also you can use food for healing and also drank some alcohol (kinda like in The Witcher 3) :-D. Storyline is pretty simple good versus evil, maybe this first and last minus in this game, also you can find some beautiful soundtracks. I think not only I like game with rich story line.Game is great!			"

												Awesome game! SO FREAKIN MUCH TO EXPLORE. People say, ""Oh, turn-based combat systems suck!"" but in this game that system is very demanding. If you make the wrong decision during your turn, it could cost you the entire battle, or even your partners life. One thing that makes this game different from other RPG games is that you level up VERY slowly. If you buy this game, DO NOT SPEND YOUR TALENT POINTS WITH HASTE. Choose carefully. Overall, I give this game a 9/10.			"

												Amazing game, made with so much love and dedication. Has the best turn-based combat system I've ever played with.

												When I bought this game I did not expect to enjoy it too much, ""It's just a turn-based RPG"" is what I thought. It's not ""just"" that, not at all.Divinity: Original Sin starts of with a simple task, which is to investigate a murder, and so you start off your journey in this amazing world. Quickly you'll notice that things might not be what they look like, 'the plot thickens', and you will realize that the simple task you started with is now part of something much, much bigger. You are free to do as you please, didn't like how this guy treated you? Might as well kill him. Too bad he had some information  which could help you solve some quest, but no need to worry as you might stumble upon a clue as you move on. But you will face the consequences of your actions, if you dig the grave of a mourning woman's husband to find some loot, she will go crazy and attack you (Personal experience).This game also won't take you for dumb, from questing to combat, and even on dialogues, you'll have to put your brain to work. Quests require you to to really pay attention to whatever clues you find so you can get them done, and don't you dare look for a walkthrough! During combat you'll have to consider what kinds of enemies you are up against, what kind of enviroment are you in, is there something that you can use to your advantage? Like that barrel of water sitting next to your enemies, how about destroying it with a fireball and then throwing a lightning bolt to stun your foes, or maybe turning it into ice to make them stumble and fall.Overall this game was an awesome experience, and absolutely one of the best RPGs I've ever played, I definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a new, refreshing experience, especially those into heavily story-driven games.9/10			"

												The devs put in a lot of effort to make this game, so it's only fair that I take some time to put down my thoughts about it in more than just a one-liner ^_^ Here we go...Content-------------------There's lots of it. Don't get fooled by the 4 overworld maps like I did - Each one takes many many hours to complete. There's a good enemy variety, but most of it is fantasy standard: Orcs, spiders, skeletons, ... They can have some nice/surprising abilities though. You'll spend quite some time in your inventory comparing stats of the tons of items you find and trying out some crafting recipes. Completing every (side-)quest and doing almost everything D:OS has to offer took about 105 hrs on hard difficulty - It's a long game but doesn't overstay its welcome. You'll see everything on a single playthrough except for some alternate consequences of choices you make. They aren't significant enough to justify playing it again though. However, the different char progressions and party setups do. For example, I never tried a stealthy rogue approach and rarely used witchcraft. Also, I highly suggest keeping an eye on the mod scene as those guys made me enjoy rpgs up to 4 times as long as intended...Combat------------------- It's turn-based - each turn, a character gets action points depending on his stats to spend on movement, attacks or using items and once you're done, another character or enemy gets his turn. After using a spell/skill, there's a cooldown to prevent you (and your enemy) from using those high damage AoE spells every turn.A very cool aspect of the combat system is, that many spells work together or with the environment in some way. See a puddle of water? Electrify it and everything standing in it. Enemies enjoying some toxic gas? Throw a fireball and make it explode around them. Dragon Age 1 did something like this, but D:OS takes it even further. Of course enemies and yourself have resistances and immunities to elements, forcing you to adapt your strategy.Balance/Difficulty------------------- In general, it's far more difficult than most modern rpgs and the only one since Dragon Age 1 that managed to kill me. Repeatedly :D Once you get used to how everything works, it's a lot easier than what you might expect though. In any case, the difficulty is too inconsistent - Early-game is quite hard because you have few good spells available, then in Luculla Forest and Hiberheim it gets a lot easier and then difficulty spikes again for a short time on the last map only to drop to zero near the end. Imho it SHOULD start fairly easy and then gradually get harder - I have yet to play a game that gets this right though (and it's probably impossible because difficulty is so subjective...) Except for one instance the game is not unfair - you always know exactly WHY the enemy wiped the floor with you.I like that the game randomly throws some bosses in your face - ""Here, have a giant spider for no reason!"" - and some of them like the Braccus Rex battle really require you to come up with a good tactic. The final boss was a big disappointment though and got boring quickly because you are so overpowered by then that it requires just time, no effort.Char progression/Skills------------------- You get 2 main chars + 2 additional ones you can hire either in the area Cyseal or in your ""base"". On lvl-up you spend points in the usual rpg stats (strength, intelligence, ...) and a variety of different skills (like elemental magic). Every now and then you get to pick a special, powerful trait. You can develop your party however you want - there's nothing stopping you from making a fireball throwing warrior.Story/Quests------------------- The writing is excellent with some highly enjoyable dialogues, but the story itself is... well, not bad but nothing special either and also pretty much linear. However, D:OS does a good job to keep you interested in what's gonna happen next. Most of the story is experienced in-game but every now and then you get a cutscene with a narrator talking over some artwork, which is pretty neat.Quests are pretty much rpg standard, but they are well written and often involve interesting characters. In many of them you get to make a choice and (if you activated AI personality or playing co-op) argue with your partner about how to do things which is often hilarious, especially in co-op. Sometimes your choice even has some consequence later in the game, although none of them is really significant. Controls------------------- Not much to complain here: Inventory management works pretty well with all the automatic sorting options. Technically there's a limit of items you can carry based on weight, but it's not like Diablo where you have to return to town every 10 minutes. In fact, with 1 high strength warrior I never reached the limit once because even full plate armour doesn't seem to weigh too much. For every char you get 5 bars with 10 slots each where you can put skills/spells/items for quick access via hotkeys. For late-game mages that's not enough for EVERY spell, but you won't be regularly using every single one of them anyway. Sometimes it's easy to misclick and accidentally steal stuff or chuck a fireball where you didn't want to though.Sound------------------- Effects are great and the music is absolutely fantastic. I'm not sure how many tracks there are, but I never got bored with them. There's little voice-acting (mostly for the 2 main chars) but the few parts that are voiced, are done quite well with talented actors.Graphics------------------- Because I've been playing on a rather old PC (E6750, 4Gb Ram, Radeon HD4800) I wasn't able to try maximum settings, but even on medium the game looks pretty gorgeous. Most of the time you'll be playing zoomed out pretty far out but it's nice that it also looks good up close. It's very colorful with nice animations and spell effects - having half the screen explode with a meteor strike feels quite satisfying :) The world has been handcrafted very carefully with a lot of attention to detail and also offers more variety than you might think at first glance - Just when you get a little bored with grassland you stumble into a burning forest, get teleported to a frozen castle or stand on a ledge that essentially looks like the one in Mt. Doom :)  Performance------------------- On my old system the game runs smoothly on medium - I guess you COULD play it on high on such a system if you're ok with occassional FPS drops. With my 32-bit OS I had the nasty problem that the game froze and ultimately crashed when saving after about 20 minutes. However, a fix mentioned on the forum worked just fine and I was able to play the following 105hrs without any crash/freeze. Saving/loading takes some time (~30s), but considering the amount of data that needs to be saved/loaded, I suppose that's still ok.Bugs------------------- Surprisingly few. There's some items you should be able to get with telekinesis, but the game tells you you ""can't reach"" them for some reason. In Hiberheim I encountered what I think was a scrapped quest. There was also some treasure I didn't get, because an item I needed wasn't in the game. I couldn't finish one of the last sidequests, but I killed everyone involved so I'm not sure if that qualifies as a bug... ;)Verdict------------------- Is it perfect? Nah. But in terms of complexity, depth and atmosphere it DOES shame many rpgs of recent years made by bigger companies with a much higher budget. Some will tell you that with D:OS, there's finally an ""old-school"" and difficult experience around again, but I don't care about that. The important thing is - D:OS is a very well made and atmospheric rpg that really shows the devs love, passion and understanding for the genre.			"

												Where to begin with this masterpiece?Pros:+ One of the most beautiful and immersive worlds I've seen in a game to date. You can interact and barter with almost anyone (including animals if you have the talent). The graphics are grade A for a game like this and I often find myself just staring at the scenery.+ Gripping story that has you guessing whats coming next, and most of the time you guess wrong. For me, at least, it seemed most of the story came straight out of left field. I loved it.+ Combat feels engaging, challenging, and at times it can be very unforgiving. One wrong move could cost you a hero. Icy surfaces are definitely the bane of my existence, I think they get me more than anything else. But the combat itself really gives you a sense of accomplishment when you kill a group of enemies you just died 3 times on to your own stupid errors.+ The music is incredible. I constantly find myself humming along to the music, even when I'm not playing. Every song is a perfect match for whats going on in game.+ Character creation and class system is the most flexible of any RPG I've come across. You can be whatever you want to be from level one, so you don't end up with cookie cutter builds that everyone uses. This really allows you to adapt the game to your play style.+ Replay-ability. I'm still on my first play through and already I find myself thinking about and deciding what I'm going to do next time around. Almost every quest can turn out differently depending on what you do and how you play. It seems no two play throughs will ever be the same.Cons:- I'm not going to lie there were a couple bugs I've come across so far. None of which were game breaking and were fixed with a simple Save/Reload. The most common and most annoying for me if sometimes combat will start but the music wont. The only other big one I can remember was one of my companions wasn't able to be healed. But as stated saving/reloading did fix both of these bugs.- I wish it was longer. Not to say it's short because it's not by any means. I'm on my first play through level 16 and so far I've invested 76 hours of play. I really just don't want it to end.I can honestly say this is the best 40 bucks I've ever invested in a game. I highly recommend it anyone who enjoyed games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, Dragon Age: Origins, or Knights of the Old Republic. Anyway hope this was helpful and hope you enjoy the game.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is mercilessly wonderful and frustrating. if you have even an ounce of nostalgia for the classic CRPGs you played in the mid- to late 90's and early '00s -- the ones that had really detailed manuals with illustrations and everything -- D:OS will get your ♥♥♥♥ hard.this game is based upon the long-abandoned philosophy of classic videogames: ""no, YOU ♥♥♥♥ing figure it out, idiot."" you're on an epic quest for some reason or other that has all sorts of grand implications... and meanwhile, you can steal anything, kill anyone, wreak all manner of havoc, and shoot fire at everything. you'll spend a lot of time running around and clicking things to see what happens (will this kill me? how many different ways can I make this explode? also, can I craft anything from this handful of zombie butts?). you'll be the driving force in an engaging story surrounded by a cast of wonderful characters with stellar quest text, voice acting, and lovely stylized character design.you are given total freedom to discover the rules (and, of course, to break them). however, the flipside of this is that it IS possible to break your game or gimp your character. you will re-load quicksaves. a lot. you will probably die. a lot.D:OS has many flaws, like its godawful UI and half-baked crafting system, but I find that those flaws are part of the charm. furthermore, the game is still being updated and tweaked, so many of these flaws are temporary. this game is addictive, frustrating, satisfying, silly, surprising, and fantastic.

												It is certainly one of the best RPG-s I've ever played. What makes it even more awesome than a lot of other RPGs you can find around - it has co-op. So, for me it was 160 hours of pure awesomeness with complete immersion into this epic world while playing with friend.This game has a lot of pros that cloud all of the problems, so here you go:- awesome story line- awesome dialogues & RP options/choices- a very nice approach to turn-based combat and it's well combined with real-time non-combat actions- nice itemization and character development, stats, skills etc.- quite hardcore, may be kinda hard for unprepared people, but if you're looking for a challenge for your strategic skills and mechanics studying - playing on hard is certainly a way to go, it's fun!- very beautiful areas and a generally good area design (in both appearance and structure)- gameplay is a well-balanced blend of combat, puzzles (a fair share of those are really interesting, got me despite the fact I hate pure puzzles), RP with optional things like stealth- non-linear progression, a lot of quests are more or less optional, but it's absolutely up to you to decide what are you doing first. assuming your gear/level allows you of course, but there's absolutely nothing that horses you to go by a corridor- worth mentioning separately: nice navigation options, you'll never walk too much just for the sake of it, waypoints all the way- remarkable soundtrackThere're unfortunately a few negative aspects, but comparing to how awesome the game is, you don't really care:- bugs. they don't take up too much time to deal with, but they may be annoying: occasional crashes (save your game often to spare your blood pressure (c) tip from loading screen), rarely you have stat problems on your characters so you have to do a simple save-load to fix it, rare disconnects if you're playing in co-op. still not too overwhelming, but after 100h in they begin to become somewhat annoying (hopefully most people finish game by this time, but not me...)- interface. overall it's fine, but some things could've been done a lot better, especially tooltips, they lack some vital details (like durations of status-effects). you'll probably have to go to wiki sooner or later for some details or just to test yourself but it takes some timeSo, to sum it up - this game is a must-play if you want a really good RPG (not something ""with RP elements"" like Borderland ot w/e) or maybe you're just looking for experience similar to Fallout. It's quite long, so be ready to allocate some time, I advice against making breaks during a playthrough.			"

Beautiful graphics, dynamic world, very interesting and deep turn based mechanics, great story, amazing music, a lot of surprises during exploration, interactions, lot of sandbox elements. You just can't get wrong buying it. Worth every single cent of the full price! If this game would be a MMO, it would prevale over any turn-based MMOs around. Thank you Larian for this masterpiece! TURN BASED IS NOT DEAD and this game, listed in steam best selling list, is the proof, I hope more great turn-based games will come in the future from other publishers as well!			"

												First things first: I love the Divinity universe. I own all of the games, even owning multiple copies on multiple websites, plus Divinity 2: Dragon Knight Saga on the 360. So although I technically could be a bit biased, I am going to try to give as honest a review as possible, featuring both positives and negatives.Positives:+ The music in Divinity games has always been phenomenal. Original Sin combines some of the best tracks from all of its predecessors, and WOW was I excited to hear them. Divinity 2 (360 version) came with a full music soundtrack, and that is the only video game soundtrack I keep and prize because the music is supremely beautiful. Many of those tracks are here as well, along with new tracks that keep up with the Divinity standard.+ The world is lush, beautiful. This game is very colorful while keeping its realism. This is a world you WANT to explore every nook and cranny of, which is great because this game sure makes you do it.+ The character classes are vast and varied. You can create the character you want (warrior that uses magic, a rogue/mage, etc.)+ The battle system is FUN, and the battle music is energizing. Original Sin introduces the concept of using elements and environments to make or break battles, so having your mage make it rain over the enemies before shocking them with electricity will give you the upper hand in a battle where you may have been losing.+ TONS of quests. It kind of gets to the point that is reminiscent of Skyrim, where the player can feel overwhelmed by the vast amount of quests waiting for you in your journal.+ - Free roaming. You can (and will) run into areas not really meant for you yet, because the game doesn't really block your path of progression. This can be both a positive and a negative. The game can be extraordinarily vague, where you move on to an area that seems correct, only to find out later on (after much searching the discussion boards and guides) that you should have finished part of another quest before you can progress in the one you had been trying to complete.Negatives:- Vague/Unclear Quest Progression. This is a game I went into knowing full well what I was getting into. The early access reviews mentioned it was old school and had no hand holding. But oh MY, can this game get frustrating. From the beginning, I have searched for secret areas, read all books, consulted my journal and map, etc. etc. because I knew what others had said about its difficulty. With that said, 20+ hours of my tracked gameplay has been due to backtracking, buying back items from merchants that I had no indication through dialogue or journal that I would need later, or running halfway across maps because I realized that since one quest was ""technically"" supposed to be completed before another, I needed to go back. I have never played a game that infuriated me as much as this one has in terms of not being able to progress because something miniscule was not completed/kept in my inventory/spoken clearly, etc.- Aiming in Battles. This is a turn-based RPG, so while you aim your spells/arrows/etc. in battle, your enemies stay in place. HOWEVER, enemies will move/bow/scratch their heads/pick their noses in battle, and when they do, you will find that sometimes if you left-click to attack at JUST the wrong moment, the enemy will move out of your click and your character will either shoot stupidly in the air beside the enemy's head OR walk all the way behind the enemy. I have lost battles over this one flaw, and this was not a one-time thing. This happened quite a few times, and it can screw up your strategy in moments.- Starting Difficulty. This isn't a negative, per se, but the difficulty in the beginning is much higher than the rest of the game, so it will be a big turn off for some newcomers. Enemies do not respawn, and as you start off in one area, you have to branch out, and all of your options are groups of enemies that are two levels above you, with groups larger than yours.- Broken Quests. There are a few quests in the game that you will be unable to complete. I have three sitting in my journal right now, forever in limbo. Sometimes quests or the characters involve will overlap, and if you decide to try to complete one quest before another, you may render the previous quest forever incomplete (won't give an example due to spoilers). Summary: This is a great game, no doubt. I have to say that this will probably be the first Divinity game that I will not replay, however. This is a game that can be great fun, but also greatly frustrating. It is a game expansive and challenging enough to really give you a sense of pride in progressing in, but at the same time, it is not a game you beat. It feels like this game beats YOU. I recommend this game to the fans of the most hardcore of RPGs, particularly the old school RPGs, who have a ton of time to sink into a game that requires you to pay attention to every detail. This game is NOT a game you can just pick up and jump into and out of. Missing or forgetting a detail can be severely punishing to both your progression and your patience, so be prepared to ""favorite"" a guide. ;)			"

												D:OS is awesome. Easily a GOTY contender for 2014.Oh, there are a host of problems with it. Obscure quests. The more-than-occasional pixel hunt. A rather confusing main story that seems to take foreverto get started. A difficulty curve that can jump from time to time, leading to frustration. A lack of direction as to where you should go. In short, a host of problems with the role playing part.Yet all this is overshadowed by the best turn-based combat ever to appear in a RPG. This is the meat of the game and it's sooooo tasty. There are many options on how to approach a battle and you can use environmental barrels (water, oil, poison) to shape the battlefield. Every encounter is a puzzle and every one is fun. I had a wonderful time playing it and recommend it to any fan of TBS combat.			"

												Co-op is very fun, the storyline keeps you engaged and all the side quests and characters are great. Character customisation is good, and you can play dual-class, which allows for a bit more freedom when designing your character. Almost finished with the game and I've thoroughly enjoyed this gameplay, the only thing that's a bit disappointing is that once you've reached max level with your character, the loot you find at the later stages of the game is a little bit underwhelming and of not much use, so opening chests isn't as exciting anymore! Also some issues with connecting with my friend in co-op at times, but we were able to work around it. Overall, I really like this game, will give Enhanced edition a go next !			"

												Alright, so about 60-70 hours after starting my cooperative adventure with a friend, and completing the game, I think it is appropriate that I write my review of Divinity: Original Sin. Some quick context, we played the game with double lone wolf characters(A fighter and a wizard) on medium difficulty. Your experience with combat balance may vary.First, let me start off by saying that this game is fun... Like REALLY fun. However, this is less of a game, and more of an experience. Let me explain what I mean by that. First of all, the combat is incredibly enjoyable. Every encounter feels hand crafted to give players a new strategic scenario almost every time. This was a real draw of the game for the friend I was playing with. As he put it, ""it was one of the few games that actually makes a wizard feel like a wizard.""The draw for me however, was the world itself. I was in awe at this game's sense of wonder, while still remaining light hearted and humorous at times. It brought me back to childhood memories such as reading ""The Hobbit"" for the very first time. As the game went on, things got dark... Like really dark. It was probably my own fault for being so caught up in the game world, but I felt physically sick at times. This gave me a real drive to find the evil, and destroy it (trying not to be too spoilery).I've seen a lot of people complain about the endless dialogue in this game, and I can understand that, but I think it depends on what you are looking for coming into this game. I adored all of the dialogue, and being able to interact with this fantasy world that truly felt alive. Luckily, for my friend that didn't enjoy that all that much was able to find entertainment out of the combat encounters, and since we were playing on coop, I could do all of the dialogue work for him.Now, lets talk problems with the game. First of all, the game still feels like it needs to be worked on (IE missing content, and bugs). The good news about that is... It's still being worked on. Bugs and imbalances that I've found one day, I found were patched the next.A couple of the puzzles in the game straight up feel unfair. I feel no guilt in having to have looked up a couple answers online, as some of them were simply frusterating for reasons that could have been otherwise avoided.There are a few problems with clarity. I know this is suppose to be a hard-core game, not for those with a casual approach, but some things are just tedious, not challenging, nor do they help engage you with the world. The biggest example of this is inventory management. A simple fix would be to have a separate tab, similar to the keys tab, for ALL quest items. That way you aren't having to manage important quest items with loot, and you don't accidently sell any of those quest items. Even the sidequest items.Something else I should touch on is the editor. This thing brings a ton of extra value to Divinity. Whether you're a modder yourself, or you just want to play someone elses adventure. There are still some problems with it, but the development team has been supporting it quite strongly from what I've seen so far.Conclusion/tl;dr:This is all from my own experience and perspective.Number scores are pointless.I would recommend this game.

												A great game for anyone that grew up playing Baldur's Gate, with a focus on true turn based combat. 60 hours in and the combat for the game still has not grow stale and still has its challenging moments.  One of the best RPGs to come out in years, highly reccomend!			"

												Divinity: Original Sin, while being seemingly forgotten about following the very successful Kickstarter campaign and initial hype, lives up to every expectation now that the game is released.  A deep and meaningful storyline, gorgeous graphics and highly detailed/varied environments, clean and uncluttered UI, incredibly unforgiving and challenging yet enjoyable turn-based combat, characters that you actually care about, deep character customization, plenty of humor, an expansive gameworld, well thought out lore, numerous bosses (large and small) and a large amount of different units and enemies, traditional RPG systems....must I continue? D:OS is a memorable experience that has a very well-designed co-op that allows for drop-ins, easy transfers of inventory, and Steamworks support.  They have created a developer kit to allow for custom campaigns and content, so there is a large potential for what could be endless content.  The storyline and content in the vanilla game is very lengthy and varied itself, all while managing to avoid falling victim to mundane quests and repetitive actions.  Excellent sound design, great art style, and an enjoyable soundtrack just make the game even easier to play.  Whether playing by yourself or with a friend, D:OS is sure to provide you with many dozens of hours of enjoyment.  Highly recommend at full retail price and I believe the game has serious potential to get Game of the Year.			"

												This game is splendificously marvellicious.Let me describe this game in a single word:  solid.  Combat, story, writing, movement, graphics, interface, every single aspect of this game is just so incredibly solid and well done, and you just keep wanting to play until the crack of dawn and/or until your eyeballs crystallize.  The story and world is just so rich and oozing with character.One minor criticism is sometimes it can be hard to know where to go, and sometimes the quest journal is a bit messy.  I stayed around in the second area for the longest time, not understanding that I wasn't supposed to really quest there yet.  Funny enough, that actually made the game more difficult, and again more enjoyable, so it ended up working out in the end.Also, never reject any quests in the game (unless they ask you to kill allies).  For example, don't reject the fabulous five, or the guy in the second area's town.  You just end up missing out on good stuff regardless of what they want you to do.Don't go with ""lone wolf"" at first if you can avoid it, get companions from the first town and play the game normally.  Also, avoid trying to min/max too hard.  Wait until your second playthrough if you want to really min/max and abuse the game, and play it on hard.			"

												This game kicks ♥♥♥.  It was definitely difficult to figure out where to get started.  My friend and I died quite a few times just testing out which enemies we could even survivie against in the early stages.  But it has already beens do rewarding.  Once the momentum started rolling we could hardly stop playing.  Game is a ton of fun and the co-op aspect just puts it over the top.  Thus far this game has provided me with nothing short of thrilling turn based combat.My main gripe so far: inconsistent multiplayer connecting.  Once it gets started it is fine, but my friend and I are baffled as to why the connection fails so often.  We put hours into figuring this out and... it still fails *all* the god damned time.  I'm not bad with his stuff: I have dealt with many convoluted and broken multiplayer systems; I have hosted my own servers for games. The online multiplayer struggles are a black eye on what has otherwise been, as I said above, an awesome rpg experience.Anyway, still highly recommend it but I hope that the devs get these connection issues sorted.

												And so it have now been released. This game is awesome. Yes there is not much more to say about this game. Its a throw back to older rpg's with a deep character creation, skill system, stats and conversation system.The quests are open ended and you can get to the end of the game even if you kill every single npc in the game. You can also find secrets and areas that you will only find or find hints for if you have certain skills. Not only that there is a editor released, a very powerful one. Make your own campaigns, edit the main one, add your own models and much more!So should you buy this?Yes! If you play a lot of rpg's and you enjoy them, then you are required to own this.			"

												TL;DR An enjoyable romp through isometric RPG nostalgia that is slightly marred by bugs and a slight lack of polish. 8.5/10 would endorse its purchase.For those of us who grew up with the isometric RPG greats, it was heartbreaking to see the genre remain unrepresented and aging as the 2000's crept on. As the developers of these games were slowly cannibalized by triple A studios, hopes for long awaited sequels were seemingly dashed and the genre seemed to only exist in blips on the emerging indie scene. And then suddenly, there was crowd funding. Larian studios had a vision, they knew what they wanted to accomplish. They wanted to bring the glory days back, and build something amazing. Divinity: Original Sin might be one of the best and most polished examples of Kickstarter done right. Instantly with character creation the game evokes that marvelous feeling of choice that has been missing from the more popular RPG's of the current generations. I'll be the first to admit that I probably started 6-7 new games, trying out various combinations and watching a few of them fail miserably, happily. Finally, an RPG that reunites me with a long lost love of mine, the potential to fail horrifically. So badly even, that you could waste hours of your time and not be able to pass various challenges the game throws at you due to negligent character creation. As far as the story goes, I wasn't particularly moved nor was it very novel. However, it did progress well and kept the ball rolling. I do think that the challenge of the game and the thrill of exploration will push you to continuing the game more than the main storyline will. This game is filled with little, tantalizing secrets and interesting sidequests. Some events occured during sidequests that I never would have expected nor experienced in any other RPG. Combat is sufficient, but by no means is it fantastic. The most interesting aspect of it is how much it utilizes the environment. Some seemingly one-sided fights can be overcome with setting up explosive barrels, laying traps or creating barracades. Once again choice and planning are showing through as a main development philosophy. There were things that annoyed me. Enemies sometimes glitch out, simply standing still doing nothing even though there is nothing impeding them. Strangely it can be difficult to click on some enemies, making your character waste precious AP in the early game by moving when you wanted to attack or caste a spell. This can be especially annoying when you completely whiff a spell or god forbid send your mage to his/her death by moving them into a large group of enemies. Luckily, the game allows you to quicksave AT ANY CONCIEVABLE POINT, however a bit of polish could have done wonders. Towards the end of the game, combat becomes a tiring unengaging affair. After about 50 hours or so, you've seen every possible engagement and know how to successfully handle all of it.I mentioned that a bit of polish could have done wonders, and I think that leaks into many parts of the game. The UI is useable but by no means fantastic. Crafting is annoying and not particularly engaging. At the time of this little review, the game liked to crash during combat and cutscenes every now and again (Thank god for that quick save button).At the end of the day, I sank 80 hours into this game. I enjoyed it thoroughly and even though this copy of mine was a gift, I would not regret purchasing it. Its charm and playability overcame its bugs and quick development. I hope we see more like this from Larian in the future and I hope other devs take note on how successful a game like Divinity: Original Sin can be.			"

												Dialog and exploration is the game strong point. Unfortunately at present the mix between text dialog and voice dialog is terribly confusing because they overlap too many times and too quickly so you kinda miss stuff especialy if you like to take your time as in an RPG and enjoy the character interactions.As per the turn-based combat, is realy good tbh. Very intuitive to visualy and quickly understand how many action points you still have until you ""pass"" and it's realy not overly complicated nor terribly slow/tactical. Animations in combat are realy flashy so that helps a little for it not being boring or slow.Coop is a diferent world that what we are used to see. If you play with a friend the dialog options (and decisions) are shared by both and both can disagree and that leads to truly fun discussions. I just love making my wife mad by just disagreeing with everything she wants in-game, it's priceless.About the game uniqueness, i believe it's the ""old school"" vibe of RPGs, and especialy the feeling that you are not being ""led"" and ""hand-hold"" by the game. When you discover something or acomplish something cool, you feel proud because you were smart enough to do that on your own and don't feel you were pushed into it. Also the freedom to do whatever you want in choices and still be able to progress in the game. You can kill a quest giver you don't like because you have the ""urge"" to do it, and it's fine most of the time you can get a similar quest in a diferent way later on.It's a game that chalenges you to do what you feel it's interesting. It doesnt scream at you to do stuff the way the developers wanted because they think its the proper way to do it, it doesnt punish you too much if you want to experiment alone. It has that old school vibe in a time that games were suposed to be about player interaction, and not so much as watching a movie on trails.Can't explain much better. If you like 10 hour action packed games that look like a movie, don't play this. If you like a chalenging and rewarding game that doesn't tell you everytime what you ""should be doing"" this is worth it.I would wait a couple days for a patch tough, the dialog is too confusing atm.

												[NOTE: Think carefully before buying this game if you're thinking it'll be like Path of Exile or Diablo. Because it's not, and the difference between those types of games and this one is very important.]As you read this, keep in mind that I'm not far into the game at the time of writing. I spent some hours in game during Early Access, but waited to do this review until release to experience it in a more complete state, so these are more my initial impressions than a proper review and are subject to change at a later date (all alterations will be noted).First off, as the note above says, this game is not to be confused with something like Diablo, Torchlight or Path of Exile. While those are all fine games in their own right (yes, even Diablo 3), they are also ARPGs, which put you in real-time combat that more often than not comes down to spamming AOE skills to kill hordes of enemies. And that's fine, I love those games, too because they're good for quick co-op play. This game, however, being turn-based, places more emphesis on careful planning and development becasue rushing in to a fight and just relying on basic attacks will get you (and your co-op partner if you have one) killed in no time flat. So if you want a game you can dive into and mow through hordes of enemies, this isn't the game for you.One key aspect of this game that will turn most people off is that it doesn't hold you hand. Yes, you can change the difficulty of the game, but thge UI itself doesn't have some features that other RPGs seems to think players need. There's no quest tracker, only a quest log that is just a list of what you've accomplished so far along a quest line (no hints). There's no quest markers on the map or compass, so you're on you own when it comes to finding where to go and what to do next (. There's no indicators on NPCs to say who has quests for you, and talking to NPCs is an actual dialog instead of a one-sided stream of text. And as far as a tutorial goes? Yeah, it's a quick dungeon that just tells you how to do a few things in the game, leaving you to learn everything else as you go. And you have to wonder, why did we need all of that stuff anyway? Half the fun of old RPGs like Ultima was in wandering around, finding out things for yourself and possibly getting killed because you wandered into a really high level area and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ something off (I did that a lot. It was fun).Control wise, this game plays like you'd expect a CRPG to play, and you quickly get used to using WASD to move the camera. However I wish the camera rotation was 360 by default as some of the angles make it hard to see things. You can switch to a ""Tactical"" view that'll highlight your party and enemies, switching you to a more top-down perspective, which I like as it can make planning easier during solo games.Navigating the character panel can seem a bit confusing, since the same window handles stats, inventory and equipment. But it only appears that way. Once you spend a moment to look it over and know what is where, it actualy makes more sense than having seperate windows. Although Skills are in a seperate window, but you only get new ones by reading expensive Skill Books (not leveling) so this seperation makes sense.EDIT #1: I've spent a good 2-3 hours wandering around the first town trying to solve a murder, earned an achievement that I didn't notice until after I quit the game, and I still ahve no idea who I'm suposed to talk to or arrest. I am literilly just doing random crap in the hopes that it works. In the process I have gained 6 quests, died in combat (for stealing) 3 times, died buy a massive booby-trap once, and had to retrace a good portion of my progress because I forgot to save before I got killed by guards... Best. Game. EVER.EDIT #2: I'm now close to 20 hours into the game. There have been many deaths, several rage quits, a few instances of pleading ""Help!"" on the forums and a brief span of time in which I was forced to lower the difficulty in order to progress (shocking, I know). In that time I have learned several things. 1st; SAVE. Do it often. 2nd; Some boss encounters will aggrivate you to no end, so when all else fails, run... seriously, turn and run like a girl with her panties on fire. 3rd; There are some quests that seem as if their just there to troll you. And understand that all this progress and I'm *STILL* not done with all the quests in the beginning town and surrounding area. This is going to be a 100+ hour game for me and my OCD brain.EDIT #3: There are moments in this game where it pulls a Gandalf and all but screams ""You shall not pass!"" Going along a quest line, when the highest level of the last enemy you faced was 9 (the same level as you) and suddenly it jumped to 15? That's a BIG hint from the gmae, telling you to go do something else, first.			"

												This is a perfect example of game made possible by Kickstarter and Early Access programs. Not bound by publisher desire to split everything into DLCs and make everything more causal.This is a classic CRPG with a turn-based combat. And when I say CRPG - I mean it.Don't like reading? This game is probably not for you - there are tons of amazing dialogues (but they do require a lot of reading).Don't like hard games? This game is probably not for yo - combat is very hard, but fair. Be ready to use your environment, combine spells and act smart. Oh, yeah, and to save often.Add incredibly gorgeous looking engine, pretty nice soundtrack, high quality animations, nearly bug free experience (thanks to Early Access) and you'll get Divinity: Original Sin.More info in the video:

								Briliant, intriguing and immersive: I am a first generation gamer, started with pong in the 70's and moved on to Atari, Commodor, Nintendo and so on... I have noticed through out the years that the games have become easier and easier to play, just for the sake of profit making, but this game made me feel intelligent once again. The game was taking my intelectual needs as a veteran player very seriousely. It was very nostalgic of an era when you felt that playing a game was actually worth your time ( Like the Legend of Zelda and Shadowrun on super Nintendo). After many years of putting down my joystick, once again i experienced sleepless nights, houres of full concentration flying by in a breath, using every bit of my Neurons that were giving me ""Nerdgasms"" one after another. ( Though the wife and kid are not very happy about it...) This game is made by true gamers in heart and soule, for gamers with a lot of heart and soule. The playability is just excellent and worth every peny that you spend on it.			"

								Divinity: Original Sin is an exciting RPG the brings story writing to those passionate about RPG games. It doesn't depend on voice acting, expensive CGI cutscenes and carefully tailored ""streamlined"" (read: dumbed down for higher mass appeal) gameplay.The game offers refreshing mechanics, deep storylines, and intriguing character customization. During almost the whole gameplay you have 5-10 different quests to take on. It's up to you when you prefer talking to a bunch of people or dive into a battle headfirst.Speaking of battles! Tactics do matter big time. The creators put effort in making clashes with the enemy different. Rain, oil filled barrels, a pesky priest resurrecting the fallen foes from an (almost) perfectly defended spot push you to situations where you carefully need to plan your every step. (If you like to play on hard, as I do.)At this point the interface, although functional, could use a few shortcuts. Getting a grip on your inventory can be problematic a few hours in. Using skills on items by someone (identify, repair) are currently a chore. I can recommend this game to any RPG enthusiast, who likes the general feel and effort put in old school games, but also wants to see updated graphics, and improved gameplay mechanics.			"

												AMAZING game!!!Wasteland 2 made 3 MILLION on Kickstarter and the graphics and gameplay come NO WHERE NEAR this game... and Divinity Original Sin made less than 1 million!inxile really took most of their backers for a ride....meaning they either spent the LEAST amount of money that they could on thier game (thus producing a fairly inferior product) or they just didnt have the skill to back up their project.Check Youtube review and compare the two games, its night and day.I played Wastland 2 and while it certainkly felt like Fallout....it felt like Fallout.....meaning I felt like I was playing a game from the 90s.Divinity Original Sin is not only a modern game with AMAZING graphics, story and gameplay, but it is true the golden age of video games and provides EXCELLENT gameplay mechanics that (IMO) exceed Baldur's Gate.I paid full price for this game and not one minute did I feel cheated.

								It's bloody amazing. Yeah sure it's an early access and a lot of the features are still missing. (I wish it had more of the co-op dialogues implemented) but still insanely fun to play with a friend. The combat system is really fun and well polished, ambush attacks combo skills everything lines up for a game that can involve a lot of planning and thinking your moves. While the out of combat quests and events are also different and fun, exploring dungeons and doing some detective work all while stealing some chick's dirty undies... (To be honest I'd rather steal her husbands...) And oh God is the dialogue fun and witty.I highly recomend picking up this game and playing it with a friend who's personality is different than yours. I enjoy being the theiving evil yet oddly religious asshat in games, always pushing bad decisions on friends :PHonestly. Pick this game up, pick it up for a friend and have a blast (And a lot of laughs together as well). It's only going to get better.			"

								I can't not even begin to describe how much you need to play this game.  If you are a D&D-er, you need this game.  If you are a tabletop player of any kind, you need this game.  If you are an RPG fan, you need this game.  If you are a tactical thinker, you need this game.  If you are a level designer, you need this game just for the toolkit.  Bottom line, if you don't have Divint: Original Sin, do you even game?As you can tell, I love Divinity.  It's a sort of a throwback to the Baulder's Gate type of game, and it is brilliantly executed.  The environments are amazing.  The monsters are well done.  The dialog is engaging and meaningful.  Choices matter.  All good.  But, this wouldn't be a proper review without some honest critiques of how it could be improved.First negative, class balance.  This was a probably early one in the beta, but it's better now the day before launch.  It's still not completely fixed, though.  Intelligence based builds still rule in terms of raw, content-clearing power.  But, the game is still more fun with a diverse group make up.  It's not a big issue, but it's one the min/maxer may pick up on pretty quickly.Second negative, limit on co-op players.  You can only play co-op with two players.  The reasons are understandable, and it's largely forgivable given that more players are supported for mod content.  But, after playing though 8 hours of the story with a friend yesterday, I can't help but feel that this whole experience would just be phenomenal with a full group of 4-6 people.  Just the shenanigans with two were hilarious.  I think of the eight hours I might have spent 3 not on fire, not being melted by steam clouds, or not being shocked to death by jumping lightning in the rain.  Friendly fire is real, and watching a completely new player learn the system while playing a wizard was gloriously painful.  I long so much to have that same experience with more people, more wayward spells, more poorly conceived plans, more failures, more accidental explosions, all around more WTF.Lastly, the crime system.  Let me just say that even a ""good"" character is probably going to resort to a degree of thievery to fill their purse.  It only makes sense.  It's hard to descibe why this is the case.  Much of it has to do with a somewhat low drop rate for your needed skill books as you progress and the very readily available goods that can pilfered with impunity.  Once you finally come across that NPC who has your skill books you need, every painting in the room will start to look like... well... yours.  That's not a bad thing.  Temptation is a good mechanic in these sorts of games.  But, in the first town alone, I racked up well over fifteen thousand gold just from yanking up whatever I could carry when no one was looking.  We could probably use a few more guard patrols to make having a rogue more necessary (needing to pick locks quickly instead of just having time to bash them to pieces).Overall, I'm a solid 9.5/10 on this game.  The issues that are there are minor (except the co-op player limit which is in fact raised for mods).  You owe it to yourself to play this game.  Don't be turned off by words like ""turn-based.""

Early Access Review
								I can't not even begin to describe how much you need to play this game.  If you are a D&D-er, you need this game.  If you are a tabletop player of any kind, you need this game.  If you are an RPG fan, you need this game.  If you are a tactical thinker, you need this game.  If you are a level designer, you need this game just for the toolkit.  Bottom line, if you don't have Divint: Original Sin, do you even game?As you can tell, I love Divinity.  It's a sort of a throwback to the Baulder's Gate type of game, and it is brilliantly executed.  The environments are amazing.  The monsters are well done.  The dialog is engaging and meaningful.  Choices matter.  All good.  But, this wouldn't be a proper review without some honest critiques of how it could be improved.First negative, class balance.  This was a probably early one in the beta, but it's better now the day before launch.  It's still not completely fixed, though.  Intelligence based builds still rule in terms of raw, content-clearing power.  But, the game is still more fun with a diverse group make up.  It's not a big issue, but it's one the min/maxer may pick up on pretty quickly.Second negative, limit on co-op players.  You can only play co-op with two players.  The reasons are understandable, and it's largely forgivable given that more players are supported for mod content.  But, after playing though 8 hours of the story with a friend yesterday, I can't help but feel that this whole experience would just be phenomenal with a full group of 4-6 people.  Just the shenanigans with two were hilarious.  I think of the eight hours I might have spent 3 not on fire, not being melted by steam clouds, or not being shocked to death by jumping lightning in the rain.  Friendly fire is real, and watching a completely new player learn the system while playing a wizard was gloriously painful.  I long so much to have that same experience with more people, more wayward spells, more poorly conceived plans, more failures, more accidental explosions, all around more WTF.Lastly, the crime system.  Let me just say that even a ""good"" character is probably going to resort to a degree of thievery to fill their purse.  It only makes sense.  It's hard to descibe why this is the case.  Much of it has to do with a somewhat low drop rate for your needed skill books as you progress and the very readily available goods that can pilfered with impunity.  Once you finally come across that NPC who has your skill books you need, every painting in the room will start to look like... well... yours.  That's not a bad thing.  Temptation is a good mechanic in these sorts of games.  But, in the first town alone, I racked up well over fifteen thousand gold just from yanking up whatever I could carry when no one was looking.  We could probably use a few more guard patrols to make having a rogue more necessary (needing to pick locks quickly instead of just having time to bash them to pieces).Overall, I'm a solid 9.5/10 on this game.  The issues that are there are minor (except the co-op player limit which is in fact raised for mods).  You owe it to yourself to play this game.  Don't be turned off by words like ""turn-based.""

												Quick Impressions (3 hours in):This game is incredibly polished compared to most other games I've played recently.  It was developed on Kickstarter and the extra time and support the fan base's commitment to the developers has been Well rewarded with this creation.I've played through the tutorial 'dungeon' and starting area, and got a pretty good feel for the mechanics, combat, and overall feel of the game.  If this game is as large as I've read it is, and if the detail and entertainment value hold up as highly as the first few hours have, this is going to be an instant classic.Let's start off with what I liked most:     Graphics.   I have a pretty powerful pc, but have still had a few hitches on some recent games.  Not a single one on D:OS.  With the graphics cranked up to ultra the game is absolutely beautiful.  With spell effects and weather effects going off, everything runs smooth as silk, not a single stutter or slowdown.  The level of detail is very good, terrain, textures, animation, all excellent.  And the Attention to detail is also obvious.  You'll see exactly what I mean the first time you attempt to 'sneak' with one of your characters, LOL.Sound.  Captivating musical score, excellent voice acting that actually sounds professionally produced and directed!   I've read elsewhere that not all interactions are voice-acted, but given how large a game this promises to be, I'm willing to forgive that.   The environmental ambient sounds add well to immersion.  Combat sounds are also good; solid and realistic.Combat.  This is turn-based and right up my alley.  I've always preferred using tactics during combat and enjoy having the freedom to plan out my moves, rather than engaging in a mindless clickfest or spamming hotkeys until they cooldown.  While games like Diablo and Path of Exile have their merits,  it's refresing to discover that true turn based tactical combat models are still alive and kicking.Character Development.  There are more classes to choose from starting out than most other rpgs offer, and one quickly discovers that these are really just starting templates,  as you have the option to fully customize any character into exactly the model you desire.  Some combinations will work better than others and discovering these can be a lot of fun.  In any case, many recent rpgs (especially mmos) have fallen into the trap of trying to 'balance' every character class, which only results in classes that are merely clones with minor asthetical differences.Inventory and Crafting.  It's clear even from the start that there will be a Ton of options and items to collect and create while one travels through this game.  And it's also quite refreshing to play a game that doesn't throw too much 'uber' at you at once.   I compare this to Diablo 3, a game I really do enjoy, but whose loot system still feels broken and overpowered well after the lauded expansion.And a few things I Did find fault with:The User Interface is good for the most part, pretty standard fare, as you can see from the screenshots on the store page.  Menus and popups aren't difficult to navigate, but I did have some trouble with inventory management.  Nothing severe, just some issues with moving items from one character to another, finding particular books and recipes, that sort of thing.  It may just take some getting used to, but I was hoping for something a little more streamlined.Camera controls:  Movement is acceptable, being basically a left click to move the selected character.   My main complaint is with the camera rotation.  Unless I'm missing something, it appears that the player is locked into a 90 degree arc that limits the actual ability to 'look around'.  The camera will only shift from Northwest to Northeast.  With occlusion in the dungeons and behind walls, this gets to be a little annoying.  Occluding terrain will turn transparent to show your your characters but objects and interactible characters can still be hidden sometimes until you move to and rotate the camera just right.  I have to wonder why they didn't just go with 360 rotation..Those minor concerns aside, I still Highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys CRPGs.  The pluses far outweigh the negatives and the price is absolutely right ($40 is a Bargain for a quality game these days!).  If you'd like to engage in some good old school fantasy roleplaying that channels the pen & paper spirit of Baldur's Gate, mixes in some epic gameplay ala Diablo 3 and tops it all off with the high level tactical combat of XCOM and Jagged Alliance, do yourself a favor and buy this game.

												I read the reviews for this game, I watched the videos.And I anticipated it very strongly.New elemental systems! ""Why is something in the game? Because the player can do something with it!"" Such promise, such a fresh approach. Wow.But now that I've played it...the battles are tough, which is fine, but if you don't happen to have an element in your party then you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck if you hope to make a fight possible. Fighting some hellhounds? Better have lots of water spells handy, didn't bring some water spells because nobody told you that you should have some on character creation? Well now you die, a lot. Have fun.Why is something in the game? Because the player CAN do something with it, but with gold so plentiful, why would you bother crafting a damn thing? Answer: you wouldn't. Vendor trash EVERYWHERE.The quests were spruiked as having huge amounts of freedom in how you complete them. This isn't true. They are very linear, go here, take this object, talk to that person, kill this critter. Try to do any of that out of order? Game doesn't respond. You have to go through the motions ""in whichever way you want"".The game as a whole seems to be a one-trick pony. Yeah the elemental stuff is neat. It gets pretty repetitive though and the slow level progression and tough fights make it very frustrating if you happen to lose one and have to go back half an hour to the latest save (if you forgot to quicksave).

												Remember when Dragon Age: Origins was touted as the heir to the CRPG? Well, Divinity: Original Sin is much, much more deserving of that title. Not to besmirch Dragon Age: Origins, a wonderful game in its own right, but Divinity is more than a homage to the classics reborn for today's gamers. It's the classic reborn, not limited by a console, not limited by a publisher, not limited at all. This is hardcore CRPG full stop. Do you long for a return to Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, or the original Fallout games? Divinity: Original Sin is what you have been waiting for. Truly a new classic, I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												Even in this early alpha state, the game sets itself apart in more ways than I can go into here.  There is a sense of freedom in this game that is thoroughly refreshing.  It is clear that Larian Studios has put a great deal of thought, time and effort into this already.  It's easy to get drawn in to what you are doing because the environment reacts accordingly.  You are free to develop your character outside of class boundaries.  You are encouraged to develop the characters individually.  The player isn't forced to play the characters as friends.  They can argue and have disputes, intimidate, charm and convince one another.  This I found to be particularly appealing, and it went a long way towards drawing me in.  For the most part, the dialog choices aren't your standard Good, Neutral and Bad either, which is also nice.  There is no moral compass other than the one you bring.  The fact that Larian has made a genuine effort to address these possibilities speaks volumes to the direction and depth they're bringing to the title.Larian has taken that same approach with the players’ interaction with the environment.  The player isn't in a static environment and has a level of interaction with the environment that is unparalled in games of this type.  This sense of freedom, of ‘what can/should/would I do?’ is throughout all aspects of the game, from the pacing to the crafting system and all of the other things I have yet to try.  It does a great job of keeping you curious, entertained and occupied because there is very little in this game that is linear or forced upon the player.  I find it easy to get drawn into the world they are building because I can do things in the time and manner of my choosing.  With what they’ve got going on with the character development, the environment, the crafting, the magic system, the audio, and everything else Larian has demonstrated a fantastic creative spirit and attention to detail.I still stand by everything I've stated above.  This game is amazing.			"

Early Access Review
								***Alpha Impressions***I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of RPGs and/or turn based games. It is certainly very rough around the edges but there is ALOT of promise here. I have played a little bit of single player and ALOT of co-op. Very fun co-op. A few things that do bug me but im sure will be fixed later concerning co-op. The player hosting the game will have control over all of the henchmen you get. This can make for a little boredom for the 2nd player during battles. Keep that in mind. Also if you are having issues figuring out how to start co-op.....Click join and then pick your friend on the steam overlay and join game. Make sure to use some sort of communication outside of the game as there is NONE in the game at all. I hope they add some sort of voice/text chat in the game at some point. Also you will be joining someone else's game so be sure to discuss with them what type of character you want so that they can premake them for you!Graphics are pretty good. Sound is good when its working properly. Sometimes it cuts in and out and the music can get a little loud at times even with it turned down. Play control is a little slow and a tad sloppy but that is to be expected during an alpha. There are some balancing issues for sure. Mages seem way overpowered right now. Ranger is not very good at all IMO. You do virtually no damage. I have played alot of hours as a ranger and have started leaning towards spellcasting even with my ranger!Have had a few minor glitches but overall this is very playable. I have very high hopes for this game. "

												When I first heard of this game, I thought nothing could evoke that classic D&D feeling in gaming ever again. I've always disliked how games slowly but surely evolved to hold your hand and limit the amount of thought required to overcome challenges or problems. This game, however, is a refreshing take on figure it the **** out yourself RPG's of yore. The tutorial is a bare-bones, but sufficient . Crafting is trial and error, not to mention loads of fun. Combat feels like a tabletop RPG, similar to Fallout 2 or D&D. And finally, the weakest point is the story, but even then it holds it's own. On top of all that, it's designed to be modded... I can't wait to see some D&D modules show up to play!TLDR?BUY THIS GAME AND FIND SOMEONE TO PLAY WITH, IT'S THE SHIZZLE.9/10			"

												Including offline time at this point i've put in about 10 hours towards the game. At first I was a little hesitant, as it wasn't what I had expected and it seemed super slow almost to the point of being turned off. But I stuck it out and i'm really glad that I did...Negative first. Foremost I must say that this is truly the only negative thing that I have to say at all. I want more information on character building BEFORE I make my character. I was not originally aware that you must save skill points to further upgrade those skills later - this was a major mistake and i was forced to reset my game so as not to of wasted any skill points nonchalantly. Secondly, I think more emphasis should be put on how important it is to make your party varied in the elemental arts as well as the NEED for a ranged character. So far the best group i've come up with is a mage and a thief/mage (splitting elemental types between them), an archer and a high defense, high constituition knight of sorts. Variety in your skills is MANDO! And make your characters masters of ONE or TWO set of skills. Do not make jack of all trades - it will weaken your part as a whole.COMBAT:The turn based combat delivered on a high level and surpassed the high standards that I had for it. I truly enjoy ALL aspects of combat from ranged skills and melee / rogue type abilities to the more jaw dropping elemental magics that intertwine with the local environment. For example, I electrocuted an Orc Shaman while he was standing in a puddle. It just so happens that his two body guards were standing in the same puddle. BAM! All three instantly damaged and shocked, losing a turn. Not to mention being able to cast water spells near a teammate to do damage to your enemies but put out the flames burning your partners shoulders to a crisp.WORLD:I haven't explored much yet but everything that I've seen so far has been put together very well. From item placement and decorations to broad scale placement of dungeons, changing weather and variety of landscapes.NPCS:I normally skip through that NPC's say in other games. The usual B.S. filler type material that just get irritating - BUT in this game I've become more involved in the storyline and actually enjoy the bickering within the group as well as the diversity in NPC personalities. A lot of effort was put in to making the storyline full with a hint of sassy.SIDE NOTE:I am a bit OCD and a horder in games... and sometimes it ruins games for me because I spend too much time collecting things. Example would be, in Skyrim and Fallout 3. I spent hours upon hours just making sure that 'THIS' chest in my home had only Elvish equipment or Laser weapons. While 'THIS' chest had only Ebony gear or Plasma weapons. I like to seperate things so that I can easily go back and look for things later, plus it becomes a center of pride for myself in game. Odd? Maybe. But this game allows me to feed my sorter desires by giving me back packs and a ""home"" to store my people and valuables. I have backpacks for every different type of item and with the ""pack mule"" talent, its that much easier... I spent 2 out of my 10 hours just organizing and reoganizing. This may not be a selling point for some of you but for those who know what I'm saying... Yup, smile wide. :-D10/10 - So Far.			"

												While the game still has some bugs and rough edges (such as stat-reset in multiplayer upon joining and the animation skeleton showing when using some skills, etc), the game itself more than makes up for it.There is plenty to do and much to explore - it manages to appeal to both modern game lovers and oldschool gamers, combining modern and old into a working package of grand adventure. The gameplay is clever and interesting, allowing for different ways of solving fights and problems. Characters and interaction are especially good and differ from the norm for these kinds of games. The co-op makes for a fun way of playing, while single player allows for being nitpicky to the most minor of details.Combined with a good soundtrack, pleasing art style and some solid story and gameplay, this game is a good addition to anyone's library.

												While the game still has some bugs and rough edges (such as stat-reset in multiplayer upon joining and the animation skeleton showing when using some skills, etc), the game itself more than makes up for it.There is plenty to do and much to explore - it manages to appeal to both modern game lovers and oldschool gamers, combining modern and old into a working package of grand adventure. The gameplay is clever and interesting, allowing for different ways of solving fights and problems. Characters and interaction are especially good and differ from the norm for these kinds of games. The co-op makes for a fun way of playing, while single player allows for being nitpicky to the most minor of details.Combined with a good soundtrack, pleasing art style and some solid story and gameplay, this game is a good addition to anyone's library.

TL;DR: High customization, unlimited actions/consequences, and they best top down RPG combat ever. I really recommend this game. 10/10, would disgust a hot girl by talking about this game.This is the game I've been waiting for since Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights. You are free to do whatever you wish; there are consequences of course so save often! The combat is challenging and intuitive while also managing to be very strategic. I have no idea how they managed to pull it off, but it is seriously perfect. There is plenty to customize and you can set up your characters however you want. They put effort and love into this thing.I think the biggest downside (which some people really like) is the questing system. Yeah it's supposed to be a ""no holding your hand"" style system, but I can never find the single NPC that gave me the quest because they aren't identified anywhere on the map or with anything other than a name that appears if you mouse over them. A bit too much trouble if you ask me, but isn't nearly enough for me to knock the game for it. "

												You know, this game is a touch janky, and it has a steep learning curve, BUT it is ambitious and innovative like no other RPG i've ever met.  Far from perfect, but well worth a play just to see what this kind of game really can offer.  Honestly, it would be really hard to go back to more classic style RPG's (like icewind dale) after this one.  I also heard that the enhanced version fixes most of the jankiness... but the versions are so different that old save games can't be loaded into the new one, sadly...			"

												One of the best RPGs i've played in a long time. When i started playing it i expected it to be Baldur's Gate's spiritual successor, and while that's not really the case it is still a great game in it's own right. And it took me 85 hours to complete one playthrough, that's like... 20 times more than the average game nowdays.The combat system is fenomenal, possibly the best part of the game. Turn-based might sound boring to a lot of people, but if you give it a chance it's surprising how addicting it gets once the battle starts. Think of it like X-COM, but without the clunky movement and horrible RNG. And way more abilities.The main story isn't the game's strongest aspect, and while i wouldn't call it generic i'd say it's quite forgettable. However the world is filled with the usual Larian tongue-in-cheek humor, similar to games like Sacred 2, and many interesting encounters such as talking wells and a romantic sidequest between two cats.The music is great to listen to and doesn't get repetitive. There's a lack of voiced dialogue but this is already taken care of in the Enhanced Edition.My only complaints are the lack of banter between party members and the awful rock-paper-scissors minigame when there are decisions to be made, which works well in co-op but is complete garbage when playing alone.I recommend it to anyone interested in RPGs.

												This is a must buy game for any RPG fan who grew up with the classics like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape Torment. The visuals are above average for a game of this type and the gameplay is even better. I been playing this since the alpha build and the developers stay on top of the updates to keep the game running pretty smooth. The gameplay itself is unlike any rpg I've played before in the way all the character's abilities play off each other for example the Leadership skill bonuses to damage when your in range of your companion/co-op ally to the countless number of the magic abilities that play off each other like fire/water, oil/fire, and water and electricity it is great. The only issue I have with the game is that the developers took out the four player built in co-op because they feared it would be boring which couldn't be futher from the truth. Co-op makes the game even better and being able to have three friends instead of one would of been great. You can use the mods people have made to fix it though so it isn't a huge deal. I highly recommend this game to any person who wants a long and rewarding gameplay experience by yourself or with a friend.			"

												When I first heard of this game, I thought nothing could evoke that classic D&D feeling in gaming ever again. I've always disliked how games slowly but surely evolved to hold your hand and limit the amount of thought required to overcome challenges or problems. This game, however, is a refreshing take on figure it the **** out yourself RPG's of yore. The tutorial is a bare-bones, but sufficient . Crafting is trial and error, not to mention loads of fun. Combat feels like a tabletop RPG, similar to Fallout 2 or D&D. And finally, the weakest point is the story, but even then it holds it's own. On top of all that, it's designed to be modded... I can't wait to see some D&D modules show up to play!TLDR?BUY THIS GAME AND FIND SOMEONE TO PLAY WITH, IT'S THE SHIZZLE.9/10			"

												A marvelous piece of role-based RPGThe Divinity Series had its ups and downs, D:OS is definitly the highest up it ever had. Next to an open-world full of secrets, friends and enemies, there is an excellent gameplay, or as I call it in this case: Open-Gameplay.Why? Because not just you can explore the world just as youself want it and go with quests in your very own style, you can also deal with every enemy, every trap, basically every single step in this world like you want, thanks to the wide and well balanced skill system. It has some troubles at some points, but on that I will go in further in the Divinity: Original SIn Enhanced Edition review, if those difficulties are still existant.But so far: A Must-Have for every RPG fan.

												Just to be helpful for wanna be buyers, the short condensed version:Pro's:- Absolutely Baldur's Gate 2014- Looks pretty good- Challenging at first, later on it is rather easy to beat the game (dunno if this is a pro or a con), but then again very few games remain challeging to the last scene- Immersing, good storyline, believeable world- Very atmospheric- Some good irony and humour here and then- Good choice of gear, talents, perks, abilities- Good difference between combat classes and at the same time great choice to mix classes as you see fit- Baldur's Gate that you can play with your sister! (or friend or whoever)Cons:- Some annoying bugs with quests that did not complete due to the order in which I handled things- You basically start in a huge town and spend the first few hours talking endlessly- A lot of the conversations are rather lengthy and only suited for hardcore lore fanatics- All loot is randomized, but some high level areas drop very low level loot (they might fix this)- And my main annoyance: This game is 1/3 about exploring and talking, only 1/3 about combat, and a bloody 1/3 about puzzles, that would take anyone hours to figure out without help of internet. If you like to be challenged by finding a book here and a switch there, then a sacred bone elsewhere hidden in a bush, then this sure will be your thing. Personally I would like a tad more fighting and a bit less wandering about in search for a key.All in all a good game for people that love isometric fantasy games, it delivers what might be expected of the genre. If long ago you enjoyed Baldur's Gate, then this will suit you well.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin was one of the best surprises I've had in gaming in a long while.I've played a couple of Larian Studios' previous games: Divine Divinity and Beyond Divinity.  I thought both games were okay, but they weren't so great that they made me a fan of Larian Studios.  So when I bought Divinity: Original Sin last month, thanks to a sale, I didn't have particularly high expectations.  I figured the game would be fun enough to tide me over until PIllars of Eternity came out in late March, 2015.Boy was I wrong.  And I'm glad I was wrong.  D:OS turned out to be one of the very best computer roleplaying games I've ever played.  I think so highly of it for several reasons: It has a tremendous amount of content I did not know how long the first playthrough would take.  I figured I'd get at least 50 hours of gameplay out of it.  I ended up taking 216 hours to complete my first playthrough of the game.  This game was fun and fascinating throughout all of those 216 hours.Before Divinity: Original Sin, I had NEVER spent over 120 hours on a single playthrough of a CRPG.  I'm guessing I completed Planescape: Torment - one of my all-time favorite video games - for the first time in under 100 hours.  Similarly, my first playthroughs of open-world RPGs like Elder Scrolls: Morrowind and Fallout 3 took me about 100 hours or so.  Out of nowhere I wind up buying this RPG from a relatively unknown studio, and I end up being engaged by it longer than most other games I've ever played.I think a majority of gamers who play this game will like the amount of content it has to offer.  It has A LOT.  On top of that, it provides the user enough motivation to play it more than once. Some of the best RPG itemization I've ever seen Managing the itemization of a roleplaying game can be ridiculously challenging.  Take for example Fallout: New Vegas.  I enjoyed F:NV quite a bit.  I've clocked in maybe 300 hours of playtime in New Vegas across multiple (attempted) playthroughs.  One of my few complaints about that game was its itemization.  Specifically, it did not take long for me to acquire what I considered to be optimal gear in any of my playthroughs.  I preferred to play the game as a gunslinger who's friendly with the NCR, so for me the best firearms as well as the best armor were found in the Honest Hearts DLC. Once I completed Honest Hearts, I had the guns and the gear I knew I'd be using for the rest of the game.  Everything else I found was sold so I could accumulate a silly amount of caps that I would not spend on anything.Divinity: Original Sin does not have this problem.  In fact, it has some of the best itemization I've ever seen in an RPG or any other video game.The power of all equippable items in the game are influenced by item rarity (Common, Magical, Rare, Legendary, Unique).  At a certain point in the game, you'll want all of your items to be Legendary or Unique.  Item power is also determined by the level of the item.  So a level 15 Legendary item is going to be more powerful than a level 10 Legendary.Because of the way Larian designed their loot, there is the possibility of finding upgrades all the way until the end of the game.  This made every single combat victory, every single hidden treasure chest, and even every single search-able crate a fun experience, because you never know when or where you'll find the weapon, armor, or magical goodie you'll use to beat the game.I really can't rave enough about the desing of Divinity: Original Sin's loot.  Whenever I engage in a discussion about how itemization can be done right, I will use D:OS as one of my top examples.**Too many good things to say, really**This review has already become much longer than I intended.  The bottom line is that Divinity: Original Sin is an excellent game.  If you like RPGs influenced by classics like Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate, if you like fantasy games, or if you enjoy games that mix humor with quality storytelling, then you'll probably enjoy the hell out of this game.

												Absolutely fantastic, game of the year quite easily for me. Hell, I would say that this is easily the game of the new millenium so far, damn near nothing can even remotely come close to how much fun I have had with this game. It might damn near supplant Baldur's Gate 2 as my favorite game of all time.Ok, I've gushed about it enough but I haven't said a damn thing about the game proper. The gameplay is fantastic, this game encourages exploration out the ♥♥♥, there are secrets and easter eggs everywhere. Combat is satisfying and magic is powerful with many great area denial abilities. The story is cliche, but in a good way in my personal opinion. It really feels like a good old fashioned campaign of D&D with great friends (and that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you'll figure out which companion that guy is.) Dialogue and writing overall is quite good with plenty of humor and it never really takes itself seriously. Character customization is pretty strong, at least in the vein of what your character can do, not appearance so much. DivOS follows a classless system that is flexible enough to allow for multiclassing to become every bit as powerful as specializing is, though the game does stumble in the area of having a few non-combat skills be mostly useless in many situations. Lockpicking for instance can be very useless, since every chest has a key which can be found via exploration or pickpocketing, or by simply bashing/blasting the chest itself open if you so desire. Now as to customising your characters appearance there are limited options, but at the very least it is possible to dye your armors a different color so that you can look a specific way, though it can be difficult to find enough dyes to get your clothes set.When it comes to loot, DivOS went the randomly generated route. Randomly generated loot has some pros and cons, just like hand place loot does. The cons of randomly generated loot is that to many the loot never really feels special and will often be useless for people in the party and in DivOS that can certainly be the case at times. However I also submit that randomly generated loot encourages exploration every bit as much as hand placed loot does. People often cite Morrowind as an excellent example of the glories of hand placed loot, with many otherwise useless caves holding a valuable artifact that rewards you for exploring it. While certainly true, it is really only rewarding the first time around, since you will always know that that item is there so you always know to go there to get it. Morrowind veterans, myself included, know of dozens of place to get powerful artifacts with minimal effort, and while fun it can rapidly become a ritual for the game, which can swing either way of being great or terrible. DivOS on the otherhand opts for a more Diablo-esque loot system, with randomized loot that encourages you to seek chests and fight bosses for the best stuff which I find to be quite enjoyabe as well. Ultimately I enjoy both systems provided they are done well, I just felt it was something you need to know.Graphics are perfectly passable and enjoyable, it is always simple to tell what everything is and the art style of the game is quite good with few standout ridiculous armors or weapons, barring most of the robes unfortunately. Sound design is as per usual for all Divinity games absolutely excelent, with an amazing soundtrack made up of  excellently remastered tracks from past divinity games as well as many new tracks. Voice acting, what little there is of it, is enjoyable...at least the first few times you hear it, but it will eventually drive you to hate it, or love it. Personally I have taken to loving some of the idle chatter of some NPCs, and hating others.Game length is quite satisfying as well, sitting at around 60ish hours from what I understand. I personally took significantly longer since I wound up developing a taste for reloading boss fights to do them over and over again, but I can confidently say that of my 200 hours as of writing only 20 of them were spent on the game back when it was in early access, and I enjoyed all 200 of them a great deal, and look forward to adding more via coop and mods. I can go on for a while longer, but for the sake of simply ending this review I'll just say that I can't recommend this game enough, Larian created a true classic with this one.			"

A perfect mixture of challenging combat that scales, intricate puzzles that reward the cautious observer, a deep and involved crafting system, and enough dialogue and branching dialogue paths to remind one of Planescape Torment.

												While people across the web compare D:OS to games like Baldur's Gate and older TES series, there is a series that does a much better comparison job imo - Ultima!It is common for all old RPGs not to lead a player through with objective markers and scalable content, but Ultima games were unique because of the interactivity.Original Sin does a great job expanding this concept; all the ways player can interact with the world around: move things, break things, create things - affects gaming experience, from immersion to actual combat tactics. The overall game design perfectly complements those interactive mechanics, creating a dense and rich gameplay.An absolute must see for every RPG fan, new or old alike, even if only to understand how far the genre deviated for the last decades and what RPGs used to be about.

												Almost all of my hours in this game were spent in the first zone, because I played the game as soon as it showed up with a freind of mine. I enjoyed it a lot, but after a while it began to wear on me. I did the same stuff over, and over, and over again and while I had fun for the most part, it began to bore me with how, sometimes, the game had so few choices.sometimes there's two or three ways to complete things with minimal differences, which don;t make much of an impact on the story. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. You can send a bunch of imps to get killed by a demon and your freind imp just gets a little mad and carries on like nothing happened. Or, you can lose a game of ♥♥♥♥ING ROCK PAPER SCISSORS and have an entire town turn on you.There have been at least ten different occasions where I, having the upper hand in the persuasion arguement, lose despite having DOUBLE the stat of the other person, and then have an entire town attack me. Now, you might say, that if i was to save then that wouldn't be a problem - and sure, but most of the time I didn't even know it was coming!The game encourages save-scumming, trial and error, and luck. You can do the same persuasion twenty times and win none of them in spite of better stats, and then do it again and win without a fuss. It's INCREDIBLY dumb. On top of this, the multiple choices in this game seldom serve to do anything except have an incredibly mild effect on the game, bar one that could SINGLE HANDEDLY LOSE YOU THE GAME in the second act.Exploration isn't an option so much as a necesity. You HAVE to explore, you HAVE to do everything, because otherwise you are going to Die. Again, and again, and again, and again, and again. You won't have the levels, the gear, or the spells to suceed. Save every five seconds, because sometimes a pack fo seven enemies will just appear and kill you from nowhere, without warning, and you'll die. Now, you might think that because you know where they are you can attack THEM first! Nope. They're not in the game until you trigger the event. There's no way to pre=trigger the ambushes. You will just... have to get ambushed.I had to restart the entire game multiple times because i died to something i had no knowledge of, and lost HOURS of progress because i was in town or picking up quests and then stumbled across something far too strong for me. Merchants inventories only change when they level up, so good luck finding what you want in the late game.I still like the game.The characters are pretty alright. Some are kinda interesting, some are forgettable and some are memorable, like the Cheese Vendor who me and my freind quote every now and again. SOme quests are silly and fun, and are a nice little diversion from the main quest (when you actually figure out what the main quest is). The game has a lot of lore, and a lot of crafting (not that you'll ever need to craft apart from some very specific circumstances that require no crafting skill) and enemies are generally varied and interesting (except for the Immaculates and Orcs, and to a small extent the Goblins)The enviroments are awesome, seeing spells used is awesome (except from scrolls, which crash the game), and using summons, using tactical combat, and using different builds makes each playthrough fresh (until late in the game where you realise that, you can only use a very small set of builds that basically do the same thing and everything else is terrible and going to get you killed with no warning or reasoning)Divinity is Mixed for me. Yes, i'd say you should play it, and play it with a freind most importantly. I'd even reccomend using a guide too, so you can minimise the sheer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of some of the things you run into. But some mobs are colossaly strong with no clear exploitable weakness or strategy to beating them, some things like the rock paper scissors persuasion system lead to hours of frustration and unfairness, and the density of mobs, while normally nicely paced, can get frustratingly grouped in later areas.Don't play this game to 100% it. The end of the game is... lackluster, honestly. If you want to play it, and you should, play with a freind, or just play for fun with a guide and take it slowly, reading everything, doing every quest, and never trying to go too far ahead of the path. Explore everything, do everything, and most of all have fun. The game doesn't really bear replay value as the different choices don't affect much, if anything, and expect some quests to fail because of RNG. Most of all - don't expect the game to be easy.I enjoyed Divinity, but i won't play it again. Perhaps the Extended Edition will fix my problems			"

												Brilliant cRPG, highly recommend it. Larian have done a terrific job bringing old school RPG into 2014 without compromising or dumbing it down. Pretty much everything you know and love about cRPG is there. Complex character stats, inventory management, wall of texts and no quest marker.Combat is all turned based, using the action point system. What makes it interesting is the area effect and how the different element interact with each other. Cast a spell to make it rain and enemies become more susceptible to stuns (electricity) or frozen. Drop poison gas or oil and follow it up with a fireball and the gas/oil blows up causing more damage to the affected area. It's going to suck now playing other RPGs and not being able to remove or use hazards to your advantage.Game was made to be played co-op but if you want to just play it single-player (I did), it'll pretty much play just like any other RPG except you'll have an option to roleplay both characters. A recent patch added personalilties that you can set on your 2 main characters which will let the AI control the other main character you aren't controling in conversation should you want to automate either character's responses. The story is probably the only real weakness of the game. It's pretty generic fantasy stuff (with a humorous undertone, especially on side quests), but it did keep me engaged enough for the 85 or so hours it took me to finish the game with all side quests done (great btw). The puzzles are, in most cases done pretty well. Some of them might not be obvious right away. You'll have to look around your environment, reading books or talking to the right person for clues. There was 1 or 2 that was convoluted, which lead to trial and error. The game isn't perfect but I did not run into any game breaking bugs and Larian is constantly updating the game on a regular basis. There's a free toolset that comes with the game so hopefully, we'll be seeing quality user generated content that will keep the game alive for hours after finishing the campaign. We've got 3 more cRPGs coming out (Wasteland 2, Torment and Pillars of Eternity), Larian was the first out of the gate and it has set a pretty high bar for the rest to follow. "

												Understand that this game is its own world. It has its own rules and logic and not all of them are recognizable right away. At first, the game seems hard, and it almost is. It can be punishing to die, and frustrating to get stuck on a puzzle. Ultimately though, because this game is its own world, the reward for uncovering is great. There is so much freedom and independence in this game, it almost feels strange coming from a long line of games that hold your hand to the point it isnt exploration, its a tour. This game is not a guided tour. You’ll need to reload quick saves here and there, and might even lose progress up to 30min of play or more because of a surprise encounter or trap.But! This game is outstanding. All of the above points only help to realize and flesh out the world. The sense of achievement you get when figuring out a difficult puzzle or beating a tough encounter is huge. This game is great, and if you aren't playing it and have a tiny shred of interest, i'd reccomend it without hesitation. I could write a five page point by point on this game and how much it has going for it, but better you experience it. "

Early Access Review
								Divinity:Original Sin feels like the updated child of Baldur's Gate. Design a character from the ground up, choosing skills, feats and spells or opt to take one of the predefined classes. Manage a party of up to four using the slick team controls, or play online multiplayer with each of your friends designing and controlling a character. Conversations with NPCs and between party members are deep and impactful, with each individual being able to act seperately or even adventure seperately if compromise cannot be reached. Combat is turn based, but the Action Point system feels fast and responsive.The very best part of this game however is the extensive modability. I have not seen an editor this well done since Warcraft 3, and already parts of the commuinity are stepping up to make campaigns to rival those of Neverwinter Nights 2. So even if you are on the fence today, I urge you to keep an eye out for what can be done with the engine.			"

												After playing the release version for a good 20 hours and killing every evil thing walking the vicinity of Cyseal, it's time to share my thoughts on Divinity: Original Sin. Most things I said in my EA-review hold true. The game is simply a lot of good, old RPG-fun. It's challenging but not frustrating. It's complex but not confusing, there's a lot to read but that's well written, and there's so much detail and stuff to do and things to find out, I may sink 100 hours into it.To shorten the wait for a decent cRPG I played Baldur's Gate for the first time and Divinity is just as much a joy to play. It's certainly not perfect. There could be much more interaction with your companions and NPCs, the story could be presented better, managing your party inventories is more laborious than it could be, and you can clearly see, Larian was on a tight budget. But none of these things reduce the qualities this game brings - buy it, if you like party-turn-based RPGs!Only one thing battered me when I tought about it: Larian clearly failed to deliver the Kickstarter strechgoals. We knew Day/Night Cycles would not be in the game. It's disappointing but I can live with that. But where's the Lair beneath Phantom Forest, dynamic weather, the orchestral soundtrack and the deep character of the companions? There's not even a way of telling whether they included the other goals since they were formulated in a very abstract way. Don't get me wrong, this won't make Divinity worse in any way, but it leaves a bad taste of broken promise after all. 9/10---I may write a longer review when the game comes out. For now, I can only share my EA-impression. Divinity: Original Sin has improved so much in the last few weeks, especially in terms of usability, that I think it's save to say: It's going to be great. The game grants unparalleled freedom, is fun to play for anyone who likes turn-based RPGs and it looks impressive too. The only thing that annoys me somewhat is the lack of acoustic feedback when interacting with the world, but that's peanuts.If your willing to take the risk of buying a beta that might turn out to be bad - which will not happen imho - than buy it now. Everyone else wait until June 30th. Thank you Larian.			"

												To be honest I have never played a RPG similar to Divinity: Original Sin, I've only played games like Skyrim, Diablo 3 or Dragon age with a real time combat system rather than turn based. So it took me quite some time getting use to the combat system of this game, at first I felt it's too slow but as I progress it actually feels better and better. I love the fact that I can use elemental spells combos against my foes. For example I can cast a rain spell to make puddles on the ground and then I can cast a lighting spell into the puddle and whoever stands on the puddle will be stuned. I also love the fact that the environment is highly interactive in this game, just like in Skyrim where you can pickup and move many different objects, from candles to barrels. The story of the game is great, it starts off with a murder mystery that I have to solve in the first town, which grabs my interest right away, however, I find it sometimes frustrating during the quests since this game does not give you a clear indication where you have to go, unlike the other RPGs I have played. Another thing about this game bothered me a little is the sound. The game only has partial voice acting and sometimes they can be repetitive and annoying, you are reading the conversations in the game for the most of the time. The soundtrack is good but I wish they could have added more tracks. This game takes a lot of time to complete just like some other RPGs I have played, I'm 40 hours into the game and I'm not even close to the end. Overall, I really love this game, it's a fresh experience for me and I am enjoying it very much.Pros:- Cool Combat system- Interesting Story + Side Quests- Beautiful graphicsCons:- Lack of voice/soundtrack variantScore: 8.5/10			"

												Like all good CPRGs, expect to enjoy hours and hours fighting and exploring and thinking (20+ hours not shown). D:OS can be compared to other classic CRPGs, such as Balder's Gate 2 & Fallout 2, and hold its head high. i.e. It is a topdown isometric squad(?) RPG real-time then turn-based in combat. Similar to the Fallout series in that you can roam and explore and do as you like - until you get to dungeon-like instances. There will be some hard puzzle solving.The Elemental Magic system is something the old school CRPGs dream of. eg. Water + Cold = freezing (with all the 3D animations for it). However, after you slip 3 times in a row on the same puddle of icey water (left over from the battle), you do get frustrated (until you hit level 10 and get the tornado spell). In D:OS you have everything you would expect from a CRPG - stealing from NPCs, bartering, lock picking, quicksave-scumming on traps. >.> Also like old school CRPGs, the battles will seem very hard until you understand the strategy - especially for the boss fights. Pro Tip: items and gold is common, XP is a limited commodity.The dialogue is funny, quirky and numerous. Character ratings (like-ability) unfortunately has no real consequence. The dialogue is also competitive when deciding which AI or Human character is the winner of the dialogue options. This is done with Rock-Paper-Scissors with skills influencing points won. It makes perfect sense for a RPG with skill-checks, especially with multiplayer. FWIW - co-op is absolutely awesome (but it is difficult to find a friend I know who plays CRPGs, sigh).The Unity engine is a mixed blessing. There is a an editor (creating levels and whatever), ""mod-ability"" is very high. Graphics are good but nothing amazing. D:OS could have been a 10/10 game if released on a custom CRPG engine top graphics. There are still a few bugs in game but nothing game breaking (I expect they will all be fixed within a month or two of this review). I backed D:OS on Kickstarter and played the beta as well. You are not missing out on anything if you get the DLC - except for a discount. Highly recommend.			"

												The game is really awesome. It's really in line with stuff like Fallout and Baldur's Gate. Starts out feeling a bit overwhelming, especially if you're playing single player. You will be controlling both main characters, and it drops you in a fairly large city with lots of quests to do, npcs to talk to, ♥♥♥♥ to figure out, and deadly monsters outside  4 of the 6 town gates. But stick it through the first few hours of figuring everything out, pretty much like any game like this, and you'll realize how  well done and fun to play it is. I'm not even very far, from what I understand it gets kind of easy towards the end, and there are 4 very detailed areas which yield around 80 hours of playtime for most people. But it really leaves people wanting more. Fortunately the modding support may be promising and we could end up getting whole mini campaigns created for it or maybe some other cool stuff.Co-op feels more satisfying but at the same time it's not without it's small problems. Companions can only be controlled by the host currently, that should be fixed soon I hope. Dialogue is hard to follow when the other player is engaging in it, hopefully they fix that too. Companions seem pretty cool but apparently much of the companion content was cut and they will be releasing new, more detailed companions in a future update in a few months.Either way though, single or 2 player, now or later, with or without launch day flaws, the game is definitely an instant classic and I would definitely recommend getting it. It will only get better with time but this is one game that I can say with full confidence is worth the full price, and many people would probably play through a few times with different styles of characters. I'll probably play through once now, once when the devs makes all their updates, and then when mods come out I'll play again with some cool mods.			"

												Understand that this game is its own world. It has its own rules and logic and not all of them are recognizable right away. At first, the game seems hard, and it almost is. It can be punishing to die, and frustrating to get stuck on a puzzle. Ultimately though, because this game is its own world, the reward for uncovering is great. There is so much freedom and independence in this game, it almost feels strange coming from a long line of games that hold your hand to the point it isnt exploration, its a tour. This game is not a guided tour. You’ll need to reload quick saves here and there, and might even lose progress up to 30min of play or more because of a surprise encounter or trap.But! This game is outstanding. All of the above points only help to realize and flesh out the world. The sense of achievement you get when figuring out a difficult puzzle or beating a tough encounter is huge. This game is great, and if you aren't playing it and have a tiny shred of interest, i'd reccomend it without hesitation. I could write a five page point by point on this game and how much it has going for it, but better you experience it. "

								Divinity:Original Sin feels like the updated child of Baldur's Gate. Design a character from the ground up, choosing skills, feats and spells or opt to take one of the predefined classes. Manage a party of up to four using the slick team controls, or play online multiplayer with each of your friends designing and controlling a character. Conversations with NPCs and between party members are deep and impactful, with each individual being able to act seperately or even adventure seperately if compromise cannot be reached. Combat is turn based, but the Action Point system feels fast and responsive.The very best part of this game however is the extensive modability. I have not seen an editor this well done since Warcraft 3, and already parts of the commuinity are stepping up to make campaigns to rival those of Neverwinter Nights 2. So even if you are on the fence today, I urge you to keep an eye out for what can be done with the engine.			"

												One of my favorite games this year - the two word summary is ""buy it"".Divinity: Original Sin is a throwback to traditional RPGs - it's a deep, character building based game with lots of choices, a pretty open world, a lot of dialog, and turn based, Action Point dictated combat.  It heavily encourages smart game play - use combinations like throwing a water based skill to get an enemy wet, then a cold based skill to freeze them, or poison then fire for explosions.  Lure the enemy into a river, then shock it with lightning for a truely devistating effect!The 'normal' difficulty is a bit challenging at times - there is an easy mode to account for this, but it's more fun to actually figure out a better strategy until you can win!  Also, dont expect to get quests from people with bright icons over their head, and follow a waypoint to the end of the quest - this is a game you'll have to think, piece together the clues, and figure out the answers yourself (or with googles help, no judgement, we've all been there dont that at times).The single player is a treat - 70 to 110+ hours (depending on your level of completionism) of ""I'll just do ONE more thing then i'll go to bed"" content.  What surprised me, though, was how much the multiplayer felt like the old days of sitting around a table playing pen and paper RPGs.Very enjoyable, had that special something reserved for games that other games in the genre will be compared to for years to come.

								Isometric turn-based RPGs aren’t normally my cup of tea, but I had heard good things about Divinity: Original Sin, and having been a quiet fan of Divinity II: Ego Draconis, a third-person RPG in the lineage, I decided to check the game out through Steam’s Early Access.

												I haven’t gotten super far into it so I can’t speak for the narrative as a whole, but the line-writing is very good.The actual gameplay I think is fantastic… combat presents you with a great variety of tactical options, and you can get really creative with spell combos. It’s turn-based, which has the downside of leaving me bored while I wait for enemies to act but the upside of giving me time to really think and plan.There’s a multiplayer conversation system (which you can play both sides of if you’re playing a SP game, or assign the second protagonist an AI personality to automatically choose their own lines) which is even better than SWTOR’s because it actually takes into account whether the protagonists agree or disagree with one another; my only criticism is the rock-paper-scissors method of decision resolution if you disagree (it’s also used as the persuasion minigame when trying to convince NPCs). It’s affected by your proficiency with different persuasion styles, but it’s still a little game-y. That said, I don’t know how I would improve it.So, very strong first impression. I’d have more to say if I’d completed it.			"

												Just a month ago have started to play Divine Divinity. Something of the best games I've ever played on par with Fallout1, Fallout 2 with great quests, decent lore/background and a rich value of quests and world interactions.Divinity: Original Sin took most of the pros of it's predcessor (including some of the mechanics, game world lore etc.) while got somewhat adopted to the more modern requirements to the games that players tend to have now.Absolutely recommend to everyone that likes dialogues, character customisation and a fair bit of role playing with the ability to choose (so that your choice does really change the outcome, although not the in main quest line).But beware:- This thing is pretty much addictive. Plan your time accordingly.- Exploration part sometimes tends to become a burden - game has tons of random loot in all kinds of boxes, stashes and barrels.- Battles are turn-based and sometimes take more then a hour and more then just a few save-loads to finish in your favour. If you are looking for some action in game - this one is not for you.			"

												Brilliant RPG for the fans of ""think to win"", not ""press x to win""(like DAO or ME). At hard difficulty it is really hard and challenging. You should use crafted scrolls\arrows\potions\food or you won't win and this is good because not much RPGs(at least modern ones) forcing you to make some preparations before the fight. Nice storyline and side quests, not perfect, but good enough to entertain you between battles and looting\stealing\crafting. Again, no quest markers on the map and THANK YOU FOR THAT. First time for a long time i'm not feeling myself a brainless idiot who just runs from one quest mark to another via waypoints because lots of rpg developers this days seems to thinking that average player cannot read the quest dialog and find the right way himself.And thank you for co-op mode.

												Divinity: Original Sin is turn-based rpg with most important feature in my opinion multiplayer the game up to 4 players. And it's not pvp or some multiplayer scenario, it's the actual game played in multiplayer. It works, and it's really fun.Game contains lots of dialogue and interactive combat. Combat is turn-based and environment matters. If it's raining, burning effects wont stay, and if there's ice on the ground, you can slip on it. Things like that make the game more tactical and can sometimes create really unfair, but often fun results.Story is affected by the choices player(s) make, to some extent. You can deal with encounters in plenty of different ways, for example peacefully negotiate, or straight up murder everyone. Literally. You can kill almost everyone in the game if you want, town npc's and such.You can develop your character in many ways. Be either a melee warrior, stealthy rogue, mage out of many different spell schools or ranger. You're also free to combine these stereotypes and play hybrid class.It's great, fun game with tongue-in-cheek attitude. I wholeheartedly recommend the game to anyone wanting a turn-based rpg action.----------------------Then, my personal negative sides of the game:My personal negative side of the game is that combat-wise pure damage is way stronger than any kind of tanking. While this is true in most rpg games in general, it still saddens me that there's great possibilities for some kind of tanking setup but it's much harder to play, or rather pure damage dealer party is so much more stronger that it's bit silly.Another negativity is that stealing is way too easy. So easy that it becomes second nature to just steal everything even bit valuable, and that can break the game more or less. At least I felt that I became bit too overpowered because I could just steal everything, sell, buy things like bonus skill point books. If you get caught while stealing, you can get attacked and so on, but it's very easy to avoid that happening. Stealing doesn't affect morality of the characters in any way besides one dialogue option between the players, and even then you can say that stealing is wrong and steal stuff anyway.Besides these two things, the game is exceptionally good and wholeheartedly recommended!

				3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful			","5, 2014
												So where to start. Let's start with the end. Do I recommend Divinity: Original Sin? Absolutely. The game is absolutely magnificent and here is why:It has been so long since I have played either a pen and paper rollplaying game or something like Baldur's Gate that I had forgotten how entertaining both used to be. Divinity: Original Sin is a throw back to those good'ol days. D:OS is very different from most of its contemporary peers, because it simply lets you play the way you want to play. No handholding. That means you'll be forced to ""think"". It is shocking at first, when you realise there are no quest markers and you are left to your own devices and you find yourself in front of a locked door. But then you discover that there is no predetermined way of breaching said door. You can talk to the NPC the door belongs to and he may give you the key. You can sneak in and steal the key, while your partner is distracting the NPC. You can kill the NPC and grab the key. IF the door is made out of wood, you can take an axe to it; or burn it down; or you may have a ""magical unlock"" skill and unlock the door without the key; or you if you don't have the magical skill, you can craft paper, out of wood and us a magical pen you have crafted to create a magical unlock scroll; or perhaps you have the ""petpal"" skill and talk to a rat that then shows you a back door; or maybe the door is not made out of wood and just iron bars and you can look into the room, then you can just teleport into it if you have the skill, or if you don't you can craft a scroll with the skill on it. I think you get the idea.  The amount of freedom and choices is simply staggering. Because of this it is best to enjoy this game with a friend. Someone you talk to on teamspeak so you can run ideas past each other. The game truly shines in 2-player COOP, provided you know the other person and communicate via audio. Don't bother with finding a random player through the lobby. While that is certainly possible as there are a looooot of people playing right now, I think your experience will be highly diminished. The combat is fun. The magical elements behave ""realistically"", i.e Magicka on steroids. For example: You freeze some enemies with an ice wall. That leaves ice patches on the ground that you and the enemies can slip on. Someone shoots a fireball at it. The ice melts and leaves a puddle of water. You can then shoot lightning at the puddle and the water and everyone that touches the puddle get electrocuted and stunned. Shoot another fireball and the electrified puddle evaporates into an electrified cloud. Amazing fun.Finally, the story is actually pretty entertaining. The dialog doesn't take itself too seriously and at times is just flatout hilarious. And when you finish the game it feels like you have been partaking on a long epic journey. If you are like me and like to discover every inch of an open-world game then you'll be surprised by the size of the game world. My first play through took roughly 120 hours. Though I did start over after the first 10 hours, because I realized my skill choices where not complementing each other well. So that leaves me with around 110 hours for the first playthrough. Not bad for the price. And there still remains enough to be discovered so that a second playthrough is appealing to me.If you like old school pen and paper or cRPGs like Baldur's Gate / Arcanum you will most likely love this game. If you expect to be guided through the game or expect something like Diablo 3 then you best stay way.			"

												This game can be very difficult at first. The world and gameplay are very detailed, and the game doesn't really act like most games in helping you along. This learning curve can be very intimidating when you first start playing, and actually had me put the game down after a few hours, thinking I would never pick it back up. Boy am I glad I did. All of those reasons that make it so difficult to start make it so rewarding once you can some momentum. One of my favorite all time games is Baldur's Gate 2. That game was so professionally crafted, and although it was an open-world RGP on the surface, it doubled as a complex strategy game. Unlike most games of today, the encounters were not levelled. That meant you could walk into an encounter with enemies at a much higher level than your character. Of course, you would probably be eviscerated in your attempt to just get out alive. Then after you reloaded your game, you would be obsessed at beating that challenge. You would try different spells, buy different equipment, try sneaking and backstabbing, different spells and scrolls, you would do anything possible to win. The game was amazingly open to your creative solutions, and once you finally found a strategy that looked like it worked, you would be exhilarated. I loved that about that game more than anything. While I have loved games like Skyrim since then, I have still never experienced anything quite like that since. Divinity: Original Sin may be the most worthy successor to Baldurs Gate 2 I have seen. The RPG elements are different. It takes more of an Elder Scrolls type style, where you can choose to start from base classes, but leveling up doesn't have class restrictions. You can start as a thief, then start learning spells. You can be an archer that knows water based spells, or a assassin that knows witchcraft. its more closer to the spirit of the 4th edition of D&D than advanced dungeons and dragons. Overall I think that works well. There are many choices to make that create nuanced changes to your gameplay. The setting and world is very detailed, but feels like a much smaller scale than Baldur's Gate 2. Though you can enter every building and talk and trade with every character. The game really excels in its combat. Everything works together and can be used strategically. You can put out fires with a Rain spell, you can light oil on fire to burn your enemies. You can shock everyone standing in a pool of water, you can blow up poison gas. You get up to four party members, and can make each of their skills compliment each other. My one buddy will often lay an oil slick on the ground to have my thief ignite with his flame spells(yes my thief is a pyrotechnic wizard). My actual wizard will often teleport an enemy close to my buddy's bruiser warrior character for quick dispatchment. There are a million and one different ways to approach a battle and we often lose miserably on a first encounter, only to eventually succeed after careful planning. There aren't many encounters you can really take for granted. There are probably less enemy encounters than in other games, but each one is hard fought and feels dynamic. Essentially, this is as far from a hack and slash game you can possibly have.In typical D:OS fashion, the crafting/inventory/item collection aspects are richly detailed and not explicitly explained. Its indicative of every aspect of the game. Most of the time it feels like a developer is trying to point out ever single part of their game in an effort to demonstrate how much time it took to create it. Larian Studios is so absurdly casual about crafting one the most dense games in decades. We were basically ignoring cracting entirely until my partner found a  Guidebook[www.divinityoriginalsin.com] online. I thought all that stuff we were picking up was just meaningless stuff to sell. Needless to say, we are pretty excited to jump back into the game and try some of that stuff out.I don't have many complaints about the game, but I have some differences of opinions. Mainly, I wish that this was 4 player, considering that you can have 4 party members. Also, we my friend hosts our game, and the save files aren't accessible to me at all. I don't really own the characters I play with, its like he just grants me control while we play together. We also end up fighting over chests a little more than I like. Some recent games like Deathtrap brought some appreciated sharing of treasure. In D:OS, we tend to greedily race to the dropped loot after a battle and walk into traps looking for chests.			"

												I technically bought this game from concept on Kickstarter a few years ago as I loved the previous game Larian studios (the developer) had made including divine divinity and dragon commander series so I was interested in another game within that universe.Old school RPG's seem to be rare delicacy in recent years so from what the guys had set out on the Kickstarter page and the guide of how the money would be spent I though why not give it a bash as their previous work that I had come across was good.Took me roughly about 67 hours to complete the single player story which is pretty good in this day an age of 5 hour long corridor simulators.Combat is turn based and turned out to be one of the best parts as different elements and abilities combine with each other which adds a certain level of strategy to each battle as u have to be careful not to zap or burn your own party accidently,As an example if there is water on the ground and you cast a ice spell you could turn that water to ice and cause a surface your party and the enemy Ai could slip and fall over on.Music is brilliant really adds to the atmosphere of the zone you are in at the time.The story starts of as a simple investigation about a murder but develops into a more sinister plot that threatens the world. The story is a bit hit and miss but it has its moments and has plenty of the good old Larian studios humour mixed in. The world is really immersive and beautifully designed props to the art team loads of hidden items treasure secret caves underground caverns so if you like exploring you will love the adventure you will have in this game and the game has plenty of side quests that will get you out there in the world.Now while I appreciate the way the devs did the navigation and quest layouts I can see some people maybe having a bit of trouble finding their way around initially, the game does sort of throw you in the deep end and if you have never played games such as Baldurs Gate or Neverwinter it could be a bit overwhelming. This game doesn't have a press a button to see where you need to go or a massive arrow pointing to the quest objective you have to take the time to read the quests and listen to what the NPCs tell you in the game or you will find yourself lost.The start of the game is a bit slow and I could see some people getting bored but stick with it once you get out of the first town and get exploring the game really picks up and gets its hooks into you  :)It's a yes from me on this one guys if you  love adventure and exploring beautifully crafted worlds get this one bought ASAP.P.s no I am not in the mood for cheese -_-			"

												This game can be very difficult at first. The world and gameplay are very detailed, and the game doesn't really act like most games in helping you along. This learning curve can be very intimidating when you first start playing, and actually had me put the game down after a few hours, thinking I would never pick it back up. Boy am I glad I did. All of those reasons that make it so difficult to start make it so rewarding once you can some momentum. One of my favorite all time games is Baldur's Gate 2. That game was so professionally crafted, and although it was an open-world RGP on the surface, it doubled as a complex strategy game. Unlike most games of today, the encounters were not levelled. That meant you could walk into an encounter with enemies at a much higher level than your character. Of course, you would probably be eviscerated in your attempt to just get out alive. Then after you reloaded your game, you would be obsessed at beating that challenge. You would try different spells, buy different equipment, try sneaking and backstabbing, different spells and scrolls, you would do anything possible to win. The game was amazingly open to your creative solutions, and once you finally found a strategy that looked like it worked, you would be exhilarated. I loved that about that game more than anything. While I have loved games like Skyrim since then, I have still never experienced anything quite like that since. Divinity: Original Sin may be the most worthy successor to Baldurs Gate 2 I have seen. The RPG elements are different. It takes more of an Elder Scrolls type style, where you can choose to start from base classes, but leveling up doesn't have class restrictions. You can start as a thief, then start learning spells. You can be an archer that knows water based spells, or a assassin that knows witchcraft. its more closer to the spirit of the 4th edition of D&D than advanced dungeons and dragons. Overall I think that works well. There are many choices to make that create nuanced changes to your gameplay.

			Divinity Original Sin: Quick Look Divinity Original Sin takes the old days of PC turn based RPGs and modernize it with a slick and high gloss presentation.		

Divinity takes PC turn based RPGs and modernize it with the shimmer and shine of today's graphical standards. Though the game looks fantastic, I would even go as far as saying one of the best in the genre, the core and mechanics stay true to it's source. The game is deep and will require dozens if not hundreds of hours from the player. If you are looking for a time sink, this one will do you just fine. The writing and story are equally as impressive as it's visuals. Characters are lively with humor and personality, and the narrative will draw you in with it's many incentives to role play. Since the game is so large in scope, I found it to be slow at the start. Not just pacing, but also in understanding. It took me a few re-rolls before I made a game that I was happy with, and even then it took me roughly 3-4 hours before I moved away from the dialog heavy town, and into the more actiony bits. Of course my persistent demand to talk to every single towns folk before leaving may have contributed to more time than needed, and only serve as testimony in how engrossing the writing can be. Also keep in mind, you need to be able to enjoy reading... a lot. There is only limited voice acting and the majority of the game is told in written form.Overall, the game is every thing I expected and more. It will probably go down as one of the great classics of our time.Pros:- Excellent visuals and overall presentation- Deep mechanics- HUGE game- Lots of customization- Great writing- Classic return to form, for this style of RPGCons:- Slow to start (potentially).- Could prove too daunting for those who are short on free time.

												This is great if you want something a bit different and a relaxing casual coop to play with a mate. It combines some good open-world RPG with more intense turn-based-strategy and I feel the mash-up works well. As an Open-World game there's also plenty of scope to do things with or without your coop partner, which is a nice change from games like Diablo 3 that force you to stick together the entire time.It's hard. Really hard. But that's refreshing too. Stick with it though and it's delightful and rewarding.			"

												***MILD SPOILERS FOR SERIES FANS! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!***If you're a fan of the original Divine Divinity (or the series as a whole), you will not be disapointed with OS. Staple mechanics are here (lock picking, pyramid teleporters, crafting food and potions by collecting ingredients out in the world), some of which are recognisably the classic Div Div systems (the skill-up system is pleasingly familiar, whilst also being greatly expanded), and some of which are fresh new additions.Perhaps best of all for series fans, the lore, setting and characters are all intact. The Legion are around in their various garrisons and forts, Arhu is on-hand to dispense wisdom and advice, and, of course, the Source is present and correct (or  rather, corrupt).Beyond Div's simultaneous 2 character system works even better in OS. In fact, it's chalk and cheese, and any painful memories you may have of that game's controls, or the notorious Fergus will be wiped away. Your group can be split up and easily managed just by dragging the portraits around, so no worries there.I never thought isometric RPGs could get better than Div Div, but OS takes the crown.			"

												Spent the first two hours clicking on just about every object I could see.  Then finally got to a town and, oh boy, just about every npc has something to say.  This is going to take up most of my time and I can see that I will get frustrated a lot, but it will be a very good frustration.  Already found someone to team up with and love the fact that you can join in/skip conversations anytime you want, as long as your close to the other player.  A lot of reading is needed in game and, I guess, out of game to fully understand the whole game.  Not a game that you can just pick up and go.8/10  It may go up or down as I progress.			"

												In short: An extremely good classical RPG.For the elders: I wouldn't say it's on par with Baldur's Gate 2 or Torment, but yet it's not far behind either. It will surely bring you good memories. They mixed new stuff ( coop, better UI, ergonomy and graphics) with good old stuff which made good cRPGs good at our time. Plot is very nice, and gameplay very addicitve (I personally spend hours crafting stuff). For younglings: This is the best game for you to introduce you to a great game type which was left aside for a good while. If you like this one, you're on a great path, which will include (in any order) Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Arcanum, the two first Fallouts, and Planescape Torment (My all time favorite). It might be harder than your average game, but like every game (not just video games), overcoming the difficulty is proportionnaly rewarding.9/10 A must buy.			"

								I would highly recommend this game to any big RPG fans, especially those that like games of older generations such as Planetscape Torment, Baldurs Gate and Dungeon and Dragons. There's very high amount of customization and replayability as the game is very fluid and many of the parts can be done with different methods yielding different results. While I've only played the beta, I'd be shocked if the review would change at all - and I already consider this game as one of the best RPG's I've played which combines a great story along with great gameplay and freedom, yet still allows for 2 friends to have fun and has plenty of laugh out loud moments. I highly recommend this game to any RPG fan. Story: 10/10Gameplay: 10/10Control: 9/10AI: 8/10Graphics: 9/10Sound: 10/10 Overall: 9.5/10 (one of the best games I've ever played)			"

								Divinity: Original Sin is quite worth the cost even in its current Alpha state. I won't focus on bugs here. That's what the forums are for.The Turn Based combat uses Action Points to dictate how much you can do in a single turn. This means a single turn could consist of an item use, special skill, and maybe a normal attack. You can also end your turn early to AP to allow more actions per turn. This greatly affects how you approach each fight. Additionally, each fight has the potential to be a completely unique experience with interactive elements. See an oil barrel? Attack it and oil spills out. Got some flaming arrows or a fire spell? Set the oil on fire and burn your enemies. Got a Rain spell? Put the fire out with rain. Have electricity? Shock enemies standing in water to electrify the ground. Ice can also be used to create slippery areas that can knock enemies (and players alike) down. There are a number of possibilities using single elements or a combination.Party members will actually interact with each other during certain conversations with NPCs. This leads into a back and forth between the characters you control. The outcome is a point increase in different social attributes. These help increase Luck, Charm, Leadership, Pickpocketing, etc. It's a pretty neat take on character development.Inertacting with NPCs and the world is also quite enjoyable. Most NPCs can be talked to and bartered with. Objects like boxes and barrels can be looted, moved, or destroyed. Hanging hams or potion bottles sitting on tables that look like decoration can be stolen and used later in battles. Houses can be broken into and looted. NPCs can be attacked if you're feeling evil enough. Half of the time I have put in so far has been seeing what I can get away with around town and I will say there is a fair amount to do.Crafting, though not fully implemented, it pretty wonderful as well. Simple combinations of herbs and potions can yield a variety of new potions. A wooden club and nails nets you a spiked club, a knife and pumpkin gets you a jack-o-latern helmet, etc. Considering the number of items I have found labeled ""Ingredient"" I anticipate there being a number of recipes in future releases only adding to the things you can do.DOS also looks fantastic. Textures, shadows, and ambience are all quite well done. Colors are vibrant and plentiful. Fire singes the ground, ice covers the ground and melts away slowly, poison clouds linger in the air, blood pools and splashes when you walk through it. There is a lot to see and it's all quite enjoyable to look at.All of this is packaged with Larian's off the wall humor seen in games like Divine Divinity or Beyond Divinity. I am incredibly excited to see this game when it's finished. Based on the devs hotfix coming out four days after the Alpha release, I am also excited to see this game evolve into its final state.

Early Access Review
								TL:DR; You can surprise a lady having a bath and get yelled at. 11/10 will play for years.I really wish other Early Access Games would be released with this much solid basic content to let you really feel like you have something to test that gives you an idea of what their end goal is. Larian has done it right. Yes there are some bugs and things that still need perfecting in the mechanics, but this is ALPHA and its purpose is for players to find those bugs and report them for fixing. The Alpha gives you the first town an some surrounding area to explore and do a few quests in, but it's a pretty HUGE area with a lot of content and even a couple of little easter eggs that give you a good insight into what the rest of the game will be like to play through. There's plenty of combat encounters with nasty things for you to play around with the turn based combat mechanics and leveling your characters. It's not an Alpha you'll burn through in an hour! I played for around 15 hours and still didn't finish everything or go everywhere. Hell, the recently released Might & Magic X is at final release only about a 25 hour game for the same price... And frankly I'm pretty angry I bought the Alpha for that one at this point considering how limp the final release is.D:OS is for fans of Larian like myself, a long-anticipated game from a game developer with a history of quirky but addicting games and dedication to their playerbase. Divine Divinity (their first in this series) came out in 2002 and I bought it for myself for xmas that year and was instantly hooked. I had played Diablo so much I had actually worn out a couple of game CD's of it, but there'd been nothing since 1996 which had caught me quite the same till DivDiv came out, and I can honestly say if I put 500+ hours into Diablo, I must have over the years put 1000+ into DivDiv and have bought many copies of the game. I am actually working on another playthrough to keep myself occupied till D:OS comes out lol It's still to this day my favourite game.Larian's creative, fresh and cheeky style never grows old and has a great balance of a light hearted comedic RPG with some silly elements, but also a very deep and complex serious story with a vast world of politics and lore beneath it. The NPC's are lively and memorable, your own character conversation choices are full of personality and ""life"". I was very pleasently reminded of DivDiv when I played Dragon Age, it felt like they took a few pages out of Larian's book on crafting engaging conversation with humor and depth without losing the serious story side. And so far D:OS looks like it's solidly in the tradition, style & quality I would expect. If you like things like Douglas Adams, Monty Python and a little Tolkein & Game of Thrones mixed in, you will probably enjoy this game.Although there is a story which you're playing through, and technically you're on a rail to get to the end of it, you almost never feel like you are. You have great freedom to go where you want and kill who you want as well (which CAN screw you up, as you can kill people who are key to completing a quest! But that's your fault, you psychopath). If D:OS is like DivDiv then you will have dozens and dozens of side quests and places to explore which will keep you busy and add replay value as well. It's a little early to judge on that for sure, but Larian has been consistent in giving a lot of content in side quests in all of their other games so I feel like it's a fairly safe bet to be able to look forward to that.The look and animation in the game is very pretty, the lighting is fantastic as well, I love using fireballs because they just look incredible and you can really see the blistering heat from them. So this is certainly a game which is very pleasing on the eyes. It's consistent with the look and feel of their previous games as well, so it still feels like you're in Rivellon!Movement is the biggest flaw that really stuck out to me during my playing so far. It's a bit clunky feeling right now and like your team is a little slow to respond when you give them a direction to move in and their progress when they do get going is a bit plodding especially when you want to run across a large section of the map. That can get pretty time consuming and the pathing for your party members when they're following you when you've selected a direction to run in can be a bit problematic, considering how slow the movement is it's surprisingly easy to loose one or two of them while you're travelling. I'll be reporting the movement issues - I'll be honest and say it isn't enough to stop me playing even if that doesn't change for final release, but it is frustrating and I can totally see it stopping others from playing. I really haven't seen much else that stands out to me as a flaw worth mentioning in a review of an Alpha stage release, yes there are a few bugs, but I'm sure they will be fixed if reported. With the exception of Starbound I haven't been this thrilled with my player experience with a game I backed in Alpha release. And I wouldn't hesitate to recommend D:OS to anyone with a sense of humor who likes turn-based RPGs and vast world/lore exploration. "

												What can i say about this game? Did anyone expect it to be this good? I can speak for myself that i did not. This game is probably the best Rpg made in the last years. Awesome story, exploration at its finest, really difficult, moddable and on top of that you can play it with a friend.  If you had second thoughts about buying it cause of the price, don't. Don't let yourself miss on this masterpiece.			"

But... the game itself is just what I wanted, back to the old school RPG style, great look and feel. I had never really tried a turn based game before, had my reservations but this is a very cool battle system. This is going to be top notch for us RPG lovers once complete.

								My first memorable Top Down RPG was probably the Fallout series and in many ways it's left a lasting impression on what i like in my RPG's.  I absolutely fall in love with rich worlds, well crafted lore, unique NPCs, and a certain amount of freedom with character creation (both in gameplay and personality).  While their have been many pretenders to the throne to this old school theory of game development and the general meta-game has shifted toward action based RPG's Larian Studios has restored my faith with Divinity Original Sin.I've been playing through the comabt and avoiding the story as much as possible but what accidental bits i've discovered and the combat has me very excited for the full release.  To say i've bought into the hype is a bit of an understatement.  I'm actively drinking the kool-aid at this point.This is going to be one of those games you wake up on the weekend and make yourself a cup of coffee while playing co-op with one of your old gaming friends.  There will be pauses between dialogue choices as you decided how you want to respond and several minute long planning sessions on how to engage a tough fight (see the 4 elemental demon bosses early on.  We fought them at lvl 4 and won but it did take a little bit of planning).I'll give a more solid review when the game is fully released as i've been reading that launch has been delayed for voice acting (MOTHER OF GOD, YES!) and the same company and actors from dragon commander are doing the voices.  For the uninformed, Dragon Commander has some very solid voice acting and helped sell the world and general atmosphere of the game.  I have complete faith that a return of the actors from Dragon Commander will be an incredible experience ontop of something i'm already looking forward to.  (i also have a schoolyard crush on the actress that did Ophelia's voice in Dragon Commander, Here's hoping she does voices for Original Sin too)But my general reccomendation is to buy this game.  If you're a twitch gaming kind of guy then save your money for something more to your taste but if you like RPG's, stategy games, Pen/Paper DND, tactical turn-based combat, and any variations of those core game elements then this game is absolutely for you.

A True ClassicNot a ""modern classic"" - a true classic. This is the new benchmark for this kind of RPG. Details below.Short version: This is an old-school-style RPG with modern graphics sound and UI. It is astoundingly good. It's a shame hyperbolic terms like ""awesome,"" ""incredible,"" and ""phenomenal"" are so overused in modern communication, because they apply.Long version: The tone reminds me more of the original two Fallout games than any fantasy series I can point to. The main story is fairly dark and gets more so as the story progresses, but there is still plenty of humor and lightheartedness to be found in the world. Both of these aspects are handled well; I recall my pair of very heroic protagonists being unnerved and dismayed more than once by stuff going on around them, which made them feel like actual good people in a hard situation rather than just wooden protagonist bots that are above things like emotion.Gameplay in combat feels like the best parts of Jagged Alliance 2, The Banner Saga, and Baldur's Gate with a hefty helping of things I haven't seen before. There are a lot of very satisfying synergies, and the designers clearly know how to design good encounters, because almost every fight in the game is an interesting tactical situation. Attacks feel so weighty that I actually winced a few times.Social interactions and storytelling are also very good. The game includes a social conflict system, and it's the first time I've seen one that actually managed to create some tension in a video game. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention how good the soundtrack and sound design are. I wound up purchasing the deluxe DLC because I wanted to be able to listen to the soundtrack, and the sound effects and environment noises are also great. The art design is similarly spectacular. This isn't the most graphically-intensive game you'll ever play, but it is gorgeous to look at, and everything feels like it fits in the world. If I have one criticism, it's that some times the puzzles are a little bit too obtuse, but I'd rather have to scratch my head and/or look for help in a forum or wiki than have my hand held through the whole game. It respects your intelligence and persistence.I'm not even done with the main campaign and I already want a sequel. I cannot recommend this highly enough.			"

												Overall: 8/10What a fun, polished, classic-style RPG!D:OS is hands down the best RPG of this sort since Dragon Age: Origins. Interesting combat system, good story line, and never a dull moment.PROS+ Not a single ""fetch"" quest. Seriously, about 100 quests and not a single one of them falls into the ""go get me 10 pairs of smelly panties"" category. + Excellent graphics with bright colors, excellent level of detail, atmospheric nuances, weather, terrain, all very beautiful to watch.+ Interesting, innovative, detailed and hard to master combat system. When ""fight"" is on, solid tactics are essential.+ Lots of content, areas to explores, NPCs. D:OS' world is very much alive and full of detail. A single, completist playthrough is well over 100 hours.+ Humor galore. Easter eggs, puns, funny remarks everywhere. For the first time ever I even paid attention to ""achievements"", each one a nod to some more or less obscure rock track (Sleeping Village, Disciples of the Watch and No More Mr Nice Guy among my favs).+ Appropriate sound track, not invasive, you won't feel the need to turn it off.+ Game is very polished, in 150 hours i've encountered just one, quite minor, graphic glitch.CONS- Characters are devoid of any real personality: voice overs are sparse, character build doesn't help, you don't really get attached to your main character as you would have done with Origins, or ME's Shepard, or even with Baldur's Gate. You get stronger and stronger, but you don't ""grow"".- The UI would need an overhaul, inventory management is tedious and a time waster.- Some quests are too obscure and counter intuitive, if you really want to complete everything you will need to go check a walkthrough from time to time unless you enjoy pixel-hunting for a semi invisible knob or switch.

Short version:I found this to be the best game I've come accross in the past few years, definitely worth to get it.Pro:- Excellent Co-op experience- Great combat system and game mechanics- Amazing art and music- Offers challenge to a wide variety of people- A lot of entertaining quests and conversations- The possibility to have multiple characters/companions with some rather unique set of skills- Quite much entertainment for money spentCons: - If you're not so experienced with similar games, the first 5-6 levels can be a very rough start- Personally encountered very minor graphical bugs here and there (they might be not as widespread though, my friend doesn't have them)- Sometimes the controls and positioning can be a bit off (easy to misclick in a combat and waste points on movement instead of attacking, backstabbing position seems weird quite often, relatively hard to see where the environmental effects begin and end)Neutral:- While conversations are amusing, some might find there are way too many quests involving jokes and puns.- Really addictive. When your friend in co-op tells you the second day in row: ""Dude, did you realize it's 6 am already?"", then you know you spent too much playing the game.Longer version:I'd definitely suggest to buy it, but for the maximum level of entertainment you should get a Co-op partner too with voice communications - possibly one that's willing to read through plenty of conversations and play during same hours as you do. If you're anything like me and not really familiar with games like these, you might want to read up on basic game mechanics - such as sneaking, stealing, pickpocketing, the reactions of elements in combat, weaknesses of different opponents - otherwise it might be a rather tedious start. With a sub-optimal party you might run into trouble in the first couple of levels already. The game itself offers a wide variety of skills and classes (at least I'd consider it so nowadays) which results in quite good combat scenarios, the only thing that can be a bit of a letdown if the randomness turns against you - but that's part of the game.Aside from combat, there amount of quests, side-quests and just interesting NPCs is just incredible. Many of them will basically require you to do some sort of investigation based on what you're learned through your conversations, sometimes you might just have to talk with dozens of NPCs to find out who can help you, sometimes it takes several minutes to find that hidden switch or logic to progress to the next part of the quests. Which is really a good experience from the old times, seeing how almost all the new games will save you from using your brain at any cost.The level of details is very good as well. There're towns with multi-leveled buildings, each of them have dozen of items like tables, chairs, cups, knives, paintings, quill, ink and whatever you can imagine. Some of these you can steal and vendor, others can be used for crafting! You can even move most of these. The art and voices are pretty good and the music is just perfect. Really the only thing that annoyed me was the sounds of characters speaking in caves, there's a weird echo to it, but it's nothing major.While the positive things by far outweigh the negative in this game, I do have to mention some of the annoyances - although these might be fixed soon enough. One of these annoyances are the downtimes between battles and conversations, when you're basically doing nothing but traveling. The default movement speed on your characters are pretty slow, while there're waypoints to help that, often you just have to move back and forth between NPCs to find out what to do. It's the same thing with healing between fights, feels just like a pointless downtime (although I can see how it could be exploited).Other than that, there're some minor things, such as it's hard to see when are you actually going to step on an environmental effect (you might think your character can pass right near that little blazing grass, but sometimes it'll set you on fire) and there seems to be a little inconsistency between host and a co-op player on where some of the enemies are facing - this and the very small angle at which backstab works can make the life of Scoundrels a nightmare early on. A friend of mine and me spent almost 30 hours with this game so far and we can't see the end of it yet. We might still create new characters once we finish, as we didn't even get to try crafting properly yet, or the quests where you talk to animals, or a lot of characters, or the steam workshop, or many of the other things this game can offer! The point is, it's one of the very few purchases in the past half dozen years that I didn't regret and for that I bow before Larian Studios. "

												Holy ♥♥♥♥.... Baldur's Gate, is that you?   This game is the closest thing to BG I have played in years.  It has all of the moral ambiguity (kill peasants for their pocket change, or help those in need if you would prefer).   The graphics are gorgeous with an adjustable top-down perspective that is reminiscent of BG / Neverwinter nights.  Character development & customization is deep , allowing you to tailor your character's strengths with different perks, traits, skills, and equipment.    The dialogue is also pretty hilarious and the NPCs feel surprisingly 'alive'.    10/10.   I cannot wait to see where this game goes.			"

												Take Divine Divinity world. Add party members. Add turn-based combat. That's something similar to what it plays like. If you're looking for an easy going, streamlined experience where you always know where you're going, and what you need to do, then stay away. You're probably not going to like it.If however, you like old school rpgs like Ultima 7/Morrowind (Not the rest of the series, just Morrowind with it's no quest markers and having to read quest logs/dialogue to figure out what you've got to do) then this is going to be a blast for you.So far.. I'd really probably call it, a modern day Ultima 7 without the awful combat system they switched to and reviving the Ultima 6 turn-based system.. but also modernized.One last note, if you're not a fan of a little monty python/terry pratchet humour in your games.. you're also going to have issues.But from an old-school rpg fan, this is a damn treat and I'm enjoying the heck of it.

												I have played many many games and very few of them offer the freedom, satisfaction, and fun that Dvinity: Original Sin brings to the table. Most modern RPGs are more action than RPG, and suffer from dumb downed and simplified gameplay to appeal to a broader audience. Well Divinity: Original Sin brings the depth and interaction of older series like Baldur's Gate as well as beautiful graphics and music that really brings the Dungeons and Dragons style genre to the next level. Quests require you to talk to various npcs, whose dialouges are always extraordinarily written, and read excerpts from journals and books to uncover plots and mysteries as well as unravel your tale as a Source Hunter. There are no quest markers or waypoints, which may leave you lost or searching for what to do next, but as you adjust and learn to put the pieces together you will find yourself immersed in the beautiful world, Every aspect of the game just feels so finely polished and well made. Dialouges with npcs are engaging and many times hilarous. The word intuitive is thrown around a lot for games, but the crafting system in Divinity definitely deserves it. I don't want to give too much away but one small example is you can take a knife to a pillow to get a feather, which can be combined with the same knife to create a quill which can be crafted into various other things. The world is extremely interactive, rivaling AAA titles like Skyrim with the ability to pick up and move around almost every object, including chests and barrels. The combat is turn-based, with each party member having a number of action points, determined by various stats, that are used to move, use skills, etc during combat. It is very tatical, and the environment plays a huge role. You can lay down oil, slowing your opponents and limiting their action points for a couple of turns, then even light the pool of oil on fire buring everyone standing in it. There are many combinations like this, such as making it rain then electrocuting and stunning opponents standing in the pool of water that forms. One of the big ways the combat stands out is that buffs and debuffs play a serious role in the combat. Being stunned, knocked, down, etc can take someone out of a fight for multiple turns, creating huge advantages. Fights are very tough, and you are almost always fighting someone a higher level than you are, so utilizing your skills correctly is key to a satisfying victory. You can also converse with the people in your party, discussing events and things that you've done. You also discuss with your party when making decisions for quests. There are multiple meters for how people percieve you, such as independent/dependent, heartless/compationate, bold/cautious, that change based on the decisions you make and things you say. The icing on the cake of Divinity: Original Sin is that all of this can be experienced with a friend. There is drop in/drop out co op that is super easy to use. You can split up control of your party amongst the two of you and set off on your adventure.I can not reccomend this game enough, especially to any who find themselves going waypoint to waypoint completing boring quests or easy mind numbing combat in other games. For casual gamers I would still recommend this game, but heed my warning that you may find yourself lost and not sure where to go next, or having difficulties in a tough fight. You can always turn the difficulty down though if you're having too much trouble. So get out there. Explore. Discover. Interact.			"

AP based combat, thrill of advanture and freedome in completing quests are this game strong points. It took me 4h to explore the city about 20h+ to leave the first area and there are at least 100h ahead. Let's not forget about the optional multiplayer.

												Divinity: Original Sin is another masterful entry into the critically acclaimed Divinity Universe from the wonderful Larian Studios!Divinity: Original Sin follows in the footsteps of it's predecessors, throwing the player into a magnificiently crafted world full of character intrigue, mystery, betrayal and hope. The story plot is free-flowing, allowing for ""maximum"" freedom in the choices one can make (and although it works quite well at the best of times), it often requires moments of linear gameplay in order to avoid stalls, glitches, etc. The written script is intelligent, often subtle in humour and philosophy. Character customization is similiar to previous titles, allowing for the greatest degree of freedom in hybrid builds and mashups of class types. Combat takes a different turn, heading towards turn based battles - although free movement exists outside of combat. Again, almost all items in the game world can be stolen, found, bartered or sold. Crafting requires a solid memory, as the instructions for craftables are found within lore books, often in rhyme and poetry. Divinity boasts memorable characters, easter eggs and references (in one instance a solid, yet humourful, recommendation to buy Dragon Commander)...Original Sin's visuals are not spectacular, but unique and arresting to the eye. Colors are bright and vivid, spell effects are often satisfying, and character animations are smooth and fluent. The music of Original Sin is a fantastic element, as composer Kirill Pokrovsky comes aboard once more, delivering a beautiful, atmospheric soundtrack as befits the games style. The mechanics are well implemented and reactive, as you can create hazardous surfaces of fire, ice or slime with combinations of the elements. The content is satisfying (even the semi-pointless Golden Grail and Zandalors Trunks). The UI is simple to follow, the controls easy to master. Character voice overs are rare, but professional in tone and fluency of language. Multiplayer boasts an interesting concept of drop in/drop out gameplay, as the host of any game has complete control over the progression of all characters - only allowing for drop-in players to progress in the campaign, influencing little change over the character controlled.Divinity: Original Sin is a magnificient title from a wonderful developer, and is absolutely well worth the money and time for those who enjoy tactical RPG experiences with freedom of choice!

												I have never played any of this series at all so I'm giving this review without the past tinting it in good or bad way for those that might not know anything about the game.  So I will give you with the bit I've played my first impressions with what I think is good and bad.Since I got it I haven't been able to get out of it... in a good way.  I'm totally addicted and found the game that suits me to the max.  This is turn based, so it gives me time to think without pressure yet still sitting on the edge of my seat at the fight.  It kind of threw me in the beginning though on character creation because I didn't know it was a duo... I was quite perplexed when I had to create two and customize them. (again I've never played any of the earlier ones so not even sure if that is how they worked in those)  But the whole two character thing had be curious right off the bat.  I figured it was basicly like a skyrim of a different flavor, story, etc etc.  But it isn't and it is!  For me, it's perfect.  It guides you along at the beginning yet gives you freedom to experiment and explore to start you out.  Perfectly balanced in my opinion for a brand new person.  They are great at the queues you need to not salp you in the face eyt pop up at the perfect time with suggestions.  They aren't obnoxious at all, but definitely letting you know about a new feature.I think it is an amazing and creative touch about the dialogs you have that affect the game between your two characters that you choose how it goes.  There are different options.   They really thought out of the box on this one.  I'm an animator for the film TV and gaming industries and not much impresses me. But this one did. the only negative thing I can say about it is the camera.  though it's not hard to get the hang at all on rotating it, they put a limit on it severely so you have to zoom in to see through walls at times, which is a feature of the game, not a bug.  It just messes up my immersion a wee bit, but i'm sure I will get used to it soon enough.  I just love the barter / selling / buying system a LOT.  items are as good as gold and visa versa.  it took me a couple times to realize I could switch between the characters in the same selling / bartering menu, but it's something that isn't hidden at all either.I could go on and on about it but in a nut shell, it's just amazing and I'm totally addicted and that is a huge feat to do with my line of work.Create an awesome day and kudos to the awesome creativity to the devs.  it is totally worth the price!~ ish			"

								Amazing game - high reactivity, lots of different approaches to resolving most problems. Fights are well executed.Dual-dialogue system is great for roleplaying and there are no ""wrong"", instant loss choices. Roleplaying is instead rewarded.Graphics are rich in texture, character and flavour. The game really feels like it was designed with a purpose, with a ""soul"", rather than merely a choose your own adventure over a spreadsheet.			"

												This game is downright amazing. At first I didnt really know what I was doing, but with more reading and exploration the game really. Questing is not just started by marked NPCs. A journal entry is made and you must read and explore on your own to get things done. Crafting also happens to be solved by exploring your ingredients. Simply by putting random herbs in a vial or special arrow heads onto a shaft, no crafting table or work bench required. The game makes you want to talk to everyone and has an interesting interaction between your two main characters through interactive conversations. This game is a great old school turn based rpg and the immersion makes you feel like you are in a very interaction DnD campaign.The only cons I can think of are the movement sometimes seems clunky and multiplayer is currently only 2 player. It seems that a mod is already in the works of changing the multiplayer to 4 players.Divinity: Original Sin is a must buy for any avid rpg player.			"

								Really fun gameplay even at this very early stage of development.It's an interesting mix of realtime gameplay that becomes turn-based just for combat.The combat is varied with both friendly npc's and enemies, and plenty of environmental effects such as barrels that can be destroyed spilling oil whic can be ignited etc.Character creation (which is yet to be developed with plenty of 'place holder' messages) looks as it will be quite flexible without having to follow a particular 'class', develope your own unique mix of skills.Graphics are pretty and the sound track so far is excellent.Very excited to see what this game becomes, especially once multiplayer is added!

												I'm not really a classic RPG gamer and find myself leaning towards shooter, F2P MMORPG, or crafting/building type games.  However, I got this as a gift from my boyfriend and his family and it is by far one of the best games I've ever played.  For once I'm challenged to think critically and can utilize my envirorment in battles with strategy rather than mindless clicking and shooting like in other games I play.  This just may be the game that turns me to strategy RPG gaming.Absolutely love it.			"

								Update 6/28/2014Still in love with this game, awaiting release, the patch they released on Friday has added sounds and what not to the menu actions, and also managed to make the game run even smoother than it was before.I know it's not full release yet, but i've already clocked in 100+ hours into this game, and  awaiting my collector's edition, so yeah, this is bascially my GOTY 2014, 2nd only to Shovel Knight or something.Update 4/25/14: I LOVE THIS GAME! - The Loading issue has been fixed- The framerate is smooth as butter even with V-Sync on- And there have been a whole bunch of fixes and changes that only make me love the game more and more.Original Review:I'll be honest i'm really enjoying this game a lot, I keep coming back to it wanting to play more and more because it's so good, but then I remember it's in Alpha and the saves aren't always compatible so I end up not playing, but over all the gameplay feels pretty good, it's an isometric turn based RPG in the vein of Baulder's Gate or Fallout series, but there's a lot of details that make the game feel really good, for example, you can basically attack anything, if there's a barrel of oil and you use a fire spell on it, you can make it explode, also you can use those spells on doors, allies, or anything that glows red when you aim at it.Another great thing about this game is the humor, there's a lot of funny puns and diologue you'll find in this game that you won't see in other fantasy based RPG's, like putting a bucket over your head as a helmet, or being about to use a guitar as a weapon that actually has decent stats, I remember one time there was this monster called ""adorable puppy"", then when it got closer you realized it was a zombie dog, which kinda weirded me out. Also I can't forget the music, the music is pretty top notch, I'm not expert on music but basically I can sit in the menu or one place without even doing anything but sitting back listening to the music. That's not to say the game is without it's flaws, since it's still in Alpha, that means there's a lot of issues and bugs, i'll just list them.- The loading time at the beginning and when you load up the game is pretty long.- There's a lot of areas that haven't been added to the game yet.- The framerate stutters for me with V-sync on and in high settings, I know my PC can run it pretty well at it's best, but this feels like a game play issue, not one with my computer.- The game is only about 20% done, so sadly, there's a bit of a wait before getting the full experience...

								Want the ultimate RPG that allows you to do anything? feel like killing everyone? do it! Feel like stealing? Go ahead! Original Sin Is a turned based RPG that you can play along with a friend with who controls the other character. Depending on how you interact with each other the two characters could hate each other, be best friends. or even...lovers (>'.')> <('.'<).Currently in Early Access they let you play about 15hrs worth of content The devs say that the game in total with have 50 hours of gameplay. buy right now you also get the games Divine Divinity and Beyond Divinity. The crafting in this game is very entertaining, if you want to make a pizza you have to have flour, water, tomatoes, and a hammer. Want to make a awesome club? get a branch and cover it with nails.At launch They will also be releasing a World/Adventure making editor to everyone who buys the game. This will add hundreds of hours to the game and give it a long life. For a Early Access this fun and bug free I have no choice but to recommend this game.-Ignious			"

								A friend and I have been looking for a game like this and finding it is awesome. The combat system is a bit weird at first but you start to get the hang of it. Also fights aren't just fights they are epic battles agaist 10 enemies sometimes. The Ranger is a bit crap honestly but it's alpha so still stuff to work on. The duel dialogue is awesome and you and your friend both have a say unlike in other games (Diablo 3). All in all this is an awesome game I recomend to COOP with.			"

								Buy Buy Buy. Support these developers. The environments have more depth and detail than Diablo III. It is like playing D&D. The game play itself is a point and click adventure with a turn based combat system. For an Alpha, this game seems quite refined. Dare I say it, it is better than Wasteland. You may be thinking the price is high for an alpha version of the game, but it is totally worth it. The future of this game is going to be an intense experience. If you like RPGs that are heavy on story and combat, this is the game for you. I strongly urge you check this game out, you will have no regrets. DillengerX Out!			"

								Real-time exploration combined with turn-based combat that is intuitive enough not to be a hassle every time you get into a fight. So far, this alpha build is already a good representation of what I expect from an RPG, having played games such as Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and other Black Isle games in the day.  This game, to me, is a modern adaptation, with mechanics, of the RPG-style game I played back then.  The option to discuss amongst the party and shape the personalities of the characters is a great feature to enhance the immersion.  I hope they'll take this a step further and open/close party member choices based on your party's personalities.Options are limited in the Alpha, which is understandable. Still, I'll have to agree that this game is now near the top of my most wanted releases for this year and in my opinion already worth a recommendation. If you're a fan of RPG's, buy this.			"

								Just how badly has modern game design softened your ability to be engaged in whats really going on in the story? The odds are quite a bit and this game will really show that. It's pretty refreshing to not have a quest marker, GPS tracker, arrow guidance or any quest helpers other then a detailed journal and common directional sense. It's actually funny how simple tasks without these crutches can now cause confusion and maybe embarassment or frustration. Divinity Original Sin will allow you to once again be actually mentally engaged in the game in order to do progression rather then drudging through it like a undead. Speaking of undead there are plenty of them as the Soure Hunter you are you will be battling a lot of them. With very rich detail, an enthralling soundtrack and turn based combat, Divinity Original Sin will satisfy any real RPG fan.			"

												I have been a Divinity series fan ever since I played the first game as an Action/Adventure/RPG game. When I heard they did a Strategy/RPG game, I had my doubts about this game, but after buying it and playing it, I am a huge fan. Although the game play is different from it's counter parts, it's a nice touch and a nice change from the normal game play.This game plays a lot like ""Baldur's Gate"", only in true 3D. Overall, game play is done by a click of the mouse. Although there are keyboard commands, you can pretty much do the same thing using the mouse. Combat is pretty simple, you take turns making moves and choosing your attacks and then the enemy does the same. There's tons of quests and plenty of items to find and use throughout this game. Maps are very nice and big enough to do plenty of exploring.Here's my outlook of this game...PROS====-Plenty of character developement-Plenty of additional characters to find and bring with you to add to the party-Lots of spells and skills to learn and master (Your not just set with defaults, you can add more as you progress)-Tons of maps/locations to explore-You can reach well over Level 100+-With added skills and abilities, you can have well over 20,000+ HP-Gateways allow you to reach locations easily once you find them-Elemental effects that can change the tide of combat-Spells and skills that range from close combat attacks to the long range explosive fireball-Lots of NPC's to interact with and gain addtional questsCONS====- (When I find some I will let you know, most of the CONS I have read, I can't really fault that as part of the game itself. Some complained that there was too much dialog, and yet people always want a story. RPG's are designed to have long stories so I can't fault that to the developers nor the game, I like a good story in RPG games, otherwise there's no point in making RPG games. No story, no reason to be part of the game.)			"

								Even with the game being in alpha, some features lacking explanation, some content not yet included amongst other things this game is worth it's weight in gold. I am having so much fun with this I find it hard to explain. The solo gameplay is good and the CO-OP is a lot of fun when you get some synergy going with you'r bud. If anyone is looking for their next RPG, look no further. Tis' the game for you			"

												I didn't know what to expect when I initially started playing. I knew it was an RPG and a lot of people were hyping it as amazing. My very first impression was that it was clunky and awkward. I was barraged very quickly with all sorts of things to do and places to go it was almost overwhelmingly busy. In definitely wasn't intuitive for me at first. After a couple hours I started getting used to things and it actually started becoming a lot of fun. The more I play it, the better it seems to get. Within a couple hours it very enjoyable and I wasn't noticing any of things that were bothering me before. I'm not terribly far in at the point that I'm writing this, but I'm pretty thoroughly impressed by it and would definitely say it's worth a buy.The simplest way I could probably sum it up is as a cross between Baldur's Gate and Diablo, but it feels much more like the prior.

												If you're into old-school PC RPGs, like Ultima and Baldur's Gate, you gotta get Divinity: Original Sin.It's a love letter to those kinds of games with a great modern sheen. And the writing and world are definitely more Monty Python and Pratchett than Tolkein and Martin. It doesn't take itself too seriously and you can co-op the entire game!It's a great game from a great studio and if you were thinking that the Dragon Age was gonna be your RPG for the year, I'd recommend you give Divinity a shot instead.Also, you can talk to animals and they all have something neat to say.  That dog is dope.			"

												A turn-based tactical rpg with a decent story and and nice gameplay. It is ridden with glitches and requires a lot of polish to be a real gem, but it's redeeming traits are a campaign co-operative mod for two players and the freedom the game gives you to experiment with the abilities your characters have. What it lacks in straightforwardness of the story it makes up in the multiple ways you can progress the game.As the saying goes, always keep a game for two players at home. This is the choice for a gaming couple.			"

								If you liked any other game from Larian..  you will love this one.In the tradition of the Divinity Series it has a fabulous humor,  a fantastic soundtrack and a fetching story.The fights are quite challenging, the KI is really intelligent: for example they loot their fallen comrades when they have a potion and use them, or destroy also elemental barrels, evade the 'traps' you have set or they take cover when there is no safe way to your party. Also the Deciding system is a great idea.. and the social boni, which grant you a lot of passive ability points.And at least.. it has cats!   Quests from Cats, a ""cat wedding"" and a cat-astic Sorcerer!  And a cat-bonus-song in the tavern!The only negative point is also the deciding system against the KI.   They use a quite simple algorythmic which is really easy to look through. There are ~3 ways how they use the rock-paper-sissors game.  For example: first they use Rock, than paper, scissors, rock, parper, scissors, ....       or  rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, ..    it could be that it was only coincidence.. (or my luck-skill!), but it was quite easy for me to win every contest.     I hope Larian make it more randomly.Graphics: 8/10Sound: 10/10Balance: 9/10 *Atmosphere: 9/10Leveldesign: 9/10RPG-Factor: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10Difficulty: 7/10Crafting: 8/10Handling: 7/10Co-op: not testedLevel Editor: not testedTotal: 84/100* tested in Beta, but it was still totally playable and I found also only one Bug.

												It's been a long time since I've played an old school RPG of this quality. I highly recommend it to RPG fans! Here is my breakdown:THINGS THIS GAME DOES RIGHTCustomization - Instead of setting the length and thickness of your character's nose, you get options that matter, like choosing skills, talents, and stats which add up to make your own custom class. Of course, you can pick from a default list and build it however you want if you prefer. This is customization done right.Difficulty - This game will kill you. It's not Dark Souls hard, but it's hard enough to give you a sense of satisfcation when overcomingits challenges.Non-linearity - Aspects of this game are non-linear. Ultimately it does have a linear narrative, but you can almost completely freely explore the world. You're limited mostly by your level, which is the main barrier limiting progression.Grinding - Most RPGs allow you (or force you) to gain excessive amounts of experience to out-level the game's content. That is the fundamental principle of the JRPG. This game only gives you enough experience to survive the next challenge which ensures that the difficulty of the game is more fine tuned and harder to trivialize.Puzzles - Not everything is explicitly a puzzle. Sometimes advancing the story is a puzzle in itself (like the old adventure games). Sometimes a combat has puzzle elements. Sometimes it's just a room full of traps. Either way, there's almost always a problem to figure out.THINGS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT LIKESpeed of Play - This is a slow methodical game best spent enjoyed at a leisurely pace. The turn based combat, sprawling maps, and slower paced movement speed means that it'll take hours to progress through what some may consider a small amount of content. For the perceptive and the patient, though, that content has a lot to offer.Tone - It's a fairly straight forward fantasy setting. It's fun, whimsical, and self aware at times. It doesn't get overly dark nor overly comical. It's not too geneteric or creative. It serves primarily as a backdrop for the gameplay.Co-op Dialogue - You can do rock-paper-scissors to overcome disagreements. What you choose impacts your stats in small ways. Min-maxers beware. Everyone else; have fun.Random Loot - This has pros and cons. On the one hand, each playthrough is different. On the otherhand, a lot of loot sucks. It's debatable whether or not random loot works in a game with a limited pool of enemies.Nietzsche - He can join your party. It's pretty neat if you're in to that sort of thing. The devs didn't actually name him Nietzsche, but you'll figure it out if you went through that phase in your teen years.THINGS YOU PROBABLY WONT LIKEOops - It can be easy to make it hard or impossible to progress in the game by killing an NPC, letting them get killed, or just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off enough. Same goes for accidently clicking on an object or walking into a room that causes the entire town to aggro on you. Save often.Bugs - There's still quite a number of bugs, but they are very quickly being addressed. Still, be warned. Save often.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is the greatest party based RPG to come out in years. It is a game that doesn't hold your hand; you can skip through dialogue with NPCs for quests but you won't get a quest marker, just a note in your log. You don't start off with crafting recipes, you have to read short entries in books to learn how to craft an item, and even then you won't see the recipe pop up in some sort of universal crafting list that counts your materials for you.It's a game that often time requires you to think if you want to progress in a quest. Many times I have advanced a quest simply by inserting myself in the situation - If I were in this world, what would I do next?You are challenged with harrowing bouts of turn based combat in which 4 characters you control ( 2 entirely player created, the others are companions ) and where every move you make is important, and every spell you cast, puddle of water you electrify or spill of oil you light aflame can turn the tide of a battle in your favor. The game has a fantastic system of being able to interact with the environment and create hazards to your advantage.The game is entirely cooperative, and the dialogue has a revolutionary system where coop players or your companions can challenge your word and you have to either reason, charm, or intimidate them into your way of thinking through a simple game of rocks, papers scissors. Should you fail this mini game, it would be like losing the argument and being swayed to your companion or friend's idea, and you have to do something entirely different. It's incredibly interesting and mimics the real word, where sometimes things don't go as exactly planned or you don't always get your way.The game has depth. There's so much to sink your teeth into, and you can easily put in over 60+ hours if you want to complete each side quest while taking your time. The world is so rich that I find myself speaking to every single named NPC just to get their take on the land, hoping they may have a story to tell that may better my understanding for a quest, or have a new quest to give.Oh - and the speaking. The voice acting is absolutely fantastic. The lines are somewhat sparse as dialogue with NPCs is mostly text based, but when you hear characters speak, they're well voiced with enthusiasm and a wide array of voice actors. It's a game that every gamer who appreciates an RPG should experience. You owe it to yourself. If you're thinking about buying it, do it.			"

								So I went against my own rule and bought an Alpha Early Access game on Steam. Divinity: Original Sin. I’ve had my eye on it for a long time, and they released a collector’s edition that comes with 2 copies of the game and both it’s predecessors, plus free launch DLC. So I caved. After playing the game, I definitely see why its still in early access and why save games won’t be carrying over to final release but holy hell is it fun. Its a very diablo-esque dungeon crawler but the combat is turn based, rather than real time and a lot of the different skills play off eachother. For example, I can cast a rain storm over the battlefield which puts out any fires and eliminates the burning status effect. Then my wife casts a chain lightning and it does increased damage to every enemy it hits because they’re in the rain. The combinations are all over the place: oil+fire, water+lightning, theres a bunch. I definitely recommend at least looking into it, if this piques your interest.			"

Spells and magic arrows can combo to be even more effective.THe only real complants I have are that you can't change your body build (males always look bulky etc..) and they went with 2d charactor portraits so your portrait wont represent your charactor sometimes...All in all the game is awesome!  It is fun and very deep and a worthy reentry into a long abandoned genre.  I highly recommend it if you enjoyed the old style of Western  RPGS from the late 90s.			"

												This is a great effort by Larian worth any RPG fan's time.  I loved Baldur's Gate when it came out and haven't found anything that has captured its essence since quite like D:OS does.  Every system in place here is solid and ripe for improvement in future games.  Battle, crafting, skills, equipment, exploration, dialogue... all of these are fun and seem well thought out (though rock,paper,scissors for charisma/intimidate is just ok).  While there is quite a bit of freedom, players are still somewhat limited in where they can go based on level alone.  I accidentally went to the wrong area at one point, unaware why my %'s to hit were failing (it's level-based), and ended up at a large boss battle I couldn't win.  Luckily, the save & transportation systems made it easy to just go somewhere else.  I will say that the game got a bit repetitive for me once I found a combination of abilities that made all battles easy, but that didn't happen until 40 hours in, so I got my money's worth for sure.  I'm very much looking forward to what's coming next using this same game style.			"

												Probably one of the best co-op experiences I've ever played.Wonderful throwback to old-school dungeoncrawl RPGs.If you and a friend are bored, look into buying the Collectors edition, You get 2 copies of the game. If you split the cost it is cheaper than buying 2 standard copies.When a friend and I first started, we ended up wandering into areas we weren't high enough level for, and got stuck on a few quests. Some people will probably find this frustrating. However, I found it be pleasantly refreshing. Too many game now a days just hold your hand through the whole game. It really made us think critically, and overall made it a more engaging experience.Graphics are well done, mechanics are well thought out. Decent story-line (Not great, but not bad either.) Voice acting could be a bit ""cheesy"", but I find it to be part of the charm. Just a wonderful game.9/10And always remember: ""There is no one that has as many friends as the man with many cheeses.""			"

It´s just done so well, that even i can loose myself in these brilliant shemes they call quests.If all dialogs would have been voiced over, this would have been the first game on steam, which i would rank with a 10/10.Thus ""sadly"" it caps at a 9.5 for me and an absolute recommendation for everyone owning steam... which is free, so: for everyone!

It takes the successful elements from games such as Baldurs Gate and beautifully merges it with a multiplayer experience. I've spent many hours on the game and I'm still excited about exploring new locations and fighting new enemies. The divinity engine also allows you to create new adventures which adds more to the replaybility value of the game and is also a fantastic tool for level designers.

The game machanics are full of depth and well designed, most of my critques have been resolved with the Enhanced Edition, characters are memorable and flushed out, cities and villages actually feel populated and personally I love the tongue-in-cheek humor found in Larian's game.

A bit annoying but given the linear nature of the game, you're bound to finish it if you try to explore all the caves, nooks and secret hiding spots. Morality is an interesting concept here... you don't really want to steal everything in sight because it's the fastest way towards getting murdered by the quite overpowered town guards.Paid $40, felt i got my money's worth given the quality and entertainment endured.

												This game is honestly... I... well, I can't really put it into words. Many people compare this to old-school RPGs like Neverwinter Nights, Baldur's Gate, and Ultima, and while I can honestly say I see the homage quite clearly, D:OS introduces many new concepts too. Co-op works seamlessly and flawlessly, the editor is great, and I can't wait to see what modders do with this game. My only main complaint about the game is the inventory system - it's a little clunky and hard to navigate at times, especially when you have a lot of items. The writing is clever and humorous, and I just found myself reading books and immersing myself in the world for hours on end - and I continue to do so as I play through the game.So, how do you know if this game is for you? Honestly, if you've enjoyed any old-school isometric RPGs in the past (or currently), chances are that you'll enjoy this game. For a newcomer to the genre of CRPGs? Watch a couple videos, if you have friends who personally like the game, shoot them a message and ask them why it's great. I also realize it's a pretty hefty price tag, but I honestly think it's worth it - especially with all that comes shipped with the game.			"

												Best co-op RPG I have played in a long time.This is really a game worth trying. The whole concept of not being limited to the class you choose in the beginning is brilliant. You can be a fighter while casting fireballs and every spell available. Or a mage walking around in Plate Male armour.The downside however is that the game still has a lot of bugs. Like the count down timers for abilities and spells doesn't always work 100%. As well as when you play co-op the second player sometimes load as a LVL1 character, but luckily if you load again it fixes itself.I really hope there's going to be an expansion.			"

												I'm 26 years old. I've played RPG games all my life. I grew up playing games like Zelda, Diablo and Balder's Gate .etc. So, I feel pretty qualified to talk about RPG games :DDivinity: Original Sin is potentially one of the best RPG games of this generation. It is definately a 'classic', and I would say that it's (basically) the modern day equivelent of Balder's Gate.Let me put it plainly; if you like old-school role playing games like Diablo 1, Dungeons & Dragons, or Balder's Gate, then you *WILL* enjoy this game. No doubt. You will enjoy it even more if you have someone to play with too (the game supports two players, and you can either play on LAN, specific people over the internet, or in 'public games' on the internet where anyone can join) -- it really has something for everyone! (although i prefer to play solo, cos i'm an insocialable basturd xD)But yea, I don't usually buy games unless they're like -80% sale, but this one was definitely worth it. I've spent about 120 hours so far on this game, and I'm only like 10% through the game (I keep deleting and remaking my characters cos I'm very indecisive on what setup to play xD), so that's value for money!!I fully expect to spend over 1000 hours playing this game, since there is just so much content to explore and find... people to talk to, secrets to reveal... gawd I love this game :'DSeriously. Buy this game. Now. o__o			"

												Divinity Original Sin is a turnbased Coop rpg game with fun combat mechanics and intricate crafting and rpg systems. It takes the successful elements from games such as Baldurs Gate and beautifully merges it with a multiplayer experience. I've spent many hours on the game and I'm still excited about exploring new locations and fighting new enemies. The divinity engine also allows you to create new adventures which adds more to the replaybility value of the game and is also a fantastic tool for level designers.

												I have been a Divinity series fan ever since I played the first game as an Action/Adventure/RPG game. When I heard they did a Strategy/RPG game, I had my doubts about this game, but after buying it and playing it, I am a huge fan. Although the game play is different from it's counter parts, it's a nice touch and a nice change from the normal game play.This game plays a lot like ""Baldur's Gate"", only in true 3D. Overall, game play is done by a click of the mouse. Although there are keyboard commands, you can pretty much do the same thing using the mouse. Combat is pretty simple, you take turns making moves and choosing your attacks and then the enemy does the same. There's tons of quests and plenty of items to find and use throughout this game. Maps are very nice and big enough to do plenty of exploring.Here's my outlook of this game...PROS====-Plenty of character developement-Plenty of additional characters to find and bring with you to add to the party-Lots of spells and skills to learn and master (Your not just set with defaults, you can add more as you progress)-Tons of maps/locations to explore-You can reach well over Level 100+-With added skills and abilities, you can have well over 20,000+ HP-Gateways allow you to reach locations easily once you find them-Elemental effects that can change the tide of combat-Spells and skills that range from close combat attacks to the long range explosive fireball-Lots of NPC's to interact with and gain addtional questsCONS====- (When I find some I will let you know, most of the CONS I have read, I can't really fault that as part of the game itself. Some complained that there was too much dialog, and yet people always want a story. RPG's are designed to have long stories so I can't fault that to the developers nor the game, I like a good story in RPG games, otherwise there's no point in making RPG games. No story, no reason to be part of the game.)			"

												Fantastically deep and challenging game in the style of Baldur's Gate and the great isometric RPGs of old. The puzzles are challenging, and unlike modern games, there's no hand holding to make them easier. The combat is rich and strategic. Most of all, the game changes based on the decisions you make with how you train your characters, how you approach quests, who's in your party, and more. The story is long and rich, meaning you'll easily get your money's worth on just the first playthrough; and because the game can be quite different each time you play, there's tons of replayability.

The quests are done old school style where you do the work rather than go where it tells you to. The dialogs are a joy to read. Pet speaking is a must.

								These guys KNOW how to do a Kickstarter campaign better than most any developer I've seen.  They constantly keep you in the loop about EVERYTHING they are doing and why and showing updated videos covering everything with superb answers to live questions.  It's been a thrill to watch this game come into being and it's the first one that has surpassed all my expectactions.  The Turn Based nature is so versatile, characters can be so unique, Co-Op is just way beyond what I would have expected and then even more beyond what I could have expected is the Editor that allows everyone to create their own games to freely share with others.  Not since Never Winter Nights have I see this attempted.  It's just amazing all they have been able to complete and I'm so happy to have been able to help Kick Start this wonderful achievement.   I'm still holding off to play more fully until the full release but from testing it all out regularly everything has been improved on steadily and I haven't come accross any  bugs personally.  It all looks beautiful and deep.  I've given to many Kickstarter Campaigns, but this one has really been the best by a long shot in covering all that a Kickstarter campaign should.  I hope many other developers go by their example.  While waiting I've just gotted into Divinity 2 which I somehow missed along the way and it's been a blast too!  Larian and CD Project are now my two favorite developers!  Oh and surely check out the Twitch TV interviews that go along with this game.  They are soo good.  One just uploaded on the 18th even.  But check out the ones before it if you have any questions because they go into great depth.   "

												Alright, so the amount of hours played is inaccurate because I have no internet most of the time, so I've actually played around 50 hours. I haven't yet played co-op, but I'm very excited to check it out.    +You can roleplay two characters and have them argue and decide through rock, pape, scissors.            ++The arguments your characters make change their personality and their personality traits give them bonuses to certain abilities and such.    +I really enjoy the turn based combat and ability points system.     +So many quests everywhere that aren't even required!!! EXPERIENCEEE    +A large variety of characters and creatures to fight and talk to.    +Pet Pal trait allows you to speak to animals which are very helpful for figuring out quests.    +A pretty interesting leveling system, though -I wish you got more skill points later on so all of my characters don't end up being completely well rounded without me having to save them, but that's not much of a negative, it's just a balancer.    +Lots of customization in character creation.    +SO MANY PLACES.    +Realistic environment effects that are interactive!!!    -I accidentally got an adorable dog killed by digging up a grave which spawned an undead that he tried to help me fight. :(    -I get the skillbook thing, but I do wish you could get some skills by leveling.    -Crafting is a little confusing, it would be cool if they could add in a quest about crafting.    -There are still a few bugs that need to be worked out, but it literally just came out of beta, so I don't actually mind at all.    -I wish there were more early game companions to choose from.All in all, it's SO MUCH FUN and totally worth it, this is the only steam game that I have ever paid more than $20 for.

												This game is amazingly comprised with turn based fighting, tons of story, and hours of collecting loot. This is not a fast game by any means for me. Very chill and a good sound track to go with it. Main tip i would give is learn the rewards for level system, just a quick over view. It will show you that you need to level up with meaning and don't expect to master everything with any one person. Specialize with your 4 characters and plan ahead. Also there is a way to get extra ability/attribute points for each level, don't want to spoil here but know there is more you can get.			"

												So many of the younger persons have been so spoiled growing up playing nothing but Diablo-like click fests, that they have no patience for a well thought out and deeper RPG experience.Divinity: Original Sin, is throwback to the golden era of the cRPG. The age before Diablo's success spawned a new type of RPG with the most important element removed or given a back seat - THE STORY! Not to mention a watered down version of RPG combat - the button mash.This game is nostalgic. It leaves me with a good feeling just thinking about returning to the game, and experiencing it with the attention and thought that it was designed for. There is great attention to detail, the writing is excellent and humor a fun diversion, and the combat forces you to think instead of like pointing at a group of monsters and clicking them to death.This is what a real RPG game is all about! The developers did an excellent job with this.			"

								Honestly this is one of the only games that actually make me feel like I am playing pathfinder or dungeon and dragons. The trasition between combat and normal roaming around is seemless and works just as it would if you got together with a group of friends and roleplayed. In my oppion this game does it better then baulders gate which was suposed to be the same and D&D 2nd ED.			"

								My brother and I were searching for a great Co-op RPG game for a long time. It's turn-based combat (exponentially fun) is similar to Final Fantasy Tactics and can be punishing if you don't adequately prepare yourself for every battle. Even in early access this is a must have for any fan of hardcore roleplaying games. It includes both classic features (no respawn, set enemy level) and modern alike (save anywhere, online co-op, etc) Do yourself a favor and Get. This. Game.			"

												I love the combat and all the other ♥♥♥♥. Few things to mention:Game is linear believ it or not. Yeah, nobody tells you what to do, but the enemies mark a specific pattern which is their level, if you are not leveled enough which most of the time, finds itself into a linear pattern, then you cannot go beyond the enemies of the same level than you, as they are incredible strong even if they are one level above you.Game is gore as hell, that's amazing.Lots of interesting spells and ways to manage them.The game gets absolutelly repetitive by the end, and the ending right now is horrible. Apparently the definitive edition will improve on many things, like voice acted dialogue and improved ending, improved spells. For PC owners of the original version, the update to the definitive edition will be for free.			"

SummaryA good game with some flaws and great cooperative play.GameplayGame features a simple yet powerful(tho still limited) and funny crafting system and you could completely ignore if you don't like crafting. Crafted items are comparable to found and sold by vendors ones.Combat is... well, almost perfect. AI is sometimes bugged, but devs constantly improve it. Main issue is lava - you could kill anything not invulnerable with it.Questing is fun, well written and diverse, however it seems last chapter was rushed till release as it contains a way less quests than 1&2 ones on bigger territory. Main story is bug-free, but some quests are uncompliteable at 2 & 3 chapters.Non-mage characters will probably face lack of different skills, while mages enjoy diverse and rich amount of spells, both harmful and helpful.ReplayabilityIn my opinion game features zero-to-none replayability cause there's no major game-changing choices you could make. Game is filled with plenty of minor ones but those only affect your end-game stats via so-called ""traits"" like compassionate or blunt.Co-opThe game is desinged for two players. Both of you could do everything, no limits, later on you'll be able to take control of additional henchmen. You could savely afk while your partner takes control of your character. Game poses options for you to play a rock-scissor-paper game when you can't agree on certain answer in dialogue.Last-battle You can't take evil side by killing Astarte. And tis battle is extremely easy even on hard, cause dragon is not immune to disables. Boring.  "

												I backed the project through Kickstarter and I can say I am more than pleased.After a few hours of intense NON-combat questing in the town I solved a few quests in surprising ways, had disagreements with ""myself"" that lead to new friends or foes, skipped questlines by pickpocketing the right people, crafted my first gear and ventured out of town for my first big fights. There is enough content in the first town and surroundings to pass as a proper game these days and that is only scratching the surface. The implementation of co-op, the way that fights can play in turn-based mode while other party members venture the world in real time add another layer of depth and fun to the game. Together with  the classless system I am already contemplating which skill/ability combination I will try for my next playthrough !Highly recommended, a true RPG offering freedom, experimentation and challenge without holding your hand while never being obtuse or confusing.Highly recommended !

This game is perhaps one of the best 2 player co-op games for people who like roleplaying or running a story.  That said, I would state that this game is significantly less fun without a friend, because it's running the two player mode where one player controls two chars (Basically hotseat two player).

												Divinity: Original Sin (DoS) is an excellent rpg game. With stunning graphics, nearly endless choices, and lots of difficult, advanced battles, DoS is an epic rpg. NPC's show lots of personality, whether or not they repeat the same lines over and over. Dos allows you to interact with the environment. For example, if a wooden barricade is blocking your path, you can shoot fire at it, then make it rain to diffuse the fire to continue walking your original path. No game can be perfect, and DoS is no exception. Early progression can be difficult and long, and people that dislike turn based combat will likely dislike the combat sequences in the game. DoS is a top down, Open world Rpg Epic.			"

												I've had a lot of fun playing Divinity as it reminds me of time spent many years ago playing old school Bioware Infinity Engine RPGs like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale.  The engine, graphics, sound and production values are all triple-A quality (for a top-down RPG) which suprised me for a game that came out of a kickstarter campaign. The learning/difficulty curve seems about right (for a non-powergamer playing on normal), with the game being quite challenging at first but after a while the gradual pacing and steady level progression kept me wanting to play. Not to mention the decent exposition and story line that is well above par for the genre. The ""classless"" system works really well, providing a fair amount of freedom in shaping your source hunters throughout and allowing you to adapt playing style as you discover the magic and combat systems.  The turn based combat is really good, and will appeal to lovers of games like X-Com and Final Fantasy. Can't wait to try out co-op and highly recommend this game to RPG lovers.			"

												Having only ever played the tedious intro to Baulder's Gate, I wasn't quite what I was expecting when I bought this game. To my pleasant surprise, this game turned out to be a whole lot bigger and badder than I originally thought. Pros:- Attention to detail in both environment and story/dialogue is really quite astounding. I never thought I could get so immersed in an isometric game until now- The soundtrack is really something to behold. The devs made sure to add music to fit EVERY setting. Many times when I found myself walking around, the soundtrack would constantly transist to the environment in such an awesome way. The OST for this game is very, very good. - Turn based combat is something i'm still new at, but I found it fairly easy to handle as I progressed. There are no difficulty sliders to my knowledge, so the usefulness of your stats/skills/dps will all depend on your team's level versus the enemie's level. Overall combat is balanced pretty well, and can be just challenging enough to keep you on your toes.Cons:- Either I'm just tired or i honestly can't think of anyI've been having a blast with this game so far, it has turned out to be quite the adventure game. Many places to explore, people to meet and recruit, quests to indulge in, and a very well progressed story. This game is a 10/10 for me and I definitely recommend it to any open-world adventure fanatic			"

												9.5 out of 10. Fantastic Game. As an avid Divinity Fan since Divine Divinity, I was excited when I first found out that Larian was going to release another Divinity Game. I played all the Divinity Games from Divine Divinity to Dragon Commander. It is very deserving to be Game of the Year.  I enjoyed this game as much as I enjoyed Skyrim when it came out. Pros: Excellent Turn-Base Combat: Ability to use your enviroment against your enemy is very unheard of in most RPG and how each monster has a specific weakness to a specific type of damage whether it be magical or phyiscally. It's a blast to expierment on what does more damages to what specific group of monsters. And a battle could be in your enemies favor one time and next it's in your favor. Same applies to them. Longvity of a game: So many quests to do, I don't even think I completed all the quests in my 140 hours of playing this game. Excellent StoryHumorous: Especially when you meet Bellegar. Character Interaction, to actually be able to interact with every character and barter with each one actually made me feel like I was really in the world, but I expected nothing less as all the Divinity series aside from Dragon Commanderr had that. No Class Roles: You may have to pick a class to start out with but you don't need to follow the layout. I started out as a Wizard but decided to turn into a Battlemage. Replayablity: Replaying a different class after finishing the game adds so much more replay value. Co-Op: It's so fun to play with a friend, I played with my ex when we were still together and we had a blast playing. Exploration: So much to explore and I highly recommend you explore each and every place of this game you can find secrets, new quests and even legendary items. Music: One Word: Masterpiece Kirill Pokrovsky who is the composer of all the Divinity Music is a master at his art. The music is so blended perfectly with the game and it's atmosphere that it really adds a whole new layer of depth to the game. I could listen to this soundtrack so much and never get tired of it. Cons:The only con I can think of is I wish crafting was more in depth, and more recipes. Crafting seemed pretty non-existing to me while I played and I only used it to craft magic lock. Better armormaking and weaponsmithing would be nice. Still a fantastic game and has overtaken Divine Divinity and Dragon Knight as my favorite Divinity games.  Buy it and play it especially with a friend, the cooperation part really makes this game so much fun. Side Note: Those who complain about the difficulty of this game, sure it is difficult to begin with but it's really easy to get stronger and beat even the most diffiicult battles. With so many quests to do especially without leaving the main city you can easily get to the level you need to be to fight the mobs you see. I know it was hard for me but after some questing and gearing up, I was able to compete against the mobs and if that's not your cup of tea you can always turn the difficulty down. And make sure you grab two more companions in Cyseal before adventuring out, unless you're doing lone wolf build.			"

												This is definitely the best RPG I've played in years. The game has very little hand-holding and it makes you have to figure out stuff on your own. Quests aren't simply little exclamation points over character's heads, you don't have to necessarily run back to town to ""turn in"" a quest, you're not given a little point on a map for you to follow. This game wants you to become invested in its world, and invested I have definitely become. In most RPG's I've played recently I know the names of like, maybe 2 NPCs, because if I need to go to them for some reason the game will say, in capital letters, ""GO HERE AND TURN IN THIS SPECIFIC QUEST TO PROCEED."" This game doesn't do that, it's not its style.The first main quest in the game is essentially a murder mystery, which might not sound too amazing on paper, but it's a fantastic starting point in the game because it forces you to become invested in the world by talking to all of the NPC's, learning their relationships, collecting clues, etc... Your journal in the game recounts what you've learned, but it doesn't make any of the deductions for your, it's up to you, the player, to deduce who you think is the murderer.This type of quest design pervades throughout the game. If you play this game you may become a little frustrated at first because of how used current gamers are to having their hands held, but if you persevere (and please don't use a wiki) then you will find one of the most immersive and enjoyable games you'll ever play.

												The best RPG I've played in a very long time. The closest a video game can get to a pen and paper RPG, Chris and I spent our first 5 hours just wandering around town literally doing nothing but stealing paintings, talking to kittens, and occasionally massacring random villagers. There's a lot of humor, a million ways to play the game, great turn based combat that is definitely not overly easily or too hard. The co-op is the best I've seen in an RPG, you can each make independant decisions and actually have your characters argue ending in a game of rock paper scissors, the victor getting the final say. The game doesn't hold your hand at all, so expect to have to learn and be creative, just as you have to do in a pen and paper story. There's crafting thats entirely experimental that I can't find two online lists that have found all the same things because theres that much. It's classless so you can really make your own character who you want them to be. There's a huge long story to this game, but I've been completely satisfied with my purchase and excited for the rest of the game without even venturing very far from the first town. I highly recommend Divinity if you are a fan of RPGs.			"

												- Pros -*Combat rules very comparable to Dungeons and Dragons. (Attacks of oppurtunity, a stat comparable to initiative, and more)*A comfortable amount of flexibility for creation of your 2 main characters* Fun and relatively innovative conversation system based off of stats and skills you have invested in (Charm, intimidation, etc)*Future modifications could provide endless playability-Cons-*The multiplayers leaves a lot to be desired. You can have four players in your party, and can have 2-4 players in multiplayer. Unfortunately you have to stick with the only campaign out at the moment, so you'll find yourself saving games so you can play that campaign with your friends, and moving onto other save files whether they be online or offline, that will lead you to either replaying the content you just played, or waiting for your friends to come back online so you can share the experience.*The main module's storyline is VERY dry. From having to repeat it a few times I was uninterested by the beginning of the 2nd playthrough. All and all, the game is really entertaining. A solid 4/5 stars type game. I could really use more content that doesn't lock me into this main story. I recommend picking up the game.			"

												Updated Review --I like it!To start with, the world is big, there's lot to do and see and, in some ways a bit too much - your quest log is going to get overwhelmingly full and you'll probably end up somewhere new wondering why the hell you're standing there and trying to remember what your original goal was five hours ago.It looks beautiful, almost too much as it can be very easy to overlook something visually and start wondering what's gone wrong. In particular the ALT key to show items on the ground doesn't show all items, just 'equipable' stuff it seems. Unfortunantly there doesn't seem to be a way to have those items always show either, so you'll be holding down alt a lot.The UI has seen quite a bit of improvement though there are still some bugs to work out, multiplayer even more so. Some examples are the combat log not scrolling, the dialogue not showing you what the other person selected in the log, and the combative dialoge forcing you to scroll up to see some of what was said. Those and a few other things could stand to be tweaked.Progression is a little different from many modern games - you wont get a bunch of points every level that make a little difference but just one every few levels that will make a big difference. This also means not screwing up what you choose is important as, so far, I haven't come across a way to respec. Which is a shame since you're probably going to regret a point or two.Combat is good but sloppy, you can pretty much count on setting things on fire you didn't mean to and having a spell hit a wall when it shows a hit. There's also something a little wacky about a few of the element interactions (fire not always exploding a poison cloud or fire healing a water enemy because it melted ice into a puddle are a couple of examples) - they may seem that way because it's all based on rolls but without the log showing all those odds it's a little hard to say for sure.Despite all that, causing a massive chain-reaction of explosions or stunning a whole group of people standing in water is a lot of fun and working all your party members strengths together to take down someone 5 levels higher than you is great. Even stubmling into a devistating ambush and being wiped out is amusing and reminds you to save often.The music included is fantastic too, though the provided soundtrack, if you got it, doesn't seem to include the full library that was apparently put into the game. I do hope even more music gets added at some point as well since their composer's illness cut into what had been prepared for the game.It's a great game and once the last of the bugs are squished, and Larian does tend to be very good about patching, this game will be amazing.Original Early Access Review --So far, so good!After the Dragon Knight games I was excited to hear something new was in the works. While it's not the same style of RPG, it's got a Baulder's Gate vibe that was still appealing enough to back it on Kickstarter. Indeed, as the crowd-funding went on and more details and goals were reached, it very much became a source of excitement for me.After playing though some of the Alpha I was encouraged. The UI had some rough spots, there were some very obvious bugs and some subtle ones but even the update to Beta included a vast array of improvments that left a much more polished feel.Obviously things are still going to change and I've held back from playing too much before the final version, but from what I've seen so far, if you enjoy a big RPG with what seems to be a delightful level of depth and want turn-based combat where stratedgy plays a real factor, it's certainly worth checking out.

												Do you love RPGS? check.  Did you play old school RPGS such as Badlur's gate or Ultima series? Check.  Then this is the game for you.  I honestly haven't played a game this good since maybe Skyrim.  As mentioned above this game takes elements from popular 90s RPGS and modernizes them.

												Divinity: Original Sin is the greatest party based RPG to come out in years. It is a game that doesn't hold your hand; you can skip through dialogue with NPCs for quests but you won't get a quest marker, just a note in your log. You don't start off with crafting recipes, you have to read short entries in books to learn how to craft an item, and even then you won't see the recipe pop up in some sort of universal crafting list that counts your materials for you.It's a game that often time requires you to think if you want to progress in a quest. Many times I have advanced a quest simply by inserting myself in the situation - If I were in this world, what would I do next?You are challenged with harrowing bouts of turn based combat in which 4 characters you control ( 2 entirely player created, the others are companions ) and where every move you make is important, and every spell you cast, puddle of water you electrify or spill of oil you light aflame can turn the tide of a battle in your favor. The game has a fantastic system of being able to interact with the environment and create hazards to your advantage.The game is entirely cooperative, and the dialogue has a revolutionary system where coop players or your companions can challenge your word and you have to either reason, charm, or intimidate them into your way of thinking through a simple game of rocks, papers scissors. Should you fail this mini game, it would be like losing the argument and being swayed to your companion or friend's idea, and you have to do something entirely different. It's incredibly interesting and mimics the real word, where sometimes things don't go as exactly planned or you don't always get your way.The game has depth. There's so much to sink your teeth into, and you can easily put in over 60+ hours if you want to complete each side quest while taking your time. The world is so rich that I find myself speaking to every single named NPC just to get their take on the land, hoping they may have a story to tell that may better my understanding for a quest, or have a new quest to give.Oh - and the speaking. The voice acting is absolutely fantastic. The lines are somewhat sparse as dialogue with NPCs is mostly text based, but when you hear characters speak, they're well voiced with enthusiasm and a wide array of voice actors. It's a game that every gamer who appreciates an RPG should experience. You owe it to yourself. If you're thinking about buying it, do it.			"

								First time playing the Divinity series and I know this is a far stretch from what the originals were BUT if you're an RPG fan and don't mind turn based combat (which works VERY well in this game). Then this is a must have. I've only clocked a few hours so far but the game is excellent, have only encounted one minor bug, that has to do with letters occasionally missing from the text. There's a lot of reading (on par with say Planescape torment or BG1 or 2) and just about everyone seems to have something to say. EVEN the animals (skill permitting) Highly recommend!  "

												I didn't know what to expect when I initially started playing. I knew it was an RPG and a lot of people were hyping it as amazing. My very first impression was that it was clunky and awkward. I was barraged very quickly with all sorts of things to do and places to go it was almost overwhelmingly busy. In definitely wasn't intuitive for me at first. After a couple hours I started getting used to things and it actually started becoming a lot of fun. The more I play it, the better it seems to get. Within a couple hours it very enjoyable and I wasn't noticing any of things that were bothering me before. I'm not terribly far in at the point that I'm writing this, but I'm pretty thoroughly impressed by it and would definitely say it's worth a buy.The simplest way I could probably sum it up is as a cross between Baldur's Gate and Diablo, but it feels much more like the prior.

Great character creation and progression options. Delightfully interactive environment, and a classic turn based combat system.

												9.5 out of 10. Fantastic Game. As an avid Divinity Fan since Divine Divinity, I was excited when I first found out that Larian was going to release another Divinity Game. I played all the Divinity Games from Divine Divinity to Dragon Commander. It is very deserving to be Game of the Year.  I enjoyed this game as much as I enjoyed Skyrim when it came out. Pros: Excellent Turn-Base Combat: Ability to use your enviroment against your enemy is very unheard of in most RPG and how each monster has a specific weakness to a specific type of damage whether it be magical or phyiscally. It's a blast to expierment on what does more damages to what specific group of monsters. And a battle could be in your enemies favor one time and next it's in your favor. Same applies to them. Longvity of a game: So many quests to do, I don't even think I completed all the quests in my 140 hours of playing this game. Excellent StoryHumorous: Especially when you meet Bellegar. Character Interaction, to actually be able to interact with every character and barter with each one actually made me feel like I was really in the world, but I expected nothing less as all the Divinity series aside from Dragon Commanderr had that. No Class Roles: You may have to pick a class to start out with but you don't need to follow the layout. I started out as a Wizard but decided to turn into a Battlemage. Replayablity: Replaying a different class after finishing the game adds so much more replay value. Co-Op: It's so fun to play with a friend, I played with my ex when we were still together and we had a blast playing. Exploration: So much to explore and I highly recommend you explore each and every place of this game you can find secrets, new quests and even legendary items. Music: One Word: Masterpiece Kirill Pokrovsky who is the composer of all the Divinity Music is a master at his art. The music is so blended perfectly with the game and it's atmosphere that it really adds a whole new layer of depth to the game. I could listen to this soundtrack so much and never get tired of it. Cons:The only con I can think of is I wish crafting was more in depth, and more recipes. Crafting seemed pretty non-existing to me while I played and I only used it to craft magic lock. Better armormaking and weaponsmithing would be nice. Still a fantastic game and has overtaken Divine Divinity and Dragon Knight as my favorite Divinity games.  Buy it and play it especially with a friend, the cooperation part really makes this game so much fun. Side Note: Those who complain about the difficulty of this game, sure it is difficult to begin with but it's really easy to get stronger and beat even the most diffiicult battles. With so many quests to do especially without leaving the main city you can easily get to the level you need to be to fight the mobs you see. I know it was hard for me but after some questing and gearing up, I was able to compete against the mobs and if that's not your cup of tea you can always turn the difficulty down. And make sure you grab two more companions in Cyseal before adventuring out, unless you're doing lone wolf build.			"

												If you have any doubts about gameplay and turn based combat, don't worry and get this game if you like RPG's.Pros:+ Innovative, engaging and entertaining combat system which you have to make a plan and have a decent strategy (I mean a real strategy, tanking with tanks and attacking from range with mages/archers is definitely not enough to win most of the battles.)+ Diversive path/build options, you can build your charecters however you want and it would work.+ Smooth gameplay, nice GUI (which could be little bit better) no bugs, no mess, no sloppyness. Everything has adjusted perfectly.+ Pretty funny. NPC's, dialogues, quests etc. there are moment that will make you laugh out loud.+ Nice graphics, wonderful music.+ Game does not hold your hand, thus enables you to feel accomplishment.Cons:- Looting, and crafting( which is pretty diversive) felt a bit dull and unsatisfactory.- The map is not that diversive and big in comparison with other RPG's.- Optimization could be better. Plenty of people (including me) suffers from low-FPS problems.- I hated Rock-Paper-Scissors which I happen lose more often than I win. So I hate it.That's all.

												Would definitely recommend this game - The classic design your own characters, build your team, steal everything in sight to be profitable, or be a stand-by citizen and be broke. The possibilities are limitless!Really the class design has been done, many-times, but the co-op is what sets this game apart. One of the biggest issues I had with DA:O was the lack of co-op, especially in live time. Thankfully the turn-base of this game allows a single player to be more efficient than a co-op, but it provides a lot more entertainment value.The cons, are some of the bugs have been in the game far too long, and still haven't been resolved. Nothing game-breaking, just minor frustrating item bugs.My recommendation to new players: Teleportation is an amazing spell.			"

												An epic RPG with a lot of player autonomy. Although there are some tutorials, this wonderful game takes a more classic approach and lets the player figure out most things on his own. To summarize:+ A great deal of content. I've played for about 100 hours and I haven't finished my first playthrough yet.+ Much player autonomy. You'll feel free to explore and learn about the world at your own pace.+ Investigating! You'll do a lot of detective work in your quests. You're a lot like an inquisitor, trying to find and destroy evil.+ A good story, with quite a few twists and surprises. + Wonderful, turn-based combat.- Not much character development. It's possible I may have been spoiled by modern RPGs, but I reacted badly to this.- A small of amount of audible dialogue. Most interactions are done through text. Many players are ok with this though.- Too much running sometimes. There is a fast travel system, but you'll often find that you have to run great distances, with nothing to do but wait until the characters reach the destination. "

												This game is amazing. For years I've been waiting for an RPG that could come even a little bit close to Baldur's gate & planescape torment and this one comes verry verry close. Sure it had a semi-rough start (some bugs at release) but even that couldnt stop it from being the top seller on steam. And theres a good reason for that -> the game is absolutely amazing.This game gives the player an 'experience' which is a skill other game developers seem to have forgotten. I applaud Larian for being so ballsy to dare to take the step and go back to the classic formulla and putting it in a modern jacket. They went for it and they 100% deserve the successful sales of it.You can just feel the blood, sweat and tears + a few droplets of love the dev-team has put into this gem.The gameplay, the sound, the graphics it all fits perfectly togeter.A must have for any crpg enthousiast.

								DOS is basically like dungeons and dragons or classic Baldurs Gate but with improved graphics and a great storyline. Gameplay consists of tactical turn based fights and tons of other awesome features including sneaking and stealing which can gain you good items or help you cause extra damage at the start of a fight to turn the tide. You can fight and kill anyone in the game, but doing so can cause dire consequences like being Killable on Sight for the rest of the game to particular factions. 10/10 I suggest playing it. Once I started I couldn't stop. 2 Man co-op is awesome, should check it out with a friend.			"

												A weekend's worth of gaming into this gem and all I can say is that this game has ""it"" in abundance. If you like RPGs and don't mind turn-based ones, you'll enjoy this one a lot.  The combat system reminds me of The Temple of Elemental Evil in some ways, which was (in my opinion) the best-ever interpretation of core D&D rules ever.  Having said that, the turn-based system is fluid and doesn't feel bogged down as some procedural combat games may be at times.The graphics are well done and the environment is interactive in unique ways.  I'm looking forward to what else can be done with this engine and this world. Well done, Devs.  People who enjoy RPGs: get this game and have some fun.			"

								First time playing the Divinity series and I know this is a far stretch from what the originals were BUT if you're an RPG fan and don't mind turn based combat (which works VERY well in this game). Then this is a must have. I've only clocked a few hours so far but the game is excellent, have only encounted one minor bug, that has to do with letters occasionally missing from the text. There's a lot of reading (on par with say Planescape torment or BG1 or 2) and just about everyone seems to have something to say. EVEN the animals (skill permitting) Highly recommend!  "

												I didn't know what to expect when I initially started playing. I knew it was an RPG and a lot of people were hyping it as amazing. My very first impression was that it was clunky and awkward. I was barraged very quickly with all sorts of things to do and places to go it was almost overwhelmingly busy. In definitely wasn't intuitive for me at first. After a couple hours I started getting used to things and it actually started becoming a lot of fun. The more I play it, the better it seems to get. Within a couple hours it very enjoyable and I wasn't noticing any of things that were bothering me before. I'm not terribly far in at the point that I'm writing this, but I'm pretty thoroughly impressed by it and would definitely say it's worth a buy.The simplest way I could probably sum it up is as a cross between Baldur's Gate and Diablo, but it feels much more like the prior.

												So many of the younger persons have been so spoiled growing up playing nothing but Diablo-like click fests, that they have no patience for a well thought out and deeper RPG experience.Divinity: Original Sin, is throwback to the golden era of the cRPG. The age before Diablo's success spawned a new type of RPG with the most important element removed or given a back seat - THE STORY! Not to mention a watered down version of RPG combat - the button mash.This game is nostalgic. It leaves me with a good feeling just thinking about returning to the game, and experiencing it with the attention and thought that it was designed for. There is great attention to detail, the writing is excellent and humor a fun diversion, and the combat forces you to think instead of like pointing at a group of monsters and clicking them to death.This is what a real RPG game is all about! The developers did an excellent job with this.			"

												I am giving this game a thumbs up with a few caveats.  It is almost the gold standard for RPG of this kind.  It is well worth the money, I got 87 hours out of it and I didn't even complete everything.  It is a lot of fun and is a dynamic world.  For example in most games where you see backdrops of crates you can't interact with, in this game you can.  You can move them or set them on fire.  A door locked and can't find the key?  Bash or burn it down if you like.Anyway,  I would strongly reccomend that you wait at least 3 months after this game is released to buy it for the following reasons.  By this time I sure hope there are good walk-though guides available.The quests in this game are very old-school.  They do not give you a lot of hints and there in no guidance in the least.  Some of them may require that you find hidden switches and hit them in the right order.  You will not know how many hidden switches there are.  You might find three of them and try all combos and nothing happens.  Well you need to find the 4th switch and try again... maybe find the 5th one?One quest requires you to find a hidden object, this is a main quest so you have to do it.  This object is ""somewhere"" in a large forest.  You need a perception of like 12 to ""see"" it.  Stats are very precious and you generally are not going to be able to pump perception as other stats are FAR more important.   The only way I solved it was by finding a screen shot of the locaiton, then moving my character there, putting on all +perception gear I could find, and THEN drank a super preception potion and FINALLY I could ""see"" this huge mound of dirt that had the item I needed.It is stuff like this that pisses me off and really takes away from this game.  I would really like to know if people find stuff like this naturally without guides.  Other than stuff like that, this is a great game.			"

												It's been a long time since I've played an old school RPG of this quality. I highly recommend it to RPG fans! Here is my breakdown:THINGS THIS GAME DOES RIGHTCustomization - Instead of setting the length and thickness of your character's nose, you get options that matter, like choosing skills, talents, and stats which add up to make your own custom class. Of course, you can pick from a default list and build it however you want if you prefer. This is customization done right.Difficulty - This game will kill you. It's not Dark Souls hard, but it's hard enough to give you a sense of satisfcation when overcomingits challenges.Non-linearity - Aspects of this game are non-linear. Ultimately it does have a linear narrative, but you can almost completely freely explore the world. You're limited mostly by your level, which is the main barrier limiting progression.Grinding - Most RPGs allow you (or force you) to gain excessive amounts of experience to out-level the game's content. That is the fundamental principle of the JRPG. This game only gives you enough experience to survive the next challenge which ensures that the difficulty of the game is more fine tuned and harder to trivialize.Puzzles - Not everything is explicitly a puzzle. Sometimes advancing the story is a puzzle in itself (like the old adventure games). Sometimes a combat has puzzle elements. Sometimes it's just a room full of traps. Either way, there's almost always a problem to figure out.THINGS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT LIKESpeed of Play - This is a slow methodical game best spent enjoyed at a leisurely pace. The turn based combat, sprawling maps, and slower paced movement speed means that it'll take hours to progress through what some may consider a small amount of content. For the perceptive and the patient, though, that content has a lot to offer.Tone - It's a fairly straight forward fantasy setting. It's fun, whimsical, and self aware at times. It doesn't get overly dark nor overly comical. It's not too geneteric or creative. It serves primarily as a backdrop for the gameplay.Co-op Dialogue - You can do rock-paper-scissors to overcome disagreements. What you choose impacts your stats in small ways. Min-maxers beware. Everyone else; have fun.Random Loot - This has pros and cons. On the one hand, each playthrough is different. On the otherhand, a lot of loot sucks. It's debatable whether or not random loot works in a game with a limited pool of enemies.Nietzsche - He can join your party. It's pretty neat if you're in to that sort of thing. The devs didn't actually name him Nietzsche, but you'll figure it out if you went through that phase in your teen years.THINGS YOU PROBABLY WONT LIKEOops - It can be easy to make it hard or impossible to progress in the game by killing an NPC, letting them get killed, or just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off enough. Same goes for accidently clicking on an object or walking into a room that causes the entire town to aggro on you. Save often.Bugs - There's still quite a number of bugs, but they are very quickly being addressed. Still, be warned. Save often.			"

												Do I recommend this?  HELL YES!This game is a mix of all the old school greats, Ultimas, Baldurs Gates, Torment, Fallout, etc.What I liked alot:Story - There is a huge fleshed out world, lots of lore, books, etc for those that choose to read everything. The actual main story was fleshed out and interesting, it made me want to finish the game to figure out what happened. World - The world was pretty cool, very detailed with little things hiding everywhere for you to find.  They rewarded people that where willing to go adventuring. Graphics - Graphics where great, I had everything maxed out and did't have any preformance issues or find a problem with anything.  There where several different tilesets as well, so the world didn't get boring for me on my run through the game. Spell System - The spells where great.  Nice visual effects, can be mixed and matched to create extra nice effects, ie Lightning + Water.  This aspect also made you more careful, because if your own guy was in the water.... you get the meaning :). You had to be somewhat intelligent about what you cast also, spell effects would cause things like line of site issues, etc.  Hard to heal people when you drop a fireball between you and them and the place goes up in smoke and fire! Comabt - I've read reviews about people complaining about the combat, but it's perfect for this game.  It's turned based, initiative style, there's numerous different ways to finish off encounters and fights. It was as good of a system as I could have asked for for a multi character party game while still maintaining control of each charcter with precision.  What I liked but I thought could use some more work: Character Progression/Building- This was a little confusing at first, I didn't know what did what, what was good, etc. I had to do a little research outside of the game, but once I god how it worked, understood what was important and not so much I was good to go.  It was pretty easy to build an uber party, basically my 2 casters would buff my 2 frontline guys and they would go and destroy everything. With that being said maybe the difficulty could have been a little harder?Questing - Questing was great, there was some awesome quests, things that made me laugh, etc.  Some of the quests where hard to figure out and I had to get help from outside resource sites with where to go next because there wasn't enough clues (for me anyhow) telling me where to go.  I'm not asking for a big arrow pointing to everything, but some  more direction would have been more helpful, either on the map or in the quest log. Puzzles - Some of these where downright hard/impossible. I found myself looking for help more then a few times with how to solve puzzles, especiallly the weight puzzle. I have no idea how anyone would ever figure that out (This is after I tried for over an hour). Just asking for some more direction.  Crafting - The crafting was awesome and vastly helped out once I figured out how to use it but some of the blacksmithing stuff vs crafting stuff didn't make sense.  Regardless, make one of your characters have level 5 Crafting and Blacksmithing by the end of the game if you can.  There's numerous resource sites for how to make stuff also as the in-game books can be confusing, and are not organized, etc.  All in all, this is a great game.  The 9/10 reviews are spot on and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is nostalgic for an old school RPG in todays clothing.  The developers did an amazing job, and hopefully they have an expansion out soon, I know I'll be buying it.			"

												Probably one of the best co-op experiences I've ever played.Wonderful throwback to old-school dungeoncrawl RPGs.If you and a friend are bored, look into buying the Collectors edition, You get 2 copies of the game. If you split the cost it is cheaper than buying 2 standard copies.When a friend and I first started, we ended up wandering into areas we weren't high enough level for, and got stuck on a few quests. Some people will probably find this frustrating. However, I found it be pleasantly refreshing. Too many game now a days just hold your hand through the whole game. It really made us think critically, and overall made it a more engaging experience.Graphics are well done, mechanics are well thought out. Decent story-line (Not great, but not bad either.) Voice acting could be a bit ""cheesy"", but I find it to be part of the charm.

												This is a great effort by Larian worth any RPG fan's time.  I loved Baldur's Gate when it came out and haven't found anything that has captured its essence since quite like D:OS does.  Every system in place here is solid and ripe for improvement in future games.  Battle, crafting, skills, equipment, exploration, dialogue... all of these are fun and seem well thought out (though rock,paper,scissors for charisma/intimidate is just ok).  While there is quite a bit of freedom, players are still somewhat limited in where they can go based on level alone.  I accidentally went to the wrong area at one point, unaware why my %'s to hit were failing (it's level-based), and ended up at a large boss battle I couldn't win.  Luckily, the save & transportation systems made it easy to just go somewhere else.  I will say that the game got a bit repetitive for me once I found a combination of abilities that made all battles easy, but that didn't happen until 40 hours in, so I got my money's worth for sure.  I'm very much looking forward to what's coming next using this same game style.			"

With a solid balance between challenging fights, clever puzzles and a rich narrative, this game has entertained me about 80 hours during the coop campaign. The game accepts the games the RPG genre has seen in the last years without joining them - the developers decided to lean toward old titles like Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate without copying them and by doing so created a game that the player will fondly remember.

												This is definitely the best RPG I've played in years. The game has very little hand-holding and it makes you have to figure out stuff on your own. Quests aren't simply little exclamation points over character's heads, you don't have to necessarily run back to town to ""turn in"" a quest, you're not given a little point on a map for you to follow. This game wants you to become invested in its world, and invested I have definitely become. In most RPG's I've played recently I know the names of like, maybe 2 NPCs, because if I need to go to them for some reason the game will say, in capital letters, ""GO HERE AND TURN IN THIS SPECIFIC QUEST TO PROCEED."" This game doesn't do that, it's not its style.The first main quest in the game is essentially a murder mystery, which might not sound too amazing on paper, but it's a fantastic starting point in the game because it forces you to become invested in the world by talking to all of the NPC's, learning their relationships, collecting clues, etc... Your journal in the game recounts what you've learned, but it doesn't make any of the deductions for your, it's up to you, the player, to deduce who you think is the murderer.This type of quest design pervades throughout the game. If you play this game you may become a little frustrated at first because of how used current gamers are to having their hands held, but if you persevere (and please don't use a wiki) then you will find one of the most immersive and enjoyable games you'll ever play.

												The best RPG I've played in a very long time. The closest a video game can get to a pen and paper RPG, Chris and I spent our first 5 hours just wandering around town literally doing nothing but stealing paintings, talking to kittens, and occasionally massacring random villagers. There's a lot of humor, a million ways to play the game, great turn based combat that is definitely not overly easily or too hard. The co-op is the best I've seen in an RPG, you can each make independant decisions and actually have your characters argue ending in a game of rock paper scissors, the victor getting the final say. The game doesn't hold your hand at all, so expect to have to learn and be creative, just as you have to do in a pen and paper story. There's crafting thats entirely experimental that I can't find two online lists that have found all the same things because theres that much. It's classless so you can really make your own character who you want them to be. There's a huge long story to this game, but I've been completely satisfied with my purchase and excited for the rest of the game without even venturing very far from the first town. I highly recommend Divinity if you are a fan of RPGs.			"

												Easily the greatest RPG since the golden age (the '90s). A witty and whimsical sense of humor mixed together with a healthy plate of dialogue, a brilliant lack of hand-holding, head-scratching puzzles, great encounters and some of the most complex and intricate combat and character creation/building in a decade and a half. 9.5/10Buy it for yourself, buy it for a fiend, buy it for a stranger.

												This is a great game. I love the engine for combat as well as for rendering.  If you like games like Baldurs Gate, Dragon Age etc.  just buy this game and stop thinking so much about it. The only complaint I have.   You can't duel wield in this game. (Devs Please Add soon!)The character customization for skills more then makes up for it.  You can make any kind of interesting class you can think of. Looking forward to seeing more content and what kind of quests the modders can come up with.10/10			"

								So far loving it. The gameplay is very unique. You don't feel as if youre pressured into taking any certain skills, everything is viable, and there are multiple solutions to many quests. The game doesn't hold your hand and lets you explore and discover on your own. The turn based combat system adds a strategic element that i've missed from oldschool crpgs, and Divinity does it exceptionally well.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin (DoS) is an excellent rpg game. With stunning graphics, nearly endless choices, and lots of difficult, advanced battles, DoS is an epic rpg. NPC's show lots of personality, whether or not they repeat the same lines over and over. Dos allows you to interact with the environment. For example, if a wooden barricade is blocking your path, you can shoot fire at it, then make it rain to diffuse the fire to continue walking your original path. No game can be perfect, and DoS is no exception. Early progression can be difficult and long, and people that dislike turn based combat will likely dislike the combat sequences in the game. DoS is a top down, Open world Rpg Epic.			"

												Like Divine Divinity, only better. More variety in skills and stuff. A greatly improved difficulty rating. You should get and play this game if you like RPG(PCtoPC-RPG and PCtoNPC-RPG) and if you like tactical strategy games.The bigger importance is the gameplay in this game but also the graphics are with modern standards(need high end pc to play it on max).As well the people of pc magazines said, I say that this is a combination of Baldur's Gate and Diablo 2 with a little more turn based battle system(which improves gameplay).And unlike other games which are in some points similar (turn based) it doesn't have stupid addins like scissor, stone, paper(for battle). Only logic.Water on the ground?! Ice or more Electricity? ;) Find it out.			"

												First of all, I loved Divine Divinity and I waited long for its spiritual sequel and if anybody who reads this felt the same -	 Divinity Original Sin  IS this sequel. With a playtime of almost 20 hours, i didn't even get to the second map, I mean this game is HUGE! The combat is turn-based, everything else is real-time with a transition between combat and exploring.In all points, it is a upgrade to its predecessor: + a extensive crafting system + beautiful landscapes (although the texture quality could be better) + humor (a underestimated quality in games) + completely unrestricted skillsystem (a rogue attacking with close-combat mageskills, totally possible!) + many objects are destructable, movable AND you can ""borrow"" them. :) + the elemental system! (cover enemies in oil and light them on fire, then make it rain and freeze them. Only one example.) + Well, I'm done here, play the game, find a few points for yourself, be surprised.There is only one downside, most of the dialogs are not voiced, so there's a lot to read. (In case you want to follow the story)Other negative points, as descripted in the ""negative reviews"" section, are also partially true, but in my opinion these are minor setbacks for an otherwise great game.10/10 would play again, oh wait, I'm not done yet.

												Is this the spiritual successor to BG2, as some would claim? No, not really. But don't let that put you off, the game stands tall on its own and it does so better than any other ""old-school"" RPG in recent memeory.In truth, Rivellon has always had its own appeal with its quirky inhabitants and light take on just about everything. The world is alive and full of adventure with the mechanics well done, bar some minor bugs. Humor and magic go hand in hand and any shallow approach to the story is fully made up for with the incredibly fun combat system. Go on, jump in!And if the game alone wasn't already good enough (it really is!), the modding toolset it comes with guarantess we'll be seeing some of the most awesome community adventures since NWN2.

												I won't go into some long summary of the game. Watch the videos and read the info to find out what the game is about.Pros:Depth - The game has a vast amount of creativity behind it, and you just feel like you're playing a very deep game the moment you start. The fact that your companions interact with each other is brilliant and adds a nice Role play element for those who want it, or a chance to ♥♥♥♥ around with a buddy's character for those that want to laugh. Each quest feels and plays differently than the next, and there are some quests in this game that just surprise you with how... different they are to the norm.Combat - While I'm not the biggest turn-based fan, I heavily enjoy the combat sequences of this. Everything looks and sounds dramatic, and the risk of death is high. Even if you're on easy, if you don't have the right class pairings, you'll get smoked and there's no coming back from the dead spare a ressurection scroll (they're pretty pricey too). Thus far I'm only level 7 or 8 but I have more than a toolbar of spells, and each spell has a unique spin to it (I'm a Wizard or something if it wasn't obvious) from the silly teleport which moves the enemy from their location to another location several feet in the air causing massive damage from falling (and to anyone you put them near - definitely a strategic spell if done right) to an AoE boulder which throws poison on the ground for added damage. Don't forget my Ice Elemental for a free tank that you don't have to worry about it dying. However, be wary of boss battles. They are HARDGeneral Gameplay - Combat is one thing, but how do you play the rest of the time? Well, you are given a lot of freedom with what you do. That barrel that you think is silly? Move it elsewhere, or shoot an ice ball at it. That door that is locked? Pickpocket the owner for the key, or shoot an ice ball at it. Some shop keeper has some nice plates on display? Turn into a barrel with sneak mode and steal them away, but don't shoot ice balls at them because shop keepers don't like their stuff getting ice balled. I have a lot of fun just running around a village because I can do whatever I want and the game isn't needlessly punishing for shooting ice balls at things. Just don't hit anyone and don't steal their stuff in front of them and you won't normally get the guards (who are very strong).Settings - While the raw graphics are subpar, the actual look of the game is colorful and fun. In the first few hours of the game I've gone from a ""placcid"" beach, to the first city of the game, to the woods north of the city, and then to a lava and zombie filled graveyard east of the city. Did I mention I'm still on the very first main quest and I'm only level 7? Unless the game ends off the first (and thus last) quest, you're in for a plethora of places to explore and a lot of game to be had for only 40 dollars.However that ends the positives - things this game does better than other games. What does it do that's standard?Graphics - as I said they're subpar. They're not bad by any means. They don't take you out of the game, they just aren't great. Villagers only show up when you're nearby, textures are mostly decent with some that are iffy and some that are downright awful (looking at you tree leaves) but you only notice bad textures normally when you're zoomed in more than default. So don't do that and you're fine I guess. There really isn't a Graphics configuration, just presets. Disappointing. But it's not a terribly ordeal and as I said the visuals are not hindered by the raw graphics. Everything is colorful and has life, so I leave this as not a con but not a pro.Voicing - There is a decent amount of voice work, but the game isn't anywhere near fully voiced. There's a lot of dialogue you get through, so it's to be expected. Regardless, there are MMOs now that are fully voiced, so it's not a good thing. However, I leave it out of the cons because the voices they do have are fun (I've gotten a laugh out of some of the things villagers say and how animals will have normal voice clips) and your characters will voice out a decent amount of lines for you. Adds to the feel of the game.Leads me to the cons of the game now.Loot - For a game where I'm constantly  going on about how big it is, there certainly is a lack of loot. And that rather surprises me. For a game where the point of it is to have two+ companions, you only ever get one or two things from even big bosses. You mostly only get basic equipment and potions from loot. There isn't a very high risk/reward for exploring caves when all I get is a staff I have to turn in for a quest (and the staff isn't even that good to start). Coming from Path of Exile, a free game, I'm more than a little disappointed by the lack of loot. However, take this with a grain of salt as I'm a loot ♥♥♥♥♥ and will go out of my way to get the best loot.Customization - The RPG elements are decent in that you can level up your character however you please. However, you are rather limited with how they look. Very few hair options, just as many face options, a dozen or so skin options, male and female human only (in a fantasy game with demons and undead and orcs in the first 10 minutes?) no facial hair options they only pair with faces (so the only way to get a beard is to use the specific face that has one), and that's about it for customization. It's just disappointing. I feel this part of the game was just an afterthought. ""Oh I guess we should have some choices for how their character looks."" Well it's one of the best parts of an RPG for me, and so I feel left out in the cold. Also, an annoying feature is how your avatar's picture is chosen, not reflective. That means you will not look like your avatar's picture. You can come close if you customize them the way it looks in the picture, but often times you want to branch out (as there's not a lot of choices for pictures) and thus you're left with a picture that is not very reflective of your actual character. Weird choice, I have to say.Multiplayer - When I have to mod in order to play the game the way I want to, and when that mod works perfectly with what I wanted, I again get that ""Gee I think this was an afterthought"" feel. What were the devs thinking with this multiplayer choice? Only two players? You can have four people with you, so why am I limited to two real humans with me? Don't worry, a mod fixes that for you. And the fact that it's so seamless makes me feel a bit annoyed. Why is it so easy for a mod to make the game playable with a group of friends? Why is it not like this to start? And then there's the fact that you can't bring your character(s) with you to adventure. You are stuck with the characters in the game that were there from the start. Yes, if I beat the game and then join my friend as he loads up the game for the first time, it will be unfair. But that should be our choice. What happens when I leave? How about make it so he has to have his two characters, but when I bring my character over it functions much like a mercenary (like Jahan) so when I bail, he isn't stuck with my character, or he isn't just left in the cold alone. Considering the fact that FourPlay (four player mod) makes it so there's a possible six players, and the game does not in the slightest break because of it, I think something could have been worked out.All in all, I love this game. I will continue putting time in it as the pros are all very important features that make or break a game. The cons, while they're important, are not life and death. The game is $40 well spent, and I simply write all of this crap out to vent out what I want for the game in the future, whether it's in this game or in other games. Mods fix one of my cons for the most part (even if I can't bring over my own characters to another's game) so this game is definitely a must-buy. I hope it leads to more.			"

												Updated Review --I like it!To start with, the world is big, there's lot to do and see and, in some ways a bit too much - your quest log is going to get overwhelmingly full and you'll probably end up somewhere new wondering why the hell you're standing there and trying to remember what your original goal was five hours ago.It looks beautiful, almost too much as it can be very easy to overlook something visually and start wondering what's gone wrong. In particular the ALT key to show items on the ground doesn't show all items, just 'equipable' stuff it seems. Unfortunantly there doesn't seem to be a way to have those items always show either, so you'll be holding down alt a lot.The UI has seen quite a bit of improvement though there are still some bugs to work out, multiplayer even more so. Some examples are the combat log not scrolling, the dialogue not showing you what the other person selected in the log, and the combative dialoge forcing you to scroll up to see some of what was said. Those and a few other things could stand to be tweaked.Progression is a little different from many modern games - you wont get a bunch of points every level that make a little difference but just one every few levels that will make a big difference. This also means not screwing up what you choose is important as, so far, I haven't come across a way to respec. Which is a shame since you're probably going to regret a point or two.Combat is good but sloppy, you can pretty much count on setting things on fire you didn't mean to and having a spell hit a wall when it shows a hit. There's also something a little wacky about a few of the element interactions (fire not always exploding a poison cloud or fire healing a water enemy because it melted ice into a puddle are a couple of examples) - they may seem that way because it's all based on rolls but without the log showing all those odds it's a little hard to say for sure.Despite all that, causing a massive chain-reaction of explosions or stunning a whole group of people standing in water is a lot of fun and working all your party members strengths together to take down someone 5 levels higher than you is great. Even stubmling into a devistating ambush and being wiped out is amusing and reminds you to save often.The music included is fantastic too, though the provided soundtrack, if you got it, doesn't seem to include the full library that was apparently put into the game. I do hope even more music gets added at some point as well since their composer's illness cut into what had been prepared for the game.It's a great game and once the last of the bugs are squished, and Larian does tend to be very good about patching, this game will be amazing.Original Early Access Review --So far, so good!After the Dragon Knight games I was excited to hear something new was in the works. While it's not the same style of RPG, it's got a Baulder's Gate vibe that was still appealing enough to back it on Kickstarter. Indeed, as the crowd-funding went on and more details and goals were reached, it very much became a source of excitement for me.After playing though some of the Alpha I was encouraged. The UI had some rough spots, there were some very obvious bugs and some subtle ones but even the update to Beta included a vast array of improvments that left a much more polished feel.Obviously things are still going to change and I've held back from playing too much before the final version, but from what I've seen so far, if you enjoy a big RPG with what seems to be a delightful level of depth and want turn-based combat where stratedgy plays a real factor, it's certainly worth checking out.

												If you have any doubts about gameplay and turn based combat, don't worry and get this game if you like RPG's.Pros:+ Innovative, engaging and entertaining combat system which you have to make a plan and have a decent strategy (I mean a real strategy, tanking with tanks and attacking from range with mages/archers is definitely not enough to win most of the battles.)+ Diversive path/build options, you can build your charecters however you want and it would work.+ Smooth gameplay, nice GUI (which could be little bit better) no bugs, no mess, no sloppyness. Everything has adjusted perfectly.+ Pretty funny. NPC's, dialogues, quests etc. there are moment that will make you laugh out loud.+ Nice graphics, wonderful music.+ Game does not hold your hand, thus enables you to feel accomplishment.Cons:- Looting, and crafting( which is pretty diversive) felt a bit dull and unsatisfactory.- The map is not that diversive and big in comparison with other RPG's.- Optimization could be better. Plenty of people (including me) suffers from low-FPS problems.- I hated Rock-Paper-Scissors which I happen lose more often than I win. So I hate it.That's all.

												An epic RPG with a lot of player autonomy. Although there are some tutorials, this wonderful game takes a more classic approach and lets the player figure out most things on his own. To summarize:+ A great deal of content. I've played for about 100 hours and I haven't finished my first playthrough yet.+ Much player autonomy. You'll feel free to explore and learn about the world at your own pace.+ Investigating! You'll do a lot of detective work in your quests. You're a lot like an inquisitor, trying to find and destroy evil.+ A good story, with quite a few twists and surprises. + Wonderful, turn-based combat.- Not much character development. It's possible I may have been spoiled by modern RPGs, but I reacted badly to this.- A small of amount of audible dialogue. Most interactions are done through text. Many players are ok with this though.- Too much running sometimes. There is a fast travel system, but you'll often find that you have to run great distances, with nothing to do but wait until the characters reach the destination. "

A huge world where you can do so many things in many different ways, like crafting, blacksmithing, customize your skin, solve riddles, negotiate itens, make your build etc. etc. etc. The story is beautiful and well developed, it has so much to do with the things I like to read. The battle system is smart, but sometimes it prolongs, and there isn't so much action, it needs more reasoning. The game isn't perfect, it has its bugs, but the positive points makes me forget them.

The dialogues are fun, the story is good, the environment is highly interactive, the inventory system & character management is superb, and the fresh take on turn-based combat is, I dare say; something that should from here on out be considered standard for games of this kind.While writing this, I still have not tried the multiplayer function, but given that it runs smoothly and bug-free(like the singleplayer certainly has), I can't imagine it being anything less than a great way to spend a weekend.If you like RPGs I highly recommend you get this.

												This game is the best and freshest gaming experience I've had since Skyrim was released in 2011.  It blends the best parts of tabletop D&D rules with Diablo/Torchlight-like experience.  My favorite part though is the level of the detail present in this game.  The quests, the NPCs, the dungeons and so on have an incredible amount of thought and detail put behind them.  This game is truly a modern incarnation of Baldur's Gate.			"

												Haven't played a CRPG this deep in years, a real treat. Love the fact it has co-op. My only complaints are the mechanics are not explained very well and the game can be quite challenging when you first start. The story starts a bit slow and also meanders at time, but that’s not uncommon with open world RPG games. The general progression is still fairly linear and the game has a lot of side quests of varying interests. Overall Divinity: Original Sin is a good CRPG that’s worth your time.			"

												Ok, I don't review games to often. A game either has to be extremely good, or one you wish you could set fire too. So in a nutshell, is this game worth buying?  YesEven for £30? Take all my money!I bought this game in a sale, because I wasn't sure if It was my sort of thing. I like RPG type games, but it's not something I would spend a whole lot of time playing. Now yes I do have a rather low play time so far.. but in this very short amount of time, I can honestly say this is going to steal a whole lot of my hours. If they make more DLC, more missions, then i'm in.. even if I haven't finished the main campaign. The classes seem very well balanced, and theres so much control of what you can do. I'll update as I play through the game, but for now... YES, if you are a fan of this kind of game.. you will NOT go wrong. I'm playing with a friend at the moment, and we are both enjoying this very much.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is wonderful.  From the serious characters to the quirky characters to the crafting and the combat, this game delivers on all counts.  Improving it would be difficult, though not entirely impossible.Two things I love about it: 1. Every battle presents some degree of challenge with few exceptions as the adversaries are equally matched to the playable characters.  Even a difference of one level can be devastating (e.g. a level 7 adversary tends to annihilate a level 6 party member).  This does bar access to some regions of the world, but it does so organically.  You can attempt it and fail or you could mark it on your map and return later.2. All of the skills (special attacks) gained remain useful throughout the game.  In many RPGs, the early skills become useless partway through and/or get replaced by upgraded versions.  In D:OS, they remain pertinent and never get replaced or outclassed by an upgraded version.  This is due to the skills scaling in effect as the characters progress improving their attributes and equipping superior weapons as well as to the old school combat system.  For instance, Minor Heal remains useful later on because its cooldown decreases as Intelligence increases and so, my healer could cast it every single turn by level 13.  I use it while Strong Regenerate cools down and out of combat to quickly recover the party.One thing of which to be aware: The game begins slowly and the beginning is not overly engaging.  It is a game that gets better as you play it which has pros and cons.  The pro is that it is wonderful as I said; the con, that many people give up on it early on.  Honestly, I did not play it for a while because it did not engage me as I am accustomed to games doing.  Give it a few hours and once you can leave Cyseal without being murdered by undead, you can really start enjoying it.			"

												My relationship with this game brings me back to Dragon Age: Origins. I'm not an old school PC RPG player, so I don't have any stories about Baldur's Gate or Planescape. Regardless, this is probably the best RPG to be released since Origins and has captured more of my time than I can scarcely begin to understand. The gameplay lends itself to thought and thankfully doesn't hold your hand with quest markers, flickering trails to the next objective or obvious build decisions. If you're not a veteran of the genre the game is going to sock you in the face over and over again, but it feels so good when you do finally learn to dodge the punch. Encounters, especially with bosses, seem unfair at the outset when they pit your 2 to 4 man group up against 5, 6 or 7+ enemies. A little element mixing and ingenuity can see two turns tilt a battle in your favor or bad positioning have you reloading in a heartbeat. You can use mages to deal massive AOE damage by combining elements such as fire and poison for huge explosions or catering to a melee character with massive magic buffs to create a massive wrecking ball. There's a certain level of sarcasm and wit peppered into the dialogue along with pop culture references that can bring a smile to the face without really overwhelming. Good music, nice looking areas--it's definitely worthy of all of the great reviews it's been getting. In a few weeks I'll probably have a 100+ hours into this and I'll still be coming back for more. There's even frickin' multiplayer, with rock-paper-scissor arguements that can come up between players on how to handle quest decisions. If you don't have a friend you can set your AI partner's behavior and experience two main characters disagreeing. It's fantastic. Oh, you can rob entire towns blind, too.			"

												Original Early Access review:This is shaping up to be a really enjoyable RPG. It has a fun story and the combat is engaging and mostly deterministic. I've played about 20 hours, and I think I've exhausted the currently available alpha content. I'd like to have an option for a free rotating camera; since everything seems to be fully 3d modeled, I don't see any technical reason not to. It would also be nice to have dialog choices somewhere in between ""I hate you and want you to die"" and ""I love you, let me be your slave forever"". Aside from a few small bugs and the above issues, I have no complaints about the game. Definitely worth buying, even if they release the other 80% of the game without fixing any of the issues.Release update:The game is still very worth buying. I haven't noticed any of the bugs that I experienced in early access now that it has been released. I'm playing multiplayer now and it is loads of fun. Co-operating with a friend adds a whole new dimension to combat. Text chat works well, athough text chat is inherently clunky for this kind of game. I'd reccommend being on skype or teamspeak to play with a friend or three. An option for a free rotating camera has been added (I love you for this Larian Studios) with the caveat that the main compaign wasn't intended to be view from the unlocked angles. I haven't noticed any artifacts yet, but I'm incredibly pleased to have the option even if I did see them.Minor griefs:The only bug (new; nothing that I saw in EA still exists) that has bothered me is that walking on environmental surfaces seems to tick the environmental damage way too many times. Zombies can walk across their own secreted poision to heal to full and one of my party members walking across a single meter of poision surface might take 5x 10-15 damage ticks and end up almost dead. The multiplayer chat window makes it a bit tough for both players to keep up with the story when only one player gets to see the dialogue play out in the large font, high contrast window (and view what can be said instead of only what is said). I initially had trouble getting my friend's companion to bind back to him when reloading; it turns out that companions are configured with the first button on the esc menu. The dialogue options are still very binary, the same as they were during early access. Overall:The game plays a lot like D&D (4th ed? no daily limits on spells for spellcasters in this) for the computer. If you like D&D then you will probably like Divinity: Original Sin.New campaigns and mods from the dev tools will only make D:OS better.The overall experience is phenomenal. Grab a friend and start playing.			"

												Do you long for the days of yore? The bygone era of endless rpg's that would immerse you and make you lose all track of time?Games that would let you decide the way to play, the way to react and the actual outcome of the game's story? The days that games that would let you get through those long, cold and wet winters when no child (friend or foe) could be found roaming the neighborhood? No need to dream about the past any longer: Divinity: Original Sin is an ode to those glory days, when RPG's could immerse and entice you so deeply that you would look up after 3 months of playing and ask yourself; How long have I been away from society? Do my friends still know my name? Are my parents still alive? And the most important question of all; Why haven't I finished this game yet?If anything of the above sounds familiar, pleasant or ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME; GO BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥ RIGHT NOW!			"

												Divinity: Original Sin (DoS) is an excellent rpg game. With stunning graphics, nearly endless choices, and lots of difficult, advanced battles, DoS is an epic rpg. NPC's show lots of personality, whether or not they repeat the same lines over and over. Dos allows you to interact with the environment. For example, if a wooden barricade is blocking your path, you can shoot fire at it, then make it rain to diffuse the fire to continue walking your original path. No game can be perfect, and DoS is no exception. Early progression can be difficult and long, and people that dislike turn based combat will likely dislike the combat sequences in the game. DoS is a top down, Open world Rpg Epic.			"

												Fantastically deep and challenging game in the style of Baldur's Gate and the great isometric RPGs of old. The puzzles are challenging, and unlike modern games, there's no hand holding to make them easier. The combat is rich and strategic. Most of all, the game changes based on the decisions you make with how you train your characters, how you approach quests, who's in your party, and more. The story is long and rich, meaning you'll easily get your money's worth on just the first playthrough; and because the game can be quite different each time you play, there's tons of replayability. Highly recommend this game to RPG fans.			"

												Love this game. Very reminiscent of Baldaur's Gate. This game can be very tedious in the way it encourages to forge your own path, explore, and with little to no clues at all on as to whats the next step. This is a good thing if youd rather adventure than be taken on a tour like most RPG's these days. But, frustrating if you get lost easily... The combat is nice as well. Like the BG series the game allows you to explore in realtime but when you meet combat it switches to turn based. This games combat is refreshing in the sense the AI is not at all unintelligent, even on easy they can still pose a threat and its not the same npc every time. It's all a very nice design for a game worth the $40 being asked, with a lot of other features I wont spoil that make it really worth it.			"

												9.5 out of 10. Fantastic Game. As an avid Divinity Fan since Divine Divinity, I was excited when I first found out that Larian was going to release another Divinity Game. I played all the Divinity Games from Divine Divinity to Dragon Commander. It is very deserving to be Game of the Year.  I enjoyed this game as much as I enjoyed Skyrim when it came out. Pros: Excellent Turn-Base Combat: Ability to use your enviroment against your enemy is very unheard of in most RPG and how each monster has a specific weakness to a specific type of damage whether it be magical or phyiscally. It's a blast to expierment on what does more damages to what specific group of monsters. And a battle could be in your enemies favor one time and next it's in your favor. Same applies to them. Longvity of a game: So many quests to do, I don't even think I completed all the quests in my 140 hours of playing this game. Excellent StoryHumorous: Especially when you meet Bellegar. Character Interaction, to actually be able to interact with every character and barter with each one actually made me feel like I was really in the world, but I expected nothing less as all the Divinity series aside from Dragon Commanderr had that. No Class Roles: You may have to pick a class to start out with but you don't need to follow the layout. I started out as a Wizard but decided to turn into a Battlemage. Replayablity: Replaying a different class after finishing the game adds so much more replay value. Co-Op: It's so fun to play with a friend, I played with my ex when we were still together and we had a blast playing. Exploration: So much to explore and I highly recommend you explore each and every place of this game you can find secrets, new quests and even legendary items. Music: One Word: Masterpiece Kirill Pokrovsky who is the composer of all the Divinity Music is a master at his art. The music is so blended perfectly with the game and it's atmosphere that it really adds a whole new layer of depth to the game. I could listen to this soundtrack so much and never get tired of it. Cons:The only con I can think of is I wish crafting was more in depth, and more recipes. Crafting seemed pretty non-existing to me while I played and I only used it to craft magic lock. Better armormaking and weaponsmithing would be nice. Still a fantastic game and has overtaken Divine Divinity and Dragon Knight as my favorite Divinity games.  Buy it and play it especially with a friend, the cooperation part really makes this game so much fun. Side Note: Those who complain about the difficulty of this game, sure it is difficult to begin with but it's really easy to get stronger and beat even the most diffiicult battles. With so many quests to do especially without leaving the main city you can easily get to the level you need to be to fight the mobs you see. I know it was hard for me but after some questing and gearing up, I was able to compete against the mobs and if that's not your cup of tea you can always turn the difficulty down. And make sure you grab two more companions in Cyseal before adventuring out, unless you're doing lone wolf build.			"

												This review is for co-op mode.  Divinity: Original sin is a dream come true for fans of RPGs and Tactical Combat games.  All of the key elements are there: interesting tactical choices, good character building, lots of party synergy and tactics, challenging fights and a decent RPG/fantasy backdrop (complete with good music, environment, characters, the works).I especially like the elemental interplay, allowing you to do things like set an enemy on fire, coat him in acid - which then ignites again - creating a poision cloud, which poisons him, but if he's still burning, it explodes... bwa ha ha.  Truly you can devise fiendish ways for your foes to perish.  They can also be used against you, so be wary.Co-op mode also has an entertaining way of letting you make choices, pitting you against each other in a game of paper-rock-scissors when you disagree.   Over all it's an excellent way to get some fun RPG action with a friend or spouse.			"

												Wow, this game is awesome. It harkens back to the days of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura and Fallouts 1&2. This game is gorgeous at times. The UI is very intuitive, and all of the game's systems are easy to figure out without consulting guides or manuals (at least for someone familiar with this type of game.)The drop-in co-op is implemented very well. The only gripe I have is your partner doesn't create their own characters to use in your game; they play the ones you assign them that you've created. Not a big deal at all.Also, I've run into a few bugs in the game, but nothing that has impeded my progress.I heartily recommend this game for any old school turn-based RPG fans... or just RPG fans who want to play a great game.

												This is a game that has it all-> Exploration, interesting crafting, lore, characters, tactical battles, complex skills, bunch of randomized items, lots of stealing, devious traps, talking to cats, return of the teleporter pyramids, stronghold, mood system, riddles, zombies, buried treasure, pirate bandanas, jokes and references (like the ""nine inch"" nails-ingredient), weirdness and the usual epic ""Divinity"" soundtrack with beloved classics making a comeback. Game is really filled to the brink with numbers to ponder and stuff to try out. A feast for lovers of classic role-playing. No hand-holding - doing ""wrong"" things can insta-kill you though there is some good auto-saving so next time my feeble guys don't aggro the hulking orc brute. No arrow pointing to the next quest step. Quests can be failed.If you remember Divinity 1 - it's just that as turn-based and with updated graphics minus grinding thousands of creatures. Minor negs: -character movement is somewhat slow, biggest issue for me (unlike in Div1)-inventory sytem clumsy and chaotic with the hundreds of stolen items (but not as terrible as in Div1)-somewhat underperforming on i7 with ssd, long loading (just like Div1 all those years ago on my Pentium 3)Still everything considered really addictive and full of innovations: 9/10,This time the backers really got what they wanted. Also I think devs will iron out some problems.Update: 48 hrs played and I can hardly pull myself away. Very addictive indeed.			"

Early Access Review
								An intstant classic and a game made several years too late (where were you my whole life!?) Well, now it's finally going to release and I must say it's a very well made Ultima/Baulder's Gate styled game that will leave you doing random stuff for hours. Literally hours. I think that's the only bad quality of the game. You can play for eight hours straight and seemingly get nowhere. That was the charm of Ultima too, but in this case, for my life and where it is, I don't have the patience.The graphics are very good for the isometric portrayal of the game world, and the interactions with the environment are a welcome sight to see. Although the world feels alive, the people feel dull. Many of the villagers will not help you much with quests as they all say the same thing and do little in hinting you where to go next. That just adds to the hours spent meandering around doing nothing. While I love it when a game does not hold your hand it must try better at making you understand the world you are playing in. Otherwise I'd love to see more map markers for quests.Combat is highly rewarding. Finally we have a game where your tactical decisions mean a lot. I was expecting this from games like Dragon Age but that game never had the envronment as a tactic as much as this game does. Your characters matter, and a team of warriors will be ill prepared against magic while a team of rogues will die fast against a strong opponent. By using your partners to full effectiveness, it feels everyone has a place in the world.The loot and trading is awesome and makes the game feel very free and open. You can do anything you want. Lastly, the music and menu design is very well done. All things considered this is a really well built game, with deep lore to explore, allows you to do anything you want, and keeps you progressing as you play. But I will warn you: be prepared to sink a few hundred hours on your first playthrough (unaided) since a few quests can be a bit overmuch to explore.I'll also add, the first quests make it very slow to have multiple playthroughs of the game. If I were you I'd skip most of them just to get your playthroughs underway. Most of the stuff in the first town is talking and meandering and highly forgettable.			"

												First thing me and a friend did when we got to town was to gear up, I usually talked to the people, while my friends went invisible to their cellars, stealing everything he could find, then we said goodbye to teh NPC and sold everything to the vendors. We got rich and won the game.			"

												By far the best COOP game I've played in years. Alot of fun gameplay, beautifull graphics. Smooth gameplay with your friend. Played all day with a friend, not a single moment was boring. Highly recommend this game, the only downside is that it's only two player COOP for now. Hope they will make it four.			"

												Very difficult and stressful, Takes an incredible amount of time to progress. Still my favorite game to play right now.It does however fall short on multiplayer, only allowing one other friend to acompany you on your turn bassed adventure, however there are mods that allow you or two other friends to play as one of the various npc characters. Of course id rather play as my own but i didnt mind too much as the attiude and character of the npc's are great and its easy to pick a favorite. Highly recomended if yoou have the time.			"

												Honestly this is the best game I have played in years. I can't recommend it enough. Must own for any RPG fan.After playing the game for over 30 hours, I was still surprised by what was possible. You pretty much figure out the mechanics of most games these days in a couple of hours. But DoS has the uncanny ability to surprise you over and over again.			"

												8.5/10: Great writing that relies on irony and camp more than melodrama. Robust character development. Deep, tactical combat. Great looking game.  Only drawback is that the main storyline is a little bit in the background - game relies more on exploration and side quests. I've played about 20 hrs so far, really enjoying it.			"

												This just might be the best RPG I've played in the past decade.It's been a very long while since any game could measure up to games like Baldur's Gate, Planescape, Fallout (not 3) or Arcanum and I was beginning to think those kind of games wouldn't ever be created again. But then D:OS came out and proved me wrong. It really deserves a spot among the best RPG's ever. (Unless you don't like games that don't take themselves too seriously. Larian always puts in a fairly large amount of sillyness, which is I personally like. But it might not be for everyone.)			"

												This is a great effort by Larian worth any RPG fan's time.  I loved Baldur's Gate when it came out and haven't found anything that has captured its essence since quite like D:OS does.  Every system in place here is solid and ripe for improvement in future games.  Battle, crafting, skills, equipment, exploration, dialogue... all of these are fun and seem well thought out (though rock,paper,scissors for charisma/intimidate is just ok).  While there is quite a bit of freedom, players are still somewhat limited in where they can go based on level alone.  I accidentally went to the wrong area at one point, unaware why my %'s to hit were failing (it's level-based), and ended up at a large boss battle I couldn't win.  Luckily, the save & transportation systems made it easy to just go somewhere else.  I will say that the game got a bit repetitive for me once I found a combination of abilities that made all battles easy, but that didn't happen until 40 hours in, so I got my money's worth for sure.  I'm very much looking forward to what's coming next using this same game style.			"

												Probably one of the best co-op experiences I've ever played.Wonderful throwback to old-school dungeoncrawl RPGs.If you and a friend are bored, look into buying the Collectors edition, You get 2 copies of the game. If you split the cost it is cheaper than buying 2 standard copies.When a friend and I first started, we ended up wandering into areas we weren't high enough level for, and got stuck on a few quests. Some people will probably find this frustrating. However, I found it be pleasantly refreshing. Too many game now a days just hold your hand through the whole game. It really made us think critically, and overall made it a more engaging experience.Graphics are well done, mechanics are well thought out. Decent story-line (Not great, but not bad either.) Voice acting could be a bit ""cheesy"", but I find it to be part of the charm. Just a wonderful game.9/10And always remember: ""There is no one that has as many friends as the man with many cheeses.""			"

												This game was the most I've ever spent backing a kickstarter project, and it was worth every penny.  I've been craving a tapletop rpg experience on the PC for ages now and this is the closest I've ever played.  Looks fantastic, but also can run on my laptop.  Great character creation and progression options. Delightfully interactive environment, and a classic turn based combat system.  I've been playing it solo(you can even roleplay both characters in dialog options, and have arguements with yourself. I'm sane I swear:P), but I'm sure this would be a blast with someone else as well.			"

												I have been a big fan of Larian studios since I stumbled upon the Dragon Commander series and was pleasantly surprised when Original Sin appeared on the Steam store. I love Original Sin. The game machanics are full of depth and well designed, most of my critques have been resolved with the Enhanced Edition, characters are memorable and flushed out, cities and villages actually feel populated and personally I love the tongue-in-cheek humor found in Larian's game. Big shout out to Larian Studios for a great RPG that pays tribute to games of old without being dated!			"

												A hardcore oldschool Baldurs Gate style RPG with current day features. D: OS never goes easy on you and at times its going to feel hopeless but overcoming a hard fight or boss is what makes playing this game very rewarding. I did lose interest half way through but now that the enhanced version is out Ill probably give that a go.			"

												9.5 out of 10. Fantastic Game. As an avid Divinity Fan since Divine Divinity, I was excited when I first found out that Larian was going to release another Divinity Game. I played all the Divinity Games from Divine Divinity to Dragon Commander. It is very deserving to be Game of the Year.  I enjoyed this game as much as I enjoyed Skyrim when it came out. Pros: Excellent Turn-Base Combat: Ability to use your enviroment against your enemy is very unheard of in most RPG and how each monster has a specific weakness to a specific type of damage whether it be magical or phyiscally. It's a blast to expierment on what does more damages to what specific group of monsters. And a battle could be in your enemies favor one time and next it's in your favor. Same applies to them. Longvity of a game: So many quests to do, I don't even think I completed all the quests in my 140 hours of playing this game. Excellent StoryHumorous: Especially when you meet Bellegar. Character Interaction, to actually be able to interact with every character and barter with each one actually made me feel like I was really in the world, but I expected nothing less as all the Divinity series aside from Dragon Commanderr had that. No Class Roles: You may have to pick a class to start out with but you don't need to follow the layout. I started out as a Wizard but decided to turn into a Battlemage. Replayablity: Replaying a different class after finishing the game adds so much more replay value. Co-Op: It's so fun to play with a friend, I played with my ex when we were still together and we had a blast playing. Exploration: So much to explore and I highly recommend you explore each and every place of this game you can find secrets, new quests and even legendary items. Music: One Word: Masterpiece Kirill Pokrovsky who is the composer of all the Divinity Music is a master at his art. The music is so blended perfectly with the game and it's atmosphere that it really adds a whole new layer of depth to the game. I could listen to this soundtrack so much and never get tired of it. Cons:The only con I can think of is I wish crafting was more in depth, and more recipes. Crafting seemed pretty non-existing to me while I played and I only used it to craft magic lock. Better armormaking and weaponsmithing would be nice. Still a fantastic game and has overtaken Divine Divinity and Dragon Knight as my favorite Divinity games.  Buy it and play it especially with a friend, the cooperation part really makes this game so much fun. Side Note: Those who complain about the difficulty of this game, sure it is difficult to begin with but it's really easy to get stronger and beat even the most diffiicult battles. With so many quests to do especially without leaving the main city you can easily get to the level you need to be to fight the mobs you see. I know it was hard for me but after some questing and gearing up, I was able to compete against the mobs and if that's not your cup of tea you can always turn the difficulty down. And make sure you grab two more companions in Cyseal before adventuring out, unless you're doing lone wolf build.			"
