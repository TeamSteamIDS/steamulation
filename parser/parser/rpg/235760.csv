												I know the graphics are a little simple, the gameplay is average.  I am having fun unlocking the costumes and dioramas.  I don't think this was a cash grab because it has been in development for 2+ years.  I would say the game is about a 7 out of 10.I am having a blast playing the game, and isn't that what matters?  I bought all the DLC on day one, because I wanted all of the characters and costume, I know this rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.For me it was worth, $40 for Base game +DLC.  Wait for the price to go down and give this game a chance, at least for me it's a lot of fun!Edit: It's Cheap, get it.			"

												I bought this game and the Ultimate Hero Pack dlc during a sale for 50% off. Little Orbit never seem to discount their games past 50% off, and this was the first time any of the DLC had been discounted so I grabbed it. I had been wanting it for a while, so $5 was my buy point.I enjoyed it enough to play through twice (you unlock 1 extra character for finishing the game per difficulty and the character you unlock for hard mode is pretty damn cool), however the character you unlock for finishing the game on normal is one of the worst in the game and lazily coded. The PC versions options are lacking, all you can choose from are resolution and fullscreen/windowed mode. Vsync is off by default, you'll have to force it. The framerate is capped at 30 FPS, but I honestly wasn't bothered by that and I'm usually picky with framerate caps. The graphics very much look like a polished PS2 game, which isn't surprising.. it's a budget TV show adaption.I was disappointed right off the bat after seeing that the online co-op is completely broken. It'll give you an error when trying to create or search for a lobby. I checked the forum and there didn't seem to be any way around this, but I was willing to play the campaign in singleplayer so this wasn't a deal breaker for me. Ideally, the game is best played in co-op, so if you have the opportunity of doing local co-op, I'd recommend that.In singleplayer, you'll be constantly switching across the 3 heros you have in your team, so it does take some getting used to. Focusing on playing only one hero isn't very effective, as your power meter will keep running out and the normal melee attacks (that don't consume energy) are ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and pointless to use most of the time. You'll mostly be spamming power attacks, which is why it's better to use all 3 of the characters on your team.The tutorial kind of sucks. They teach you most of the core mechanics, but they don't tell you about the squad/hero boost, a semi-important feature, which is only briefly mentioned in a loading screen tip, and doesn't go into detail for how to use it. They expect you to RTFM, but who has time for that?! Actually, there are a few other things that aren't explained in detail. When you open a chest, it will appear that it's empty but it has a tiny XP orb that you can't really see, and I think you get money for smashing boxes, but those also seem to be empty whenever they're destroyed. I don't know if this is a lazy design choice, or if it's a problem attributed to the PC port.The money that you earn is almost completely useless, because 90% of the items you can buy are crap. Many of the ""enhancements"" you can buy boost your melee attack power, or your defense. Melee attacks suck, and the game is ridiculously easy even on hard mode that you'll never need extra defense. I ended up using the same 2 items (that increase power damage and energy efficiency) for the entire game. This also means that the hero skills that increase defense or melee strength are useless.About half of the characters in the game suck, they aren't very balanced. You'll have the option to take whoever you want with you into a mission though, except for the team leader, so it's not a big deal. It does however make the game a bit more boring when you're using the same sets of characters for the whole game once you figure out which heroes are good. The best character in the game IMO is Wondergirl, which is DLC. If you're wondering which heroes are worth using, this is how I rank the best of them: Wondergirl (DLC) > Artemis > Lagoon Boy (DLC) > Miss Martian > Nightwing > everyone else. Rocket's also pretty sweet, but she takes forever to unlock so I didn't rank her. Zatanna is useful as well, but only when her skills are maxed.. which takes too long. DLC characters are unlocked from the start, along with Artemis, so you start out with good characters by default. The good thing is that XP is shared with all of the characters, so you can freely choose who you want without needing to level them exclusively.So by now, you must be wondering why the hell I would play through it twice. The answer to that is the game is worth playing through if you love Young Justice and want to play as the characters or test out the superpowers. It's NOT worth playing for the story though. It's meant to fill the gap between season 1 and 2, but the story ultimately seemed rushed and uninteresting to me. The plot is nowhere near the same quality of the show, but it is cool to fight against the majority of the villains from the show. If your only interest is the story, I suggest youtubing it. For $5 + $2.49 for the DLC, I got my moneys worth. If I could, I'd give this a ""neutral"" review rather than positive, but seeing how I enjoyed it enough to play through the game twice, this is worth a positive review from me.			"

												Edit: Wheeeeee, we are getting a third season \(^__^)/ Note: Before you continue on reading, don't buy this if you only want to play MP or coop because the online portion of the game is dead. Recommended for the fans of the show and those who can tolerate your typical tv show\movie\cartoon-based games.When I purchased the game I didn't expect it to be visually stunning nor I expected it to be the second coming of jesus, nothing at all. I simply bought the game because I'm a huge fan of the series and want a third season to be made.Story timeline ? The game takes place between season 1 and 2. While the gameplay is kinda repetitve, the game features variety of characters. Each character has his\her unique way of fighting and his\her unique set of powers. There is a level up rewarding system that allows you to upgrade your character as you progress in the campaign. Adding to that the variety of bosses (shameless self-promotion: I already have a walkthrough guide for the game published on steam in case you wanna see the list of bosses). There are total of 15 missions divided to 3,2 or 1 section. Every 3 sections are set in a different location. For example; A missions conists of 3 sections set in Gotham, another in Greece, etc...The voice acting in this game is awesome, why? well, because the voice actors who voiced our beloved superheroes and their rogues came back and lent their voice talent for the game.The only thing missing that is related to voice acting, in my humble opinion, is in-game dialogue\banter between the team members(just like in the show), that would've been cool.Here is a list of things I didn't like in the gameCons:           - Dumb AI: Sometimes your assistant AI can be annoying and so fraustrating. They get stuck behind a door or a crate easily, lol.                   - Blue Beetle, Wonder Girl, Bumblebee, and Lagoon Boy are DLC characters.                   - Lack of attack combos (there are like 2 or 3 combos for each character and that's it)                   - No 'restart mission' option from the pause menu. You have to exit all the way to mount justice (campaign mission menu), go to the missions list and re-select the one you wish to replay.                   - While it's not that big of an issue for me, the graphics could have been polished a little bit more.                    - Again not an issue for me but the MP never functioned properly ever since day 1.If I to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, it would be 6.5/10. It is an ok game at best, you might wanna give it a try when it goes on sale.....			"

												I'll preface my review by saying Young Justice: Legacy has a lot of potential and is probably a decent game on consoles - it just wasn't ported very well to PC.Me and a friend - both fans of the Young Justice cartoon - purchased the game to play online together. Before even playing the single player campaign, we attempted to play together. I was able to host a game, but I was stuck on the ""waiting for players"" screen indefinitely. My friend could not even host OR join a game, he simply received vague error messages.With multiplayer not working, we decided to play the single player campaign separately. I immediately noticed that the game's menus did not have support for a mouse cursor, you must use the arrow keys. Additionally, the ""space bar"" had been chosen as the primary ""make a selection"" key, not the standard ""enter key"" or mouse click. These were minor inconveniences, but probably a red flag.In the game, I was immediately annoyed by the fact that the camera could not be adjusted. In narrow pathways (which this game has many of) the camera really impedes gameplay. I ignored this and continued on. The combat was pretty typical of a hack-and-slash. Mindless, but enjoyable. Unfortunately, the voice emotes were very repetitive and triggered way too often. My biggest issue with the combat was the enemies' aggro radius. It was very small, and moving out of this radius caused the enemies to reset and go back to their patrol locations. I found myself accidentally exploiting this as I was playing. I would attempt to back off a little bit to do some ranged attacks and the enemies would reset, giving me time to regain health. It was very unnatural.I continued. I found my first chest, which I had hoped would contain some interesting item - but it was empty. My friend found the same chest, no item. I ran into another game-breaking bug. I have two monitors, and my cursor was not limited to the game screen. As I encountered larger battles, I found myself clicking outside of the game and minimizing my session.At this point, I exited the main game and decided to take a look at the mini-games in the central hub; particularly, the trivia game. The game seemed interesting, especially for fans of the game, but every time I finished I assumed the game froze because I could not return to the hub. The UI prompted me to press ""space bar"" to exit, but this did nothing. Eventually, I discovered that you actually had to press ""s"" to exit. One of the many control-based typos in the game.Overall, the combat was pretty polished and fun. Fans of the Young Justice cartoon would appreciate the story. The graphics were very out-dated (I've seen comparisons to the Gamecube, which are pretty accurate) but they weren't unreasonably bad.Unfortunately, though: the menus were frustrating to deal with; the controls were unintuitive and typos worked against you; and the game wasn't interesting enough to justify the gameplay bugs (empty containers, bad AI).

												If you enjoyed the Young Justice TV series, then this game was something that you were probably looking forward to greatly, and something which we had all hoped would tie together different aspects of the show. The game is meant to take place in the years between Season 1 and 2 of the TV series, and is meant to fill in a lot of the gaps that happen in between these points. I wont go into spoilers, but the game does cover some of the aspects that weren't explained in Season 2, with a reasonable explination as to the events. That, really, would be the only reason to purchase this game, but I'd highly reccomend you just find a Let's Play and learn the story that way.The gameplay at release was quite glitched, with the multiplayer feature not even working out of the box, and because of that, there is a lot of trouble finding a co-op game. If you're lucky and have a friend that can play it, then you're fine as you can play together - unless you have a network card that doesn't support each other, according to the Developer's posts on the Steam forum. That's okay though... except that Single player also has a lot of issues. Firstly, they never explain the controls to you in any meaninful way if you use a gamepad - and you'll want to use a gamepad - so you spend a bit of time figuring out how to even do certain moves, such as your heroes/heroines special attacks, or the Sqaud move, for the group or single. On top of that issue, there are various crash reports that are visible from the forum; I myself have the game crash when I attempt to go to the challenges section, and if I press B during hero select on Multiplayer, it crashed the game entirely. The Developer hasn't released any content for this game since they ""fixed"" multiplayer - which took almost 2 weeks after release to even comment - and has not made their presence known on the support forums either, making it appear that this game is all but dead to them.Combat in the game tends to get a little repative, as there is little challenge in it across the entire game, and boss battles are rarely a challenge even on hard. Whereas it had a chance to create something amazing with an entire catalog of DC powers to come from, Superboy, just seems EXTREMELY underwhelming in attack power, and hits just as hard as Miss Martian, who the game states is physicall weak. There seems to be very little balance between the heros, with many of the feeling the same, and the ones that do feel special, they become your go to heroes because they are so over powered compared to the others. For example, one Hero gets a heal that impacts an circle AOE, and you need to be in that AOE. The next healer you get, impacts EVERY hero on the map, no matter where they are, and heals for a far greater amount, making the first hero almost meaningless to play as. This game, really, lacks any real gameplay, or even more important, game stability. Unless you were a big fan of the TV serieds and want to support that, then I wouldn't bother getting this game. Read up on what the story is, watch playthroughts of it, or something to that extent, because even if this game hits $10, there are far superrior titles with less bugs even at that price range.			"

												i can say that this exceeded my expectations, but they were already low, based on trailers and screen shots. The only reason I actually bought this game, was because i wanted to explore the story gap between the 2 seasons. The story was pretty good, but I didn't like the graphics at all. The combat is ok, but it turns into a hack/slash game really fast with repetitive combat and watnot. I would only recommend this game if any fans really wanted to find out what happened between season 2 and season 1.5/10 would punch the crap out of bad guys again			"

												This game appears to be abandoned. Multiplayer doesn't work (apparently if you have certain combinations of DLC), trying to create or join a game just results in connection errors. This has been a problem for months but no peep from the devs or publishers.It's full of weird glitches like missing text, missing menu options that magically reappear sometimes. This is a console port so it tells you ""don't turn off your console while autosaving"". When you hold the right-trigger to use your powers there's nothing on the screen showing what buttons do what. This game is trying to be like the Marvel X-Men or Marvel Ultimate Alliance action RPG/brawler games, but it's missing most of the UI and gameplay features that make those games fun.The graphics are pretty bad. They look like 2005 or earlier, but the game came out in 2013. Textures are blocky and muddy, there are no graphic options other than resolution, and the game won't start at all if you have it in full-screen mode. Even text and menu items are blocky and jagged.I wish I could like this game. I wish I could recommend it. There aren't enough games like this on PC. Unfortunately, this one is terrible. If the devs ever come back and fix it up I'll change my recommendation but for now, meh. It's possible to have fun with this game if you can overlook the many many flaws, but you have to be pretty desperate for a superhero action RPG brawler. 4/10			"

												++Bad Port, Clunky contorls, Good Voice acted story++ Being a DC fan helps considerably!--From a post by Flextacy on GameFaqs-- He or she says it perfectly.Gameplay wise think of this game as a DC Comics version of Diablo.You always have a party of 3 members, if you're playing by yourself you can freely swap between characters, one aspect i find annoying is when you are just running around the AI characters don't run around on their own exploring, they follow your movement exactly, so it's like you are controlling 3 characters at once, however as soon as enemies are spotted they go off and do their own fighting, it's very simple ai though, so i really recommend playing with 2 other human players.My thoughts, well it is a diablo style game, but with console or DS type of graphics and character design making it what us “PC master race” folks would say is a low quality PC game. The port is barely passable but playable and after getting use to the controls it is tolerable but clunky. Along with a bad PC port comes things like periods when the game takes camera control away from you and it's crap but shot lived, few options, non rebindable keys with a few keys that are used for more then one thing which have you say dashing when you are trying to revive an AI partner etc. All in all worth $10 to me(DC fan) but looks and feels more like a 5-7 dollar game.

												Young Justice Legacy, a highly anticipated game ever since season 2 finished back in March, 2013. Loads of reviews on Steam and the internet say stuff like, 'Terrible. No Don't waste your money.' and to be honest i was debating whether or not to buy it. I cracked and my inner nerd came out and i bought it, and boy I made great choice. People say, 'The controls are really bad and uncomfortable,' Now I'm not going to lie i was pretty anxious and scared about that until i realised that considering I bought it 2 years late the controls had either: A) Changed, The production team decided to change them due to way to many complaintsorB) They were just plain picky and the controls didn't suit THEIR way of playing.It is literally your average 3D fighting games, WASD to move, spacebar to jump, Mouse 1 for medium attack with Mouse 2 for strong attack, as well as 1 2 3 4 for your special moves.Young Justice: Legacy takes place between season 1 and season 2 and how Aqualad joined sides with his true father (SPOILERS) Black Manta. It also sadly shows how Tula (Aquagirl) died. The entire soryline was simply perfect. It was constructed so well that is nearly impossible to actually stop playing. The charcters are really well designed, still from the TV show but what really caught my eye was a few of the characters that looked alot like they were from Disney Infinity game (especially Bane) and honestly it looks aMAZING! Unfortunetly there is no such thing as a perfect game :( As much as I love Young Justice (WHICH I DO LIKE HEAPS) There are some flaws. The game tends to crash a whole lot of times, I've encountered about 5 times when in the middle of a level (which is super long with absolutely no checkpoints or anything   (will talk about that soon)   and the entire game crashes and I have to start again from the start.  I can't stress enough how annoying that is. Another minor negative thing is the cAMERA. You can control it by looking around but there are times when it does it for you and it is most stressful thing ever because you can't tell where you are going.The levels are really long which is great don't get me wrong but if you and the 2 other CPUs fall you have to start from the start. There is this one level where you must kill all enemies while a lazer follows you, so you must act fast and work as a team, but since the CPUs aren't team players they pretty much just sprint into the lazers leaving you to take measures in your own hands but if you are not carful and touch the lazers well you start from the start.Honestly that's about it. The game is simply great and i would recommend to just about everybody! 8/10! What really annoys me is the fact that there isn't any Steam Profile Backgrounds for this game D; *cough cough* Steam *cough*			"

												Absolute ♥♥♥♥.No, seriously, this is HALF of a complete game here.To me, it feels as if it was a company not finishing their work and trying to sell this off as a means to get some of their losses back. Whether true or not, I'm not here to argue.At $40 (Or even $60) it's straight a rip off. At $2.99 it's bearable but hardly worth it. If you're interested in the story bits, go watch some YouTube Videos. Save yourself the trouble. The Good, the Bad and the ARE YOU GOD DAMN KIDDING ME!?Young Justice the video game is a good idea baked into an uneatable bun.The combat is basic at best and annoying at worst. All the moves you want to do are locked behind Energy meters. Other characters you might be interested in either take far too much time and effort to simply unlock to try them out only to find out they're pretty lackluster or other characters are DLC/Non playable.The boss fights are annoying to say the least and offer a large health bar, cheap attack moves and a rinse-n-repeat style of bland gameplay.I could go on and add more detail but seriously, you can take a quick look and see this game went through development hell and was supposed to be on the Xbox 360. Even for the PS3 or Xbox 360 this game should've been better than it is.			"

												Well, I guess there's a first time for everything.I know the game is lousy based on what I've seen on Youtube. I wasn't expecting much from a game designed to pander to the fans of the series. But I gave it a shot, cause well I'm a fan.My God, this is the worst PC port I have ever played. First indication was the lack of options in the Options menu. If the config launcher only has Fullscreen and Res options, something is wrong.The second is how the game loves to switch its own settings around. Settings do not save, so I have to reset to Xbox controller (cause the keyboard layout sucks, who uses Spacebar for confirming selections?) everytime I start the game. And the game seems to like to shut off my ClearType, so everything looks jagged and horrible, even after I quit game. Graphics are atrocius, but that is expected. What I didn't expect was how poorly optimised it is to my laptop. It crashed my laptop twice so far, with lots of switch to desktop bugs in between. Game is beat 'em up, which is going into Dynasty Warriors territory. But for a first timer, I was not taught about levelling up, switching characters from what tutorial they gave. Combat is rather sluggish, from bad fight animations, lackluster effects when beating people up, to unresponsive and slippery button controls. You just mash buttons, there's no timing involved. At least with DW, there's the effect of beating and throwing people around.Really, the only praise I can give is the VA is from the show itself. And even then I feel like its not their best performance. Collectibles do, however, help fill the 5-year gap, if you can bother to find them			"

												I bought this game because I'm a huge fan of the series, and I wanted to show my support.If you're interested in the game for the same reason, then definitely BUY IT.If you're interested in this game for the gameplay, and for fun, then I don't recommend it. The graphics are are so 2001, and the actual gameplay is too repetitive. I wish that the designers put more time and effort into this since it definitely has a large market, and really has a lot of potential.			"

												Crap controls remove any chane of this being a good game. Clearly a very bad console port. I do not think they put any effort whatsoever into setting up a decent control system. They did not even enable the mouse for the menus.May be a good game, but the controls are so bad, I never even got to start it.			"

												Don't  buy this game. I owned the mobile version but thought the computer version would be better as is often the case. It's not. The mobile version is sophisticated and a good blend of action and strategy. This is simply a clunky poorly controlled hack and slash. The mobile version equals the pc game in every cosmetic way. The only reason to buy this game is if you aren't able to buy the mobile version. Even then wait for a sale.			"

												Disappointing, all things considered. The combat was beyond easy, and not challanging in the slightest. The catch phrases that each character uses become incredibly annoying after a while. Boring use of collectables throughout the game, decreasing replayability. Most of all however, the story was exceedingly bland. No interesting twists, nothing really linked up, a very disappointing return from the writer of the TV show. Where was the reveal of Jason Todd? Where was the break up between Miss Martian and Superboy? Where did Tempest go? Why is the camera angle really odd in some places and unchangeable? On the plus side, the graphic style is quite nice, the use of all the characters is quite cool.			"

												I bought the game because i thought there was a LOCAL CO-OP, but there isn't. The online doesn't even work either. The game also felt really rushed as the graphics are very low par and the animations and gameplay are pretty bland as well. Its pretty much a hack and slash rpg, it would be a great if the local or online would work, but for 20.00 the game isn't really worth it. If i were you I would avoid this game unless it goes on sale for like 9.99.			"

												The controls are wonky and the camera is so easily confused and your characters get stuck all the time and you open a chest and there's nothing inside? And you press the button again and it replays the opening animation but there's still nothing there.  It says ""Smash objects to get Young Justice coins"" but no coins ever come out.  But you still might get them?  The banding between the characters is hilariously terrible.  You'll fight the same five enemies over and over.  Events won't trigger and doors won't open and you'll have to restart levels.  To fight the same five enemies over and over.  With the clunky controls. And the confused camera.  And everything.  And everything.It's so ridiculously awful. It is a perfect kusoge.  You'll be frustrated by it and you'll laugh at it and you'll get more frustrated and you'll laugh again.It does have good drop-in multiplayer.  It is simple enough that young superhero-loving children can play it, although holding down a button and pressing other buttons for superpowers is fiddly and silly. This game is silly.3/10 and that's being generous. But recommended.  It's not so bad it's good.  It just triggers a certain type of nostalgia for me.  Plus my daughters can play it, and they're young enough that they don't even notice how terrible it is.By the way, don't buy individual character DLCs.  Just get the Ultimate Hero Pack.  It's the same price as a single character and it includes them all.			"

												Like the beloved cartoon, this game completely has the charm of this DC Comics band of young heroes in a very story-driven adventure game.It may not be as competent as Marvel's X-Men/Ultimate Alliance games in terms of performance and roster, but more than makes up for it with it with how engaging this superhero journey is!
