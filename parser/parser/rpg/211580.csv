												Ah, Wanderlust: Rebirth. It's been too long since I played you, and I still have good memories...But, every time I try to go back to playing Wanderlust: Rebirth (WR from now on), I end up remembering why I stopped playing it in the first place. Let me just get one thing out of the way: I do consider this game to be particularly good for what it is, a 2D top-down beat'em-up RPG. WR would be even better had the developpers not centered its gameplay on co-op with other players. And so I start explaining why I don't recommend WR...First, as the entire game was developed with co-op in mind, there is actually content of the game that can't be accessed in solo gameplay. Yes: because everyone likes playing with randoms or, even better, can convince his friends to play a game only he seems to like.The first point segues into the second: playing alone you get AI team-mates, but they are just a sliver short of being useful. The reason for this is that the AI teamsters tend to get killed incredibly easily by certain enemy types while not amounting to doing any real damage (or healing) to contribute, in a general way. They are also clearly not balanced to help you in the higher difficulties, meaning that it does end up as if they weren't really there. It even gets insulting when, as the Paladin, you can't even use your skills to bring them back to life, AS WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY WERE A REAL PLAYER INSTEAD. What's the point? Are the developpers telling us that only some classes work for playing solo?Third, for a game with WANDERLUST as its name, you don't tend to wander much at all. Exploration is minimal, having most scenarios (or chapters, if I remember how the game calls it correctly,) being linear and driven by a quest that is very clich√©. I'll admit that you DO wander through a somewhat varied diversity of caves and forests, and that perhaps the setting of the game has a worthy backstory that ends up either unseen by the player or forcefully fed at him depending on perspective and situation, but you would expect initially to have a little more freedom exploring a world full of annoying monsters for you to beat up.Fourth, the enemies. Maybe if this point was a little more balanced in favour of the single player or by how many players there are in the game, the earlier three points wouldn't stand out as much. But come on! Some enemies are plain ludicrous in their balance. Blood slimes, even if ""rare"" in the campaign, are about the most annoying thing in the arena game mode if you can't finish them off quickly, or rather, quicker than they can leech off your useless AI budies' health into their own; blood slimes can also one-shot you, given the right conditions. And this is simply the enemy that pops to mind as the most unbalanced: poisoning spiders and the annoying elf casters also come to mind, if you really want a list of sorts.Fifth... is definitely the grind. You would not believe how much you have to grind in this game... and you'll hate why, too: you need 3 of the previous tier of items to craft a next-tier item. And you also need tons of crappy small parts semi-randomly to craft things. And you need a ""blueprint"" of the item you're crafting. And the ingame currency as well, lots of it. And then this consumes space in your already limited and otherwise useless inventory. See where I'm getting at? You're not even grinding to become more powerful, oh no: you're grinding to raise a few numbers just a little, so that coming across an elf mage isn't immediately lethal at least. Leveling up is instead done by how well you scored on a chapter, which then gives you X of a total of Y skillpoints that the chapter can give. Meaning that playing alone is much harder in addition to the lackluster AI buddies, especially when you have to rely on them since most other things in the game are broken. Heck, the only way it could be worse was if you decided to actually play WITHOUT the AI buddies, which I believe you can, but why would you? It's better to have 3 meatshields and possibly a buff or two for 10 seconds than to die in those 10 seconds just because everthing was targetting you and you didn't kill the most dangerous things as fast as you could.Also, that I know of, the multiplayer scene is practically dead. Maybe you can get into a game with a stranger, MAYBE. Timezones apply, of course. Be wary of desynchs, too: those can be quite annoying, with everyone stuck waiting for something that will never happen because the other person doesn't have the exact same data.So, why did I bother making this review? Simple reasons. Primarily to warn you not to buy this game, but also to tell you that most of the things I listed are promised not to be issues with the sequel of this game, the (as of the time) yet unreleased Wanderlust Adventures. Seriously, DON'T BUY THIS GAME. You'd do the developpers more of a favour to buy the next game and extra copies if you care about them (thus creating a larger player base for an inherently better game by gifting the extra copies) than if you bought this game right now, or ever.(Edit: the Steam store finally has the aforementioned Wanderlust Adventures here,  , in case you were wondering.)

												So this is a hack n' slash RPG with crappy graphics.  That is kool. What they don't tell you is that you only get 50% of the exp for beating a level unless you manage to beat the level doing as little damage as possible to all the enemies so that you get very high combo numbers. (Yes it's true, I asked the developer) You don't get extra experience for beating a level again. Nor do you get experience for their challenge levels. You can only try to get more experience by getting the higher combo numbers and thus a better rating.  There are all kinds of really powerful skills. You can max out maybe 2 of them and if you use them you don't get crap for experience.  So, in short this game is based on repetition and ineffectiveness, while discouraging the use of the games advancement system. This is extremely irritating and a horrible idea. Also, it's just what the developers had in mind. The last boss is also a very annoying fight where you whittle away at him only to have him heal back while he can literally kill you in one shot. Avoid this piece of garbage.			"

												Fun game with nice art, gameplay mechanics and great potential, but the wonky UI, extremely poor controls and spartan tutorial text makes it incredibly hard to figure out how to do anything in the game. A quick Google search will bring up a lot of these frustrations. Devs apparently haven't bothered to address any of these issues for over two years. I'm hopeful that their new game will be much easier to figure out. Had some fun while I was trying to figure it all out, but it just doesn't feel worth it.If you do decide to give it a shot, here's a heads up: You'll probably want to play this with a controller. As painful as the controller was, the keyboard setup was next to unbearable.4.5/10			"

												A valiant effort by a small development team, however, don't expect to jump in this game and start playing multiplayer immedeately.  To start off, the game forces you to do a terrible tutorial.  Even though it does'nt last very long, its still incredibly painful.  Secondly, as far as I could tell, everyone who was playing the game at the time, including myself, had extreme difficulty setting up multiplayer matches to play with friends.  Games that emphasize co-op play should have match making capabilities that are really easy to use.  The frustration this brought myself and a friend was substantial.  I bought the game on sale for about $3.00, and I am not even sure if that's a fair price.  The difficulties with the multiplayer alone are enough for me to not recommend this game.			"

												I bought this game on a sale because I had read a few reviews on-line suggesting it would be a pretty decent action/RPG type of game, but after having sunk a considerable amount of time into it, I honestly cannot recommend it.On the surface, the premise is pretty simple: You battle your way through 10 chapters of action as the story unfolds, and you earn Character Points to use in developing your fighter.  You can replay chapters to try and earn 100% in them, but at times, it's not clear what this even entails, and from what I can tell, there's no way to review this information once play is underway.  This is just one of many holes in the game, however.On the good side, the graphics are charming and fairly well done, and there are some pretty decent musical tracks throughout the game, as well.  You won't have problems picking out the enemies, and it's nearly always obvious when an item has been dropped to pick up.  The gameplay itself is fairly straightforward, and there is the occasional side quest to keep you occupied.  Combat is pretty much button mashing; there is some nuance when it comes to the block function, but aside from this, you'll basically be spamming your weapon strikes and/or special ability--at least in my experience.I've managed to get 100% in the first 5 chapters on Normal mode, build up my stats significantly, and equip better items.  Yet there is STILL no way for me to beat the final boss.  The game has three difficulties: Normal, Hard, and Epic.  The game is structured to basically force you to play through every chapter at every difficulty level to be able to complete it.  Without doing so, you can't win.This is my overall perception; a lot could be resolved if the game simply provided an instruction manual!  Virtually every single nuance of the game requires you to experiment and figure it all out for yourself.  The biggest offense here is the crafting system.  You can occasionally pick up blueprints for better weapons and armor; I have about four of these right now.  However, I cannot craft ANYTHING yet because of the sheer costs, and the crafting process itself is not explained anywhere in the game that I have found so far!  Additionally, you don't just find the necessary items; that would be too easy.  Nor are the items themselves even remotely easy to come by.  I've had to replay the same chapter where I know I can find a particular element multiple times to earn enough of it.  You ALSO have to have in your possession three of the type of item you want to create.  Want to craft a new helmet?  Well, you have to already have three other helmets in your possession.  On top of that, you have to pay a staggering amount of money (tokens), earned primarily by completing chapters over and over again.  The item I want costs almost 6600 tokens, which I have now.  But I don't have three helmets, so I'm going to have to spend about 1600 tokens to buy two more helmets, spend a ton more time grinding for more coins, and then maybe I'll be able to craft the helmet I need.  As someone who is used to grinding in video games, I find this to be absolutely LUDICROUS.  Adding even further to this insult is that such items are EXTREMELY rare as far as loot drops from enemies; in fact, you'll virtually never get an item drop from an enemy unless it's the occasional orb that restores all of your energy.  It seems that only certain enemies drop such items, and they apparently only do so in pre-determined places throughout the game.  So you can't even effectively farm for what you want during your multiple replays of the game.And this doesn't even go into the truly major problems of the game.  The afore-mentioned block function actually requires focus points (the yellow energy bar) to use; even if you're not actually blocking an attack, that meter drains just from holding the button.  Once it runs out, you can't defend again until you recover some points by resting.  In the early chapters, this can be troublesome but isn't completely insurmountable.  However, after you get past about Chapter 4, the enemy barrages and patterns make it to where it's virtually impossible to block every single attack and effectively retaliate.  Every retaliation opens you up to another enemy, whether it's from one that's close in (you will likely get surrounded A LOT) or from a long-range monster throwing boulders at you.  In later stages, where you begin dealing with mages that can quickly spam you with fire and lightning attacks, you can be dead before you even know what hit you.  Some enemy barrages come so quickly and in such fierce numbers that getting surrounded is almost an inevitability.  When you're trying to block and retaliate with special attacks, your focus meter will drain very quickly, and it only takes a few hits to kill you at that point.  Additionally, some enemies have attacks they can just repeatedly spam, forcing multiple blocked hits and draining your focus points at an extremely high rate, meaning within seconds you can be forced to take the damage and likely die as a result.  (This is especially true of the final boss, who has a multi-hitting attack that he sometimes just spams over and over again.)  At this point, just trying to complete the game seems like nothing more than an unending slog.There's also an extremely nagging control problem in the game.  I'm not sure if this affects game pad users specifically, but there are maddening moments every time I play where my character just simply STOPS MOVING or simply will not move in a direction I press.  I have to let go of the controls and then press again to get him to move at all, and this happens frequently right in the middle of combat.  To be fair, I use profiling software with my Logitech controller, so it's possible there's some issue with this setup (which works in almost every other game I play, by the way) that I'm not aware of.  But it's another issue that brings down this game.  There's also an apparent sound bug that prevents Direct Music from initializing if you have an Asus sound card; make sure you disable GX in the DSP Mode settings of the driver software (my apologies to whomever posted that solution for my not having the link to the thread for this review).In short, I find this game to be the worst combination of tedium and frustration, with really no sense of completion or even a feeling that at some point, you can actually complete the game.  Yes, I have beaten the final boss on Normal mode, but you get the worst ending for doing so; you apparently can't get the ""real"" ending without beating him on Hard Mode, if not in Epic Mode, which brings me to my original point about forced replaying to actually win.  Wanderlust: Rebirth is an unforgiving and at many times unfair game that only leaves me more exasperated after each play session as I discover some other roadblock to my progress when I know intrinsically what I need to do to win.  I simply cannot do it thanks to game design that prevents me from even getting any better weapons or armor that would give me a chance in the final battle.  I cannot say enough to avoid this game unless it's completely reworked and rebalanced.			"

												[Spoiler-Free Review]Wanderlust: Rebirth should come with a disclaimer stating your experience with this game will largely be influenced by the number of people you play with. Although the game is entirely playable in an offline single player environment, I found playing in such a way severely hindered my enjoyment of the game.Whether or not we care for them, the Action RPG genre has evolved a few staple conventions. When a game largely ignores these, it's noticeable.Story and Scope: The story is extremely short (around an hour or two to complete the normal difficulty mode), it's unimaginative, and failed to captivate me in any meaningful way. Scenarios felt unimportant as resolution to any situation often devolves into fighting this, that, or the other thing. The world of Wanderlust is barebones, at times lonely, and devoid of life.Character Development: Characters are one dimensional and expendable, protaganists are mechanical vessels who only strive for the next piece of bait dangled in front of them. Although they're with you from the very beginning, you never grow any attachment to your unnamed NPC comrades and NPC's in towns will rarely, if ever, acknowledge your presence, save for the odd, ""Hello"". You walk ""through"" towns not ""into"" them.Interesting Gameplay Mechanics: Enter an area, fight, move on, rinse and repeat. Your out-of-battle experience is monotonous and boring. Collecting items and equipment becomes cumbersome as your in-game pouch for holding these things is much too small to quest for extended periods of time without micromanaging your belongings to make room for the next thing.Exploration/Adventure: There is no sense of discovery because there's nothing to discover (except the odd coin in a breakable barrel or randomly appearing treasure chest). My first instinct when playing a game like this is to scour the areas for chests and barrels, secrets and treasures. There's no point in trying any of that here though, you'll quickly find you're just wasting your time. To top it all off, invisible walls are everywhere, preventing you from walking past even carpets in open hallways (with treasure chests placed on the other side to further remind you of what you can't do in Wanderlust).Diverse Locales: Ransack location after location, each location serves only as a battleground. In fact, you begin to feel inconvenienced by the discovery of a new area because it just stands between you and the only enjoyable part of the game - the fights.Intense Battles: You enter an area and fight anything that moves, rinse and repeat. melee enemies employ the same swarm-bumrush strategy upon encountering them (limiting your ability to move), ranged attacks are unobstructed by obstacles leading some battles to feel cheap.Multiplayer: The best thing about the game. Multiplayer ""Crawls"" are enjoyable. Story mode levels progress in the same way as in single player, but at least you can develop actual strategies with your teammates. The connection between players is crucial to the formula that makes this mode a success. Without cooperation between actual players, the experience is too rigid.Replayability: There's enough to keep you coming back for more if you want to improve your character's skills and/or equipment or want to go for achievements.It's hard to recommend this game. The only redeeming quality besides it's graphical style, is it's multiplayer, but you can get that in many better developed packages. I'll continue playing it to collect equipment and achievements, but I'd encourage people to skip this one unless you've got a group of friends who don't already own something better (like Dungeon Defenders).Update: A month later...Thankfully the in-game population has grown a bit more since I wrote this, so finding people to play with isn't such a challenge anymore. I've been playing every day for basically three weeks and have come to the realization this game isn't so bad if you ignore it as a single player experience and only play in multiplayer modes. It's also a lot less like Zelda than the screenshots lead me to believe (part of my initial disappointment). In my experience it's actually a lot closer to Smash TV and Total Carnage (games of that ilk) - especially in Crawls.I still wish things were a lot more polished, but even as it is, there is fun to be had with this game, it just isn't immediately apparent.

												Wanderlust: Rebirth walks a disappointing line between success and catastrophe.  Close to fantastic in concept it simultaneously fails to meet basic needs to a crippling point.  The key mapping is the worst I've seen in a long time.  I can appreciate the 1980s graphics, but no one wants 1980s menu options.  On top of that, the clunky combat and unpolished gameplay seems like it skipped its beta stage.  I hope the developers return to their drawing boards with the community's feedback to develop the next version of Wanderlust - I'm convinced there's gold at the heart of this mess of a game.			"

												This game, I'm going to be honest, this game is bad, BUT worth every penny spent.I simply love this game, the fun that I have while playing this is genuine, it may not be the most perfect game, and its story may be super generic but this game is a gem among friends. Screw it, I can't really explain this any better, and I could list the downsides but the only ones that you should know about are the ones that would be considered for not buying the game, the other ones can be taken in a comedic light.1. the game is buggy, there's no real way around that, and yes sometimes its game breaking but it would only last until restarting the game.2. the game is rather short, 10 levels and that being on 3 different levels of difficulty (which by the way is actually difficult)3. The game has little guidance involved, sometimes you are left with figuring out some parts of the game that really should have been explained by the tutorial.4. The game is impossible to 100% without playing with competent non AI players. (steam group for remedying this situation)http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Betterthanmybuttocks/But honestly, the game is a fun time and if you can look for a coupon for this, there are plenty floating around.

												I can't seem to find any public parties and I mostly play solo in games. My solo experience is that the AI party members prevent you from getting a good score since they rob you of hits and damage. If actualy party gameplay is like this as well, then you are constantly competing with party members to attempt to get a semi decent score sadly. If that's the case, I don't think I'd play with other people even if I could. Also, the AI is simple so naturally they die all the time and are barely a distraction for monsters. AI party members in the crawl die way too fast even on the early levels. They would need to have better AI or be significantly stronger to be actually be a viable helping hand in single player mode. I like the look and feel of the game but the solo experience is not really good. I would really love to play Wanderlust Adventures pre-beta/beta and see if the solo experience is still like that. I really hope it's been tweaked to be more rewarding and entertaining. Having AI party members hold back your score/dying easily in harder difficulties is terrible honestly. I hope a Dev reads this when making Wanderlust Adventures. I have high hopes for WA and will definitely be a backer if that's what it takes for the game to get better and my feedback to reach the Devs.			"

												I really wanted to give this game a chance, for some reason. Maybe because I spent $8 on it. It fails in several ways:The AI companions are awful. They often stand around, not attacking, and when they are attacking, they are in the way.The landscape can obscure where you're fighting, so you don't know where the enemy that's hitting you is, or where you are.The damage numbers are the same color for you getting hit, your party members getting hit, and your enemies getting hit, and non-boss enemies don't have a health bar, so you don't really know the status of a fight.Perhaps more importantly, I couldn't see any health bars for my AI companions, so as a cleric, I just had to spam heals without knowing when they needed it.The sprites/animations are pretty poor, you can't face/attack diagonally which really sucks, and I couldn't tell if my party members were dead, or if they were alive and just standing around (which, as aforementioned, happens in combat).The difficulty/loot scale is awful. The first boss was super easy, and your rival who apparently lost to it comes back next level and wiped my party, constantly stunlocked me and killed me 4 times, so I just had to hold block and get in one hit at a time. Then the loot I got from finally beating him was worse than what I already had.The game doesn't inform you of many things, such as when I thought I was stacking enhancements on an item, I was actually just overwriting them with another. No info on that.Your AI companions have no dialogue. Zero. No story, they just follow you around and no one else acknowledges them. Awful storytelling.Speaking of which, the main story doesn't come in until 40 mins in. That time is spent winning a tournament you didn't join, and fighting through tons of boring battles to get to the celebration of your really easy victory.The one cool thing is the abilities are cool, but the hotkey system is annoying, you can only have a few powers hotkeyed at a time.Overall, I really wish I didn't spend my money on this game. Don't get it. It feels very unfinished. Oh yeah, the most annoying part: after suffering through the story to see if it improved, there were some enemies that spawned behind some terrain that neither they nor I could get through. Their ranged attacks couldn't get out, and I had no ranged attacks, and my party wasn't even moving (they might have been dead, but the sprites are such that it's hard to tell). I couldn't leave the way I came, and I couldn't progress until they died, but they were stuck and therefore so was I. I had to quit and lose all progress in that chapter. Now I'm done.			"

												W:R's multiplayer is broken, and its enjoyment factor is upped through multiple players (as some of these reviewers have already pointed out). Maybe after an update I could recommend this game, but otherwise it's just another chincy indie rpg trying to replicate the SNES ""glory days."" Secret of Mana was fun because you could two-player or multitap it--the fun was lessened exponentially in single player. Strictly hack-and-slash gameplay of Mana (and W:R) becomes quickly tedious in single player. Play Hammerwatch instead.			"

Playing characters that use mouse aiming with a controller is annoying, clunky and difficult. Playing characters that do not use mouse aiming without a controller is annoying, clunky, and difficult.

												Unfortunately. I find this game generic. Controls are a mess, the game itself seems to run in a clunky manner, and it's attempt at recreating the 90's style RPG is a bit off. At no point during gameplay did I feel engaged. The storyline isn't original, and there is little depth in what you are trying to accomplish. The reward system for ""Missions"" in this game makes it feel as if they broke away from attempting an action RPG and decided halfway through to attempt an arcade game. Many claim this game reminds them of Secret of Mana. However in my own opinion, had this game came out at the same time Secret of Mana had, I would still have chosen Secret of Mana. The art style did hit fairly close to target in trying to emulate the 16 bit era, however once again, depth and immersion are still a huge issue. The towns, the map, the lands feel all bland. Many of the areas in this game use a rather dull color palette, which to me personally is very unappealing. One of the big strengths in Secret of Mana, and even Zelda, aside from their gameplay and mechanics, was the color palettes and music used to really hit on target with the feeling you get from certain areas in the game. I commend W:R for attempting to recreate this feeling. But I suggest the developers go back and really spend a lot of time analyzing exactly what made those games of the 16 bit era classic.			"

												There's nothing really wrong with this game. The gameplay is solid and it's a charming game, but like others have said, this game is very dependant on who you play it with. Therein lies my main complaint with the game. You need to use a 3rd party client like Hamachi to play with your friends online. I don't really have a problem with this, but some people just don't want to go through the trouble, as Hamachi can be daunting to people who aren't familiar with it. I'd absolutely recommend this game if it had better multiplayer options, but as it is, I'd say avoid it and cross your fingers for improvements in a sequel.			"

												Sep 23, 2015: IT JUST GOT WORSE...  So after chatting with some friends who also had negative experiences I found out how the game got worse.  It rewards xp through combo length.  Where's the problem in this?  Well...  if you run though the game using the worst gear possible and only playing each level once and getting everything caught in an endless combo, you can reach maximum level.  If you fail to preform ANY of these actions, well, sucks to be you, because xp doesn't stack from replaying previous levels, it just replaces the worse score with the better score, and if you try to go back *with better gear* to try for a higher score, it's mathematically impossible considering your old score involved a 58 hit combo and your new weapon 2-shots any of the 18 enemies.Jul 8, 2014: It crashed so I wasn't able to play very long. The controls are awful. The tutorial was confusing, I had to find a PDF online to figure out how to craft. The multiplayer is wretched, you have to get your whole team to stand on a symbol to move to the next ""map"" and the maps are very small so you're doing this constantly. If someone doesn't stand on it, you can't move forward. The multiplayer server list is really slow to load, only shows a handful of servers, and then you have to hit F6 or F7 to flip through these tiny pages of servers which it makes you wait to retrieve. You can't use your mouse in the menus, you use W A S D instead. The mouse is only used for aiming your weapon, for example fireball. The fighting itself is boring and repetitive and brings nothing to the table. Not a fun game and it is badly written.  Avoid at all costs. The tutorial is confusing, the GUI is bare, the music is painful, the chat system archaic, controller support awkward, and most of the features go unexplained. If a player doesn't feel like playing past the awkward start, it's a poor excuse for a simulation, not a game. Before attempting to sell this game for 8 dollars, try creating a clear tutorial (Ex. Super Meat Boy), A familiar GUI (Ex. Dragon Warrior/Quest 4, NES), high fidelity music (Ex. Rogue Legacy), an up-to-date chat system (Ex. WoW), Mindfulness of controller context (Ex. GTA4), and maybe some in-game help system or documentation (Ex. Civilization 4). Widescreen support wouldn't hurt, and having options and other menu items available at the start screen is a requisite on consoles for a reason.Feb 28, 2016: I feel this needs another update from my recent discussions.hey guys, let's make a game that's basically 4 player multiplayer only""""then make multiplayer near impossible to set up with friendsand make it so 3/4 classes are gamepad only, while 1/4 is mouse onlyand make exp dependent on combo length while also being a highest score onlythat way we'll prevent people from grinding levels to grind exp! (...while failing to realize that by making it combo dependant you need to get perfect scores every level if you want to be competative, otherwise you'll be gimped because higher damage = smaller combos)			"

												In the begining there were a few guiding principles of game design: logical interfaces, fluent controls, challenging the player and simple multi-player.Wanderlust: Rebirth however took the short bus to game design school and missed these important principles.The interface and menu system are morbidly fascinating; even equipping a new item is a small adventure unto itself as you attempt to decipher the arcane menu system. The mouse isn't integrated into the menu system as we can't garuntee that people will have a mouse hooked up to their computer! Instead we'll navigate this menu with the W,A,S,D keys. Want to use a new spell? You'll have to look it up in your spell book then go to a different window, click and drag invisible lines between runes then do a small pirouette and hope that the you were holding the correct mouse button. Oh didn't we mention? The mouse we're not sure you have is required for spell casting.Talking with NPC's is initiated with one button (also doubling as your menu button) then progressed with another button. All of these decisions and more will make you wonder ""Why on earth would you design the interface this way?""...because of REASONS!No matter how you choose to play this game the controls are utterly baffling. They mouse is required to cast spells but moving with it? We'll have none of that! Sure this is a top-down view and it would make more sense to simply click a location to move there but that's too mainstream for Wanderlust.You're using a controller there? Let me eliminate half the keys and make sure that two of the remaining ones can't be mapped to trigggers, stick push, start or select. Also Let's navigate menu's with the D-pad and move with the Analogue stickbut never shalt their roles be reversible or interchangable! That modifier key that you had to hold to access your second set of hotkeys on a full keyboard? You don't need it now that you've got less buttons to work with!All of this could be forgiven however if the core game mechanics held up well. Which, of course, they don't. Playing co-op with a caster proved to be an exercise in futility as the poor melee class was unable to reach enemies with his stumpy little sword before they burst into flames. Inspite of this the combat is laughably easy, particularly with multiple players, as the enemy tends to sit in lovely little clumps and wait for you to attack them.Progression is handled by way of wandering in whatever direction the game will allow and hoping that you end up on the right path. Luckily there is no open-world, multiple pathways or even competing goals to stop you walking down this long corridor of frankly baffling art choices (Why is the GRASS in this CAVE every colour EXCEPT green for instance). However this is designed to be a multi-player game, I think, so what it really comes down to is how easily I can play with friends. Well I'm glad to report that private games seem to not work at all. Luckily there were only 3 public games open at the time we played so we added a fourth one. Trying to kick an unwanted player however was an exercise in futility. The menu sequence ""Menu -> Players -> [Player Name]"" presented me with only one option, Back. Again proving that no one actually bothered to try and design a functioning menu system.Graphically Wanderlust: Rebirth  wouldn't fly as a DOS era game, let alone today. The graphics don't seem to be retro-styled as much as just poorly drawn, The world consistently shows you oddly coloured and out of place objects that you just can't interact with or even investigate. NPC's are drawn in a painful blend of cartoon and ""high-school student who didn't take art class"" realistic. The background frequently doesn't give you any clear indication of what is and isn't a walkable path and the colours are just garish.In all Wanderlust: Rebirth is the kind of fascinatingly, humourously bad game that puts it on par with classic films like ""The Room"" and ""Troll 2"" or games like the original ""Postal"". Worth the admission price only on the suspicion that you'll get joy from mocking it.			"

												I'll just list some of the worst things about Wanderlust: Rebirth, because there are far too many for me to bother listing them all.-The controls are horrible.-The menu is ugly and difficult to navigate.-I frequently die from getting stuck on enemies and objects.-It has worse graphics than an RPG Maker game.-The story and characters are boring at best, and groan-inducingly predictable at worst.-Not enough inventory space to hold all the worthless crap you get from enemies.-Each chapter features several tiny, uninteresting filler maps that you have to go through to reach your objective. These frequently only have one or two enemies in them. Sometimes they have none at all. They might be more interesting if the tilesets weren't ugly as hell.-When I get critical hits it displays a giant text box that blocks my view of the enemy. Enemies also frequently spam screen-filling attacks. These, in combination with the fact that the game expects you to read enemies' ‚Äútells‚Äù and block their attacks, creates a rage-inducing and borderline unplayable experience.-Ironically, the game is totally linear, and has no exploration whatsoever. So much for wanderlust.Wanderlust: Rebirth wouldn't even be worth playing if it was free.			"

												The game has an interesting concept but the execution is just bad. There are lots of small design decisions that really cut away at any fun. It's obviously meant to be played coop, but having to wait until every party member has read the dialog is slow - or on the flipside, feeling rushed to read it so you don't slow down your party members. Each map is incredibly small, barely more than two screen-sizes big. To advance all of your party members have to sit in a small space and you have to push space. It sounds trivial but it's just a very unfun boring process after the 10th time. It feels like the design gets in the way of what I want to do.There's lots more to get into. The pvp feels unbalanced. The combat isn't terrible but it's just not fun enough to warrent spending any money on this game.			"

												This game is hard to recommend. From the difficult and hectic gameplay, to not knowing what the hell is happening on screen. I found this game frustrating and completely lacking in meaningful characters. Other than the very clique storyline, there is very little in this game which would entise me to replay the levels.  However the graphics are quite charming and for the price i picked it up (v.cheap), a bit of a bargain.			"

												To start off, fantastic game. It is simple, yet difficult. Getting started can kinda be frustrating at points just because of the lack of damage and such, but overall it is really easy to play. I am a little bit into it and I already really enjoy it. It is a pretty fun hack and slash game and the multiplayer makes it that much better. Highly recommend it to anyone.			"

												It's a game created by indie rookies looking to get attention via Starbound developer Tiy's refusal to accept donations, so it's hard to expect much. I can give them credit for their effort, but it's nothing spectacular; you basically have two abilities at any given time, and you've no choice but to just spam them. It draws close to a Diablo 3 clone without the fudgeawful voice acting, but with the same mindless ability spamming and tedious crammed inventory management.The singleplayer is far harder than the multiplayer, probably to encourage multiplayer, but it's difficult to set up. The balance between melee and ranged is horribly disturbed, and the random recipe system is extremely useless when you have a total of 40 inventory slots and there are like 100 different materials needed to make items.If you're getting this to keep you occupied until Starbound's release, again, make sure you have someone to play with, as the singleplayer is tedious.

												This game is absolute dog ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Unlike a lot of the reviewers who are criticizing the game because it's balanced for 4 players and they can't find anyone to play it with, I am criticizing it on its ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• game design and gameplay. This game was designed by a pixel artist who knows nothing about designing a game. Menu navigation is attrocious. It's awful. It's a cluster-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing nightmare from which there is no escape. Imagine trying to use your keyboard to emulate yelling at your pet gerbil to manipulate your SNES controller, and you'll still have no idea how bad the menu navigation is in this game.Gameplay is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing joke. The game is divided into rooms that are each about the size of your screen, that take 4 - 5 seconds to traverse. If you're LUCKY, you walk into the middle of the screen and are attacked by monsters that come running in from the edges of the screen for a while until you've killed all of them. If you aren't lucky, you spend 4 - 5 seconds walking across the generic tile-based landscape to the exit, and realize the screen was a complete waste of your time.The game doesn't care about quests or objectives. As the game tells you itself, all that matters is completing stupid little awards that would be bonuses or achievements in any other game - get a 100 hit combo, escape in 25 seconds, that type of thing. There's a reason why these awards are tertiary in most games, but the creator is likely an achievement ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and doesn't realize not everyone loves tertiary awards to death.Combat is a mess. If playing with a full party, there are so many distracting effects flashing all over the screen you can scarcely tell where you are or what you are doing. You can see this throughout the videos, although it might not be as obvious how annoying it is until you're actually playing.Because the developer is a tool, there are some video settings to turn off some of those effects that literally don't work. You can change the settings to on or off and nothing happens. The game includes a graphical quality setting, as if it needed one, but the joke is that the setting doesn't actually do anything when you change it. It's like Early Access all over again...In short, this game is a piece of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. It isn't fun at all. It isn't designed well and it has literally nothing good about it. You will run into the middle of a square, get attacked by creatures and spam particle and text effects for a while, and then repeat over and over until you wish your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• friends had never bought you a copy of this piece of garbage. This game is exactly as much fun as staring at your desktop wallpaper - less if your wallpaper has boobs on it. The story isn't interesting, and the game doesn't start having a story until it's too late for you to care anyway. Everyone who has nobody to play this game with should be glad they don't have to suffer through a session of this monstrosity.			"

												The first playthrough was alright, but the leveling system is very bizarre. It is based on some weird ""achievements"", such as combo values and damage dealt. Therefore, leveling up means you need to not do a good job, but rather perform weak attacks and combos to meet specific requirements to be awarded experience at the end of the level.You will not be able to progress past normal difficulty if you do not somehow comprehend this obtuse leveling. Sometimes there is so much on the screen (enemies casting spells that cause layers and layers of animations to stack all over), you will be unable to see your character until the smoke clears and you are dead. There is also (go figure) a crafting system that really doesn't mean much as you can only craft a bunch of garbage as the ""best"" weapons you will never have the resources to make.			"

												Most of my favourite games ‚Äî the ones I go back to regularly to play time and time again ‚Äî were released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). I have favourites on every platform, to be sure, but I have the most on the SNES, and of all of them, if I had to choose just one that I enjoyed more than any other, I'd have to go with Secret of Mana.Not because it was the best action-RPG title on the console (I'd award that badge to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past), or because it had the best characters or storytelling (Chrono Trigger, anyone?) ‚Äî no, it was my favourite, and remains that way to this very day, because of the cooperative multiplayer.In Secret of Mana, you could play through almost the entire game with a friend, each taking control of one of three characters while the game played the third. It sounds simple enough, I'm sure, but by adding multiplayer to a genre that typically never offered it, Squaresoft had created an experience like no other.I mention this now because recently I discovered Wanderlust: Rebirth on Steam and for the first time in almost 20 years I feel like I'm playing a SNES RPG with my friends again, only this time it's even better. LEARNIN' THE ROPESI was a little afraid of Wanderlust: Rebirth at first; as is typical for me with Steam, I rushed in with no idea what I was going to play. After creating my character and completing the tutorial ‚Äî which among the basics introduced character point (CP) allocation and crafting ‚Äî I was thrust into battle almost immediately and lost amidst a sea of colours, characters and combat.Quickly, I realised that I was one member of a party of 4, the others controlled by the game and each with different abilities. I was an Alchemist who played the role of a rogue, dashing and flinging explosive potions at everything within reach; the others, a Cleric, Fighter and Elementalist all contributing to the carnage in ways I could scarcely comprehend.Following a series of short battles,  a small mini-boss encounter and some oddly charming dialogue we appeared to have won the tournament, and set out on an adventure to claim our prize. Everything happened so quickly that I didn't get a chance to process what I'd learned. The end of the chapter brought with it a score screen detailing the awards I'd earned and % completion, which determined the CP I'd earned, and thereby, how much I could enhance my character.  MAKE IT MULTIPLAYERThat's when I was invited to play with a group of friends, and from the very moment we began our quest anew ‚Äî this time, communicating on Skype and listening to them prepare character 'builds' that would benefit the group/scenario  ‚Äî I began to fall in love.Having already completed the game multiple times, some of my companions already had access to every mission on multiple difficulties, alongside an awesome selection of spells, abilities and equipment; though, to keep things fresh they started with new characters and we played from the beginning. It didn't take me long to nail down the basics properly and get a handle on my Alchemist's abilities, and by playing with others I began to see how the other classes worked.The Cleric wasn't just a healer, but a battle-hardened veteran capable of blocking all incoming damage and increasing our party abilities. The Fighter, an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-kicker without limits, customisable for every situation. And the Elementalist, another beast entirely, complete with its own spell system and mechanics. On top of it all, each of us had access to a shared 'Soul Charge Pool' that filled as we succeeded in battle. Each of us had a single ability we could use to drain this pool, which effected the entire group, and by utilising these abilities sparingly, saving them until at precisely the right moment, we could topple harder opponents without issue.The depth was immediately visible, and it only continued to develop as we plunged deeper into a world of ever-growing chaos.CRAWLIN'Skip forward half-a-day and I'm a veritable pro, strategically dropping blast potions on large groups of enemies immediately after hitting stealth to maximise my combos and earn more awards. We'd finished a complete play-through and were working our way through Hard Mode attempting to 100% each chapter for more CP.I'd crafted a blue weapon, too, and using gems switched out some of the lesser enhancements for a massive damage boost. This happened after we'd unlocked a new game mode, The Crawl. Essentially a limitless, randomised dungeon grind, The Crawl served as an easy way to start farming crafting materials alongside honing our group strategy against some crazy enemy and boss combinations. Better yet, after 5 successful 'crawls', we entered a treasure room. On the left, a blue chest with basic rewards and an instant exit. On the right, a locked orange chest, presumably filled with rarer recipes and equipment. In the centre, a slot machine. Playing the slots is the only way to open the orange chest and win better rewards; however, doing so loads up another, harder crawl, with the chance of boss encounters. Play and win, but risk failure and complete loss of all loot? Or leave now and live, precious crafting materials in tow? This is the heart of The Crawl, and with every successful run from there, you're given the same difficult choice. Ingenious, and incredible. Especially so, on Epic Difficulty. GET ON MY LEVELEventually, we arrived at Epic Difficulty in the Story Mode and discovered an entire new game to enjoy. New limitations and monster attacks deeply altered our combat strategy, and with death now ending the chapter entirely, the level of difficulty had spiked beyond reason. It was glorious. Orange-Level gear recipes had now begun to appear, too, with special items required from special hidden boss encounters to craft, and having already completed most chapters 100% on Normal and Hard, we had plenty of CP to spare and an incredible array of new abilities to work with. Almost as though we were playing an MMORPG, end-game had appeared and with it a new host of gameplay to enjoy.Eventually, we called it a night and continued on the following day. Currently, I'm working on getting every achievement on Steam ‚Äî a challenge reserved for the greats, it would seem ‚Äî and I'm getting closer with each passing day. In closing, I've shared with you here my experience with Wanderlust: Rebirth, and why I have enjoyed playing it. To reiterate my opening passage, it takes me back to an era of my life that I've been trying to get back to for years, and does it with grace, style and unique flavour.Built entirely within GameMaker by two guys, there are some expected issues. Controlling your character is clunky at times, but becomes significantly easier with practice, the lack of multiplayer connection directly through Steam, instead requiring basic port-forwarding is frustrating at times, and there's a learning curve (specifically if playing solo) that's tough to get your head around. Though, rest assured, for fans of the SNES RPG era ‚Äî specifically fans of cooperative multiplayer and, to a lesser degree, PvP ‚Äî this is a title that you'll be happy to have gracing the shelves of your virtual collection.

												Wanderlust Rebirth is a challenging game that rewards the skillfull use of your character abilities, teamwork, as well as tactics. Failure is punished rather harshly but it does not make the game impossible. It instead forces you to learn from the mistakes made so you can become a better player. The community is great with very active developer support. The game is playable solo albeit more difficult (which is part of the fun!) but it really shines in multiplayer. The story is catching I find and overall rewarding to see all the way through.The crafting system is where I had some frustrations due to limited carrying/storing space. It is not that bad though once you can move up the tiers of gear you use allowing you to free yourself of lesser materials. The game takes patience and should be expected to be a challenge.One thing I have not tried a whole lot of is the PVP game mode. It can feature up to 8 players with two teams of 4. It is fun but with my limited experience in this particular mode that is about all I can say on it.This game is for those who want that challenging arcade style feel with high score leader boards. Those that like to button mash so they can run and gun are probably going to feel lost.			"

												Changing my review as i posted this before the option to read reviews was released.This is a neat game. I love the SNES like graphics and feel to the game.The last time i played it, it was entertaining but had alot of downfalls. The biggest one i can remember is that this game has no death penalty. You die you get up and keep going where you left off. No reduction in HP, no starting over, no nothing. It made completing this game extremely easy and alot less fun than it could have been. I have not played recently so i do not know if this was changed.I would give this game a sideways thumb as a neutral rating if i had the option. It is an awesome game if you just want to play a casual multiplayer SNES like game. This is one of those games that had alot of potential but never met it.			"

												Upon first glance, I thought this game would be same-old, same-old, and I was just buying it to help out the team that's bringing us Starbound. However, after playing it for a few seconds, I quickly became addicted. There's never a shortage of things to do, and even if you repeat the same fights over and over, every encounter has an air of difference, because you'll never block, counter, or dodge in the same way. All in all, this game is a huge ""yes"" on my list, and I'm proud to have made it my first review.			"

												This is a pretty simple yet brilliant game. If you are a fan of classic gaming and can get into the retro graphics this game will give you many hours of entertainment. It can be a harder game to beat 100% as it requires a group to do so. Yet with that said the gameplay is very engrosing even tho the keys are easy. Leveling is simple and easy to understand and the developers play the game as well as work on it even after release. With a good story, good retro graphics, nice hidden secrets, and multiple stages of difficulty that you must complete to be completely leveld up, this game will hold you in your seat for hours at a time. Simple crafting keeps the game enjoyable even after completion.The major downside is ease of access to host a server or join one. If ports are not forwarded entirely correct there will be issues.To the guy who reviewed this and said that 50% is all you can get, he is entirely wrong. Combos are an easy way to get points, but completion of all the secrets of a level is what gives you the percentage. Only in the last level and the first did I ever find combos to be major. Destroying objects in the world or collecting items on the map are another way to help achieve completion. For that person to state he talked to the devs and that was their response I find hard to believe as I have gamed with them in Wanderlust as well as spoken to them in chat and completed the game. What he states is entirely wrong. Not to mention who ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•es about graphics when you see it is a retro game to begin with. This is not a X-Box Live 12 year old players game. This is one for the older generation or the young that can appreciate the good old times of getting lost, confused and having laughs.			"

If you're going to buy this game, know this: you're not going to get 100% completion on a level if you don't take advantage of the block or counter system.

												This game is an old school rpg inspired by various 16 bit games.The controls take sometime to get used to, and this game from the start tries to teach you the basics, but then you are on your own.If you are one of those players that expects the game babysit you from the start till the end, then don¬¥t pick this game up, this is game aimed at people who play the game several times till they get used to the controls and they find a character class they like.The game difficulty also gets increasingly harder as the game goes on, so don¬¥t judge it it on the first chapters and make sure to make use of the block key.The user interface is not the best, but it does it job and it provides with enough information to the player.Overall, I think the greatest strength of this game is combat, it can be hard at times and unforgiving, but once you understand the monster combat patterns and each monster does, you should be able to do well			"

												Probably the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a game: you start and can create a new profile or load a profile. The problem is that when you select ""load profile"" it does NOT list any profiles at all. It makes you remember your exact profile name and you have to type it in and press enter. So if you haven't played in a long time and forget your profile name you are screwed. Why could they not make it list the profiles when you select load profile??? I think this might be the only game in history to do this. It doesn't matter anyway because this is 39mb of pure, absolute, filthy, disgusting, rotten garbage trash dog crap.This game sucks in every possible way. One of the top 5 worst ""games"" I've ever played. What a ripoff this was at $10. By far, by a thousand miles, the worst I have ever been ripped off on steam. I only bought it because it says that it is like Chrono Trigger and Secret of Mana. Both great games and Chrono Trigger is one of the best games of all time and should be on anyone's top ten list. This game is NOTHING LIKE THOSE GAMES. NOTHING. Its an indie game and it sure feels like one too which is not a good thing because most indie games are horrible. It is not even worth $1. The combat/controls/gameplay is beyond horrible. I was playing a wizard and you die very easily like one or two hits and you die a lot. And this is the way it remedies so much dying: you select ""revive and continue"" and it makes the enemies on the screen disappear and lets you move on to the next area. So not only is the challenge unreasonable, there is no reason to play if you can just die then revive and make the enemies disappear. It makes no sense and there is no point in playing. There are no vendors so to get better gear you have to craft it and materials drop very randomly and drop very, very, very, very rarely. What a sickeningly bad experience this was. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• steam for allowing games like this to be sold.			"

If you're not familiar with that, The Crawl is just endless waves of enemies and can get pretty fast paced, bring your friends.

												If it ever goes on sale, consider looking out for this if you and your friends enjoy a Zelda-esque experience. That is to say it has flawsThis game is short as it has 10 chapters currently. Even with the new content that may come out, the length of the game is still a short amount of time. Controls in this game is odd as well as you'll be using on keyboard ""WSAD"" for movement and Arrow Keys for combat. This game can be played with a gamepad or Xbox 360 controller (and it feels better to me, IMO).I'm a bit bummed though that this game at the end of the day is merely a RPG game that's mainly involved with ""Time Attack and Get the Best Score Possible"" in order to unlock all your SP.10$ for a few hours of gameplay. I'd hand it to 20$ with ClaDun x2 if you want more gameplay hours for your money. Downside to ClaDun x2 is at the moment it has no multiplayer integrated at all as it is a PSP port.			"

												I only played this game for a couple of minutes and I can definitely see what type of players it is trying to aim at.I had some difficulty earlier on getting used to the controls, because I am not too used to these types of games, the trick is to get used to the character movement, the character attack animations and the enemy maneuvers. This is not a button masher as some people think it is, you need to carefully block blows in order to be able to get a crosshair on top of the opponent so your next attack critically hits and remember to replay the first chapters a few times, You might die at first, but once you get used to the block mechanic, it becomes a bit easier. Don¬¥t try to judge the game in the first chapters and try to play both singleplayer and multiplayer before you do so, the experience is much more different between them.			"

This is mainly towards peeps with bad computers. not the game but my point. It's simple and fun to play with some confusion at what your doing at times. you won't get stuck but you'll do stuff randomly and boom! you beat the level. your like wtf did i just do?! But hey it's fun to play with friend. No problems other then the ones i mentioned and that you can't create your own character.

												Pretty decent game but it lacks polish. Questing/adventuring with friends is fun but the joy gets cut short when you realize you're just passing through very short maze-like pathways cut off by screen transitions. These are basically the majority of the game and they're pasted together. If the different screens weren't so short it might not even be an issue. The spell system for the casters is also very enjoyable and diverse once you get the hang of it, though it can be cumbersome at first.			"

												Wanderlust: Rebirth is a cool, old school rpg. Older players surely remember similiar games and new ones could see those in some recent indie games. It's well made, has interresting item and skills system, can be easily played with mouse and keyboard but with pad as well. Four classes offer much replability and gameplay is quite demanding of the players so it shouldn't get boring too fast. I would say it's a little bit like Magicka + Old school adventure rpg fused into a game that - for me - is less annoying, offers clear character progression that I like and offers all those characters that we are so familliar with - Alchemist (a.k. rogue/assassin), sorcerer, warrior and a cleric.

												Wanderlust: Rebirth is an online four player co-op arcade-action RPG set in the fantasy world, Valandria. The heroes are summoned to Westhaven Arena to prove their worth as heroes of old legend. However, things are not as transparent as they first appear, when our heroes are unknowingly set upon a trek to save mankind from an ominous end. Band together with your fellow brethren to conquer and change the course of destiny. Take control of one of four character classes, each with a distinctive play style, and use your abilities with finesse along side the other heroes to gain high-scores and legendary items. Band together and plan your assault, for the minions of the underworld fear no blade, and only in Epic mode will the true heroines rise victorious. Unlock The Crawl survival game-mode to earn Tokens like a boss, and try your odds with the Luck Box, as you spin the slots for glorious loot or daring challenges.			"

												Sad to say I am disappointed after finally getting to play this.  I bought a Humble Bundle almost exclusively because I saw Wanderlust in the list of games (would never have heard of it otherwise).  I really do like almost everything about the game, but for a couple of small things and one big one.  For small things, the lack of explanation of significant concepts (like the mage runes and their cooldowns) made just jumping in kind of frustrating.  Also, the videos make it look like a great dual-stick shooter combined with RPG elements; in reality, the mage is the only character that uses the mouse.  The rest are one hand for movement and the other for 4 attack hotkeys.  I just couldn't enjoy the Rogue because of how quickly enemies respond to dash (9/10 times they turn around too fast to backstab them), and how if you tried to change direction mid-dash to attack behind yourself at the end, you would mostly get stuck attacking in the same direction you had dashed until you tapped the opposite direction again.  So, you dash thru an enemy and end up attacking air with them behind you.The big issue: the advancement system.  Earning CP (skill points) based on your performance rank of each level.  This could really be a very nice idea, and add great replayability.  My big problem is that most of the scoring is based on combos (getting consecutive hits without taking damage).  Oh sure, it was easy to ace the first few levels with the mage; you just stand back and snipe/dodge while allies distract.  But with the other (melee) characters...unless you're 1v1 with an enemy (RARE), there's too much in the way to see when they're going to attack in order to doge or block.  So I just don't see advancing being very easy for the other characters.  For Rogue, I wanted to be a good dash backstabber, but ended up just using potions nonstop because you could actually stay mobile with dash/bomb/dash and not get hit by enemies swarming on 3 sides.  I couldn't even hit and run because of the dash/direction bug above.  I see the Warrior as the class where you stand and block while your allies wail on the enemies...but where will you get your combo points?  In short, if I didn't feel like it would be a chore to ace each level (essentially unlocking the last HALF of your stat points because you get x points for x% completion + an extra 100 points for 100%), I would be playing all the way through this.  If I feel the urge to play something similar, I think I'll have to go back and boot up Secret of Mana.			"

There's some game mechanics issues too, I dunno.  You'd think that in 2hrs I would have found something pretty good about this game but I just haven't seen it.			"

												Your basic run of the mill indie RPG game but one of the better clones in this genre. Reminds me of SNES Zelda or Breathe of Fire but obviously not as epic!I played this for a couple of hours with friends this weekend. Apart from the clunky controls and lack of graphics options it was pretty good if a little basic but that's all I expected having seen screenshots and other reviews. The tutorial explained everything and the game world is well thought out and nicely designed. There's clearly been effort put into the design and it's very retro 90s in feel.I'd imagine single player would be a bit boring but on Skype with friends was a giggle defo a multiplayer title. I personally think you need to play on HARD or above for it the be interesting we found NORMAL too simple, and EASY would be a waste of time and boring. The character classes are nicely done and gameplay is simple to pickup and play but it was entertaining. I doubt there's much reply value though once you've completed it though nice variation in enemies and levels. The lobby system doesn't support Steam Community you need to use the in game stuff by pressing ""Escape"" when the game starts.I wouldn't pay more than ¬£5 each to be honest if your thinking of buying but if you want a one off on a rainy afternoon and this is on sale pick it up. It's no Diablo or Gauntlet for sure but they are releasing DLC and addons so could grow into a cult game for some people.			"

												As a fan of Old school RPG's i wanted to buy this one just to give it a try. I got it from HumbleBundle so It was worth it. I have played it for a while and I gotta say it gets repetitive. Areas are small and combat feels cheap at times as you can't really see sometimes whether to block or attack. Contstant text bubbles and skill animations ( explosions ) will get in your way so It's hard to focus on combat. I wouldn't recommend it for a full price because there is little to find here ( little customisation option, character looks etc. )... but If you get it on sale and you have friends that can play with you then you will enjoy it. Given that you will get used to the control scheme... 2.5 / 5 There are better games out there.			"

												I purchased this game a while back because it looked similar to Hammerwatch and it was cheap.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  It is not nearly as good as Hammerwatch.  It seemed to have a few bugs here and there, but the last straw was when the game decided not to let us continue on under the same difficulty we've been playing on.  It would only let us continue with Easy difficulty.  Once this occurred the 4 of us basically said ""We should just be playing Hammerwatch instead;  It's so much better.""  Now I know I seem to be giving this game much more flack than it deserves.  It did have it's moments with a deep skill tree to spec into, a decent enough story, and it even had equipment crafting.  We just didn't find it to be the game for the 4 of us.			"

												This isn't really a recommendation, more of a caveat. The story is laughable, the gamepad support controls are poor, it's extremely difficult to tell what's occurring in combat, and the point system for completing a chapter is opaque and obtuse. Perhaps it's fun online with other people, but I don't see how - these same issues apply to multiplayer as well. In addition, the game makes you play through 'mini stages' between larger areas, which are just basically small arenas to fight groups of monsters. You MUST complete all these 'mini stages' each time you travel between two major areas, regardless if you've already cleared them. The game has potential, but they need to improve gamepad support and controls as well as fixing the flow of combat. Some might enjoy this, but I feel the majority of gamers would have a hard time accepting this as a completed game.			"

												The game started off seeming like it would be great. I had loaded it up, and i was already a fan of the style. The menu screen was a bit weird but then again I wouldn't be seeing much of it so i just decided to get on with the game.The first level started up(I missed the tutorial due to crashes that happen on offline mode) and i didn't know how to attack.After a little while, i ended up beating the level and then about 5 minutes later found out i could attack using the down arrow key. I literally beat the first level, by not doing anything. And that's the main problem with the game. You don't do anything. It feels like you have no impact and everything seems to just bounce off either you or your team. I only ended up dying once about 3/4ths of the way through the game because i was changing a few menu settings(which doesn't pause when you load it up, and can take several seconds to exit it, since you have to navigate with the arrow keys and then use space at the very bottom of the list to exit). It seemed like a very good idea, but very poor execution. I could see this game for maybe a quick 20-30 minute playthrough for 0.99 or maybe 2 dollars. But for 8 dollars it just has very little substense and depth.			"

												Do not delete your local game files after you beat the game! Steam, unlike with every other game I have played on Steam, does not save your progress beyond your local files. It doesn't take up very much space.Why do I jump straight to after you beat the game? Because it's pretty good and you should play it. I got it on sale and was very pleased with it. Oh, and buy some friends to play with you. It's really only co-op.			"

												It was a fun game at first,but than I found out that the AI f*cking sucks and that the game is littered with cheapness.If you're going to play this, get some friends to do it with you, except you have to do that stupid port forwarding cr*p.			"

												Loved playing it. Has fun mechanics/combat, nice graphics and low requirements! However, it is a buggy game, with balance issues, and the online is dead. Apparent that the game has been abandoned by devs. Really sad, because this game was fun! But alas....			"

												This game is made for Coop. And multiplayer is pretty much dead since nobody plays it any more. The singleplayer experience is not really much to brag about, though it can provide you with a few hours of fun. What makes this game into one of the best games I have EVER played is something much deeper. Think of this game like excavating. It looks like dirt and you don't think it's going anywhere. But before you know it you will find a diamond that makes it all worthwile. This game is more than just story. It is more than just looking fervously for other random people to play with because you have no friends. It is like old ruins. It is no longer alive, but you can still tell how it was. If you can find someone who knows the game enough. Someone who will take you in as perhaps their apprentice. That is what happened to me, and if not for that I may not have played this game for so long. The statistics on my steam user is a lie. I played this game for over 200 hours before I actually bought it on steam, and I will always keep coming back to it. Get this game! Not for the gameplay or the story, but for the community. If you play long enough you will meet many new players and you can have a third of your steam friend list full of old Wanderlust allies like I have.			"

												Wanderlust: rebirth has everything gamers want in action rpg. Challenging gameplay with many moves to smite your opponents to smitherine while you grind for hours to get better at the game and win some epic loot in the process. The action in the game is well balanced and the variety of things to do makes the game more than a simple hack and slash video game but there are a few flaws to this unknown gem; The screens in which you battle feels too small at time and having areas you can't acess simply because the game was not designed to let you go there, be it because of a tree or simply because the space can't be walked over makes it frustrating sometimes. The fact that some of the moves from the ennemies will kill you instantly or leave you powerless to defend against is infuriating. And the abuse of colors that will turn you blind after a few days of playing this game non-stop... seriously I don't recomend playing more than 2 hours every day.But despite those flaws Wanderlust: Rebirth is a pretty sweet game and the online co-op is simply awesome.7/10			"

												So here's a game I bought simply because a percentage of sales goes towards the development of starbound, the game I really want. I was expecting it to be garbage when I first logged in. Little did I know that it was actually a pretty decent retro action RPG. I've even had the opportunity to play several games with the lead developer. He's a p. cool guy :OThe only complaint that I have is it is really hard to get through normal if you don't have friends to start the game with, and for a lot of people, the first few hours of a game is what will be the dealbreaker.

												Game won't detect my controller although it works, so I can shoot stuff, but can't move.Woo.Then I try to turn off the game, and it just keeps ""running"", so I can't restart or delete it without restarting steam.Task Manager doesn't note that its running.Had a great time, thanks.Update:Tried ""Plug in Controller After Game boots fix"": didn't work.Tried Mulitplayer, crashed the game.Again, thanks.

												I found this game to be really weird and clunky.The camera chases you, it chases the cursor, it chases other stuff.The chat is really confusing and I found myself going ""Hmmm, Aaron why the hell did we get this again?""I never managed to answer me.33/100Positives+ It runsNegatives- It runs			"
