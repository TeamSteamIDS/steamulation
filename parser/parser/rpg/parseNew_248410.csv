												Legends of Aethereus first reared its ugly head over the Linux crowd around May 2013. At first it was just an exclusive Beta version for the Kickstarter backers. Eventually though, ThreeGates realised the money they had gotten out of their Kickstarter wasn’t enough; $35,554 out of the $25000 they were originally looking for. Over ten grand above their original goal and they still felt like they needed to sell Beta entries for $30. That was when the first red flag was hoisted in my head.With the promise of a large scope Action RPG on Linux, I chose to ignore that first warning. Silly me!You see, having used Linux since 2005, I’ve seen plenty of platformers, first-person shooters and even strategy games running natively. Role playing games on the other hand, there were close to none. Off the top of my head, the biggest profile RPG back then was Sacred (published by the now defunct Linux Game Publishing). Don’t get me wrong! That amalgam of bugs, which Ascaron Entertainment stubbornly kept calling a game, was actually pretty damn fun. To this day, I still fire it up once in a blue moon and lose myself in the isometric world of Ancaria for a couple of days. Then the nostalgia wears off and the critic in me just wants to tear some people’s limbs off.Legends of Aethereus was set to be the Linux incarnation of a great action RPG, until you actually got to play it. If you’re a regular follower of our LGC Weekly podcast, you probably already know where this is going. ThreeGate’s debut game was (up to this point) the sole Unity 3D game that got an average score of 1 Lawn Chair, using LGC’s brutal review system. If the Lawn Chairs don’t mean jack to you, IGN gave it a 2.5/5, Destructoid gave it 3/10 and the Metacritic page reveals that there are no positive critical reviews of the game. None! Not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ single professional reviewer could bring himself to justify a score above average.It’s that bad! When a Unity game runs like♥♥♥♥♥on an NVidia GTX 770 paired with an Octo-core AMD 8150 processor and these are backed by two SSDs in YOL0 RAID, you’re doing something wrong… on purpose! There is absolutely no excuse, after 6 months, to have the game in such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ state.I have actually been in the testing team for the past 2 months. I’ve submitted a total of 6 bug reports and out of those, only 3 got a reply. Personally, I ran into a bug that caused the game’s gamma to be constantly set somewhere in between pitch dark and the bottom of the Mariana Trench. It took their Linux dev around a month and a half to actually bother to reply and you know what he asked? “Is this with the open-source or proprietary drivers? Steam recommends you use fglrx 13.11.” - You don’t ♥♥♥♥ing say?! (This happens with both, fyi.)The one bug they actually acknowledged was the Steam Achievements not unlocking when they did in-game. Let me tell you what their fix involves; you need to copy the libsteam_api.so library the game provides into your OS’s /usr/lib folder. They basically want you to introduce a third party proprietary library into a system wide folder, for the sake of doing something 200 other Steam games already do without it. They’re basically asking you to introduce what amounts to an exploitable backdoor to a system wide folder. ♥♥♥♥! Right! Off!It doesn’t end there, though. Remember those other three bugs they never even replied to? Those are the random freezes that happen regardless of what’s going on, the mouse lerping bug that caused mouse input to go haywire and the stupid mouse sensitivity bug that would progressively make the mouse more and more sensitive over time. I don’t know about you, but to me those are some game breaking bugs or at least they toss any immersion you may have at that point right out the window.There is absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ing excuse for a game riddled with this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to be allowed on the Steam store. It isn’t in Early Access anymore and it doesn’t have a warning about the Alpha state the game currently is in! That, ladies and gentlemen, is False Advertising. Some of you may argue the contrary, to those of you who do I give you the legal definition: “Any advertising or promotion that misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities or geographic origin of goods, services or commercial activities"". They’re charging $30 for a game which, according to its store page, works under Linux. When technically it does little else than cause players endless frustration and a recurring stream of refund requests.We all know Valve is pretty lax when it comes to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games on their Steam store, but come on! This piece of junk is bleeding $30 out of unsuspecting purchasers. It’s an overpriced scam under the guise of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.This is the part where I’d drop the mic but I can’t afford the risk it’ll break after spending money on this game.			"

												I will start this off by saying I am not one of the dozens of butthurt kickstarter backers that are giving this game negative reviews. I also was not dumb enough to pay 30 dollars for this game, a ridiculous asking price. It is well known that the game makers completely abandoned this game almost right away, so points off for that. While this game has all the working pieces of an RPG, very few things are done right. You start off in this cool looking hub town on the water. Unfortunately it is basically empty, with a blacksmith, a few quest givers, a trainer, and a lot of hollow empty space. The graphics of the game are good for such an indie team. I did have regularly random stuttering later in the game, that got annoying. Also it is nice how different enemies can attack each other, which you don't see in many games. Also, you can build statues in the city, including ones of yourself, but too bad there are only 3 total sculptures to choose from. You have an apartment, of which there is basically nothing to do besides change the wallpaper. The game also has decent playtime. That is where all the positives end. Lets start with combat. Enemies can knock you over and stuck lock you, as well as auto hit you with abilities. The kick button is useless as enemies get right back up and you do no damage. The block and parry both don’t really work, but the computer has no problem using them. They also can use super overpowered elemental attacks, like venom, that are way better than others, as it hits you for damage over time for like 10 seconds, messes with your vision, and drains all stamina and energy (yeah that seems fair). Then every time you use a rifle to attack, you have to reload between each shot. There are 2 2-handed weapons, 2 guns, and 2 1-handed weapons. The models never change, and nothing else is ever introduced. Attacking with melee attacks you constantly go through people and it doesn’t hit them. The abilities are bad. It looks like you have a huge skill tree, but its really like 5 abilities, and you can just continue to get more elemental variations of the same attack, which you do for each attack. This also doesn’t work with the toolbar because it only supports about 7, and just 1 ability takes up the whole thing. It isn’t clear the difference in damage or whatever else between different elements. There are only 2 classes. My guy had a bunch of abilities that did the same thing, such as bombs, satchels, lanterns, rockets, grenades, so getting multiple of the same ability called something else doesn’t help. Needed more variety. Also my turrets would constantly shoot over guys and attack guys far away, instead of those standing right in front of them. Using abilities for some reason CONSUMES RESOURCES. Yes it is as dumb as it sounds. So if you don’t pick up enough of 1 resource or run out, you can’t use them anymore. Guys don’t drop any weapons. They only drop crafting materials. This makes killing guys boring because just crafting 1 thing requires like 600 of materials, something I couldn’t get with over 15 hours in the game. This means you don’t ever care what you get, because you usually get low level crafting stuff you don’t need, and if you do get a good resource you know you need tons of it so it doesn’t matter. Also there are tons of different color variations of the same resource, meaning your gathering will be split and you won’t get enough of anything. Also crafting things requires 2 different types of materials, meaning you can have enough of 1 type but still not be able to craft it because you don't have enough of the other. You cannot buy new weapons and armor, as the starting vendor weapons never upgrade. This causes you to switch weapons and armor 1-2 times during the entire game, yup it sucks that much. Since vendors never upgrade money is worthless besides buying a few materials. I had 300000k and nothing to spend it on. Then there are the quests. There is no feasible story or anything. You basically get random quests with no cohesion. I had no idea what the main quest was as it was never labeled. Then I would stop getting quests from the main quest giver and then after doing other side quests I would suddenly get more quests from her again. The environments are super repetitive. Each quest you run around 1 of 3 total places: a swamp, a forest, or an underground cave. They use the EXACT same textures and layouts from all the previous levels over and over (you will notice 1 above ground cave used 20 times). All of the environments are super big and super empty and full of nothing. But every quest makes you run for 10 min through these empty big environments just to waste time, instead of getting to anything good. There are difficulty settings for each quest, but choosing a harder or easier one doesn't change the rewards at all, which means it is useless. Boss fights are boring as the guys are the same models as the other enemies just with more health and a name attached to them. Lets not forget about health. First off, when you get hurt you lose total health, and you can only heal a certain point of your health with berries, meaning you keep losing health with each hit even if you heal (yeah stupid). Using healing things make you stand in one place to get hit more, instead of making sense (hate when games do that). The game thinks it’s an MMO, because even in single player you cannot pause the game for some reason, and there is no saving. If you die during a quest you have to restart the entire thing. Funny though because multiplayer no longer works, as you can’t join a game, invite a friend to play privately, or anything. The bland repetitive level design and quests of fetch/kill are MMO like though. The enemies suck too. There are about 10 total different enemy models, but you will only fight 4-5 of them throughout the entire game. This, combined with mission and level design, make every level feel the exact same. Just move along. 5/10.			"

												This game is Abandonware. Do yourself a favor and stay away and save your money. Game hasn't been updated since Dec 2013. Talks of beta testers wanted for future patches back in Feb 2014. Never got any new patches. Then no word from the Devs since. STAY AWAY!			"

												I bought into this game long after it's Kickstarter had concluded. Based on what I saw, it looked promising. I played a little bit of the beta, and liked where it was going, but now it appears to have stopped going anywhere. I made a mistake, one that I'll learn from in this new age of crowd funded Indie games, but I'll get to that in a moment.First, I don't think was a scam, even if I do think continuing to sell it might be. I think the developers actually did have every intention of fully developing this product, you can see that by the work that went into the product as it exists. But, the developers made a mistake themselves early on that more or less doomed the project.My mistake was not checking the history of the game, seeing how it was funded, and what that looked like. Turns out it was a crowd funded game, and upon further investigation they appear to have not ask for nearly enough cash to keep the project going. That is only my opinion, but the stated goals are fairly ambitious for $35K in funding.I'm sad it didn't come to fruition and wish the developers the best in their future endeavors. Because, I imagine that this was even more disappointing to them than it was to the supporters.			"

												Waste of your money friends. Spend it somewhere else. Game mechanics sucks, combat is unfair and a bit glitched, quests are dull and have minimal interaction ( or co-op moments ). Graphics are ok but when on quest there is this stupid fog and the SAME textures ALL THE TIME! SAME TREES SAME BRIDGES SAME FRICKING EVERYTHING! It's like they rushed the game or they run out of budget.... For a 5 pounds on steam you can have a bit fun in this game... a BIT.... tiny little bit... Plus sides - co op action rpg ( arena is cool but combat is again... bad ) The best crafting system I have seen so far in RPG game... That's it really....*EDIT* ---------------------Combat have been improved slightly ( animations but hit detection is a bit cheap especially with small characters ).It's been few months since they have realesed a patch with content or bug fixes. God knows what they are doing but I wouldn't be surprised if they had dropped the game....			"

												If you happen to come across this game on humblebundle or indiegala I would say get this! The $30 asking price for this game is insane.The game is really fun and shows a lot of promise but the devs seem to have abandoned it so don't expect the game to change. PROS: The combat is unique and direction based (I really love it, some people say its glitchy but I feel its just more skill based), and the crafting of weapons is really awesome considering you can make them look pretty bad♥♥♥♥♥ CONS: Devs left is the big one, the game doesn't have many different enemies, there are quests that take a long time to complete not because they are indepth but because there is a TON of walking around with not much to do. Ultimately I would have to say do not get this game unless you got it cheap.			"

												To sum it up: the devs bit more than they could chew...they ended up releasing a repetitive single player game, with no rewards to the exploration of their lifeless gaming world. Thumbs way down.Was just looking up their kickstarter campaign...deluxe boxed edition of the game never happended!! People paid for it!!! One poor misleaded soul even backed them for 1,500$... I bought the game at a discount, but ended up on the short end of the straw. VERY poor customer service altogether. (Sent them an email from their website. Never got an answer, not even from their forum.) Abandonware I guess...			"

												Can't recommend this game. ThreeGates(the Devs) seemed very ambitious and enthusiastic about creating this game and making it great. I got the steam version of this game free from their Kickstarter Fundraiser, because they missed their deadline by like a year. They seemed to get the game stable and then they dropped it. Im not 100% sure but I dont beleive they are even deving for this game anymore, their website seems to say they have moved into quick mobile game. If you get this game onsale for under $5 maybe not a bad buy but save your $30.			"

												Back when Legends of Æthereus was crowdfunded, I didn't manage to fund it. However I bought it for the full price on their website shortly hereafter - only because of Linux support.At that time Legends of Æthereus was in an alpha state and hardly playable on my hardware at that time. I did manage to get the initial feel and concept of where the game was heading, and I promised to return when some of the more game-breaking bugs was fixed and I upgraded my hardware.Fast forward 3 months and I had finally purchased up to date hardware and decided to give Legends of Æthereus another go.I was overwhelmed with the progress there was made with the game in that short period of time, and most of the worst bugs had been fixed and my newer hardware made the game playable.While Legends of Æthereus is not complete yet, and by all means a diamond in the rough. ThreeGates manages to have something that many developers lack: a constructive dialogue with the community. They truly want to better this game in every aspect, and they listen to the community - you are not just playing a game you purchased at a lower price in some Steam sale, you are a part of the game.I do understand why some people gives Legends of Æthereus bad reviews, because if you're looking for a complete and finished game, this is not for you.If you're looking for an ARPG where you don't need to immerse yourself too deeply in the game, this is not for you.If you're in dire need of a replacement for another game, this is not for you.However, if you want a game you can actively help make better, Legends of Æthereus is for you.If you want a game where combat requires thought and technique, Legends of Æthereus is for you.If you want a game that will continue to improve, Legends of Æthereus is for you.One feature I particularly like, is the Quest system. You can selectively go back and play any previous quest on any difficulty.Another thing I do enjoy is the Arena. It has two modes, one for beginners and one for experienced players - both equally fun when you get a hang of the combat system.Which brings me towards something else I enjoy by Legends of Æthereus; the combat system.Usually in ARPG's, you select your target and the character will automatically engage the enemy, or you point a direction and click your mouse. In Legends of Æthereus you actively have to block, dodge and attack each time immersing you in the combat, pressing different combinations of keys while attacking to use another attack vector.Another thing about Legends of Æthereus, is the crafting system. While it is not complex it does offer some diversity, and customizability using resources gathered throughout the planes of Æthereus.I do really enjoy playing Legends of Æthereus, and I hope others will come to have the same passion for this game as I have. I've already tracked 100+ hours in the non-Steam version - and plan to do the same in the Steam version.Each storyline can be completed in about 6-8 hours based on your skills. But there are also randomly generated quests if you just want to walk around and enjoy the scenery. Last but not least, you can always engage in some co-op with your friends, or beat them to smithereens in the Arena.Should you buy this game?Yes, at some point you should give Legends of Æthereus a try - if you want a polished game, you should wait.If you're in doubt, grab it while it's on sale and dedicate time to play through one of the storylines, and tell your friends how it was.If not, at least pop it into your wishlist and come back to it later.If you enjoy being a part of a games process and progress, and don't mind a couple of bugs here and there, buy it this instant.I genuinely enjoy playing Legends of Æthereus, and I highly recommend this game.Enjoy			"

												Very cheap Unity game, it got better after the start but the core is still buggy.Despite it went through kickstarter and greenlight i can't really recommend it.The animations are clunky and the levels are copy & pasted.Attacking and defending is complicated due animation bugs and it feels like playing an alpha state game.I won't recommend getting it for full price but maybe in a later state when the developer finished it up and may release a DLC for it in the future.

												Thanks to this game I will remember the company behind it. Three gates....is the perfect company to show people, why they should be careful with kickstarter! This game does look nice on the screenshots and I am sure, that it could get nice, IF the people behind it hadn't abandon this game. I am sure, that you ask yourself, if it is still a game, that could be played...I say no!The characters do look nice in the game and it has a decent looking menu. But after that you get inside a game, that has clumsy controls, characters, that just move like pieces of wood (and I don't mean the Makujin way) and the worst is, that this game is just boring! I spend nearly 60 minutes with this title and I must say, that steam should definitely delete this title from their store! 27,99€ (that is about 31$) are totally overprized for this Alpha version! And the developers should never show their face in the gaming scene, again. Getting all the money and then just leave is a reckless and ripping behaviour, that should be punished by Steam and Kickstarter!			"

												Probably one of the worst game I have ever played.High retail price of 30$ (the real price should be 5-8$) and buggy, it looks like an uncompleted work.It is clear that devs went far over their possibilities with kickstarter, trying to do too much. The result is a game which potentially could be a good rpg but in reality is a fiasco. The skill system is totally useless and repetitive, graphics is old and ugly and the crafting system (which could be pretty interesting) is unbalanced and poorly refined. Moreover quests are boring and repetitive, mobs looks all the same, etc etc. It is probably the first time ever I have nothing good to say about a game.What I hate most about this game is that devs lied upon release promizing features which were never there. This is false advertizing, I hope this things will be punishable one day.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!			"

												I purchased this because I enjoy RPGs and adventure games in general, and this seemed to have both of those elements. Unfortunately, the final impression was pretty underwhelming. Legends of Aethereus isn't a bad game, but it's not that good either. For me, this title fell into the mediocre category pretty quickly.Pros:I loved the environments. While not too highly detailed, they were well fleshed out and large. I especially enjoyed the forest areas with all of the greenery and lush vegetation.The character growth features a nice system where there are six main attributes sectioned into three pairs and displayed on progression bars. Each attribute has a complementary one on the bar that prevents you from maxing out every stat. For example: filling up the strength/agility bar with points in strength prevents your character from being agile. It's a nice system that allows for specialization instead of overpowered characters.The skill trees are also quite large and feature a lot of skills to obtain and expand upon.Cons:While the environments were well-made, the character and costume models, unfortunately, were not. Character textures are flat and dull with the characters themselves not being pretty lifeless. I suppose it's just a gripe of mine, but I would've expected a bit more detail on the character models considering how much better the environments look.The fighting engine is quite simple. The game's website boasts of a physics-based fighting system, but so far in my playthrough, combat just boiled down to dodging to the side and swinging  your weapon (I've only played a melee character, so ranged attacks might be different). Enemies aren't that bright, either. They'll detect you and then just perform one attack the majority of the time.Regarding enemies, there are some areas where they spawn indefinitely. It can get pretty frustrating when attempting to pick up a quest item or some loot and enemies keep on coming. Most of the time, there isn't a musical change that signals an attack, so you can get surprised from time to time. It's not that big of an issue, but I get the impression that unlimited waves of enemies were used to create tension, but they instead end up being a point of frustration.Quests are extremely simple. So far, everything I've experienced has basically been: go to a certain place, fight some enemies, get an item or wait out an attack, then return and collect your reward.Crafting is also simple with few different armor models. Most of the armor looks the same with maybe an extra texture or armor piece added. Though I've only seen the Tier I armor and weapons and tiers II and III may have more different kinds.All in all, I wanted to like Legends of Aethereus as it seemed like a good entry in the adventure-RPG genre, but it turned out to be quite underwhelming. It's good if you want something quick to do, but at this point, that's about it. Perhaps the developer is working on more content and updating the gameplay engines somewhat, but until that happens, I would say to hold off on it.			"

												*sighs*I really tried to like the game.... but it's just not working out. Legends of Aethereus is a sadly not so good Role Playing Game that went through kickstarter and got released on steam. Why isn't it so good? Because it hast - despite nice and fresh ideas - just too many flaws. The Attribute system is cool - if you add points to strenght, you can't maxx out Agility. The more you put into one stat, the less you can add to the other one. I also really liked the crafting system. Having lots of different materials and using them to craft different parts of your equipement into one piece of equipement. And then you are able to upgrade that equipement up to 10% by rolling the dice and having a 50% chance of being lucky. That's allready all positive things you will find in the game. The voice acting is okay, but sometimes a little bit wanky. The maps are horrible and really do not make life easier. Skills require ressources to use, and are - at least on the warrior side - just not really usefull as far as i could see. The overall combat is really horrible. The hitboxes are totally random, attacks that should hit miss & ones that should miss hit. You are a slow, hardly moveable object when you have your weapons out and that makes the combat no fun. 1 opponent - even a boss - no problem. But 2+ and you will run into some troubles. Overall, i really cannot recommend the game. It's not really fun and the story doesn't really ""speak"" to me. Generic, ""you are the last hero and the only one that can save us despite just beeing a normal peasant"" -type of story.			"

												Legends of Aethereus is a behind-the-player-character, action role playing game set in the land of Aethereus.  Do quests handed out in the hub city.  Marvel at the gorgeous art design, then feel dissappointed at the lack of opportunities for interaction.  Buy and sell crafting material and weapons and armour at traders.  Or craft weapons and armour at the blacksmith (crafting material can also be collected during quests).  Play one of two classes - one focused on brute strength and the other one deploying devices (e.g. mines, turrets, etc.).  Develop special moves (called a skill tree in-game, but it really isn't).  Use a complicated but accessible combat system in satisfying combat against (admittedly cookie-cutter) foes.  Play with up to three friends.  Enter your character(s) in the arena to earn more gold and materials.  Outfit your apartment (a feature that isn't fully developed at the moment).  Generally have fun (yes!).  Be amazed at the game's potential.  Then visit the forums (or do that before buying) and lament the lack of updates.Yes, Legends of Aethereus has been responsible for its fair share of controversy amongst RPG fans.My first impressions were very favourable.  Following about twenty hours of play I drew up a long list of suggestions for improving LoA, but then decided to wait for a (claimed to be coming soon by the developers) mega update before posting it.  Now it's been a year and we've heard nothing from the developers aside from their asking for participants in a secret testing programme.To dispell a common myth, this game was never in Early Access.  In other words, Legends of Aethereus was sold as a complete product.  Heck, there's even a deluxe boxed version (containing two keys);  nothing on the box says anything about the game being unfinished or undercooked (unlike for example the boxed version of another RPG, Krater, which makes it clear that the game has missing features, to be patched in at a later date).There is an ending - meaning you can play through the story from start to finish.  Many of the technical issues relate to the game running on Unity (notoriously buggy and resource hungry), and that's unfortunate, but it's also too late (obviously) to move the thing to a different engine.The many problems include:  - quest objects spawning inside environmental objects (i.e. scenery)- it being massively difficult to hit enemies when fighting on a sloped environment (i.e. you and enemies being on different elevations)- enemies floating above the ground or being too short (meaning your sword doesn't automatically hit them unless you use a specific move)- the hub city looking great but being largely non-interactive- the useless player apartment feature- the skill tree not being a real skill tree at all, but rather a list of special moves which consume resources that need to be collected in the world- technical issues like long loading times, random drops in frame rate and the game generally being a bit choppyThe quest environments feel a bit empty but they are gorgeous to look at.  You never collect gear, as in other RPGs.  Instead the game has you collecting the resources with which to craft gear.  These resources are dropped by enemies or collected from treasure chests.  These rarely tend to be hidden and thus the game doesn't really give you any reason to explore.  Even if you do explore, beyond admiring the scenery there really isn't much to find or do outside of following the list of simple commands constituting your quest -- almost always a case of following a linear path until you get to a location where you either have to pick up a quest item or kill a certain character (or monster).  This aspect of the game feels ""cookie cutter"", to use a cliche, and many others have remarked on it also.Playing the game you'll be exposed to copious amounts of text, likely enough to constitute a fairly thick fantasy novel.  But for all that lore most of it reads like gibberish, or, in my opinion, isn't contextualised or interesting enough to lift the narrative beyond the uninteresting quest structure, which really mires it down and made me skip through most of it.The problem of uninteresting environments extends to the main hub city.  There are many locations within the city which were clearly meant to be built upon, but since the game has for all practical reasons been abandoned never will be.  Having said that, the hub city is the location of a cute little meta-game where you use the resources you would normally use for crafting weapons and armour to craft statues of yourself (or enemies), which you can place throughout the city.  Just imagine inviting your friends over to your game and showing off your many heroic poses cast in shiny platinum.I've mentioned that there are currently two classes, namely Officer and Inventor.  The former is more focused on brute strength and the latter on deploying gadgets.  Both classes use exactly the same weapons and armour.  The differences come down to the available skills (or special moves), which consume their own resources and will thus likely not be used very often.A developer posted that they were going to add a mage questline (you'll notice the mage guild location cannot currently be accessed), which would among other things allow you to play as a magic user.  Unfortunately, as we now know, that update never came (and probably never will).  Even more unfortunately, the developers have since LoA's release been working on a series of simplistic mobile games for phones and tablets.  That's a real shame, considering the obvious talent employed there.Now ... Perhaps you have been left thinking:  ""With all that I've just read, how can this review be marked as RECOMMENDING the game?""It's simple -- Legends of Aethereus is one of the most addictive RPGs I've played in years.  It is absolutely a slimmed down, cut-the-fat sort of role playing game.  You get in, sign up for a quest, travel to the quest location, kill some enemies, get some loot (i.e. this game's version of loot which is resources for crafting), go back, turn in the quest, craft some new gear, rinse and repeat.  The combat is for the most part satisfying.  The environments look great.  Each and every mission can be replayed as many times as you like, and at any of three difficulty levels.  (The game notes which missions you've completed and at which difficulty level.)There is little depth to the experience.  There is also little pretention.  The game knows what it is.  There is an effort to pad out proceedings with a grand narrative, but as it's almost all in the form of walls of text, it is easily ignored.Legends of Aethereus is all just as you see it.  Right there.  Right now.  You can boot it up, play for as long as you like, quit the game, it'll save your progress.  And later you can come back for more.  That is rare, people.In a market where almost every PC RPG tries to be like another PC RPG, only outdoing it in the size and grandeur of its cinematics, here you have something that is truly refreshing, hugely playable, and although lacking in content and polish, a game that offers escapism in spades.  Escapism being, I believe, one of the main reasons why we play games in the first place.Some may disagree, some may agree, please feel free to leave a comment.  And if one of the developers read this, please do the same.  I'd love to hear from you guys.The manual can be downloaded at the following link.  Please do so if you havn't already.  This review is for all intents and purposes an opinion piece.  The manual will give you more information on the actual systems and the two classes currently available.http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/248410/manuals/LoA_PlayerGuide.pdf?t=1390752252PS. Change the camera to Middle;  I found the game almost unplayable with the Left and Right camera settings.			"

												Legends of Aethereus is built from the ground up, ostensibly, to be an MMO and holds many of the same features - but it's only single player/co-op. Graphics are unrefined considering it's only 3 years old - no option for 4K. Animations are incomplete and clunky.As others have mentioned, at best this game could have been something, but it's not - incomplete and abandoned.			"

												All things considered, it's quite fun. The graphics are nice. The combat is complex and creative. There's lots of skills and abilities to choose from when leveling up. Customization is all over the place, from your character to your your gear to your city. And I think the setting is a nice deviation from the standard ""everything is magic"" fantasy genre fare. And most importantly, there's loot everywhere, especially with the newest Arena update.The AI needs work. I can plant turrets with my inventor and watch enemies stand frozen, apparently unsure of what to do, or watch them climb on top of my turrets and sit there like vegetables. On that note, the turret AI needs work, too. Most games have turrets that aim in such a way as to HIT enemies.The biggest problem, though, is that it's VERY poorly optimized. I have a very high spec computer, and even at the lowest graphical settings with nothing running in the background the game lagged like crazy whenever 5 or more enemies were nearby. Furthermore, the loading times are absurd, and even after the absurd loading times, the levels stutter as you move through them.I picked it up on sale in a bundle, and I suppose if you had to play it, I'd recommend doing that. And be careful not to get too close to a crowd of enmies when playing hardcore, or you'll be forced to watch a slideshow of your character dying horribly and losing all your progress.			"

												I'm going to start off with this is a fun game. The combat I find well done, but still a little clunky. It constists of a lot of blocking, parrying, and dodging. There's a decent variety of enemies and they are creative and fun to fight, and a bit of a challenge with the flank-loving AI. The graphics are pretty nice, and the mission setup is kinda cool. The weapon/armor creation and customization is really fun to toy with and create new things for first few hours. Character customization isn't all that bad either, and the armor and weapons look nice aethestically. I found it fun for a few hours, a bit more with the easy set up Co-op with a friend. Lastly, this game is not dead. The devs are still working on it, and may end up changing or fixing what I have mentioned. It has recieved a few patches since purchase.On to the cons for Legends of Aethereus. The skill tree is mediocore. It looks very vast, but it consists of a few skills with just a bunch of shallow upgrades. The skills themselves aren't very interesting either. The map seems quite small, and many different areas reuse very large chunks of terrains and models, and makes many areas seem very very similar. The weapon and armor creation seems vast at first, but I later realized it's quite simple and a bit shallow. You run out of things to make fast, and Crafting is the only way to find decent weapons and armor. It consists of making the same things over and over, but just changing the material it is made out of, to make it more effective. The game is very buggy and poorly optimized. There are memory leaks that can bring even great systems to its knees over time which can really kill the experience. The game overall has a cheap feel, which is to be expected with a small studio indie game.Tl;DR - Personally, I would not recommend the game. There is fun to be had, and I'm sure there are people out there who would enjoy this game. There are, however, flaws,bugs, and lack of depth in the game that should be pointed out and considered before throwing $30 on this game.			"

												cannot recommend as of the latest build this should be noted that this is closed to open beta then a full release as many systems in the game are not fuctional.the melee combat is very close to the original fable just not as good. single handed weapons dont have any sort of combat system and while there are ""power attacks"" it is not mentioned anywhere in the tutorial (which never goes away). while there are directional attacks from movement they are situational and dont work that well unless you know exactly how to use them. many times for any attack i swing and my character will walk past the enemy swinging uselessly. ranged combat works rather well with the exception that while aiming you cannot move (as of the build i am using). as well that your cursor moves rather slowly. the skill system is a standard reagent system, you use items to use your skills. some of the skills from the two classes work really well but there seems to be an amount of randomness about some of the abilities, for example a skill for one of the classes builds a turret that you have to control this is mentioned nowhere in the skill system. another issue with combat is that your character cannot run when having a weapon drawn this is in contrast to your enemies which can and they will take advantage of this swarming you at time sunless your aim is good.the leveling system while not inspired works well. with an amount of points given towards physical stats and a point for skill. its a fairly standard system that could use more explanation in the game. there are 6 stats with 3 in opposition so you cant have max strength and max speed. these stats also affect your ability to carry things, your aim time, and attack strength.the thing i was looking forward to in the game was the crafting system whihc breakes down weapons and armore into their base components which you can select which material to build with. the major issure with this is that i have built the best weapon on can within the first half hour of the game and i have yet to run into the materials to build a better weapon which is rare and hard to get from any of the vendors. the designs for the weapons are nice and with the rifles pistols and crossbows it is mention you can have multiple barrels. this is not implemented yet.if the game was more finished, they fixed the combat system, and varied up the effects fo the different crafting materials i could recomment it but as of the current build i cannon.

												This game is much, much better than the rating it has, don't let metacritic push you away. The combat in this game is skill based, you need to aim everything, dodge or block everything, no auto-targeting. The graphics are more than good enough, the combat is very fun. You get to choose what kind of warrior you will be, melee or ranged, use guns or swords, etc. Also you have a skill tree where you lay out the skills you want to learn and on top of that you distribute your skill points into things like strength, agility, constitution and so on freely however you choose to. The game has quests, arena battles, a very detailed crafting system, so you can look however you want combining the nice player creation tool with crafting tools. Give this game a go if you enjoy RPGs and action combat!			"

												Hidden gem. The arena is a nice way of feeding the crafter players. The tutorial and guide videos in game are a nice touch. That is, you are told what to do via voice over and often watch a video for anything remotely complicated. The quest loading didnt bother me, actually a nice change. Reminds me a bit of Dynasty Warriors minus the epic battles. The quests have all been boring so far. Voice overs sound like a porn star being told to read a book aloud. Crafting is interesting but shallow. Easy to make the best item in game and then start grinding mats for ""Chance to fail upgrades"" after that. There is very little loot that isn't crafting mats. A tier 3 - level 5 item would take awhile, but not in a fun way. I will prolly do it, but its all RND - 50% chance to upgrade or break.Easy achievement game. Had 1 crash, runs laggy. Combat gets bad often. I enjoyed pistols the most. Sometimes they refuse to shoot - more so when the game is under load. Deploying 20 turrets in the arena for example. Graphics are not terrible, somewhere between oblivion and skyrim. Enough plants to loot to give you a skyrim feel.For the bundle price I dont even remember paying - Totally worth it.For 29.99, lol no.			"

												Short version: Go download Vindictus. It'll give you pretty much the same mechanics, just with smoother combat, better crafting, vendors that can actually upgrade your equipment, intuitive character stats, a simpler damage/armor system, and Vindictus just generally does everything better.Long version: This is probably the worst game I've played that wasn''t outright broken like Hydrophobia. The easiest way to get me to stop playing your game is to have terrible combat for the genre, and this game completely misses the mark, being at least 3 steps worse than the standard Bethesda combat, which is the stiffest I had seen before buying this game. My recommendation for Vindictus is because that's the closest game I can think of to this, although comparing it to this game is an insult to said MMO. The combat is done the same way, just minus any combos, smooth character movement, or any real combat quality whatsoever. The crafting system has potential, but the materials seem to have essentially no drop pattern whatsoever, thus rendering any chance of being able to make something GOOD for your level entirely up to chance. The quest system, and transportation to the areas for the quests is what made me first think of Vindictus, and this seems to be the only part of the game done with any actual quality, since it does something Vindictus DOESN'T do, by only showing the areas you need to go for your active quests. This is literally the only game I've seriously thought about trying to get a refund for, since I knew Hydrophobia was going to be broken going in, I enjoyed Colonial Marines because I went in thinking it was going to be the FPS version of the previous title named, and I haven't tried Magicka on a desktop yet which is where it apparently works best. The graphics are alright, but so the graphics in Vindictus, so save yourself the money and just download that...even if the game is closer to P2W than F2P.			"

												It makes an attempt to be an RPG but misses it.LoA has combat mechanic issues such as sluggish movements, jerky mob animations (blinking around when shifting pose), melee & ranged combat feels awkward - your head interferes with aiming as it sits on top of the reticle.The AI is terrible: Turrets break the AI and you can S key backwards avoiding nearly all attack animations.There is a fairly interesting crafting system allowing you to choose part designs and materials each facting into stats on the final item.Why did I pick it up? It looked interesting but it turned out to be painfully mediocre except for the crafting system.			"

												So the reason I bought this (for $1 at groupees.com/bab8) was so me and an equally bored friend could play something co-operatively. My thoughts are with a friend, this game is great fun. While I imagine solo would get boring fast for most people, having a friend to kick around like a football, fight a bunch of christmas elves, mock the aethetics (nobody is wearing pants), and enjoy the games many glitches with, this game is brilliant. It seems to be a poorly made game but not so poorly made that it can't be played. The games design seems to be ambitious, and co-op play was very quick and painless to set up and enjoy. The thing I really like about this game is it feels like the old school RPG's that just don't seem to be coming out all that much. You do quests for part of some generic story in order to earn loot, its good and simple fun with a friend and if you have one friend or a group to play with, i'd highly recommend it for $1. In fact I may buy a few more copies for friends later.			"

												Overall, this game should be better than it currently plays.  The controls on the action based fighting a decent, story and voice acting are passable, and the sound/graphics are good.   The problem with the game is poor graphics optization, at least on dual ATI 5770 cards.  When there is not much going on, the controls and mouse controls are fluid, but when there a few enemies or other NPCs are moving around in your line of sight, the controls become jurky and difficult to control.Maybe I will come back to this game again after the developers do a little optimiztion.

Yes it has a few bugs but what games dont??The graphics are great and everything reminds me of elder scrolls in the game itself.I have an issue with the scroll bar keeps on scrolling down in a stuck manor but hope the development team will help.Dont think its worth £22.99 More like £7.99 as there are tons of games with less problems and bad reviews.On a positive note that could all change with constant DLC and other PVP PVE impliments. At the moment  4/5  dont see why it should have a bad review it is a brilliant game.But will say the development team seem to not give two Ishts about it.... so moving on ^_^If you get this game make sure you assaign it in the graphics card profile add section.

												This is actually a very well made game. It is very detailed, has extremely high-resolution textures (especially the interiors) and an incredibly sophisticated leveling/perk system. Geniusly balanced imo. Also has more armor/loot/items than you could count.There really is nothing here that is indicitive of a poor game. Everything works as it should. There is nothing game breaking or poorly implemented. There is NOTHING in this game that even hints developer laziness. Everything is complete and finished.. The only con is that this game is not anything close to being open world like most rpgs. You start off in a small central hub city and you pick a quest in which you must run to the docks and ask the sailor to start your mission whereas a new level loads.So it's pretty much like a game with multiple linear levels, not an open world. If you like games where you travel off the beaten path to go look for treasure chests, this game is not the game for you. Because there is none of that.. While i was running down the linear levels there were multiple times i saw cave entrances or staircases leading up brick structures just to find out they were blocked by an invisible wall when you approach them.. I also stopped a few times to check in secretive looking areas and i would never find any secret loot chests or anything like that. So the exploration value is ZERO.Is it worth 30 dollars? No. I could see why the dev's would THINK it was worth 30 dollars because of all the work they put in. But the amount of work the devs put into a game does not always equate to realworld value.  I personally don't know why the dev's have it priced so high on the steam page because multiple times i have seen it go for sale in bundles for mere pennies. I think a good steam page price would be $9.99, the current $30 pricetag makes me just think that devs don't dont care/check up on their sales anymore.The only reason i could see why others would not like this is because it lacks the smoothness/polish/AAA voice acting that most rpg's have. There are many times where you can simply picture the developers speaking in to a cheap household mic as use for the NPC voices.But other than that i really soo			"

												Legends of Aethereus is a game that reached far and forgot to plant solid roots.  The game is expansive, there is plenty to do, and it has fairly extensive character customization.  Sadly it lacks in level design, enemy design and gameplay design so we're left with a product that feels unfinished, undeveloped or badly designed everywhere you look.  Full disclosure, I was a Kickstarter backer who really wanted this game to be good, it was the first game I ever backed so I really believed in it.  But the question of whether or not I enjoy the game is the same as asking do I like all the technical limitations, bad animations, missing sound effects and just general lack of enjoyment for completing quests.I wish I could say that this were a niche game, or it just isn't for everyone but I'm pretty sure it's not for anyone.  I like what Three Gates tried to do here: instead of buying and finding weapons and armor, you craft and customize your own ( which hadn't yet become a me-too generic feature when this game was developed ).  The system is a bit ugly but the outcome is fun.  Where it falls apart though is there are too many materials and its all cryptic.  Instead of choosing your cloth and, say, a color: you have to find cloth of that color.  This might go over better if the materials list was sortable, or you didn't need quite so much of each material.  But you could probably deal with that if the rest of the game was fun, right?Well, combat is another major stumbling block and I wish I could isolate just where it went wrong, but I can't because it's thoroughly awful.  The game was built priding on how your sword actually had to intersect your foes to do damage.  I think this might have been as far as they developed this idea though because you don't have much control over how you attack, and even if you did the idea is forgettable anyways because enemy AI is non-existent and nothing responds to your attacks anyways.  It's a tough thing to describe and I'd tell you 'try it and you'll understand' but my review is telling you not to try it.LoA is just a game of flaws.  It was a project of love to be sure, it's clear the developers believed in and wanted their game to be good, but honestly I think they may just not have believed when people told them it wasn't.  They either weren't willing or simply couldn't objectively look at the game and admit that it just wasn't coming together, and to that end it did not.  For a fun easter egg, should you give the game a try, you can find me in game.  Three Gates did try to do right by their backers, I just really wished they'd been able to do right by their game.			"

												One of those games where you keep telling yourself ""It might get better in a bit!"" but you already know it won't.  It reminds me of an MMO without all the people or anything truly entertaining.Pros:+Interesting attribute system+Decent sized skill treeCons:-Very very few quest lines-No real interaction with the world beyond hitting levers and turning in / picking up quests-Weak combat-Weak, dumb & boring enemies-Almost no variation between enemy types -Dull and plain world (a ruined ‘city’ is little more than the same brick tower every 50 feet)-Almost nonexistent variation in how levels look-No real development of character or world-Empty world (I know I pretty much said it above, but an entire military camp is one tent, what?)-Poor voice acting-Oddly shaped character models-Poorly done animationsOverall this game was incredibly dull, with no real redeeming qualities.Also, what’s with the all the Christmas stuff?

												Not sure why it is thirty dollars. Maybe worth ten dollars but not thirty. Pretty upset that I bought it considering the reviews and gameplay I watched were pretty good. I should have took advice from the negative reviews. Combat looked clean and kinda like Dark Souls, its not. You can run right through monsters so in the heat of battle it gets pretty obnoxious. Animations are pretty horrible, the voices in game are ridiculous and it the game world is all instanced. Maybe the game is not complete, hopefully they will fix things like how stiff your character looks and jumping is strange. I would avoid this game until they fix the bugs (my friend and I were playing and the orc-like creatures head was doing the exorcist thing trying to look at him while fighting me, hilarious but not thirty dollar hilarious), get new voice overs and maybe make the game feel more alive. I wish I could get my money back because I was considering getting Morrowind to replay it again...and also save ten dollars. Oh well, live and learn.EDIT : This game is Abandonware. Do not purchase.			"

You know those games that headline customization as one of it's main points, and only deliver thinly veiled customization options that not only suck but don't matter at all? How they edited trailers to make it look good, when in all actuality not only does the game play sucks but the graphics too? Where it tells you about having an amazing storyline when its about as bland as any crappy game? Or how games tell you of having amazing and vibrant environments, where its actually so borring and uneventful, you could be running around in circles and not even know it. How about having an MMO experience with none of the fun, and deffinatly not being an MMO? This is one of those games. Over priced and a peice of trash, its amazing how this game was ever greenlit for Steam.			"

												Wow.This is literally one of the worst coded games I ever tried to play! After crashing twice, I finally managed to get a character created and started playing. Well, playing, sorta. The game seems to be made for very, VERY shy people, because looking at anything else but your own feet makes the game a slideshow so slow you could tell half a story for every frame. Sure, my computer ain't top of the notch, but it still is somewhat potent, allowing me to play Starpoint:Gemini 2, World of Tanks and Diablo 3 at medium to medium-high details, for example. Legends of Aethereus lags the death out of my computer even in low quality.But the publisher seems not to care, as they seem not to care about the game at all: it is friggin' easter, and I'm getting adverts for some ""special x-mas arena""...Tell you what: I'm gonna uninstall this chunk of junk as soon as I submitted the review, be sure of that. In fact, I find it to be a shame steam actually provides crap like this game instead of banning it to the aether of the internet.			"

												Very repetative. I bought the game in alpha and it seemed like it would go somewhere great fast, but then it went nowhere.Little has changed since alpha at all, originally they promised and drop in and out mmo which never happened, promised open world which nope. combat is bulkier than real life, I tend to die alot from enemies glitching out of nowhere plus the story is heavily lacking.All in all if you can get it super cheap it might be worth kicking around, otherwise avoid.

												An incredibly buggy game that either should have been declared as an early access or not released at all. Purchased on sale (fortunately) because I thought that it looked interesting.Even still it is one of the worst games I have played and the only reason I have 5 hours played was to unlock the achievements.Do not recommend in any way.

												The screen shots make it look like a great game but in reality it feels like a low end Unity game. The battle system alone kills the game..when you hit something you all animation kinda stops and then starts over again and the life bars go down but it feels so cheap and poorly done. Camera angles are rough and can either make the game look great or really cheaply done. It's like the movie trailor that shows you all the best looking 3 minutes of a two hour movie.. and then you go see it to find out that the rest of the movie was so bad you walk out. That 3 minutes I was talking about, are the screen shots posted on the store page. Make no mistake this is a very very cheaply made game.. and I love Indie games.			"

												You start out as Master Chief and as you battle through hordes of Playstation haters, you slowly begin to learn the power of friendship and happiness through the help of your best friends, Darth Spockwalker and Queen Abraham Lincoln of Vietnam. You'll meet some other kooky characters along the way, such as Leonidas of Ireland, the Clown who hides from gay people and Kim Jong Un!

												Well what can i say about this game, firstly it has nothing simular to skyrim as skyrim is the best game of this sort to buy but as regarding this game soly on it's own merits i have to say after playing it for over 80 hours and reaching level 45 i am somewhat disapointed in it.This game has some major bugs and flaws in it that makes this game a major failer firstly you can only open 1 out of 4 storage chests which is very annoying and you can't scroll your entire contents you have in your inventory which means you don't always know what you are carrying when all your inventory boxes is filled up so how can you sell anything if you can't see what you are carrying.second the mouse control behaves very eractic meaning it is not smooth action and i am using a brand new mouse which was bought only 3 days ago just in case anyone says i have a faulty mouse then forget it as i don't.thirdly you can't buy items from all the traders in your city (only buy from 2 traders which includes a blacksmith) they just stand there and do nothing to me that is a waist of game information that can be better used elswhere and the maps are too small and not much detail in fact some maps are just the same they have been duplicated because the developers are too lazy to create new maps, also you can't interact with all the people in your city and the trees and leaves and water does not even have a real looking effect unlike in skyrim and i can go on and tell you lots more that is bad about this game as the list is endless and i should know as i have played many top title games (some good and some bad)The good points about this game is i bought it for less then $5.00 which is about £2.00 british pounds but for it to have a retail price of £22.99 which is about $35.00 which is daylight robbery to me the developers went all out on this game with the sole intention of robbing you which is no less then thievery or stealing from you in my book, they rushed this game without any thought at what they was trying to create as all they think about is money.This is not a game anyone could possibly be proud of and is too over priced even skyrim is only about £12.00 to buy now and is a thousand times better if i had to give this game a score out of 10 i could only give it a sad 2 as the turkey game of the year as i look at this game and laugh at it on how pathetic it is.I understand the developers which i will name from shame is (Three Gates) who has pulled back there money from this sad poor game only to be nasty and legally ask a charity site to remove it from there bundle which the charity was selling in a game bundle to raise money for starving people and people dying in other countries this shows how nasty and unhumane three gates are and care of nothing but themselves and putting money first before human life.My best advice to you is stay well clear of this game and in fact never buy anything from the company three gates as most likely it will be rubbish like this trash besides they have been nasty to a charity site so i will never buy anything created by three gates ever again in my life time.I know many of you will say that you can't expect a AAA+ game from a small indie developer but let's be honest here if we was going back 25 years ago i would say yes it is a good game because our computer tech and game developement was not very high then but let's get real here we are now 2014 and we have advanced so far in 25 years as we have super duper computers that is 64bit and liquid cooled with super processers and graphics cards so the tech is very high and many small developers is still knocking out really top end games at a low price, the difference here is this is a crap end title from a small developer who is demanding a high price for a bad product.This game has so many bad reviews and will continue to do so because it has not met up with todays standerds in the game industry and i can't see three gates investing any money in this game with DLC packs or even any patches in fact i think they just want to dig a hole and bury it and forget it as it is making no more money for them so why should they care about it's customers because they don't as they already had your money so why should they care after all this game was released september last year and if there was going to be a patch to correct the bugs in the game it would of been released long before now, so don't live in hope of seeing a patch for this game as i got more chance of going to the moon then you seeing a patch for this game.I know my remarks has been hard on this developer but i speak as i find and judge people on there own merits and there own failers and in this case there is no merits to praise here.
