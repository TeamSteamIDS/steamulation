												[Updating my review as of 2016/10/20 as it's getting attention again]After following the development of this game years before it's actual release, I have to say this is probably the most disappointing zombie game I have ever genuinely followed. And I don't just mean that from a ""it's not what I expected because I bought into the hype like an idiot"" point of view - this game is filled to the brim with content ""spread too thin"" and is incredibly lacking in depth of any kind.~~~Yes, I know this first topic should be the least important part to a reader who just cares about the game, but this is pretty much a required read to get the full gist of why I'm annoyed. This goes far beyond simple issues with how the development went, actual issues with the game pretty much go hand in hand with this.Why The Release Was Lazy:It's one thing to have a great idea, concept and writer.It's another thing to not actually deliver a good game to go with any of that. It is also another thing to wittingly cut your development roadmap short with what you once called ""placeholders"" now becoming the final product.I wanted this game to turn out as amazing as the portrait painted for it. I really did. I hyped this game to a lot of people. The developers recieved plenty of constructive feedback, and for the most part, seemed hopeful in fixing these issues as they promised to eventually do over time. I played and re-played the game throughout it's early access on steam. I gave it a positive review, talking about everything I loved about it.It was something that had so much potential, and so much of that was wasted in possibly the laziest release of all time. I thought it was a mistake when I looked at the store page and saw that it was out of early access, but apparently, it wasn't. You see, the game was nowhere near the true ""final release"" stage when they started saying it was going to leave early access. Neither the much-needed polish or balance/bug fixes had happened at that point. There was a long laundry list of stuff that was yet to be changed or added. However we just ate up every statement that more was to come with some kind of huge update they were going to put out with the full game.As expected, we all held our breath. Then the game released. The ""massive update"" was really just some UI features and terribly minor bug fixes. So much stuff was still very, very wrong with the game.Pathfinding, which has been a ""rough draft"" and improperly done since long before the official release is still a complete disaster, and it doesn't take too many hours of the game to see how poorly the movement system runs in practice.There are noteable spelling and grammar mistakes in the UI and dialogue that are still there to this date, and almost all of them were reported over a year ago.Notice how the NPCs at home base are just kind of there and don't actually seem to be doing anything rather than walking around their token job area? Animations for working, emotion and social interaction were in the works - but apparently dropped just to rush the release.If that wasn't bad enough, certain developers and staff couldn't take the criticism and decided to flag a few negative reviews they felt weren't ""honest"" enough and then threw fits on social media for the backlash. But that's none of my business.The Lost Ending:They removed an ending [Spoiler: The Cure] entirely on the grounds of ""It would have been too much work to get it going,"" despite having the characters involved extremely hype the idea to you as an achievable goal already in the game. And then they never bothered to redo the NPCs involved in the ending quest, so even today a player can accidentally dedicate way too much to this super-disappointing questline for no actual reward. While we are at it - they also took 'balance' as a reason to write it off, which doesn't make sense since it was originally an ending, and tried to back that one up with ""well what if it wasn't an ending"". You and I both know that an ending was your original intention. That objective was widely regarded as an ending well before it was scrapped. So using ""it was never intended to be an ending"" as an excuse was extremely sleazy. I wouldn't have bothered including this as part of the review had you just fessed up to not wanting to dedicate time to it (or had a change in heart for the story lore).And what did the game do to off it in final? Replaced some text. Threw in an apology from one of the NPCs for getting hopes up. I have several science buffs (including the immunologist) and medical professionals who showed interest in the subject of a cure, and we were basically told that a paragraph of text somehow made up for one of the most anti-climatic story checkpoints in gaming history, all because the developers didn't want to do the work to get it working properly (or add in a scene where the cure fails and all hope is lost) for that matter.I digress, it's not my game and the developers don't owe me anything for playing it, but it just shows how you gave up on making it great as everybody involved once desired.As A ""Finished"" Game:The game still looks unpolished. It still plays and feels like an unfinished game. The animations lack depth. Enemies with over-used models. The vast majority of NPCs you interact with don't even have names, and are stuck with ""Looter"" and ""Survivor"" as if the devs planned on going in there later and changing them.When you see early screens of the game, you see people sitting in stools in the lab, tinkering with machines, while a character flings her arms up in the air while raging about somebody being a problem. You see characters moving their arms as they talk, showing emotion. You see life. You see a game where you can show what's happening to a friend and they will understand what is going on in the scene without you explaining it.That's not the game now at all. Everything is lifeless. Sloppy idle animations which never made it past said adjective. Everything relating to emotion and conditions was reduced to text and labels. Even in the very minor ""live-action"" parts of the turn based game, it still feels like it's turn-based because everything is still attatched to their simplistic animations and use of the tile system.Pros, Cons, And More Cons:I'm going to summarize this to boot.Obvious pros and cons:+Good writing.+Good story.+Awesome, in-depth characters.-turn-based gameplay is clunky-Lack of polish-Broken story events that don't recognize a previous descision when it should-Lack of attention to various characters (Jodie Hopkins as an example)-Extremely empty list of events in the time before the endgameBorderline points:=Long storyline (but didn't have the intensity to match the hours)=Mediocre amount of weapons and content to use outside of characters=questlines can have a lot of detail and options, but on the flipside, some don'tThere is such a heaviness to your home group characters ingame - every quest, everything you build and do is built off of your cast of characters. There are no ""filler generics"", every survivor in your camp is unique and written individually, and all contribute something different. Which makes me hate that less than half of them have more than 3 or 4 ""story events"" involving them, because the ones that are actually fleshed out can contribute so much to the story while others add so little.This game is the poster child for products that spread themselves too thin. I understand that exit-stage early access titles are almost never as good as they made them hyped at the start of development, but this is well beyond ""just scrapped ideas"". While I found the characters and choices entertaining, literally everything else felt extremely under-developed and nowhere near completion. That's my blunt review for now.			"

												A pleasant way to spend a few hours.Pros:+The Base-building Aspect is a lot of fun.  The delicate mix and interplay of facilities, resource management, and character skills including your own definitely play a big impact on your crew's morale and survival prospects.  Those who get bit (infected) during the game as a result of combat with zombies have to be managed with daily antibiotics.  Each infected cause a potent little morale hit on a daily basis (fear those infected will turn keeps your survivors up at night).  Wounded characters heal in user built infirmaries.  Recovery in HP can be slow, fatigue is implemented if you have your characters scavange the wasteland of Texas for too long without granting them rest, and the additional game modes with the most recent ""Reanimated"" update even make it possible for your own character to get infected.  +The Reanimated patch adds a few of the more interesting game settings to the original base game that ramp up the zombie threat to 11 without making it impossible and human enemies are much more aggressive and damaging if you elect to ramp up to Hardcore game mode.  The Ironman mode I wouldn't recommend given the occasional save game related bugs in the game but if you save often there's no problem with anything else.+The large map and variety of buildings is almost varied enough in their experiences to wipe away some of the larger pacing problems.+Some characters that can join your fledgeling community of survivors are extremely interesting characters in their own right so there's enough variety in the mix of personalities on display in this game to intrigue the imagination.  Its a pity that the NPC banter and dialogue for each of these characters (~30 altogether) couldn't be fleshed out a bit more than it is but its good enough assuming you are patient enough for their scripted events to come to you.+The Crises events in the game add a lot of tension to the game and the amount of democratic support you have leading up to these events as well as the consequences of your decisions to resolve the crises are well thought out.  Its a pity there weren't more Criseses to help with the pacing problems that occur in the mid-game.+Pick your favorite picture of any flesh-toned animated flavor and your enjoyment and immersion into the atmosphere of the game will automatically increase by leaps and bounds.  The portraits that come with the game I found - disturbingly - androgenuous especially for the men.  The game lets you import custom portraits...use that.  The rest of the NPC characters portraits are perfectly fine though so don't let that deter you.  Its only the PC that looks...questionable, shall we say? +The game allows you a broad choice of presets background and skillsets and lets you choose your own by assigning points how you will.+The other factions in the game will definitely reach out and make their presence felt. Some will be hostile, some neutral, and some will be friendly.  A few will change their status depending on your words and actions.Cons-Graphics and animations are good enough for an indie game of this type but there's nothing you would call clean or flashy.  I don't mind this one very much just thought I would toss it in to cover my bases.-Ambient Music track is super repetitive and the one combat song gets real irritating real fast. Play some of your own music in the background and crank the music volume in the game down very low unless you really love the unimaginative midi drum-beat ambient deathrattle.  My zombie kill-count went up immesurably and I had a lot more fun when I turned to my own combat mix.  Yours will too, trust me. -No voice acting-A pity the infected mechanic doesn't have a stronger thematic element than merely a morale and daily biotic hit beyond the fixed three day incubation period of Zombie turning.-The dialogue after the introduction that you initiate in your community shelter is weak and repetitive outside of scripted events.  This is one area that may be the most disappointing from a narrative standpoint.  Each character gives you something to worry about and do and they will get into conflicts with each other in somewhat realistic fashion.  They will even group themselves into factions under sub-leaders you come across which is also nice but the lack of depth in the dialogue still makes me find this game to be a flawed gem cut too early in the development cycle to reach its prime potential.  The indie budget shows most severly in this area but the early game has the most content and in all honesty I found the early part of the game in the first month to be the best most fleshed out part of the game by far...-The factions also suffer from a lack of fleshed out developement. They are interesting and do interact some but there is a gap between what is realized and the potential that might have been realized with more time and money. More diplomacy and more varied interactions and scripted events would definitely have helped the pacing problems in the mid-game.-Pacing problems. The greatest content is at the start when you are busy trying to set everything up and get recruits and resources to deal with opening crises and character conflicts but this dries up in the mid-game pretty fast leaving you scavaging and fighting the remaining areas on the map until the scripted end-game sequence leading to the finale and one of the game's true endings.  That's all there is to say, I'm afraid.SummaryIf my hour count is any indication (I bought this game when it first came to steam early access), then I have certainly gotten my money's worth a few times over from this game.  It took a very long time for my interest in the game to wane and it certainly improved technically and qualitatively from a gameplay standpoint from its most recent reanimated patch.  Nearly all of the game related bugs are long gone by now and the game itself is a lot more tense and exciting with the hardcore and PC infected options enabled from said patch.  My only real disappointments with the game largely result from the fact that they simply did not have more than a matchbox budget to start with from their modest kickstarter and that has certainly plagued this game's development for a very long time.  That said, I remain quite fond of this indie game company and its devs for the hours of tense enjoyment they have given me since this game's release to Steam for early access and what they accomplished with such a small low-budget.  The indie team are, IMHO, very passionate about their work and considerately attentive in regards to their community.  For all its flaws and rough edges, this game is amazing in its concept, focus, and scope.  Nearly every other game on zombies boils down to a button mashing action kill fest but this game takes a more cerebral approach to its gameplay mechanics where the focus is on survival not just of your one avatar or a few NPCs but an entire community of folks whose problems go far beyond the basic humdrum of scavanging and NPC questing.  The game doesn't deprive you of either or from simply going toe to toe again the zombie hordes and the diverse medley of surviving human factions.Bottom Line: This is an amazing little game for such a small indie team.  Excellent Concept, decent implementation, a good mix of features that are especially rare for a genre plagued by first person shooter fare.  You'll also find far more meaningful choices than can be found in any Telltale Game.  Its rare for a game of this type to hold my interest for as many hours as I've logged into it over the years; so yes, I would definitely recommend this game in its most recent incarnation without reservation to any fan looking for a more cerebral Zombie Survival RPG game that casts you as the Headman of a small community of quarralsome survivors struggling to survive the Horrors of the Apocalypse together.

												I've never written a review before, but I always read them before I buy a game.  I'm writing this review in hopes that people won't overlook this great game because the some negative reviews have scared them off.  If you love the idea of the zombie apocalypse, resource managment & turn based tactical games (like JA 2, X-Com, Xenonauts, etc) you will love this game if you can get by the bugs (which are the source of most of the negative reviews).What I like about the game:After the zombie apocalypse surviving would be a day to day grind.  Dead State perfectly replicates this.  You struggle to keep up food supplies, fuel for the generator, and morale for a group of people with realistic differences who have been thrown together in this shelter to survive.  The members of the shelter all have their own goals and agendas, they fight amongst themselves, and some challenge your leadership at every turn.  To keep them happy you can bribe, threaten, negotiate with them.  When crisises occur you have to walk a fine line to keep most of the people happy, never being able to make everyone happy.  Outside of the shelter you have to deal with zombies, looters, psychos, outlaw bikers, racist militias and everyone else who would go insane if law & order was gone.  Combat is not only a struggle to win, but to do so using the minimum force needed to win.  Ammo is always short for the good guns, and gunfire attracts hordes of zombies.  Hordes of zombies are bad, M'kay.What's wrong with the game: The game has bugs.  I'm not talking about crashes, but about storyline/dialog bugs.  These are a little annoying, but certainly didn't ruin the game for me.  There are a few technical glitch type bugs, but with some help from the forums on the company's webpage, I was able to work past all of them.  The developers are actively working them out.  Honestly, I think the full release should have been delayed another month or so.  If they had, the reviews would have been far more positive.  But, the X-mas season drives release dates.  The developers are running a business, so I can't blame them for it.All things considered I LOVE this game!  I haven't been this addicted to a game in years.  If you can look past the bugs, you will love this game.			"

												Dead State needs some serious rebalancing in the early stages... I'm all for gritty and realistic, but when it seems more than half the looters you encounter on your first day have guns, and you don't, it negatively impacts initial enjoyment as you watch your characters getting blown away in 2 shots, before you even land a single melee blow on the looter...Additionally to this, the tutorial is virtually pointless and the manual does not give much more insight... Dead State lacks 'hover over' tool tips for character conditions, once again making early play arduous whilst you're trying to figure out what exactly is going on...Dead State shows considerable potential, but IMO it feels as though it still requires alot of work before reaching it and I would not recommend buying Dead State as is...If you don't mind your survivors getting blown away at the drop of a hat on your first day, while you're still trying to figure out the basics, then Dead State is almost certainly for you however...**** ADDED AFTER 31 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY ****Kept plugging away since I had paid for it and, once you actually manage to get a little armour and some better gear, Dead State actually starts to become quite enjoyable.. That is until you start getting better and better gear, at which time it becomes almost too easy... Zombies can barely inflict any damage and even gunfire is of little concern, only reiterating my previous assessment that rebalancing is required, not just in the early game, but even in the later stages.The longer you play, the more bugs you will also encounter such as 'misplaced' enemies (sprite in a different location to where they are physically recognised by the game), to-do tasks that are never completed, unusual inventory management and item stacking anomalies and game events that do not seem to trigger correctly.BIGGEST ISSUE NOW : after nearing the 30 hour play time mark, I am now encountering regular random CRASHES TO DESKTOP. There is absolutely no reason for this, as everything has been running fine until close to 25+ hours when I first started encountering CTD issues.It's my suspicion that the more your explore, recover and improve your compound, the more unstable the game engine becomes, which would fit in line with what other people (and some professional reviews) have also mentioned.Once again, even having invested 30 hours into Dead State, I would NOT recommend it in it's present release state and it requires considerable further work before it can be considered to be truely 'finished'...It is my opinion that THIS IS NOT A FULL RELEASE GAME IN IT'S PRESENT STATE - IT IS LITTLE MORE THAN A LATE-STAGE PUBLIC BETA, THAT PRETENDS TO BE A FINAL RELEASE.

												While I enjoyed the concept, style, and story of Dead State, I cannot fully recommend it. This is due almost entirely to the punishing morale system of your shelter. Even allys with ""good"" or ""okay"" moods give you a negative moral penalty. You have to constantly scour the country side in search of ""special"" morale linked items for individuals in your shelter. And even when you're constantly showering your allies with said items, a ""good"" negative moral penalty is the best you're gonna get. God help you if the generator runs out of gas, an ally dies(for any reason), or you mishandle a crisis event. Any of the following will lead to a morale death spiral. Inevitibly, the more allys you gain, the more daily negative moral penaltys you recieve and it ends with Davis gunning you down and a game over screen(worst case scenario). I enjoyed the gameplay despite the last-gen graphics, but the morale system killed the game for me. 5.5/10.			"

												It's with a heavy heart that I find this game a bit lacking, only four hours in and not much into the plot.  I love the concept, I really do--but it's taking a long time to get into the meat of it, and the interface, while not bad, is sorely missing that last coat of wax.  Having to rotate the camera to reach containers, not being able to see into buildings that I haven't entered even when I should have LOS, fumbling around to click the right tiles...and NPCs that seem to promise tremendous interactivity at the beginning, but don't follow it up outside of cutscenes.I'll come back to it later, I'm sure, but I don't feel terribly excited.  More than anything else, Dead State feels *dated* even though it's brand new.  It nailed Fallout 1 a little more than it should have...I'm okay with the mechanics, but that's not the interface that modern games should emulate.  Long, slow-paced games NEED some amazing polish on their interface so that they're a joy to play even when nothing is going on, and Dead State just doesn't have that polish.  I'm sure there's a great game lurking further underneath, but it seems like a pain to get there.Shame.  This was the game I looked forward to more than anything else on my wish list.			"

												Great concept! But everything else falls flat. Graphics: I'm not a graphic snob, but even 14 years ago these graphics would be dated. I can get over that, however it plays into combat. It's hard to see where you can move to during combat due to the dead bodies on the floor. You can't tell the difference between a looter or a zombie, you have to scroll over them...I mean if they are holding a shotgun, prolly going to be a looter.Combat: The tactics are okay, in the new patch the characters seem to connect a lot more. However it's hard to set up a battle and get your characters to where you want them to be. This should be the highlight of the game but the ratio of how much damage you put out and get is way off.It's challanging in a good way, but when you have to save before a fight it's a little too much.  Plus there is no real upside from fighting, unlike most tatical games you gain levels or xp, in this game concept you gain xp for upgrading your shelter. I feel like your always grossly out numbered, looters aren't push overs and even zombies can take several hits to kill.			"

												The game is honestly fun. I should love it. It has a lot of what I enjoy in video games, recruiting a bunch of party members, building a base, turn based combat, rpg elements, zombies, and much slaughter. . . But the game is not finished. Not even close. It is so chock full of bugs to be completely absurd. Last night I recruited Ulysses Ford and his three compatriots but lolguesswut! Ulysses and Darlene don't actually show up anywhere! But they go to talk to me in their little morning chat events and their models aren't even on screen! I have access to a helicopter but no options to do anything with it (can anyone confirm that any of the endings are actually working?)! The hotel was an effing nightmare getting through as you have to move your guys around ten times to get to where your party is ""gathered before venturing forth"" up the damn stairs when they are all grouped right the eff up any way! Couple that with the times when you can go through a door after going up the stairs, one of your dudes will be standing inside the door and you have to move him out into the hall (full of mercenaries with some of the best armor in the game and righteous weaponry) before you can get one of your other guys to either break the door down or pick the lock.... I want to love this game but it still needs a ♥♥♥♥-ton of work before it can be called ""complete."" Dammit DoubleBear, this is why we have trouble trusting Early Access games these days!

												Let me start by saying ive followed and played this game for awhile and saw lots of potential and promise from the developers. However i started playing the final release and i am disgusted at what is being passed off as a complete game. There are numerous crashes that should have been fixed ages ago. This game promised to delve so deep into a zombie apocalypse that it would include much more than just bashing zombies.. it also promised tactical combat and in depth group management.. all we get is a game with limited at best combat and group management. I waited untill the full release to see if these things would be fixed, and they havent. The game is basic, and playing it you will see that nearly all that was promised is missing. Average graphics, limited dialogue, Biggest let down of the year. To try and make the communication challenging all they have done is program npcs to be fairly moronic. Nothing feels natural and you will not be drawn into the politics of your group.Comparing this game to fallout which has real tactical combat is an insult to people that actually took time to make their game legendary. Everything in dead state feels awkward and clumsy right down to firing weapons. There are no tactics in combat except for taking in turns. If i could get my money back i honestly would. Disgusted.

												Spent 168 hours with the game, both beta and full release. Wanted to finish it before I reviewed it.I really enjoyed this game. It was exactly what I was looking for in a Zombie Survival scenario.I love basebuilding and while the system was simple, seeing my home base develop was grand.I love the characters you can recruit. And the fact that some <most> of them don't like each other. Managing your people is a big part of the game. I like that.I also like that not all of them are necessarily likeable people. But I played it trying to save as many as possible.Game still had some bugs. None of them were game breaking for me. The 5 post release patches have made things better. I expect further patches will make things even smoother.After I fininished I was left wanting more. Which to me is the deciding factor. So this game is well worth your 30 bucks. "

												Dead State is a turn based game where the player has to manage a community of survivors during the zombie apocalypse. In theory, this should be my kind of game. I like fighting zombies, and I like turn based combat. Sadly, I don't like Dead State. Its not a terrible, broken game, I'm just feeling kind of ... bored.The biggest problem is that I've discovered that zombies and turn based combat don't mix together.I like turn based combat systems because of the tactical depth that they allow. I enjoy analysing what weapons and abilities my squad has, what type of enemies I'm up against, their abilities, the map layout and figuring out my plan of action. But zombies don't have abilities. No healers, no area of effect attacks, no teleports, no debuffs, no summons. They just walk up to the nearest person and bite them. Dead State has no special infected. Sure, there are some Human enemies. But they either melee the nearest person, or shoot the nearest person. There is no tactical depth. You can't even put your guys on overwatch. Nor can you control your companions' stats, because they auto-level up. Want to improve someone's ranged weapons skill? Well that guy is taking melee because screw you.I just realised that all the other zombie games I enjoy - Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil, Dying Light, Dead Rising, Killing Floor, State of Decay - the action is real time, fast paced, and you're fighting through large hordes. Plus they all have special infected which keeps the combat interesting.The other thing about Dead State that stands out to me is the poor sound design. Weapon sounds feel flat, the ""arghs"" a character/zombie makes when they get hit are dull, there's no voice acting for cutscenes and the music is too slow and quiet. I don't often comment on sound, I guess its one of those things that I don't notice when its done properly, but as soon as it goes wrong, its really obvious. I'm convinced the lack of exciting sound is contributing to my feeling of boredom.I can't even motivate myself to keep playing Dead State, so I'm certainly not going to recommend anyone else to pick it up. Very disappointing.			"

												Short review: Fallout meets State of Decay - buy it ;)Long Version: Dead State is all about the apocalypse feeling after a zombie disaster. You have to build your little shelter, gater other survivors and keep them alive as well as happy. At the same time there is a rough ""bigger"" story, which you can follow to different endings.Good points:.,Exploration of the state, with random encounters and mostly different maps..,Fallout like character creation of your own survivor, including different skills/attributes and the improvements of these (including perks)..,Many different weapons/armors and other equipments..,A great variety of survivor characters, which create a good part of the atmosphere, together with the radio DJ and the messages you can find throughout the game. But beware, some may work against you, they have their own personalities ;).,You can - up to a point - play an really evil style as well as a normal or even good and helpful guy..,Long playtime.,Base building, weapon modding etc..,great humorIndifferent points:.,Combat - It mostly works fine as it is, but naturally could use some more options.,The late middle game can drag a bit.,. There could be more dialogues/interaction with the survivors, since it is one of the strongest parts of the game, i can´t get enough of it.Not so good points:., Not an optimal balancing.. zombies become kinda less dangerous, when you have better armor, same is with weapons - you won´t use most of the melee weapons. At least i don´t.,. Still much room for improvement regarding the handling of your fellow survivors/items etc.,. Many (mostly smaller) glitches still in the game (sometimes characters ""float"" or zombies stand on the same tile etc.).Nothing gamebreaking though for me.So, in the end, i have my fun with it, even if it´s still a bit rough on the edges. A very overlooked zombie rpg/strategy gem, which really didn´t deserve some of the negative review trolling it got.Hope to see much more of this game!			"

												There seems to be 2 reviews of  this game. either it is the dumbest game due to ui problems or its the greatest game because you have a base and zombies. was very concerned about the bad reviews before getting this game , because so many people said it had bad ui and how can that many people be wrong. well they were wrong... the ui granted is horrible if you dont know what you are doing and give up 2 seconds into the game. things you need to know:!. if you kill a guy/zombie you can move on that square still( seen a lot of reviews saying you cant)2. right click the mouse on your guys, doors, dead bodys etc, gives you more options.3 if you double click a square or container your guys will run to it, making it go a lot faster.4.when you start the game hitting 'z' will show you an icon about containers that are lootable.( bad part is when you leave game it turns itself off.)5.your bed looks like everyone elses bed, except when you put the mouse on your bed it make a bed icon and says players bed!!! ( saw a bad review saying it took him 30 mins to find his bed....)6. in the base, if you go to the stash you can in the upper left corner select other people besides your main guy, making inventory and equiping items way more easier.ok with that being said dont be scared of this game because of bad ui, its not bad if you know a little of what you are doing!!!!ok i do like this game i give it a 7/10 total. would be higher if it had more replay value. but i do have a bunch of time into the game so was worth getting it, still playing it too.some people said they had lag or crashed with them game, but mine runs great i have had it crash a couple of times but its rare for me and it auto saves a lot so didnt lose much time.pros:the base is well done, and you dont see a lot of games with one.story and dialog is good and you have to make choices that effect the game.like the noise idea, zombies will come if you make noise with guns or breaking done doors. depending on the noise and the location of the zombies, also you can use this to your advantage. fighting ai humans, zombies can distract and soak up a lot of their bullets!! but remember if they die from a zombie now they become a zombie!! also their are items you can use to make a lot fo noise like firecrackers.character making is cool and has good perks and you can differently make tons of different main characters. do you want to be a zombie killing machine? melee and strength! want to be a gun pro? go rrange and preception. want your base thrive? their is survial, mechanics, science, leadership etc.saw a bad review saying he couldnt hit zombes in the begining, yeah if you dont have enough strength to pick up a sledge hammer and no melee skills you cant use melee weapons.... and also you dont know how much life an enemy has, true but its around 60-80 for zombies and depending on the type of human you are fighting, like a soldier is harder to kill than a looter. will say guns arent that realistic in terms of range but its balanced nicely. so is melee.cons:replay might not be a lot of that, every location is static and the enemies you find there are too and most events i think are static. items you find in those area can differ a little but not that much like you might find different special items like this had coffee and now its batteries. or the food types might be different(which doesnt matter at all).minor con: is the ui but once you figure it out its pretty good.leveling up in the game is dorky. basically you have goals you need to pass, like find x amount of fuel or food or this resource and if you pass it you get a skill point. there are goals you can complete as many times as you want and then there are one time shelter goals like build 10 upgrades to shelter, but some dont give you points... and not sure but as far as i can tell you just get one point, and every 20 skill points you get a stat point. also all other character you cant lvl yourself, they put there point into what ever they want based on the type of character they are i think. like my doctor she put her points into medicine( make sense) and for the most part its not bad just that you have to add skill point into stuff you dont want because i have poeple who have mechanic skill but no science skill and people with science skill and no mechanic skill and there are upgrades, jobs, crafting etc. that require both. also so far to me putting points into medical is a waste, i have 2 medical people in my base and so far that plenty.wish there were more upgrades to shelter or that resources are done differnently. all resources are finite to a degree, but you can make food pretty easily and parts once you get a recyler. fuel on the other had and ammo are hard to deal with. you can make ammo if you upgrade your shelter but it costs fuel to make and you use fuel everyday for the generetor, wish there was solar panels or some way to make electricity besides the generator. this reason too is why i dont use a car in the game just horses. also the base seems lacking somehow, maybe if there was options to move to different locations gave different bonuses but then not sure how upgraded would work excatly if you did move. also you find tons of cars in the game, but you never can use them...i dont mine the combat, but some people might fine it boring or tire some after a while. also comabt is very skill point based, if you dont have high range/perception you cant use a gun very well or melee/strength you cant use hand held weapons very well.closing: good game i got for 10-11 dollars very happy i got it, get it if you like zombies but dont be scared by the bad ui reviews.

												OOk this game is still a bit buggy, but should you buy it.If you like turn based games, like fallout 1 and 2. XCom both old and new then YES!!I know I don't like buggy games and normally would avoid them. So why on earth would I recommend the game?1. None of the bugs are game breakers ""anymore"" that has all been patched.2. Loads and loads of content here. Way, way, way more than I ever expected from a 29 dollar game.3. It is very fun.When I say it has a lot of content, here is what I mean.1. Battle maps, you know how when you play some games you feel like you have been on the same battle map 28 times That never happens here, every map is new, and hand crafted. The only repeats are in random encounters and those are avoidable.2. Loads of NPC that can join you, more then 30, each with their own portraits, stats, skills. perks, story, likes, interactions and requests.3. Improvements, yes you can add many features to your base.4. Multiple mode of transport. Foot, horse, or car5. Politics, there are faction in your own groups that effect your decisions.6. Equipment, there are hundreds of items in this game. You pick up a new shiny piece of armor and put it on, guess what your character changes to look like he is using it. Same with weapon and helms. Too many games just skip that these days. I like to see what my character looks like. 7. Build your own character the way you like. You pick there stats and skills. You decide how to deal with others.8. Fighting styles, you don’t just have to run up and take a swing, you have different options with different weapons. Maybe you want to try to knock them down, push them back, spray mace in their face. It’s up to you.9. The radio, everyday there is a new message no repeats. It’s a “live” show, so if you don’t listen to the radio that day you miss the message. 10. A mini hacker game, over 100 data bit can be found and hacked to find out what in themIf you like this kind of game, it’s bound to be a classic and it’s underpriced, there’s a lot more here than a 29 dollar game.Enjoy!!

												For the stupid people that think this is a new post, ADD, on meds or anything of the like. The review is 7 months old I stoped wasting my time because I found the game broken. End of story. Thanks bye! Let's get to the meat of why I said no. and this game rates at 50 / 100 pointsWith regard to the development team they put a decent amount of work into this and YES it still requires work. There are bugs. There is no audio where there should be, there is ""music"" but it's the same depressing music, while at the school and the same music for combat.. ho humm boring. I still know how to read and I guess that's a great thing considering you will read until your eyes drop out. Even cool quirky comments between characters  can be missed when characters are on mission because unless you are looking at them you will miss it. SO NO AUDIO! +40. The rest: Graphics, unique or different ideas, new story lines, semi realistic world, sand box play however adds up to maybe  +10 points. If you want a End of Day sim this is not it.If you know AYTHING about FIREARMS this game will ♥♥♥♥ you off.If you know about scavenging this is not for you, you again will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.If you get excited about just poking around to find random bean and toilet paper you might like this game.If you hate trying to find random junk in random places this game is going to aggravate you.What would make this game better! Take all the great things from XCOM / Jagged Alliance and make it a Zombie game. I have no idea why Double Bear did not do this!			"

												You want opinions, well, here they are.- The character interaction between the people at the shelter is fantastic.All the characters have different likes and dislikes as well as personalities.Some might be kind and helpful, other might be psychotic and one or two might be complete sociopaths who care for nobody besides themselves.You also get to interact with them in a meaningful way at times, meaning you can at certain points steer them into choosing paths (for example there was one who asked me if they should be a better shot or a better harvester).-The map. It's HUGE, there are so many places that you can visit that it's almost overwhelming at times. There are different types of locations from an abandoned gas station to a two story hospital and a nine-story hotel.-LevelingIt's not your usual type of leveling, you don't level up by killing but by the goals you finish to better the shelter. For example, bring home 100 food and/or 50 luxury items. These can be mixed and done at random. One of my favorite is 'decrypting' data-discs by basically solving an anagram.-The shelter/basebuildingIt's nothing fancy but it gets the job done. You have certain things you can build to improve the shelter, such as a sturdier fence or a car to be able to travel faster on the map. It's nothing extraordinary but it's effective and does what it's supposed to.-CombatVery simple and disappointing. However, since there are more than one faction (besides the zombies) you can now and then run into different groups fighting each-other and decide to either jump in and start killing or wait out to see who's the victor and then attack them.Now for the bad parts.-Bugs, bugs and more bugsSome bugs can be annoying, such as not being able to loot certain stuff while others might be somewhat game-breaking (as event not triggering or not being able to fix broken things in the shelter). This is something that can and should put most people off from playing the game as of now since if you spent 40+ hours just to have everything break down and then make you wait til there's a patch that fixes it.Because of the bugs I can't recommend this since I can't even finish the game due to CTD's at the end fight.I would give this game 7 carrots out of 4 bears holding 20 poker-cards.

												This game was great fun initially.  Playing it in early access, I was forgiving of the bugs and unfinished portions of the game, looking forward to being able to play the finished product.  However, DoubleBear took their unfinished product, declared it released, and haven't patched it since.  If you look on the Discussion board, they haven't even bothered to so much as update the FAQ from 2014, which still declares it an early access game.If they could finish the game, update it to allow the story arcs that they dropped, or open up Steam workshop or something to allow the players to complete the storyline, then I would consider this game complete.  But as it is, this is still in Beta.  Since this is the first impression that I got of DoubleBear, I don't have a positive outlook on the quality of their future products, or any feeling of loyalty.			"

												I bought this after reading the many positive reviews and all I can say is that the reviewers either have very low standards or they work for DoubleBear!The game is full of bugs and crashes that should have been fixed during early access, it's nowhere near a finished game.  Combat is simplistic and clumsy, no tactics and an awful interface, and the comparisons with x-com and fallout are really misleading, this isn't in the same league by a country mile.			"

												This is my first review on Steam; have some strong feelings about this game and wanted to share. PROS- A zombie apocalypse game that doesn't focus on the zombies. - Tons of survivors to interact with- The Splendid, Texas school as an upgradable compound- Nice top-down iso graphics. Old-school, but fun and 360-degree camera panning- AddictiveCONS- Too easy - I'm on day 30 and have a ton of food, high morale, and more supplies than I can shake a stick at- Needs more/various upgrades to the shelter. As with ""too easy,"" I'm almost done upgrading the entire shelter and soon will have nothing for my survivors to do except eat food- Limited scavenging team ability. Your character must lead every team. I have a great fisherman in my compound, but he can't lead a team to the local lake and go fishing unless I'm there with him all day. A waste of time since he could be fishing while I'm killing zeds and bringing back ammo, fuel, or other depletable items.- Poor zombie AI. Pull one zed, park your team 6 squares away. The zombie will walk right up next to you. Bash it on your turn. Lather, rinse, repeat.All that said, I  continue to play the game as this genre appeals to me, especially without the 1st person blood-and-gore fest that most zombie/survival games have become. I love the strategy level game, the building of a compound, the interaction of characters... just wish it was a little tougher. Still, a great game, though perhaps not at $30 yet. Try the demo first; you can play for 7 days - plenty of time to see the coolness factors. But keep in mind that by day 30+ there's not a lot left to do and gameplay becomes repetitive. Hope for more updates/upgrades/mods in the future, but I'll probably still keep coming back to it just because there's not much out there like it.			"

												This game suffers from a series of issues.1) The combat system is terrible. I mean it's truly terrible; this thing is somehow less fun, functional, and challenging than Fallout 2, which is 20 years old. This is further compounded by pisspoor A.I.2) Where was the UX designer? The amount of glaring flaws in this game, flaws you'll notice within the first 5 minutes of gameplay, are astounding. Examples: Why are there no weight limit indicators visible WHILE LOOTING CORPSES, vision cones/agro ranges on enemies, range overlays for your guns, etc. Stuff that an intern UX still in college would be able to decipher.3) Torque 3d. Because of how awful this engine is, you can expect crashes. Lots of them. The refusal to use other Engines baffles me, especially considering the Unreal Engine is free.I had followed this game for 2 years waiting for it to evolve, and at it's finest moments.... it's playing like a vastly inferior version of Wasteland 2. It's saturated with all the concepts you know and love from games of the past, with none of the perks or joys from new age titles. Base building: It's like a D+ version of X-Com'sSurvivor management: It's a slightly better version of State of Decay's (since characters have personalities) with far less customization optionsTurn-based combat: F; it's inexcusably boring, uninteresting, and slow-paced. Even for a turn-based tactical game, it's pitifully slow. I would go as far as to say it's the worst, most unintuitive combat system I have personally ever experienced (and I played Shadow Vault)NPC interaction: It's very lacking. My choices, while phrased differently, seem wholly irrelevant and meaningless. Dialogue feels like a farce.A few other things worth noting: - I have no way to know what enemies are hard, and what enemies are not. They all look the same, but some hit WAY HARDER and have WAY MORE HP than others.- It's ridiculously hard to see the ""Loot is here"" indicator; why a dull orange color was used, as opposed to like a dark green or red, I will never understand.- Replay value seems non-existent. Want to win the game? Make a melee character, gradually ramp up to ranged, and walk through the game on cruise control.- It's incredibly frustrating when you're fighting and 23 zombies have to move before you can. It's exacerbated by the fact that I can't turn up combat move speed to expedite the process.I want to recommend it because I support indie studios... but I just can't. There are just entirely too many visible flaws in this game that suggest the lead designer either doesn't know what features are missing... or even worse, is not listening to feedback from his team about these absent features and mechanics.

												This game's strength lies in the character interaction. Your choices as leader of a group of survivors are meaningfull. There are many interesting places to explore and discover around the map and interesting survivors to recruit. It should be noted that the begining of the game can be frustrating. Primarily because the combat system and the interface are not the best. I suggest reading a tutorial on how to engage the interface becasue the tutorial is not enough.  "

Early Access Review
								Clever design. Nothing inovative, but satisfying. The demo is short and has VERY little replay value. On a whole the game is very linear. I think most people were expecting something more freeform or open like the other zombie games. However, it's just an RPG set in a zombie apocolypse. Nothing more, nothing less. The final game will be worth $25-maybe the $30 they are going to ask. However, I don't think the demo is worth $25 unless you have been dying to get your hands on this one. I can however say that there are few bugs to be found.			"

			Views: 34,808		

			Welcome to Dead State: The Zombie Survival RPG! This is an Early Access Beta version of the game and is not representative of the final product.		

For some other first impressions - I backed this on Kickstarter many many many months ago and have been following it quite closely ever since ... It seemed to promise to have the social interaction of The Zafehouse Diaries with tactical turn based combat and a healthy amount of base builing mechanics ... I have played through the first day a couple of times trying out different things (and am looking forward to diving into Day 2 and beyond)A couple of things ... There has been some confusion over simple mechanics such as how to exit the school for the first time and enter onto the world map ... having a tooltip or even a simple hovering pointer would stop this being a point of difficulty for first time players ... also if you are unable to sleep in your bed because you cannot select continue ... simply increase your games resolution and the continue icon will be clickable!Those two bugs aside ... the game plays exactly like I hoped it would ... the combat is brutal and unforgiving (I lost a character to a stupid decision in less than 2 seconds ... dead ... gone ... forever!)  ... I have high hopes for the base building and the social interaction mechanics but as of right now ... this is a solid early access demo and as long as you go into it acknowledging that it IS an early demo/beta then you will not be dissapointed!Looking forward to the whole game!!SloshworksPS - Please make the zombie walking animation in combat just a tiny bit faster ;-)			"

												PRE-REANIMATED PATCHSome things in this review may or may not have changed. I suggest you look at a more recent review. This one was made shortly after the game's release.Not worth it right now at that price (28€) unless you are extremely tolerant of zombie games. Not a good SRPG or Survival game -Shelter feels lifeless since every survivor just stands still -Engine can't handle maps with lots of enemies -No basic SRPG features like interrupts/overwatch -Pathfinding outside of combat is very wonky -Human AI is very basic just rushes to you in a straight line whether or not they're using guns-Zombies do not roam and bandits don't patrol either -Zombie maps are so easy they're a whack-a-mole minigame -Bandits and zombies teleport to the edge of your field of view when they are on the move and out of sight in realtime -You can shoot through some obstacles -Can't rebind keys, AZERTY keyboards can't even type the damn M key in the datacenter (and yes switching to an US keyboard doesn't work) -When lured on a position bandits all converge on it and stay there until the end of times -UI is serviceable but is missing some key features like showing looted containers -Zombies who are crippled can't attack-OST is forgettable at best... It goes on and on. Filled to the brim with bugs and lacks features/polish, deserved more time in developement.If you're looking for a SRPG with good mechanics and a zombie apocalypse background I'd say the asking price is kinda high right now (unless money really isn't a problem for you). If you're looking for a zombie game that happens to be a SRPG I'd say go for it because let's be honest, the market might be saturated with zombie games right now but it's saturated with bad zombie games. Dead State happens to fall in the kinda alright category and as far as zombie games go it's already an accomplishement. Most of the minor issues with the game can probably be resolved with a patch too (and maybe will be by the time you read this) even if the main problem I have with it will still persist : a SRPG with little tactical depth and a lack of polish. It's up to you to decide if that really bothers you.			"

												So, I've played the early access, the release and then the Reanimated game.Well, the game has great ideas and features, but there's a lot a minor details which make the game not so good eventually.For instance, you were able to sneak kill a zombie in the early access, now, in the Reanimated, when you try sneaking behing a zombie, he spots you and attacks you first...  There's still a few collision and graphical issues, and the game gets boring (loot and build)Relationships between characters are too scripted.			"

												Come a long way since alpha. I enjoy this kind of game, not so tactical as to make it a chore, instead focusing on the story and the flow. It fills its own nieche in post apocalyptic survival games, and it does it well with a mix between combat, human interaction and planning.Highly recommended to anyone who likes a bit of thinking and wants a beer and pretzels game.(Still has a few bugs, but nothing game breaking.)

												As a Kickstarter backer, I was excited for this release before it even existed.Then the developer decided to act infantile over a single member of the community and lash out publicly.  This is not behaviour befitting an aspiring entrepreneur.This is all it takes to make or break yourself in the business world (not necessarily the gaming industry): Professionalism.You have it, use it.  Failure to use it and your customers think less of you.  Such as the case for me.I am disappointed to have stood behind this developer and invested in their idea, because their demeanour is unfitting of someone I would ever collaborate with.Bottom line, support developers that deserve it.  This one does not.			"

												This game has got to be one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time. I've dumped tons of time into it and intend to continue doing so, The reply value on this game is high. I've read a lots of the reviews, I'm not sure I understand what they continue to rant about. The game is worth the money put into it. If you can get 1 hour per dollar you've spent the game is worth it. There are some things that need to be fixed. Look at their forums they are by no means ignoring this and continue to work to do just that. Take the game for what it is, There's nothing out there quite like it. I've really enjoyed the game, there's bugs true but all and all, I'd totally pay for a DLC expansion hands down no question. You've created something that no one else has come close to, Continue your outstanding work. Thanks Dead State for the hours of fun you've provided.			"

												I've played this game for, steam tells me, just under 25 hours over the past three days. Enough time for a fair first impressions review. So here is the short version, playing this game is like eating a fine icecream after you dropped it on the beach. It is tasty, and cool, and sweet, but every lick has annoying grit in it, and it has a salty aftertaste you don't care for.This game is so full of bugs, it needs fumigation.Don't buy it. Come back in six months and see if anyone has bothered to fix this, because as it is, it's an annoying mess.Ok, details, for those without ADHD.This has a great game in it. But like watching a scratched to hell DVD of your favourite film, it jutters along tripping over the various bugs, made all the more infuriating because you were enjoying the bits inbetween.So what is wrong?Bluntly, the game is not finnished. It's a late alpha of a great game or an early early beta of a good one. Here are a list of the actual bugs I have run into:* Graphics options don't save, so I have to reset them each time I start the game.* KO'd characters who are saved with a medical satchel are still considered dead once you return to the shelter. They can no longer be spoken to and are missing from the job board. The end of day lists them as lost - even though they are still stood in place in the school (2 instances).* No splitting of stacks. I picked up 12 gallons of fuel in lots of 1 or 2. I needed to split it between my characters to grab the last bit of loot - no deal. Or, ammo. Can't divide my ammo between the two characters using 9mm weapons. (persistant).* Zombie model not in the correct place on the combat grid. Or is confused. Main character was being hit by said zombie, but any character that attacked that zombie moved six tiles down an aisle in a store to attack the zombie on a tile which does not appear to be occupied. Think displacer beast. (1 instance).* Highly unstable client. The quicksave option should be for a cautious player moving into a challenging area of play, not as a safety measure against the game crashing. Dangerous moments seem to be as the day is ended in your bedroom (4 instances), speaking to people (2 instances), transitioning into or out of random encounters on the world map (9 Instances). Moving between basement and first floor of school (1 Instance).*I healed 'Cindy' after I KO'd her. Rightly or wrongly I thought I may be able to recruit her to my group because she had a name, and was the first living hostile I had encountered. She got back up and resumed her attack (note, not as a zombie - as a knife wielding crazy) but could no longer attack her. No assault icon, just standard pointer with no function. (1 Instance).*Easily broken steel rails on the plot. Began submitting data to the 'system' before Doug builds it.  * Davis tells me to go to a specific pharmacy for antibiotics for Doug - Just after I returned from looting the place.   * Max vanishes after his arrival and cannot be seen until he 'heals' 72 hours later.  * Despite being an only survivor of a scavanging mission, Davis berrates me for shooting first at the Human campsite. Claims someone on the mission complained but will not name who. - Did not notice a oija board in his office.  * Max complains about not being taken along on patrols - yet has been on one every day since he became available.You know what... I'm tired. I could go on... but you get the idea.It's a great game. Double Bear - please, please, please, please, please finnish this game. You released it very early. Too early. Put that behind us and put the game right.			"

												""Why do I even play this?""  I asked myself this after encountering another glitchy door before going into combat with a pack of armed looters.  Character walks through a closed door right into their arms- Why.Dead State is, for the most part, ""finished.""  The places are all there, most of them work, and there are a few things that make the game neat to play.  But that's about it.  For a text-based game, I'm entertained for a while.  But, something doesn't feel right...  The glitches, the static characters standing around doing nothing in any room at the base, the mundane grinding process, the fact that once I can't even assign a job to everyone I've brought together...  Well, there's the problem.  The game doesn't feel ""finished.""Once your character is good at leading, negotiating, and fighting, all that's left is finding the people you would actually want to have around- that is if you make it that far.  The game's combat system is cruel, unforgiving, repetitive, and I hope you don't mind bodies stacking on top of one another so you can't loot one of them. It's super disappointing to see this game ""released"" in the state that it is now, having watched development from the very start.This end product is rather boring.  Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy it, but more needs to be done to iron out the problems, more animations need to be added, and for God's sake, there needs to be a variation of death poses.  Everything I kill ends up laying there like it's planking- in some cases, forbidding me to loot the corpse, and we CAN NOT have that in a completed game.Dead State may mostly be finished, but it isn't, and if they don't bring the updates to fix these problems and to ""modernize"" what feels like a game from 2005, I'm unable to recommend it to anybody at the price they're charging.If you want this game badly enough, wait for a sale.  I wouldn't pay more than $14 for this in the state that it's in.  It just isn't up to par with more modern titles.  It's pretending to be a classic in 2015.LATEST EDIT.I'm sorry to those of you who support the game, and it's development team, but it appears that Dead State has been abandoned.  There are still numerous bugs, and there has not been a release of any editor tools to improve gameplay via Mods.  This is both disappointing and shameful; the least that this team could have done was offer to stick around for a while, but it's pretty clear they only sought to fulfill their Kickstarter obligations and jump ship.  They were never in it for the community.Dead State still feels like an incomplete game.  It still has its vintage C-Grade game graphics, and still fails to fulfill the full level of immersion one would expect from a game posing to be one purified Turn-Based RPG in style.  When comparing this to other games in my library, such as Wasteland 2, Arms Dealer, Kenshi, Project Zomboid, Space Engineers, and others, Dead State left Early Access before it was finished, and the Development team rushed a Reanimated edition, That means they decided to upgrade the game after it was released, showing you how much they care about the very principles of ""Early Access,"" wherein you actually get things done before putting out a game.The very fact that these developers left their community and game to rot is simply disgraceful; it's as if they're relying on pure name-recollection to keep a fanbase (Example: ""Oh, it's the company behind Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines! The game was okay, maybe this'll be better.""), which means they either don't care about their games or they don't care about you.  Seeing a game left in the dark like this is dishonorable.  You don't leave a half-♥♥♥♥♥ production sitting around, you fix it so it works for your customers or you lose your customers.  Bottom line.  I can tell you that I will not be giving Double Bear my business again.			"

												This game sounded like a dream game: zombie apocalypse, base building and management, recruiting survivors, turn-based combat, survival narrative. I thought it would be a mix of Suikoden II, X-Com and Fallout in a Zombie setting.But instead what you get is a shallow RPG experience, a base that doesn't really matter and which you don't really defend like you did in UFO: Enemy Unknown, one of the worst turn-based combat designs I've ever seen, and a whole crapload of tedium. The interface is also terrible.In your base, instead of being able to access crucial menus to manage your base, you have to run around it for no reason just to access different menus. This is just tedious and adds nothing to the game. If I wanted to explore the base, I'd do it by myself. To view your character list you need to run around as well, because you can't view a survivor's data all in one place. You need to run to the supply room to check their inventory, to the cafeteria to check their stats, and you can only see their perks and morale level in the Goals menu. Why is everything so fragmented? What is the point? Combat is a huge disappointment, and is hobbled by tiny rooms that are so hard to click around, a lack of proper hotkeys for player selection and reloading, stairs are particularly nasty as your people can only go through them one at a time and they are a teleport node instead of actually climbing them, so passing them completely isolates one guy to die to any enemies at the top. Worse, you cannot save while in the middle of combat. And the combat is so simplistic that it's even more barebones and basic than X-Com 1 back in the 90's. There's no saving action points to react to enemies, no cover mechanics, nothing.The actual game idea is compelling, and playing through it can be fun, but the game really does its best to make it hard for you to play it.

												Dead State is a survive-the-end-of-world themed game, on the base of party RPG with turn-based combat, in-depth team management, and the Shelter to build, supply and protect... It's a long-going indie project, which started quite low in the pre-release at 2014, but was significantly updated since then. While even now it is far from ideal, lacking something in every major game aspect, surprisingly, it is one of the most solid games in the zombie-apocalypse line. And in the ever-low-in-numbers squad/turn-based sub-genre especially. Why I like it? Because, generally, it makes sense - at least, at the start of the game. It is logical, ways above some well-known projects like all belonging to the ""Walking Dead"" franchise, in the first place. You have a shelter, a bunch of people to look for, and to help you, and all you do is basically the most real-case survival scenario - you roll down all the way to tribal age, and all you can (and need to) care about is your tribe. You hunt and kill, gather materials, build things and redistribute found resources and jobs for your crew, you tune the mood of each of your people, helping them so they can be of use for you in return... Not the worst job I had in my life, I guess.However, speaking of usual game's features, like the plot, the visuals and sound, interesting game mechanics, overall joy-out-of-the-game, sadly, the project is quite mediocre. There are some originality, sure, and it is fairly acceptable, generally, but the major hook of Dead State is the group survival topic. If you're down with it, and ready to numerous unimposing turn-based battles against reanimated corpses and marauders from different tribes - check the game. If you're generally looking for some catchy titles like the modern XCom or prefer quick-paced action - I doubt you'll be happy there. My mark is 7/10, and that's about all major words I have for ""Recommendation"".Some words more, about game aspects I found troubling, even while they sound good at first.1) the RPG elements and crew management. RPG is quite rigid there, basically, you have some skills and you'll be constantly facing various skill checks... being a leader is a tough job, especially when you can't send someone else as a head of marauding party. Really, one thing that buzz me, is that a good marauder must have high strength and battle skills (to carry loot and deal damage) and good leader have to have so many other crafts to prosper and guide - why it is so obligatory that only the main character should lead the field group?Crew management is another major problem. While generally people you gather around are not that bad and broken, as, for example, we have in the Valkyria Chronicles... but the morale system is really bugging me off, as well as the so-called ""sub-leaders"". Everyone is sad, every day every person brings overall morality down - but how do you supposed to deal with it? You can talk to them, giving them what they want, solve all their problems - and the results will be... average. But - you can scavenge a lot of books, CDs, tooth brushes and toilet paper - and the morale will be rocking! Am I the only one who thinks that's not how it supposed to be? Guess not.2) Turn-based combat is lacking, it is flat and not comparable even with the old titles like Fallout 1/2, not to mention modern projects like Xenonauts or Wasteland 2. I like the idea with sound which every weapon makes, but even that mechanic is far from perfect. Especially when I'm reaching 200db+, using only melee weapons, in the house where all doors shut - and it still attracts corpses, out of nowhere.3) The inventory and inventory management is another headache. For the game which is based on constant looting, this process is quite poorly optimised - still. Yeah, they made buttons like ""select all"" in the shelter inventory menu - but why only there? I had very hard time clearing the hotel recently - not because of mean mercs settled there, but for the amounts of stuff I was collecting with the very primitive interface system. Also, for a game, based in Texas, there are so little firearms, and the usage of those is so lame, I can never suggest Dead State to any Jagged Alliance fan - even if he prefers the first game over the second. Also, there is a weight of items ""feature"" - why some objects have those numbers, I really wonder. Like big 4) Finally, while it is good at start, I don't really like how the game is proceeding forward. Unobvious game goals I can tolerate, but the routine checking crops and malls around, to stuff even more junk food and another hundred of screwdrivers... Meh. In my second run through the game, after the first month, I've made all upgrades for the shelter, collected almost all aviable people, and stuff to feed them for years - yet, I still have to walk more and more, just to get along with stupid ""morale"" mechanic - and without any other main goal but ""to survive"". So what? I survived. But I can't really get over the basic level, I can't start some long-lasting relationships with other communities, I can't develop trade routes, or more shelters. After some time invested, the game's stacking, like the USSR in the 70-80's. And that's not the good thing.			"

												I love this game. Dead State is a survival management game set during the zombie apocalypse. And while killing zombies plays its part... its not the focus of the game. The real focus is on managing the lives of the living, whether its the people you take in and live with (their wants and desires and how they interact with you and everyone else in the shelter), or the rest of the people out in the zombie infested wilds of Texas (Rival shelters, lone survivors, looters or gangs small and large).Gameplay wise, it plays as a mix of the old classic fallouts and X-com. I love the noise mechanic for the zombies. Which makes the decision of when to switch from using the quiet melee weapons to the loud guns far more strategic than in most games.  I love that i can through a firecracker or bang on a door to lure the zombies toward a group of violent gang members and escape with the loot while they fight it out. I like the interactions with the NPC's in the game as well. Each person and group you let into the shelter alters how the shelter operates. Will this NPC be a disrupting influence or a helpful one? Will they contribute more than they take?Its a great game all around. Highly recommended.			"

												This is the Baulder's Gate, Fallout or Neverwinter Nights of Zombie Survivor Games - addictive and well executed. I was pretty disappointed with State of Decay due to it's endless random nature, but these guys got it right. Unless you grew up with games like Fallout or Baulders Gate, these games may not be for you - Turn Based games are typically slow and take a long time to complete, but some, like myself, find this rewarding and fun. There is tons of action packed into this game and many choices to be made, you'll probably find yourself playing it multiple times. With this said, the game still seems pretty buggy - I've had atleast 8 crashes within 48 hours, so save your game regularly.  The game also lacks dialogue audio, so it means a lot of reading. You may also find some of the GUI confusing, I've had to google a few things, around the Job board, cars, healing and trading inventory.			"

												Dead State is a great game. Like most other games on release day, this game has it's fair share of bugs that are still waiting to be worked out. Unlike most games, this game has a group of Devs that work very hard to fix those bugs, releasing patches constantly. They are very active with the community and even actively try to implement the things that the community asks for.This game has superb writing. Each character feels different, fleshed out, and does very well making me either like (or hate) them. There are very few games where characterization is this strong to make me actively worry about, and try to protect, certain allies in combat situations. This game is the Walking Dead you've been waiting for. Scavange, survive, upgrade your shelter, and try to save lives of other innocent survivors in the wake of this undead nightmare.While this game is still trying to get it's feet under it, it offers hours of play. And the replayability is huge! Don't like a survivor? Don't save them the second time around. Wanna see what happens if you kill off the other ""leaders"" of the group? Go for an outing they'll never come home from.			"

												Enjoyable while it lasted.I bought this game at a discounted price without reading its reviews. And while the negative reviewers have their points, there are some positives. In particular to me, the looting system was addicting. Gathering and organizing is an aspect of the game I enjoyed. Once you get the hang of it, stocking up on the essentals becomes easy and the difficulty level of the game plummets. After building all the upgrades, I just lost the will to play. While I enjoyed all the time spent on this game, it is untimately an unrewarding experience. Factor that with the bugs and unhelpful glitches...I could only recommend this game if its base price was under $10.*edit - At first this review was made without the mention of the developers unprofessional behavior in response to critisim. I honestly thought I should mention it.			"

												If you can look past all the bugs, this game is one of the best games ever created. Although the graphics aren't as good as GTA or COD or (Insert commonly played game), the story is rich, the mechanics are refreshing (turn-based is sort-of my thing), and zombies + scavenging is just something I wish gaming companies would make more of. I would, with the bugs, rate this 7.5/10.			"

												Solid turn based tactical combat and engaging shelter managment sim. So glad I kickstarted this one. I'm very impressed at the depth and complexity of the result.

												Fun idea for a game, but poor and simplistic execution.Good:- Turn based- Base building/repair- Rpg/stat based- Graphics are simple, but consistent and pleasant to look at and have a ""pastel comic book"" feel. The game is not tiring to eyes.- While weapon range is somewhat limited, it includes interesting choices such as handheld stun paralizers for example.Bad:- Very simplistic combat on squares. No hexes. Come on, Fallout 2 did it better ages ago.- No aiming at specific body parts (come on, no head aiming in a zombie game?!)- No terrain features other than ""impassable"" walls etc. If you thought about climbing on top of a car to fight off a horde, you can forget it. No taking cover from enemy fire behind walls, garbage bins etc. - Very few and simplistic critical hits, status effects etc- Very poor inventory management, including no handgun unloading (wtf?!)- No trading items between party members in base (only in missions which makes it a pointless fuss)- Similar as above = you can't enter party members character screens in base, so you don't even know how badly wounded they are etc.- No sneaking- Human opponents have dumb AI- Guns have unrealistic short ranges- Characters aren't interesting, neither friendly nor hostile humans have much of a persoanlity (except maybe 1 friendly character).- Characters in combat are ""activated"" in a fixed ""initiative"" system, which makes for very poor coordination and cooperation between characters, as well as limits tactical options. I guess the devs thought it would make the game harder and more realistic, but all it does is make it more ""automatic-move-and-attack-nearest-guy"", and less of a ""thinking man's game"".Final verdict: As a turn based game, the combat system is its heart and soul. Sadly combat is also the least polished, least complex and least enjoyable part of the game. As a result the whole game falls flat on its face because of the shortcomings of the combat system.			"

												So far I've logged 100+ hrs on Dead State and feel that I've played and seen enough of the game to form a decent opinion of it. I'll be honest, I'm a little biased when it comes to cheesy zombie stuff and I love most turn based RPG games so Dead State was right up my alley and even with its flaws, I loved it. I do not regret purchasing this game and feel that it is worth its current price for the amount of time you will spend on it.WHAT I ENJOYED ABOUT DEAD STATE:Every location on the map is unique, the amount of detail and lootable containers is very well done, each location tells its own seperate little story. Some locations are tiny enough you only need to visit them once, others are so large you need two or three trips to loot it all out. Good old fashioned text! Even though the game is fully text based, it does not take away from the game as I found the story, personal stories and crisis events to be very well written and believable. The game has an interesting and large cast of characters and each of them has their own quirks, and personal issues good and bad, not everyone gets along with everyone, there is internal conflict based on the decions you make. Micro managing your group of survivors from the job board. Brilliant! You can assign jobs to your survivors based on their skill set. As you find survivors out in the world map you can recruit them, each having their own set of skills. Some are more suited for tasks than others and parts of the crafting system can open up once certain requirements are met. The high school setting really is an all too ideal setting, it basically has everything you would need to survive in a zombie apocalypse.COMBAT!:This was hit and miss for me, but overall it wasnt that much of a negative experience as I've played worse in turn based-RPGs *cough* Blackguards *cough*. Dont expect X-Com type combat, there is no cover or crouching, no overwatch or support fire, no destructable environments or elevated terrain.My biggest issue with the combat is that the A.I. can be a little annoying (extremely slow) if there is a large queue in the turn order.However I feel the combat system really suits the game setting. One of the cool things I liked about the combat is the decible meter and how certain weapons generate a lot more noise than others. This adds an element of strategy specific to the generic zombie theme where they are drawn to sound. Start making enough noise in a fire fight with some human bandits and the next thing you know, both sides have to deal with a mini horde of zombies.PROS:Turn based zombie-RPG.Character progression.Choices you make in game at certain points greatly effect you going forward.The game is all text based, but writing/story is very well done.Most of the level designs are very detailed.Nice varied assortment of weapons, most of which can be upgraded.Crafting items and upgrading your base.Based on your choices, the game has a bit of replayability value. CONS:The game tends to crash often and when least expected. Save often.90% of everyone male/female has the same nose in their portrait picture.The A.I. can be slow if there is a large queue in the turn order.Game launched with a laundry list of bugs and known issues.

												Among all the zombie game, this game has its own flavour by mixing turn-based stretegy and survival and RPG element. While not any of these elements are very deep, the game is still very enjoyable with these limited elements. In combat, you basically just move around your character to a better position such as the back of the zombie to take a strike, or use your tank to defend a bottleneck while your other teammates shoot the zeds from the back. In a gun fight, there is not much variety, just shooting and being shot at. There is no cover system. So basically it's the group with better armor and guns wins. But I am still surprised that after playing for 40-50 hours this is still very satisfying to me watching the zeds and the bad guys fell one by one and fill my backpacks with loots.There are some crisis events occationally. The player has to make a decision that can please certain people and ♥♥♥♥ off others. One decision may have immediate effect while others have delayed effect. It's a cool element but my complaint is the crisis event is not big enough to change my loot-fight-loot-fight loopcircle. It would be nice if the crisis can force me to go / avoid going to certain places or do certain things.The game needs some serious de-bugging and balancing. Some events do not fire off correctly or repeating forever. The loot is also too much and it makes me don't feel that I am struggling in an apocalypse world. The map does not have indication how much loot is left. I also can't loot both bodies that fell on the same tile. So I suggest if you can wait, buy this after a couple of mouths.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a game that I started following when it was announced on Kickstarter. This is a game that I had high hopes for. This is a game that had a lot of potential (and still does). This is a game that has let me down. I was finally able to play this game when it was released on Steam's Early Access and I was absolutely excited for it. ""Finally!"" I thought as I started the game and met the first characters of Dead State. In about two hours time I completed everything that Dead State: The First Seven Days had to offer. It wasn't much but I was happy with what there was and I understood that it was a game in it's alpha stage. Updates to the game were few and far between and there was little in the way of announcements on the community hub (though apparently there are more frequent updates on DoubleBear's forums). Fast forward to September, I notice the game was moved forward into it's beta stage, ""Finally!"" I once again thought as I booted up the game. There was certainly more to do this time, a lot more, but soon things went downhill for me. Many of the locations were simply not finished which surprised me considering how long this game has been in development and there are at least two areas that I could not leave once I entered such as the hospital that was not textured and had a grid that  had ""512x512"" on it. Some locations you can enter despite it's unfinished state but you'll see that there is nothing to loot and no one to kill. I'm not sure how many game days have passsed but I know I built many of the available upgrades to the shelter. However, my save is no longer playable as I cannot load the game without crashing. In previous saves I can't re-enter the shelter without crashing. I have no idea what is causing this problem, it definitely has something to do with the shelter, whether it's an upgrade or an ally. I am very much aware that Dead State is still in beta and that it's in early access. Once again, I am very much aware that Dead State is still in beta and that it's in early access but this feels more like an alpha. For a game that has been in development for so long there is not much to it and I'm pretty disappointed about that. I'm disappointed that after release date delay after relase date delay this is all we got. This is just my opinion however and everyone is entitled to their own opinions. I know there will be some who agree with me and many who will disagree and that's okay.September 21st: Started playing again to check out the new update. Gameplay stopped after 7 days that said ""Thanks for playing!"" as dialog with survivors went on over the screen. After the dialog I pressed ""Continue"" and was taken to the main menu. I'm not sure why that happened other then something happened where the game thinks it's the first seven days demo.November 3rd: I wanted to try the new update and see how things came along since I last played. I saved the game during the intro sequence right after I created my character. I loaded the game (or tried to) but was met with an error ""CGC::GetPC - could not find playable character."" I have no idea why this is occuring.			"

												I had some decently high hopes for this game. I am a Kickstarter backer and thought the concept looked great and was excited to see what they did with this game. Sadly, I have just been disapointed with the game so far. As gameplay goes, it is buggy (but as a unreleased game this is expected). It is a turn-based system. The basis for who goes where is a blackbox and unclear if/how you approach will let you have the first turn or last turn in a mob. This can create an extremely annoying start to a fight. It ruins the strategic element from time to time and has made me walk away from the game on more than one occasion. There are two types of enemies in the game 'looters' and 'zombies', however, the only real difference is that 'looters' have items. Other than that they follow the same mindlesss horde approach to a fight. This makes, what should be the palette cleanser of combat just more of the same. The game feels to ""be on rails"" and there is, as of now, zero replay value to be had. While there is an expected main story it doesn't feel like there is going to be much in the way of meaningful choice in the end. Then there is the fact that the game is not intutive and has 'hidden' controls like the quick save and quick load which can ruin your game if you accidently hit it outta the blue. Of course these are all explained in a guide book, but that guide is not actually a part of the game it is hidden on the Steam fourms. Which leads to my main issue. I just don't trust these devs to bring out a quality game anymore. There are so many little things that they have whiffed on so far that makes me think the game is going to be released halfcocked and a dud. The game is only out in demo form, but the demo is not functional to prepare you for the game and feels far more like a ""hey, see it totally IS a game like we said!"". The game is far behind schedule, not totally uncommon, but the updates are few, far between, and completly underwhelming. Very little progress is seeming to be made and it is concerning. Right now the price is high and there is nothing to show for it, the game is not in early access and is simply a demo verison. The long and short save your cash, Check back in a year to see if the game has actually released and see how the game does. Right now there are plenty of other strategy sqaud based games that are worth your time and money. Check out those.Update for release:Sadly this game released as I expected. I stayed away waiting for the release to see what the devs could do, and while I was exicted about the progress they stated the game is just plain unplayable with bugs. That is the biggest thing is that unless you are constantly saving your game you will never move forward. To be so far behind schedule and then to release a game that crashes all the time is just embarrasing. Overall my suggestion stays the same, save your cash for another game.			"

												I am obsessed with this game and I'm not entirely sure why.When looking for a game to play, I personally search for three very specific things. Firstly, I want to be presented with a set of options that potentially change the entire way the game is played. Secondly, I want to be able to control multiple characters, while still retaining a main character role, and lastly I want said characters to be in a survival-esque situation or dilemma. For me, this game ticks all the boxes.In a nutshell, Dead State feels like a more strategic form of The Walking Dead by Telltale Games, and also the TV series episodes, in that its your job to keep safe a bunch of survivors stuck in a zombie apocalypse. Unlike The Walking Dead, however, wherein you are almost certain that someone is going to die and you're going to be left with one, maybe two survivors, that same theory is never in concrete in Dead State. Someone could die at any minute, and it could be any of your survivors, including you. If you're sensible and strict, you can manage to avoid deaths entirely, but the potential is there, and that's what makes it all the more fun.Dead State also has a great variety of salvageable items, dropped from both zombies or other hostile survivors, or found from things that you yourself can imagine searching for if there was a real zombie apocalypse. Suggestions that your fellow survivors make are also logical ones too. For instance, in games such as Left 4 Dead and Contagion, the idea of going to places like a hospital or train station or coastline is all too familiar and accepted - Dead State eschews that principle. Being stuck in central Texas instantly eliminates the idea of sensibly heading to the coast to get away from big cities, like many other games would (I refer to both Left 4 Dead and its sequel as an example), but the survivors directly tell you why going to places like hospitals, clinics, supermarkets and the like is quite simply a waste of time.Each and every survivor to you is as dynamic and unique as they are important. What I mean by this is that the plethora of people you will come across truly are different in every way. From flight attendants to former cops, from veterinary students, the mentally and physically handicapped, and every other minority in between. As diverse as they all are, they all have a certain role to play at your shelter (which is a now heavily barricaded school by the time you've arrived). From nursing the sick to fixing the fridges, you get to choose who does what for how long and when. As of the time of writing, Dead State keeps things standard by allowing a venturing party of yourself and three other members of your shelter to head out into the great outdoors in search of supplies, but all the other survivors will be busy doing things that you've allocated them to do. To me, this feels like a real sense of teamwork and feels quite rewarding when something gets done right and progress is made. Team fights are a very basic turn-based system using action points that vary from character to character depending on their stats and other attributes (think Divinity: Original Sin as a prime example). Though at this stage in development, hacking down a zombie with a sledgehammer isn't too hard to do, the real threat thus far is other humans. Some have responded to this in the community hub with great negativity, but I find it makes only too much sense. After all, if there really were a zombie apocalypse, I'd fear humans more than the zombies. We know from games like The Walking Dead and Dead Island that the more dangerous threat is other humans. Let's face it: they panic, they have no idea who to trust and why, they move faster, and they still have the capacity to use a gun. Dead State makes all of these clear to you, for truly when you see another hostile survivor on the map and turn-based combat starts, you do need to think very carefully about what to do because even one angry gunman can turn your entire survival situation upside down.I won't say the game is without its faults, it certainly isn't. The game is still in beta though, so you certainly have to give leeway for that. The game is peppered with lots of tiny errors (which I'm sure can be rectified quite simply) and a great deal of content has yet to be added, but the development team are quick to respond to issues and are very good with their communication to their community, which is always an added bonus. In-game content doesn't avoid controversy either, they don't shy away from real-world issues that would occur during a cataclysm like the plot, such as racism, murder, betrayal, religion, same-sex relations, disability and others, which, while risky is also quite a breath of fresh air.Ultimately, if you're looking for a game that gives you the flexibility to be in charge, while retaining a challenging experience to keep not just yourself, but others with you alive, with great versatility and variation, Dead State should definitely be added to your library. Dead State is a unique game among its genre, but one that works in a really good way. If you have reservations about Dead State and questions regarding its current gameplay that you don't feel have been adequately answered by anything you've seen or read, I'd be happy to answer them for a game I feel so positive about.For those that teal deered: 9/10.- - - - - UPDATE: v. 1.0.0 (4th Dec 2014) - - - - -This will be a lot more brief than the content above mentioned at the end of October, but as Dead State is now fully released and out of beta, it seems only fair that you know what's changed in the last month and a bit. Truly? Quite a bit. I'll list the greatest first.For starters, all of the unfinished crap that you could find when travelling around on the map (i.e., accidentally finding a completely empty location with just the shell of a building) are completely finished. This might sound like a quite obvious one, but there were a lot of these locations, so it's pleasantly surprising to see that they are all complete and weren't just scrapped and removed. Often, you could be travelling in a party of four and all of a sudden, three more of your survivors who you left at base would pop up out of nowhere and also be there. Though it wasn't necessarily a bad thing to have 7 of your people running around with you (especially in combat, it was quite nice to exploit), it wasn't how the game was meant to be played, and honestly, having more survivors with you will only cause problems.One of the three main commodities in Dead State, fuel (the other two being parts and food), can be very hard to come by. That being said, there was no way for you to turn off your shelter's generator if you didn't particularly need it burning your fuel. In the Dead State community, this caused a bit of an uproar as it simply drained people's fuel that they wanted to use for other projects. That being said, Double Bear clearly noticed that this was an issue, listened to its players, and now the ability to turn it off is functional. The artwork of all characters have been updated too, and their portraits are now much larger. Not a huge issue, but it does make it look much better, and aesthetics do count to a lot of gamers. That being said, it ties in with the fact that a lot of characters received updates to their personal perks (a lot like talents in World of Warcraft or Divinity: Original Sin, for ease of explanation). Back in October I mentioned that there was nothing stopping you from equipping yourself with the best shotgun and the strongest hammer in the game and just smashing your way through - so they've added skill requirements to all weapons to prevent this! Though it may not seem like a lot, it does prevent you from giving your wispy little doctor a giant railroad hammer.Unfortunately, I ran out of space but thank you for reading!			"

												Dead state is a convoluted little game. Overall, it is obviously competentenly made, but it is also obvious that over the course of development mistakes were made and nobody quite bothered rectifying them. The problem with this is that all the glaring little errors that managed to escape scrutiny appear late in game, precisely by the time it has you by the balls, you are having the time of your life, and naturally you are expecting the situation to escalate, but it doesn't. Instead, it just folds up like a house of cards. All of this looks like a result of a terrible lack of oversight, and in too many areas. Well, since I'm no professional gaming journalist, let's just make an obtuse little list.So here we go, in no particurlar order:Balancing issues - there are precisely three tiers of armor in the whole game. One is, to put it mildly, ♥♥♥♥ and has all the usefulness of a wet tissue paper. The other excludes zombies from the list of viable threats completely. Finally, the third one is a ballistic vest and and any other armor with a better defence rating. You put those kevlar sunday suits on, you never have to worry about anything ever again, nothing can seriously harm you anymore, which instantly turns the game into a glorified mall looting simulator. Everything else can be worked with, but if you're making a combat-heavy game and then take any thrill out of it, you aren't exactly gunning for a favorable impression. And you can get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ vests fairly early in-game, too. I've got my first three around day 18 or so, and that's not that far into the game at all, and I didn't stumble upon them either - an NPC directed me there.Speaking of the loot, Dead State is a damn good looting simulator. There are all sorts of neat little locations you can shamelessly rob, tons of people you can liberate from their stuff, and in general it is very satisfying to haul bags of freshly stolen military rations back to your hideout. Or at least it would be, if you didn't have to wrestle with the inventory every time you have to do that. If you are trying to haul a serious load, you will have to click a gajillion times though at least three menus. And you will end up having to do just that, because, as you progress through the game, your character roster will expand and expand and expand, even if you suffer losses, there will be ample replacements, and all those buggers will want to eat, if nothing else. Hovever, the interface problems don't really end there. For example, you can't really view character stats and inventory on the same screen, so often you have to backtrack between two different tabs to see what exacly you should be arming mr. New Guy with so he wouldn't blow his ♥♥♥ up or. All of this would be acceptable if you were dealing with a game lke  W2, where new party members are few and far between, but nope, no dice, there is a huge roster of potentially available characters and you will have to rotate them from time to time. There are also a lot of smaller questionable design decisions, and them being lacking is often apparent in the late game - for example, the way zombies cannot pose any threat to you no matter the numbers. You are never risking getting bum-rushed, mobbed, dragged to ground and eaten, when facing a big group - not any more than during a one-one fight, which kinda goes against the conventions of zombie genre, because them shamblers are supposed to have strength in numbers. But no, as far as the game is concerned, there is very little practical difference between a fighting a mob of zeds and fighting them mano a mano.Speaking of which, balance issue notwithstanding, the combat system leaves a lot to be desired. It would be acceptable in a 20-hours game, but, once again, the deeper you get, the more obvious its lack of depth is and it's not going to get any better, because the few options it can offer are laid out in front of you from the beginning. Finally, the plot. Without getting too much into details, I was pretty disappointed to learn about the ending. While execution was par the course, there  was much more promise to it. See, there were all sorts of little breacrumbs with omnious hints here and there, but it turned out they've had zero relation to the plot itself. In addition, it appears that some content was straight out cut, and the threads were just left there hanging. There's also an issue with the bugs ranging from mildly annoying to game-breaking, but discussing those is pointless. Indie studios like Double Bear can hardly afford quality QA, and whatever the reason for game being the way it is right now, the bugs can at least be fixed. Bad design is forever.In general, Dead state is a game you can nitpick for a long time, but - credit where it's due - only because Dead State is a big game with a lot of effort put into it. There is a lot enviromental storytelling going on, the sound meter makes you think and use the situation to your advantage, since both living and the dead can react to you making a ruckus, there is a lot of characters with unique interactions, quest lines and personality qurks, the management aspect is interesting and adds another, much needed layer of complexity.Problem is, though, for each and every one of these points there is counterpoint. The areas get duller and duller the further you venture from your starting point, the noise gimmick becomes meaningless because there is little combat difficulty to speak of, so you can just shrug and go in guns blazing, the character interaction is shallow and only manages to grab your interest by juggling characters around and never focusing on any of them - and that's actually a good thing, as this is a cardboad cutout fest worthy of the worst Bioware games, management aspect looks interesting but never delivers, because you won't ever find yourself starved for resources or even operating at a loss, and so on and so forth.I guess it is worth its money, since I've got my 60 hours of entertainment out of it, but it's not worth the disappointment you will inevitably experience.And that does the game in.

												This is a very fun game.  It feels a little clunky at first until you get used to the gameplay and mechanics.You basically have to manage a growing number of survivors who have gathered at a high school.  You can upgrade and build new facilities, venture out to scavenge for supplies and food, even restore care or get horses.  You also have to make decisions over disputes between survivors and try and keep everyone happy (or kick them out if they just don't fit).  When you venture out, combat is turn based; you need to try and stay quiet if you want to avoid too much attention from zombies.  You can essentially ""herd"" zombies away from places you want to loot by making noise elsewhere.Overall it's a solid game imho.  Not sure where the negative reviews come from (maybe game has improved a lot since then) but if you like turn based combat/resource management/survival etc then give this a go "

												Cautious thumbs up - if this is already your genre and you can deal with a decent bit of tedium.The game starts out fairly strong, if typical as a 'few survivors in a base, help us scavenge; Oh, and by the by - you're in charge.'There's a lot to manage,  a lot of tough decisions to make and a decent bit of micromanagent to do, and the turn based aspect is solid.Sadly, the UI has you spend a lot more time clicking actions every day than necessary - and once you get your armor up to snuff, zombies cease being a threat ...But they don't cease being really really time consuming to fight, with their slow animations, low roar and *all of them taking a completely unskippable turn.*If having to spend a dull 30 minutes / scavenging encounter in the late game doesn't scare you off, the game's worth picking up for it's writing, character development and select tense encounters.That said, If you have no patience for tedium or persisting through micromanaging a poorly optimised user interface, you might want to give this one a miss.Still, there's a demo if you're on the fence.

												Really disappointed in this game.  Been waiting for improvements for over a year.  Seems like the developers have abandoned it.  Game could have had a lot of potential, but there are too many problems with it.  Combat is extremely slow and difficult.  Use of guns is pointless due to the noise drawing more enemies to battle when they're less effective than melee weapons.  No real variance to the plot: loot, build, sleep, repeat.  Could have been so much more.  Feels like an early access game despite the fact that developers have said it's completed.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't know why people write the demo is short. I am nearly 2 hours into the game and I am only on day 1 out of 7 days. So far the game lived up to what I expected. The tactical combat is nothing new, but is as good as in similar games such as JA2 or XCom. So far the story is okay, but might get better later on (only day 1). I havent gotten to the point of fortifying the base yet or any other shelter management. I will update the review as I go further into the demo. So far I would certainly recommend the game as it seems to be nice once it is finished.Edit: After 5 hours and on day 3. The fights seem a bit too easy, but then again, it's just the beginning of the game and a few times I was close to losing someone, so I guess it's alright. The Map works similar to Jagged Alliance 2, although enemies and loot don't seem to respawn where you have already went, but I might be wrong on that. The Demo doesn't seem to go very far into the Story, so I cannot really say if the Story will be any good. Nearly all base building and jobs to give to your mates are not available in the demo, so I can't really judge that. Bugwise, I haven't encountered a single bug yet or I did but the bugs were that small, that I didn't even notice them. The graphic looks a bit outdated but I personally don't care about graphics in this type of game.I would recommend it to anyone who is into that kind of games (tactical round-based, zombies) and wants to play the demo and get a small discount before the game is finished, hopefully this summer from what I've read.

												After ~30 hours of fun with this game, I really must say that I recommend it. It's not flawless; the turnbased combat system is sometimes annoying, there are a few bugs and the replay value is low due to event progression, and it is expensive. But it's also fun.Overall, I really like this game and hope for some sort of expansion/sequel. More choises on where to build your shelter and more interactions with and between the other survivors would be great.Edit: Oops, seem to have missed a part of the manual. Well, another plus for the game would then be that the devs are responsive and helpful :)			"

												This has the potential to be an amazing game. Seriously, it has all the elements you could hope for in a zombie survival type game. base building, loot, skill trees, crafting, quests, and much more. I love every minute I play this game, well almost. The thing that prevents me from recommending this game in its present form is that it is rife with bugs. Not just little niggles, but game crashes, pathing problems, teleporting group members, logistic errors when throwing something like a molotov cocktail,  quests that wont complete, the list goes on. This game came out of Early Access way too soon. It's like the devs never beta tested it or, if they did, they need to sack their testers and get new ones because they failed in a big way. The cynic in me thinks that the game was released with full knowledge that it wasnt finished, in an effort to make money. It should have stayed in beta/early access for another month or so at least. Until the current bugs are fixed, I recommend that you keep an eye on the game and buy it when the bugs have been ironed out. If you cant wait, buy it but save often, although from what I hear there have been a few problems with game saves, although I have not experienced this particular problem myself. Should you bite the bullet and buy it now, be prepared for frustration, but at the same time, be ready for a deep and thrilling ride through the zombie apocalypse. This review should be longer, and I fully intend on adding to it in the future, but time contsraints mean I have to keep this short  I came here to write this review after another game crash that closed the game, but, like any addict, I am going to go right back in and carry on for a little longer before I go back to work :)			"

												I was waiting so long for this game to get out of Early Access and now it turns out that I paid £23 for unfinished, unpolished product full of bugs and annoying features.The game has a lot of potential and is enjoyable (unless it crashes), but this is far too low quality for that price.Also, there is no any long-term goal. Sometimes a character will ask you for some item or suggest visiting a specific location, but for most of the time you are left with nothing to do. After 40 in-game days when you have storage full of food, parts, fuel, antibiotics, when you have all shelter upgrades constructed and when all your characters are equipped with the best available items the game gets really boring and repetitive. Moving in combat mode is completely broken, costs shown are often incorrect, characters chose longer paths, are unable to avoid obstacles etc. Game freezes and crashes. Inventory management is a real nightmare. Multiple bugs, no way to easily move chosen items, items often do not stack, tabs in the storage are useless - you will have hundreds of (non-stacked) items in first two and about 20 items in the other 4. There is no way to easily find weapon/armor or sort them by type/damage. When equipping characters you cannot see their stats, when looting there is no maximum carrying weight shown, you have to constantly keep changing between inventory and character information. When upgrading shelter or crafting items the remaining time shown and estimated finish time are often incorrect. Sometimes having fewer people to work on an upgrade allows to finish it faster. Sometimes your turn is ended after first attack even though you still have action points. If the same character acts twice in a row, their action points are not refilled. Running around the shelter and trying to find constantly moving characters is a real pain in the ♥♥♥. Same when giving them items to improve their mood - constant running between storage and survivor. No way to handle this from some overview panel. Micromanagement gets quite annoying with 30+ characters. In the morning 5 characters come to you asking for a day off and if agreed they are automatically moved from their current job to ""sick"". You have to remember where they were assigned to or check all possible jobs. You often give survivors promises but there is no track of it. You cannot see any conversation history or any hints. Very poor choice of items, workshop/laboratory are completely useless as there is nothing really worth crafting there. There is far, far more to this, but there is a limit of the review size so I couldn't list them all even if I wanted.A very few nice things: experience is not equal to the number of kills - main character gains skillpoints for fulfilling goals which are mostly how many items of particular type were scavenged, while other survivors gain 1 skill point per day the game loads/saves very quickly you can load a game during enemy's turn the loading time of maps is very short, usually a few seconds only you can swap positions with friendly character for 2 action points "

												At this point the title is pretty solid. The game appears more or less bug free at this point, in 111 hours I encountered only two bugs ( a unlootable medicine chest due to bad door placement, and a one time event where a baseball bat allowed ranged attack). Neither of these are breaking things, and very rare.  Dead state has a lot of content for not a lot of price, especially if you get it during a sale or as part of a bundle.   It's what I imagine state of decay would be like as a proper turned based RPG.			"

												Great game for a turn based rpg fan, Definitely a must buy despite the negatives.Negatives: 1) Many many many bugs. None gamebreaking so far, but it will disrupt storylines and characters. Example: You discover a possible X, you investigate the areas, collect the items, yet nothing happens. You check the forums, only to discover this X quest is not implemented. This happens several times over the game.2) Horrific UI, item management, and character management. IE: If another corpse dies on top of another corpse, you can't loot them. Another example: You can't loot all items in a map quickly, you need to click on dozens(sometimes hundreds) of items manually per map to loot them.			"

												One of those frustrating games where ambition has outstripped ability to execute. The concept is great - managing a shelter of survivors of a zombie apocalypse - and there's a stack of looting, crafting and even diplomacy to do. It's often well-written, and throws up interesting choices.Unfortunately it's all held back by the combat system. It's slow, it doesn't feel like there are many options (no overwatch/defensive stance), the bottlenecks caused by the narrow grid system are more irritating than strategic and the AI is really frustrating - just had a prime example where a human enemy had two zombies gnawing away at him, but kept shooting at my unconscious character until she died. Maps filled with zombies should be thrilling, but instead become tedious - even when 95% aren't involved in the current combat, the game torturously goes through every one each combat turn. That's 20+ seconds *each turn* of the game flicking through portraits with nothing happening.It also has some dubious design decisions, such as requiring that your character be on every scavenging mission. Even if you have 20+ people at the shelter, and your character is best suited to leading behind the scenes, you must go out. Not only does this discourage focusing on the leadership/negotiation skills, it means you're at a constant disadvantage as you have to either sacrifice a day of scavenging to rest or constantly have a character with half their HP.Speaking of negotiation, it offers a lot of promise but is too reliant on hidden triggers. One example was when I had a heart-to-heart with a survivor and finished by asking him to ask how I was the next time we saw each other. I ran up to him with anticipation the next day...and only had the option of repeating that very same conversation. It made the whole thing feel empty and pointless. Likewise, a tense conversation with a militia leader over one of my survivors was interesting - but it fell flat when the exact same exchange was repeated the next time I visited.Perhaps the biggest problem is the lack of a mid-game. Food and morale were never a problem for me after the first few days, which takes a lot of the tension out of the game. It just becomes a loop of exploration and looting, with the occasional interesting crisis or encounter. Not all that bad, just far from what it could have been.That really sums up the game - it's decent enough, but could have been so much more. I still recommend buying it if you can get it cheap. It is still more enjoyable than many games, with a lot of content, and it's worth a shot to experience the positives; it's just depressing to imagine what it might have been.			"

												I got this game in a bundle sale, for what, 3 dollars? 5 dollars? I've forgotten by now. I am not recommending this game, at 20 dollars or on sale. Maybe at 5 dollars it would be worth it... But the combat system is absolutely broken.Combat works in this game turn based - portraits of characters/entities located on the map (which consists of pretty much a city block, 4 buildings or so). Your character moves/attacks, uses action points to use actions, perfectly fine. It works great.But the long as ♥♥♥♥ loading times/switching times as you end your characters turns is just horrid. Lets say you have your small squad of 4 survivors out to scout. You go to a supermarket location, where since it's a super market lots of zombies are around. Standard zombie worldbuilding element, all good.Until you kill, or try to kill, your first zombie on the map. If you succeed in killing them silently and in one turn, great! You can exit the combat mode and keep looting/exploring. Fail though, and the zombie will shamble towards you. Which would be fine, if the combat system didn't go through every single ♥♥♥♥ing zombie on the map, even if they're on the far edges. So you spend minutes per turn, not because you have to plan out your best moves or most efficient use of Action Points, but just waiting for when it's your turn again.Story is ok, I have no problems with it. Could be better, but it's perfectly fine for a game. Graphics aren't the best, but eh. It works, and I don't need superb stuff. Portraits of characters (when you talk to them) are all fine, detailed enough.Gameplay is just horribly broken though. I quit playing because 5 minutes per turn is dumb. And if you use guns/loud noise weapons, you will drag zombies in from the edges of the map. So you can get ♥♥♥♥ed in this cycle of ""shoot zombie"" ""zombie dead"" ""more zombie from edge of map comes along and sees you"" ""battle mode triggers, zombie gets first turn and bites you"".It's enjoyable enough. I liked playing it. Until I went on three different locations with a ♥♥♥♥♥on of zombies. Then I just quit.  One zombie dead, two zombies dead, three zombies dead. Oh, end turn... five minutes later kill another zombie, and repeat.Yeah. It needs a fast-forward option during combat. Except I got some issues with fps/client freezing (temporarily though) with the 20+ zombies at location. So I'd end my turn, then client freeze for a few seconds, then I wait for zombies to move around.  2/10 because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat system.Everything else is 6-7/10, not great but not bad either. Did I mention how much I hate(d) the combat system?			"

												**Edited my review.  See the bottom of it for my update.Going to start by saying that I love this game.I followed this game for a while, and saw so many complaints about bugs and the like in the other reviews for it.  At 40 hours in, I've only had 2 crashes, and one bug where I got stuck on an object which necessitated reloading my last save.  Not bad, I say.The price was a little high for this old school, low graphic kind of game, but I don't regret buying it at all.  I figure 2 hours of my pay went to this, and I've got 20 times that in entertainment so far, so it's a damned good deal.While not overwhelmingly dark, this game has ts moments.  The story, and the horrors you see in your explorations, are what you would expect.  The humans are the real enemy, not the zombies.  Killers, looters, ♥♥♥♥ gangs, etc. are a constant reminder that humanity truly has fallen.I highly recommend Dead State.  Don't let the previous reviews with all of the negativity about bug issues put you off.  You'll kick yourself for waiting.**  Alright, so yeah, I've discovered some more bugs that, while annoying, haven't ruined the game.  First, there are some goals on the To-Do List that I've accomplished, but aren't being checked off.  I've been asked to go to specific locations, have done everything there is to do there, but they've not been checked off.  Second, one of the Steam Achievements seems to be fouled up.  Give 25 luxury items to survivors.  I've given out about double that, if not more, and it stopped counting long ago.  Third, on one of the maps, I can only take a party of 3, rather than 4, if I want to pass a certain part.  It's a shopping mall, with offices above, and in one of the staircases, only 3 people can fit.  That's a bit of a pain, as there are some tough mofos up there.A pain in the ♥♥♥, surely, but I still recommend the game.  Hopefully these issues get fixed soon.			"

												It's nice to see a developer ballzy enough to take the survival genre out of it's comfort zone (FPS) and introduce it to the genre I think fits it best (RPG). Dead State is a game that is, in my opinion, a most own for all RPG enthusiasts. It takes place in a apocalyptic zombie world and features a turn-based combat system and other neat gameplay elements. The music and sounds fit the scenery well and add to the already creep/scary atmosphere. Very fun to play.

												I honestly don't understand why so many people have given this game a thumbs down. This is perhaps the best zombie survival game I have ever played because it is just that; a zombie 'survival' game. It isn't an action game and it certainly isn't easy. You constantly have to seek resources, deal with human flaws and make hard moral decisions. The amount of items, weapons, locations and game play hours is really quite staggering. This is obviously a zombie survival game that has been developed by people who know and love the genre, which is what I have been waiting for for years.			"

												I loved this despite its flaws. No bells and whistles and felt like an old 8 bit adventure where the atmosphere came from the writing plus you had to use your imagination instead of relying bombastic gfx. The writing and dialogue is where this stands out. All of the characters are individuals and prompt a range of emotions. Some are hilarious and some down right infuriating.The turn based combat is simple but varied enough to work out elaborate attacks especially when you start to obtain decent weapons and armor.The managment and building side to the game are great and really add to the involvement.I've read a lot about its bugs but all I encountered were some side missions not ticked off the board. All in all its simply a great adventure which, for me, smacked of the right kind of nostalgia. It reminds me of what made GTA Vice City so great. No single aspect stood out, except the writing in the this case, but everything came together to make a thoroghly enjoyable and remorable experience. 10/10 for me.Oh, and the endings. Well I loved both of them. This is the most memorable game I've played in a long long time.			"

												In the spirit of Xcom.  This turn based RPG is a bit rough around the edges and is entertaining at the same time.  In my short playtime so far it has crashed several times.  The UI/Controls are a bit wonky with the iso view being just slightly not flexible enough to get a good view.  The upgradeable base and morale and stocking the supply larder with basics + luxury items is brilliance.  Lots of fun there and the raids into town/pharmacy are fun and tense.  Despite some roughness this is a worthwhile purchase I think.  time will tell if it has the staying power but it does appear to have enough in it to keep a zombie fan busy for awhile.The weapon variety seems good (melee, guns and even a tazer)  Ammo is reasonably sparse making you treasure every shot and the action point based movements are a tried and true method to force good use of tactics.  Skills for the individuals matter and make a difference on how you will approach any specific situation and the sound mechanic is pretty cool. Using the firearms or bashing through a door is likely to draw attention .... is it worth it?  These sorts of tactical decisions make playing fun and engaging.Get it on sale if you can and it's even a better deal.			"

												This game scratches an itch that few others can even come close to. Many games claim that ""choices matter"" in it, but this game actually proves it. Staying out an additional hour scavenging for a few extra cans of food could mean the future of the shelter, but you run the risk of one of your crew getting infected the longer you stay out. You can save everyone you come across, but that just creates additional mouths to feed, meaning scavenging becomes even more important. Loved the characters, each one felt like a real person, even the cliched archetypal characters (nerd, goth, redneck). The subleader system makes it manageable to keep people happy, while still feeling like the people matter.			"

								Awesome storyline. Hours of fun to be had.  The UI can be a little wonky at times, but this one is worth playing!  Double Bear has done an exceptional job with subtle sub plots in all of the maps as well as the overall struggle to survive in the Zombie infested Texas.  You'll need to be savvy with politics as you navigate dealing with survivors at the school as well as fighting off forces outside.Well worth giving a try!			"

												Dead State is a very unigue, one-of-its-kind, single-player RPG set in a zombie-apocalypse environment. It has many interesting NPCs with different stories, strengths and weaknesses, that will keep players entertained throughout the game. Its turn-based combat system is old school, but challenging and even nail-biting at times. The foraging and base managing systems set a new standard for zombie-themed games, with hundreds of different items that can be consumed or used in many ways.  Overall, this is a MUST-PLAY game for all who are interested in zombie-themed games.			"

												After about 60 hours of playtime I think its about time I wrote my thoughts on this game.I like it a lot. Granted it was probably upgradet from early access one patch to soon. Certain aspects like NPC actions and morale has not been ironed out and there are still small bugs. That being said I still enjoy it and patches has been good and often coming.My experiences on the stream forum for this game with DoubleBear has been nice. My queries has been answered quickly and with decorum.That DoubleBear decided to push the next patch a couple of weeks because of the holidays is understandable (by me at least) and I look forward to the next patch.The obligatory pros and cons list.Pros:1. Basebuilding in an RPG, The basebuilding could be more elaborate but just the fact that its present is a major boon.2. Good story.3. Turnbased combat. (I consider this to be a great asset)4. Hard game. This will have you start over or reload a lot.Cons:1. No interaction with NPCs. The NPCs comunicate via writings on the screen and a menu. there are no way to comunicate with them or interact other than fight or leave. (NPCs are the living that does not come to stay at the base. Often hasn't got a name)2. Linear story. Your actions and choices in dalogue does count. Still some things are set to happen at certain days and they will do that.3. Annoying inventory. The fact that you at base has to go to the store to see allies inventory is bulky in itself. This has been adressed in previous patches and has improved but is still not good.4. This is just a minor annoyance for me but the fact that containers with visible loot aren't lootable. An example is in the base there is a gymnasium with containers with balls in them. Balls are a luxuary item but you cant get the ones in these because you cant interact. It goes the other way too so if you empty a shelf there is still item on it when you empty it. This is an immersion glitch for me and a minor annoyance.All in all as it is it is a 70/100 I will try to update as more patches emmerge.			"

												This game have a simple yet beautiful grafical design which might/might not suit everybody. The gameplay although is complex in the best meaning of the word. Every problem you face in you strive for survival can be solved in a lot of different ways and you are encourage to use your imagination to find your best solution in the given circumstance. The story is golden. I would like to thank the scriptwriter for the excellent designed plot and the way it's connected in the sandbox game setting, a very few game have done that correctly. The character portraits is also excellent with their personalities and relations. I haven't played a game this good, and by good I mean a game who knows what type of game it is, since Deus ex, Fallout 2 and Grim fandango. I'm happy to say that I have a new addition to my favorites!			"

												I have a very strong Love/Hate relationship with this game.  I love it because it is turn-based, concerns surviving the Zombie Apocolypse, and has RPG elements.  I hate it because it is just too <expletive deleted> addicting, which sometimes ensures my Monday mornings at work are impacted by my lack of an adequate amount of REM sleep.  Is it perfect?  No, but what game is?  And remember, this is just a game, a means of entertaining yourself.  Apparently, I have not spent enough time in-game to encounter all these bugs that are generating so much drama in the forums.  Regardless, if I find any bugs, I plan to communicate with the devs in hopes of fixing them, not go whining to the forum flamewars (grow up peeps).I strongly recommend Dead State to those of you who like turn-based RPGs in a Zombie Apocolypse setting that incorporates group behavior and relationship management in addition to combat and exploration.  It is a challenging game and I look forward to many more (>100) hours of play.  Thatz a great value in my opinion... "

												I backed this game on kickstarter and was incredibly excited about it.  Unfortunately, the gameplay is mediocre at best and contains a multitude of bugs.  It honestly feels like a game that is still in Beta (at best).  I was definitely expecting more and hope this ""release"" isn't the end product.The developer's delivered most of what they promised, but good, tactical gameplay?  To an extent, yes.  But it feels incredibly unpolished.  I'd expect this quality when playing a game from 15 years ago... but in this age, it is completely unacceptable.  It doesn't give me the feeling of playing a fallout game or anything that resembles having thought put into the game.DoubleBear should be ashamed of what they have created.  If you want to buy a well rounded, and polished game... pick up Wasteland 2.  That's a game worthy of praise and recognition.			"

												The game has solid writing but just about everything else about the game its underwhelming to mediocre to downright boring. It can be a trudge to get through the game and I found myself playing through long periods of boring and/or frustrating gameplay to get to short spurts of good writing. You see my playtime count? That is one playthrough, that is me being careful like you're supposed to and stretching out viable resources - what you're supposed to do. There are just far, far too many problems with the gameplay to list them. There's even major, recurring issues outside of combat and they too are too numerous to list. While the shelter functions almost perfectly you'll encounter glitches and bugs that make the game tiresome and even disrupt combat frequently. Aside from that bugginess there are a plethora of questionable gameplay decisions outside of it. Zombies are terrible enemies for an isometric RPG and don't work well as antagonists for numerous reasons. Tie in that the game is so glitchy with the turn order I can't tell if they're supposed to be fast zombies or slow zombies and the main antagonists of the first half of the game are just really frustrating to deal with. The game isn't well balanced for the second half of the game, which is further hurt by extreme bugginess. The writing is quite good but you only usually get exposed to it at the beginning of each day. While there is environmental storytelling in most areas, with even some events in progress, its not enough to fill the gaps.The gameplay is just too much of a chore for me to recommend the game for its writing, which while good isn't so good its worth trudging through the rest of the game for. The game would've been recommended if it had the gameplay of a title like State of Decay but since 90% of the game is average to downright tedious and boring I cannot recommend it, not even for a Steam sale. I got it on such a sale for $9 and while I don't regret my purchase I don't believe I could recommend it to others.			"

												-AFTER MARCH 13TH PATCH-I've never written a review before, but this game deserves one. The game has everything I would expect in a post-apoctolyptic world: starvation, a battle with morale, interactions with survivors, and of course fighting and killing zombies and looters. I believe the best aspect of this game is interacting and rescuing survivors. Each survivor has such an in-depth storyline which creates an emotional attachment with the gameplayer. You're forced to make such difficult, yet rewarding, decisions which impact the entire game's plotline. One controversial aspect of this game is the turn-based fighting. Now I may be in the minority with this opinion, but I think the turn-based fighting adds originality to the game. It makes the game memorable and stand out from all the other zombies game. Another part of the game which is a challenge is the balance of morale. Your survivors are scared, depressed, and alone in this zombified world, and they look to you, their leader, to keep their moods up. If you fail at keeping your survivors happy, they will leave your shelter, steal food and weapons, or even mutiny against you. This game is brilliant, and the latest patch made it even stronger. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME -- IT'S WORTH IT.			"

												I was really excited when this game came out of Early Access- I like me some turn-based combat, and I'm a big fan of zombie survival as a setting. Sadly it didn't really all come together, although it's not a complete flop- I think 4/10 is a fair score. The game is spoiled by a combination of weird design choices and horrible bugs.Design: The armour system makes no sense. No sense at all. If you wear the heaviest armour, you are literally invulnerable to all damage. You can wade into crowds of zombies, or even humans armed with assault rifles, with 0% possibility of death. Goodbye suspense. Also, boy o boy is the combat pretty boring if you're waiting for a dozen zombies to drag themselves over to you, and god forbid you start off with the wrong team-member in a crowded area- get ready to skip turns until it's the turn of the guy in front.Bugs: I let a few patches go in and decided to give the game another chance. I spent about an hour clearing out a block of houses and looting. The last zombie on the map got stuck in a closed doorway to the room I was in, leaving my team stuck in a bedroom for eternity. This kind of thing is not uncommon. Also, if you aren't able to design a multi-floored building without having players stuck in combat with enemies on different floors that they can't see, stick to bungalows. (I cleared the entirety of the hospital one zombie at a time without ever being able to leave combat)So yeah. Nice try, but pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed it up in the execution.			"

												Great game !!!!! This game is about the only thing I found to a zombie, survival, base builder/Manager sim out there.This game has the social tough choices similar to "" State of decay "" with a more important role in balancing upgrading your base with providing man power towards improving morale. *********Things You should know*********Combat in the game is turn based exploring and out of combat moving is not-The combat system in this game allows you to do many of the things you would do if lets say zombies were real. For example: You enter a block with a large Super Store, the path to the uber-lootable building is blocked by numerous zombies and obstacles that could hide even more zombies but luckily you had adopted an intelligent german shepard police dog. So you get the dog to lure the zombies in front of the building down an alley to the side of the building then returns once it lost the horde. now to enter the building, you decide to best leave your dog in front of the building to guard/alert you should the horde come back. The store is loaded with supplies that you so very much need. You round a corner and get pounced on by a zombie luckily your other compadrae was right behind you and sledge hammers the zombie in the back of the head before you became a torn open meat bag. Now you carry on with looting the building and come to an office door you open the door, axe in hand ready to fight a possible zombie only to find a looter aiming a gun right at you.He fires shooting right past your head. you duck back away from the room where the crazed gun man resides. Seconds later you hear pounding on an emergency exit where your pooch had lost the horde on the back alley of the building. They heard the gun shot. You and your partner high tale it out of there as the door busts in from the weight of the horde. The looter is now trapped in the room struggling to stay alive. You are half way out of the building as you hear moans and gunfire in your wake. You meet up with your loyal pup and flee the store now once again claimed by the dead. -That is the sort of game play I love about Dead State I give it  5 out of 5 "

												Dead State has fantastic potential! After putting more than 100hrs in, I felt I had genuinely beaten a zombie apocalypse!If you're heading into Dead State with a Dead Rising/Dead Island state of mind, don't. Dead State is a 'survival simulator'. It's more about 'what if' than 'wouldn't it be cool if...' and right from the get-go, it's all about doing what needs to be done to keep you and your team alive. It has a great RPG system to it, but you don't level-up by smashing skulls. Instead, you gain EXP by saving survivors, scavenging for supplies and making the best decisions for your team.With all these 'how will you die' survival horrors, it's actually refreshing to see a deep simulator where your objective is to make it! After playing the 1.0 build, I've noticed quite a few updates that have ironed-out bugs and added even more gamer ideas. Double Bear seem like a great developer and Dead State will only get better from their loyal support.Enjoy the apocalypse!   "

												I played it before release and have played about 15 hours after release. This game combines a lot of great elements that I love to see in games. I really wanted to recommend it, but no. At release this is more like a game that's ready to enter beta testing. The development team is still working hard on it, but it's nowhere near release ready. There are many known issues that have not been patched, some of which will cause crashes to desktop, like double-clicking at the wrong time.There are unfinished features and overall a lack of polish. The trading/inventory management is extremely awkward. Tutorial messages will popup at inappropriate times if you breeze through the tutorial too quickly. Pathfinding is still very bad in spots. The main character frequently paces back and forth when doing commmon tasks like going to sleep to cycle a new day. The tactical combat is very basic. There's no crouching behind an object for cover. Allies block movement. Characters and enemies occasionally stack in the same square which stops you from attacking/interacting with them properly. It's not terrible, but it's  nowhere near the level of X-Com or Shadowrun.I would recommend this game if the price tag was $15 instead of $30.			"

												This game is massive, took me almost 100 hours to finish, love zombie games and this one is in my top 5in this game you will manage a shelter with survivors, at first... just you and a few people, but as time passes and exploration of the game map unfolds, new people come to populate your modest safe spacemanagement of the shelter consist of what you choose to construct (area for relaxation, laboratory, etc), you need certain equipments to initiate the construction, you can find those by looting areas that you can discover in your map. later in the game, after certain structures are build, you have access to special and modification equipment (sniper rifles, nerve gas nades, specialized armor, etc)NPC that join your shelter all have their own personality (watch out for psychos and just plain losers) and you can choose to pick them to form your scavenger party or just leave them working on the shelter, all those people evolve as time passes, invest their own skill/stats points, sometimes they even come to you for counsel and gain new traitstheres load of drama on the shelter, sometimes crisis emerge and you need to step up and resolve it with others sub-leaders that people tend to follow inside your shelter, people can get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by your leadership and just plain leave (well...there can happen others bad things besides just ""leave"")obviously, you will clash with zombies, but there are others factions too, human ones, like gangs and other nasty surprises that i wont spoil hereoverall, this is an excellent game, one of the best i played last year (2016)			"

												TL;DR: Buggy and unfinished. Don't buy it. Wait for the 2015 summer sale, hoping it will be patched.I backed the kickstarter and I was pretty excited about the whole game, especially the concept.Turns out the only thing they managed to pull off is the concept, everything else falls painfully short.Extremely buggy in so many ways. Sometimes pathfinding won't let you enter a room. Other times combat wont end even with no enemies near. Enemies and allies sometimes teleport through walls, or sometimes stack ontop of eachother and become untargettable. Oftentimes animations freeze and your characters just hover around.Combat is generally very uninspiring. Not tactical, not exciting. It's a chore.Looting also is very unimaginative, quickly becomes boring.Inventories are a mess. Sorting doesnt work and managing alot of items is extremely frustrating.Companions clearly have some effort put into them, but lack any meaningful interaction.Balance is way off, both in combat and in managing the shelter.Still, despite all it's flaws it's not a lost cause.The world map is huge and exploration is exciting, also the shelter has a number of interesting mechanics.If you can look past the last-gen graphics and interface you can find the makings of a truly good game underneath.Sadly though, I can't recommend the game before it's extensively patched, or perhaps even modified by the community.edit: typos.

It is good that your characters level and you pick skills.The thing that stops me from playing the game is the combat.  It is  a pain to get the drop on zombies.

												If anyone's interested here's an opinion from a veteran Jagged Alliance & XCOM player. Dead State isn't linear but still it's is much a story & character driven game, so for one playthrough it can be a lot of fun. Maybe for two even, if you play the first game as a good & kind hero-type, and the second playthrough as an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ready to rule all of the new world. Or vice versa. I liked the story, the background and how the characters and dialogues are written, and there are many good ideas being used here. And while it's not a 4x game, the map is still pretty big and has some interesting places to visit, and random encounters. Would be awesome, if the locations would change, so when you start a new game, you wouldn't know exactly where to travel beforehand.Someone recommend Dead State as a Jagged Alliance -type of game... but can't really compare it with all the cool and awesomeness of the JA2. I mean RPG side here is fine with dialogues and decisions, but tactical side - not so much. The combat is fun at first, later not that enjoyable, and gets repeative after you learn some basic maneuvers how to deal with zombies. Although sometimes it's interesting if you're seemingly overpowered by numbers and one of yours is wounded or unconscious or runs away. Compared to XCOM though, the combat system and the enemy AI is pretty primitive - some good ideas are used here too, like several different modes for weapons. Still, it felt it never got really challenging. I was playing the famous XCOM Long War Mod at the time - so maybe because of this Dead State didn't give much tactical challenge. So, combat is good at it's best, but gets dull after a while. Also, real time mode and turn based mode, they just don't sync that well - it's not terrible but not good either. Like: Shooting attracts the zeds, so the more you shoot the more zombies you have to deal with. But after the firefight you go on real time mode, and the zeds start to just casually walking upon you. So you have to keep an eye and go to turn based to prevent them just walking right next to you and bite. I wish this would have been handled differently. I mean you can work with the system, it's not hopeless, but it's cumbersome and gamey.Still, I do hope there will be a Dead State 2, with some improvements in tactical game, as I would buy it. I can recommend this game too, while it's not great and lacks better combat, it's still interesting, compelling, exciting and fun at best, and in some ways original and enjoyably different to many main genre games, so for the price it's basically a deal.

												HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!The good: Excellent zombie sandbox game with among many other things, elements of RPG and Turn Based Combat. I bought this when it was early and very incomplete and had high hopes for it to become something special...which I am pleased to say in many ways it has. For a huge zombie fan like myself, this game is something i've always hoped for. If an editor ever gets released, this game will be a without question must have for anyone who enjoys the zombie genre. A lot of freedom to explore and even the freedom to run your survival shelter like a total prick. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at a couple of your lazy sub-ordinates? Take em out in the field and perhaps they will have an...unfortunate run in with the undead out there. Nice little storyline that doesn't really get in the way of exploring the overall game itself.The bad:  Unforgiving. Your first run in with hostile survivors will make it very evident that you just might be outmatched and outgunned. Missing a shotgun blast at point blank range...with your last 2 shells...yeah that just happened. Can become a bit repititious as well, as some locales appear to be just more of the same stuff you've already seen. Prepare to save and reload often. Keep in mind you can bring up console commands to give yourself a bit of an edge. This game will not hold your hand.Again I am a huge zombie fan and gamer from way back....and this game took me away from a very modded State of Decay for a nice bit of time...which says a lot. This one is worth a buy for sure if you love gaming and the living dead.			"

If you enjoy tactical turn based crpgs, with good story telling, relatable characters, and making many decisions that actually have real consequences to how the story turns out, then dead state is for you.

												Buy this if you like turn-based RPG, ex: Fallout series (before bethesda), Wasteland 2, X-Com EU/EW, and if you love zombies (who doesn't??)This game is NOT about killing zombies, it's about surviving the zombie apocalypse by recruiting NPC (or not) and dealing with their problems, upgrading your base so you can have nice things, and also scavenging for foods/parts/weapons/etc.Several bugs will annoy you but it's not game breakers. Overall a good game, 8/10.			"

												I really loved this game. It's a turn-action based game where you must lead a group of survivors using an old school as your new base. You can upgrade some parts (including the school itself), weapons, armor, etc. The survivors you pick up have small storyllines that you can follow. Gain favor with fellow survivors, and take an exploration party out. There are small things that would greatly improve this game, or make me buy a Dead State 2 if they ever came out with it. I would like it if you could send a party out without including yourself. I picked to up my science perk (which is great for disarming alarms, but that's the only benefit for an active party character), which would be far more useful at base making antibiotics or other stuff. Also, it would be nice to have more upgrades throughout the game. It maybe took me a couple weeks to upgrade the entire school then I had to wait a long while to beat the game. Also it can be buggy at times...sometimes these bugs are useful for combat but for example the zombies not near me taking forever to have a turn was annoying. Overall, still a good game. Takes a good amount of time to beat. Might wait for the sale, although I do with pretty much every game.			"

												Fantastic. Gritty post-apoc setting. Interesting companions though a little light on talking with them. Some minor annoying bugs but I waited a while until playing the more patched version which plays just fine. I think it could have used some small scipted events like clicking on a bathroom stall to get the ""loot"" and have a zombie jump at you or something to keep you on your toes. Overall good progression. Story is minor. Some interesting written things when looking at old ""data drives"". Nothing like bashing Zombies with a Cricket Bat. Great indie RPG in the Old School, Isometric, vein. Glad I backed it.Might have been cool to be able to drive or choose to zombiefy and soop up your veh with upgrades but ah well, can't have it all.			"

												It actually a good game to play! If you look past its low quality apperance and pretty bland characters, this game can be very tense and difficult at times.This is the sort of game I've wanted for a while actually; a zombie RPG, with its gameplay closely related to the older Fallout games. To make the game even better is that it is tense. Zombies are a piece of cake, but an armed mob of humans? The survivor politics is also another good feature of this game, as the choices you'll make can have dire consequences on your group and can lead to some pretty bad results if your leadership is bad. I recommend this game to anyone who either likes zombies (obviously), the old-school RPG games like the first two Fallouts and Torment Planescape and anyone who really likes survival horror and challenging games			"

												First off, I have to say I do love this game. I was an early Kickstarter backer, and I have got my money's worth from it.That said, I cannot recommend people buy this game. The interface is too flawed, and there are too many bugs - minor annoyances, CTDs, and game-breakers alike. Inventory and party management are so poorly laid out that even gearing up is a chore. Allied survivors just stand around in arbitary locations in the shelter. This makes even a fully-populated shelter feel like an empty building with mannequins. In short, the game has a lot of potential. But it still needs a lot of work.			"

												Even being a fan of turn-based games, Dead State only scrapes being a passable game to play if you have nothing else to do. There are a few good aspects, though the negative aspects overrule a lot of the enjoyment which could be had.Good Aspects:- The micromanagement of each person in your shelter and prioritising finite resources is satisfying- Unique survivor perks and characteristics which adds a bit extra decision making when deciding on a team- The leveling up system is odd, but appears to function fairly well, allowing you to scale well relative to the dangers of the outsideBad Aspects:- Combat - At the start combat seems ok, but the further in the slower, more tedious, and painfully boring it gets. During each turn of combat, the queue of characters will cycle through the entire list of characters on the map until it gets to a relevant character/zombie/etc participating in that combat. With the larger, more zombie-populated maps, I was sitting up to roughly 15-25 seconds per round simply waiting for the queue to cycle to the relevant zombie. Plus, when a zombie is in the combat area, but unable to reach a player, it will stand there for 5 seconds or so, letting out a bored groan, mimicking my own, made worse again when 4-5 zombie were bottlenecked. It may not seem like a lot, but if combat has as little as 4 or so rounds, I am essentially waiting triple or quadruple the length of time than is actually necessary to finish combat. And, the more you play and the harder areas you get to, the worse the issue.- Descriptions - You will need to use Google. A lot. Descriptions of the various skills, leveling system, and user interface are very poor, meaning you will either need to have a second monitor with a wiki page helping you understand the basics for the first several hours, or you will be re-loading previous saves after realising you screwed your character up.- Bugginess - While not the worst game bug-wise, there were many instances of characters occupying the same cell and making it difficult to issue certain commands, a few times I was attacked by 'invisible' zombies, which only appeared during the second round of combat, and there were a few crash to desktop moments, though I can forgive this.In short - big problems, which could be quite simply fixed, potentially raising the score from 4/10 to 7.5/10.

Early Access Review
								Dead State is threatening to be the first game to nail the all-important ""zombie apocalypse"" combination of scavenging for limited resources, managing personality conflicts, and trying to create/maintain a safe home base.  As it stands, there are only a half-dozen areas to visit, and not much to do in them aside from some very enjoyable grid-and-turn-based tactical combat ... and the stealth elements that allow you to avoid such combats in many cases.  Being sneaky is no false promise; by selecting the quietest possible weapon and walking around alone, there were only a small number of cases where I could not quietly take out an enemy while keeping its buddies unaware (that goes for zombies and humans alike, though you can debate the realism of a human not bothering to call for backup in such a situation).The base-building is bare-bones at the moment, but it looks like it is going to be a lot of fun once fully implemented--which is something I would say about the game as a whole--allowing for an intriguing cross between Fallout and XCom overall.Certainly, you can question the decision to only give players a demo if they pay for a pre-order in the form of ""early access.""  But the game is solid fun now, even if fairly small in scope.(Also I alt-tabbed out of the game and accidentally left it running for a weekend; no, I did not find some way to get 48 hours of play out of a short demo)			"

												Don't, just wait until it is patched. Don't go near that buy button just yet. This game is still half cooked. I've played enough of it to know that although it is a great game, in time, right now save your money. Come back and visit once in a while to check how it is going, but the game still suffers from a range of issues. The game still plays out like a static puzzle game where you will start repeating the same cycle of 'grinding' time and time again. There is nothing dynamic in the game world, your memorable moments will be far and few between. So many parts of this game are underdeveloped and simply tacked on, yet all of them could benefit from more development time and just some more tuning. The combat is simplistic, pre-2000 RPG games had better mechanics for combat, whilst the narrative and character progression is just so thin. Dead State will either become a great game a year from now or it'll be a developer-myth about great ideas with poor execution.			"

												It wasn't bad at the beginning, but as I kept trying it, it only got worse. It provided some fun time however. But here are the cons since they're all I can think of as of now.- It's a turn based zombie game. I never imagined that could be mixed with zombies...and it can't. It takes away the fear and suspense the zed genre is supposed to provide and drags out battles.- A looong game but the same thing every day, didn't take long however to get old fast. Go out and scavenge, sleep, repeat.- Little to no control over your supplies in way of rationing, supplying arms, or giving meds.- There are hundreds of cars! Wanna drive one? Build your own!- Bullets hardly affect zeds, that's unheard of. It's blunt weapons or nothing.- Battles are either boring or irritating. It's either the easiest fight, or your flanked by 6 zombies that in one move knockout a guy then kill him the next round.			"

												It's just not fun.  Plays like something from 15 years ago.The Last Stand - Union City has more base building depth, is more fun, and it's free.Dead State forces you out on EVERY mission - no sending teams out to do something unless you're a part of them.  This diminishes the feeling of being a leader and makes the gameplay quickly repetative, which might not be so bad except that the combat is so boring.Zombies and looters will single you out EVERY time.  This makes it hard to keep your health up and makes it unenjoyable to be forced to go on the missions.The base management is unenjoyable and essentially plays like a worse version of free web games.  Everything feels flat and uninspired.I can't overstate how slowly this game moves.  There aren't any parts of it that I find fun.  It would be more exciting to just read a good zombie novel.			"

												I followed this game with great anticipation for a good chunk of time. After I had read about it in a Gaming magazine back in mid 2010 I was thrilled to hear about a Zombie game with base management elements. I have not been disappointed.The gameplay is absolutly for the more hardcore zombie fans as it's clunky animations and turn-based combat system allows for some criticism. However it's good. It is worth 20€ for what it is.The graphics are not to be amazed over but the quality of the smoothness when it runs is worth some degree. I have seen games with worse graphics that ran like a stick in the mud.That said I love the attention to detail. If you are low on food and get a really good haul of it you will see in your pantry the massive amounts of food displayed. There will be close to nothing if you have close to no food. However have your stocks full and the pantry looks like a fully stocked super-market.DoubleBear productions are worthy of some praise as the game kept me going. I have replayed the early-mid part of the game several times and I'm pleased. The options to craft your own backstory in the beginning is somewhat good but the dialouge options could feel heavy at times.The cutscenes are nothing new or impressive as they just teleprot characters to an area to have them setup for dialouge. However the written story gives each and every NPC character. I was sure some NPC would be a minor leader but was not and some reactions of other NPCs were great. I personally loved tormenting the poor priest when he crossed my decision at one point by forcing him to do something he did not want to. That is great for immersion and for roleplaying.However the sound is very simple but it works for the setting, it won't go down like a piece of art. However it works none the less.The only true complaint I have is the RNG as it can sometimes ♥♥♥♥ you over and the AI system. So first things first. The construction and resource system. I do not like that certain upgrades feel so ""limited"" such as the garden part. I can easily imagine more outdoor areas get turned into growing areas. So there could be an update for that. The resources gained can vary very heavily sometimes and that can lead to weird situations when the need to upgrade is high. I have had the unlucky time of never being able to get the highest upgrade for the wall in one of my many playthroughs. The RNG does however what an RNG should.The AI system can be very frustrating at times. I can setup a trap for raiders to stumble into a herd of zombies only to ahve the dead attack me instead. Same goes for raiders being so extremly dumb as they make continoues fire of thier firearms to attract over 100 zombies to the map. That ♥♥♥♥ is dangerous. They should know that and they should use firearms as a last resort. But the system does not allow it.Overall, I love this game. It's one of the few good games that truly explores what an zombie apocalypse would be about. Yes there are zombies. But people are the biggest danger.			"

												Overall, I love this game. It delivers on the promise of managing a shelter, fighting for survival, tactical combat with very different approaches to the dead and the living. Given that it was made by a tiny, indie team on a small budget, this ambitious game delivers.I did wait for the Reanimated update to start playing, and I think a number of earlier complaints have been fixed.What I like:I like the dual game of managing the shelter and then going out and exploring the world and engaging in tactical combat, almost like a role playing Total War game.Set in the modern world!! A nice break from high fantasy for the genre.Good opportunities to role play, with fairly interesting characters.Combat is fun and tactical. Approach to fighting zombies and humans is very different. And the noise meter is a good system that adds a nice cost and trade-off decision to firing each round of a gun.Maps are quite well designed. They capture the feeling on Walking Dead and other zombie shows - the world is your oyster, go around, scavenge, pilfer, but be ware. Around every turn a zombie or 10 could be hanging out, or you bust into a supermarket only to find half a dozen aggressive looters already there and they don't want to share.The feeling of resource scarcity is real - you are generally always low on something, whether it is fuel, antibiotics, bullets, etc. They did a pretty good job of making enough systems where you feel a constant urge to go out and risk life and limb to find more of something.Good writing and humor - item descriptions are fun, and some maps visually tell a story without any dialogue. There is a faux-twinkie factory, and an ominous church filled with dead inside. I am sure there are more like it!Cons:Though much more stable than previous versions I guess, I still get a few crashes and bugsCharacters feel a bit shallow. There are a good amount of them and probably more I haven't found, but I do wish they had more depth and other branches of dialogue, and more interaction across them.Interface is very clunky - especially the inventory. Splitting items is a pain. Trading items between team members requires a special move, instead of being just built into the inventory. Reloading and unloading guns is done oddly and you can only do it in certain screens or menus.			"

												The devs say this is a finished game with the most bugs fixed... but there are tons of bugs and problems left.An example of one of the major bugs is that ai controlled mobs can walk through and even attack through walls and environment,So unless you can get this game for less then a few bucks like I did... don't bother with this one.

												Fair warning:Yes, it is buggy (you can screw up some quests / side stories).Yes, it has major flaws (I love the concept of the round based fighting system, but it simply sucks! Fighting zombies gets really tedious. Especially that you have to wait up to 20-30 seconds(!) every round on some maps with a lot of zombies, because the game has to go through every single zombie on the map - not only the ones you are actually fighting against).Yes, it simply feels rough and unfinished sometimes.BUT:I love it and in my opinion it's still the best zombie survival game out there.The story, world and atmosphere are great.It makes fun to explore all the different locations.There are a lot of interesting and fun characters to recruit (and fight).Building up your shelter, dealing with crises and keeping all survivors happy to keep your leader position... it's everything I ever wanted in a zombie survival game.Please, make an improved Dead State 2, I'll be paying three times the price of this game :-)			"

												Dead State is a game of good intentions marred by unpolished content and occasionally flawed execution.  When it works, it's a delightful experience reminiscent of the original Fallout and other such games with an interesting world and endearing characters.  Collecting loot from locations, rescuing survivors and interacting with them, upgrading your shelter, and equipping your characters all prove to be engaging stuff.  The first 30 days are great fun as you struggle to explore a strange and hostile landscape.That said, the game ends up with several critical flaws. It's unfortunately buggy and will crash on you quite frequently, the UI is occasionally frustrating to sort through for important information, and the combat is underwhelming due to mechanics that become imbalanced in the mid to late-game. The game just steadily begins to run out of steam after the first month as it gradually runs out of ways to challenge the player.  You'll mostly be sitting around as you wait for the game's endings, which themselves don't do much to really resolve the player's emotional connection to the characters and story.Dead State is a game I cautious recommend.  It tries to be the Zombie RPG we all wanted 10 years ago and succeeds fpr the most part, but in doing so it feels exactly like an unfinished Iso-RPG from 10 years ago.  Dead State isn't perfect, but I guess it manages to be ""good enough"".			"

												With every update, the game became worse. I tolerated it until my mouse wouldn't work. If you google their forums or post your own, the modderators and support people simply tell you it isn't their problem! Isn't their problem? My mouse works on every other game except, you guessed, Dead State. This game is worse than having no support, the dev team is actively insulting to those who have asked legitimate questions. If you don't like so many people complaining about glitches, then don't release a glitchy game.UNPLAYABLE with out my mouse, but they offer no solutions. My mouse works with other games, so I'll play and recommend other games.			"

Early Access Review
								Im giving this  a positive review for now with one huge proviso.. Make sure you know what your buying as this is a strange way of utilising EA. Your pre ordering the main game at a discount and getting access to a demo of some of the games features. The game itself looks to have a hell of a lot of promise and if they can achieve all they have planned should be a detailed and atmospheric turn based survival challenge.. Thees a lot of features missing from the demo but the promise is as the closed beta evolves some of those working features and updates will be passed down to the demo for people to try BUt you will only ever have the first seven days. The devs seem to be looking optimistically at a 6mth time plan to a release version of the full game which spans several months. From the demo you can see it looks good for an indie product  - good shader use and artwork in general ... Make the forums your first point of call though and read the manual (they should upload it to steam).. Heres hoping it can have the depth and detail of story that age of decadance has			"

												Updated for Reanimated Version:It took me several attempts to get into this game, but am now hooked. I'm at about day 15 and am happy to report that the writing gets better and all of the features I was looking forward to start to open up quite a bit (shelter upgrades, new survivors, interesting but tough choices, and personality management). I am a point and click guy, but will admit, there are times the combat can get pretty tedious. There are some layers of strategy that can be satisfying (ie; using the noise meter and zombie hordes to your advantage to take out looters) BUT you really need to take time in between battles to manage your inventory before heading out on another run. They do, however, alleviate some of the micromanagement by automatically stocking shelter items each time you return.Your survivors will randomly need to take some time off due to sickness or other reasons, so you will have shuffle your scavenger party every once and a while (this is a good thing). Your survivors also level up, but at a slower pace than your main character.  And while you can't allocate the points manually, you can occassionally suggest areas you would like your other survivors to improve when they do decide to level up (which is fine, I guess. It goes along with the concept that you can't control everybody at your shelter. You have to mange personalities through dialogue choices and finding items in missions).For me, the UI wasn't as intuitive as I was expecting when it comes to information and inventory management...but that's a tiny gripe.Aside from those gripes and small pathing issues, if you give it a little time, the game does get interesting. It's certainly worth 20 bucks and has more depth than I thought it would. The demo will give you a good idea of gameplay mechanics, but as I mentioned, it really picks up from about day 8-12.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've been following this prject before kickstarter many years ago and am an early backer. While the development has been slower than I had initially hoped (due to some global issues affecting some of their remote team members), there is enough here to get the gist of the type of game they are trying to make. And it definitely has some really great potential (exactly what you want to see in an Alpha). While the updates have been slow moving, when they do implement an update, you see a pretty significant impact. It's somewhat playable as is, but still needs a lot of work. You are paying to help test and give feedback. They have only released the first seven days and there is much to do. And while we all want more, they are still implementing story, maps, features, etc. . If they released anything beyond seven days, it would spoil the story and other surprises they have in store for us when the full game is released.Back this now while it's on the cheap. This game has too much potential for gamers to let it slip into obscurity.			"

												Dead State is what I expect from an apocalyptic RPG.  It left me with good memories of “Oh Crap, what did I just do” and “Wow, that worked out well.”The combat is fun.  Managing the shelter is fun.  Handing out luxury items to boost characters morale is not so fun.Toward the end it gets boring waiting for the endings to start, but if you have a well stocked shelter you can just end the days and get through it quickly.The bugs are annoying, but they do not break the game other than the the occasional crash to desktop (remember to quick save!).

												I've played a lot of turn based combat games in my time, some that you just can't stop playing, games that you can spend weeks playing and still have tons of fun. This is not one of those games. Zombies make constant, obnoxious noises every single turn, and they are so irritating that I've felt the need to turn off my sound on more than one occasion. The firearms in this game are far too underpowered to be of any use against anybody, living or dead. One of the worst parts of this game is the hit chance for a gun. I got a 0% hit chance with a lever action rifle from three spaces away, which is stupid. I'd also like to note that the hit chance system is complete bull, since even when you get a ""90% hit chance"" it's insanely likely that you will miss. The places you can go in this game normally have looters, which can range from one person with a knife, to twenty men with full armor and guns, yet there's no way to know how many looters are in a certain place without engaging them in combat, which, on many occasions, has killed me and my team in the first few turns. All these issues combined makes the game nearly unplayable.By the time you realize how bad the game is, it's already too late to get a refund, so be warned, if you buy this game, prepare for severe disapointment and regret in not buying a better game.

												Dead State is a RPG about surviving the zombie apocalypse in Texas. In terms of setting, the game nails it.  Since society has broken down you’ll have to turn your group into a bunch of scavengers in order to survive. This is a dangerous endeavor in Texas where firearms are plentiful, and some homeowners aren’t going to let you raid their pantries or medicine cabinets without a fight.As leader of a rag tag group of survivors you are going to be in charge of determining who to take in, how rations are divvied up, what improvements to build at base with your meager resources, and how you will relate to outside groups like motorcycle gangs, militias, and remnants of the US Army. Sub leaders will emerge within your group whose council you will need to take into account. They may try to pull off a coup against you. Maybe you can accommodate them or maybe you can put a bullet in their head during a mission and blame bandits.While I thoroughly enjoyed the setting, character interaction, and government game aspects of Dead State there were a few issues that might be major turn offs for some players. First off, it pretty much plays exactly like the old turn based CRPGs of the late 1990s. Think Fallout 2 with zombies. It also looks a little like Fallout 2 (as viewed through nostalgia goggles – obviously it is more attractive than Fallout 2 if you’ve played Fallout 2 recently).  I personally don’t like the art style because a friend pointed out that all the NPC’s have facial features characteristic of Down’s Syndrome (and now I can’t unsee that… thanks, bro). The lack of voice acting made Dead State’s NPCs feel a little flat. Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines’ NPCs were really interesting because of excellent voice acting coupled with great dialogue by Dead State lead Brian Mitsoda.  Also, be prepared for an assortment of bugs and crashes. I don’t know if there is anything game breaking you need to worry about but that could be a possibility. I was able to get 175 hours of enjoyment out of it and I am actually contemplating starting a new campaign to try more stuff out. So consider this highly recommended, if you can put up with the flaws I mentioned.			"

												Wanted to like this game alot but its crap once you start playing  So many thing odd about it that makes no sense at all like a zombie will hit me twice with no weapon, just hands and they do 80hp dam, while I shoot them at point blank range twice and miss, next I am knocked on the floor and they eat me to death.  Could understand this happens once but not every dam map and starter map as well.Another example, first map quest go get drugs.  I sneak around map killed a few zombies, near use all my med kit up but made no sound.  Went into the chemist and 2 looters there, one has a gun and fires, this makes a noise and 3 zombies join in plus the two looters I finaly killed turned into zombies.  In the end they killed another char with 2 hits then eating then my turn to get hit with fits for 90hp dam then bleed to death.  works out I am only doing 10% dam to zombies armed with knives, gun and such yet they kill with 3 hits, does not make any sense at all and makes it impossible to even start playing when you cannot even finish the first quest.  I have tried it with dif weapons. skills and make no difference at all.  Seems like a great idea and has good maps, anims, items but lacking in any fairness of play as you start off with nothing and after a few maps end up with nothing but lost hp due to never fully healing.  You only start with 110hp and after just one minor scuffle end up dead.			"

												This is the zombie apocalypse game that I always wished existed.  I LOVE ""anyone can die"" type games.  And for the first two weeks or so, anyone could and DID die.  The country bumpkin deputy fell first...the trucker mom and I had to abandon him as we ran for our lives from a hardware store.Then the IT nerd and the trucker mom's daughter were killed at the national park when we tried to split up to survive a horde.Then the trucker mom and the tough cop got caught in the middle of a shootout between rival gangs.  Between the gunfire and the zombies that were attracted to it, it became a blood bath.  In addition to the trucker mom and the tough cop dying, the flight attendant with PTSD got bit.  She killed herself that night.Then the televangelist got jumped...there was no way for us to get to him in time.  Finally, there was nobody left except myself and a young naive farmer girl.  We were doomed.Until we stumbled onto the scene of a car wreck, where a gay former Army Ranger agreed to join our group.  That was the turning point.  Once he was on my team, things got much easier.  We still lost the occasional member from time to time, including one of my survivors murdering another one, but all in all we grew to about 30-40 survivors - each with a unique skill set, backstory, All along the way, I was making hard decisions that affected the rest of the group.   I did eventually lead the team to safety, and it definitely felt earned.I will make one complaint, and it's one you don't hear a lot:  This game takes FOREVER to beat.  A ridiculously long time.  I'd say the first 50% was a real nail-biter where I was loving every second of it.  Then the next 20% I was starting to feel a little OP, but still liking the game.  Then the last 30% becomes ""JESUS CHRIST WHEN DOES THIS GAME END???""It gets very repetitive in the last 20-30 hours or so, and every single battle...regardless of whether it's zombie hordes or major human ""bosses"", becomes a cakewalk.  But even with that pacing complaint, this is still a phenomenal game and I highly recommend it for anyone who likes the feeling of the lives and deaths of dozens and dozens of characters depending on you for survival.

Early Access Review
								Considering turn based games have been around for decades, it's hard to explain why this one stuffs it all up so horribly. On the surface this has a lot to recommend it; recource gathering, base building, missions and more besides, and no doubt that make might for a fun game. But the combat system is so irredeemably awful it makes getting into the game a tricky notion.The typical action point system only comes into play once you're in combat so you're free to run around until then, but once you enter combat, good Lord does the game go south. For a start, you can't attack on a diagonal, which makes precisely no sense. Square on fighting is the order of the day. Secondly, there's no way to bring up a list of key commands so if you need to change view for instance, there are no on-screen icons to do it (a staple of these kind of games surely), you're kind of stuck. The whole game lacks that kind of simple clarity. Thirdly, it's too easy to batter someone on your team (why does the game allow this without at least a simple 'are you sure?' check?). As a result, once you enter combat it turns into a farce of repeated misses with whatever weapon you have equipped (early in the game you equip a weapon which doesn't show on your character who then gets advised to equip a weapon by everyone he meets before going outside - top work!), shuffling your characters around to try and get to the right square to attack and then using all your action points hitting your own team. It's just rubbish from top to bottom.It might get better and I'm certainly going to persist playing it as it seems to have genuine depth, but it's frustrating and counter-intuitive to play. I was hoping for State of Decay meets X-Com but this falls far short of that lofty aspiration.Ho hum.			"

												In the modern zombie apocalypse, you take shelter with several other survivors in abandoned school to fend off zombies and not-so-altruistic survivors.The zombie-infested modern world is depicted very nicely albeit brutal, where you can see how humanity quickly goes back to being medieval.Will you stay humane in this maddness to people around you, or become one of the predators yourself, preying on the weak and abusing everyone around you just to survive that another day?You can do all that and more in this very unique RPG game with turn based combat, strategic and planning elements and lots anf lots of dialogues.It is really hard to compare this unique game to anything, except that it has been heavily influenced by older RPG titles like Fallout.All in all, this time spent reading about the game is better be spent playing the game yourself, have fun!

												If you like turn-based RPG's, I highly recommend this one. I played Suikoden back in the day until they stopped making it for the European market, and the replay value of Dead State is kind of like that of Suikoden: You play through, then you play through again to get things perfect. Then you set it asside and pick it up one day when you remember what a fun game it was. I love collecting the characters, interacting with them, and scavenging. Killing the zombies is fairly easy, but battling the gun-wielding humans can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ (but that's part of the fun). I like improving my headquarters and the crafting. I like how my decision making and interactions have consequences, and I like following along with people's stories. I also have to give the developers special props for not deciding for me that the main character is hetero. That was a pleasant surprise.			"

												I would really like to write a positive review for this game, sadly I cannot.The combat thus far is simplistic - at best, lacking giving any tactical advantages to combat. Unfortunately this causes the difficulty to be... excessive. I think so far I've reloaded Brady (near the beginning) around 10 times, from looking online, I'm not alone in that.The focus on melee, means that the game devolves into surrounding an enemy and hitting them. Unfortunately the human enemies seem almost super-powered compared to your guys, surviving multiple axe, bats and shotgun blasts to the face.I'll be following the game in case things like cover mechanics, crouching, overwatch get added in, but for the time being, the combat is overly simplistic, lacks difficulty options and has a number of crashes that really should have been resolved by now.A pity, it had a lot of potential.

Early Access Review
								I'm only posting this out here due to the mass amount of trolls attacking this game for no reason as I would not recommend anyone to purchase a game that is in Early Access as there is no reason to unless you want to help the developers out with testing and feedback. 1. This is not a timed demo. The game does not expire after 7 days. The initial build is called The First Seven days because it only features content from the first seven in game days. 2. This is not a paid demo. This build is an evolution of the 3 day demo that was shown at PAX. It is a way for Kickstarter backers to get a progress report to see how far the game has come along If this was released in the condition it was in, it would be commercial suicide. It's buggy, it's crash prone, and it lacks many features. Unlike actual demos that exist for finished games, this is not a demonstration of the final product.You can either save a measly $5 to pre-order a game that isn't done and get access to content that is not even in beta form yet, or you can wait 3-5 months for the game to be actually finished and try out the public demo that will be available to everyone for free while reading reviews and make the decision for yourself. If the word ""demo"" was absent and it was simply called The First Seven days, then I guarantee you there would be no public backlash as the content featured here is the same as the initial Early Access builds of Wasteland 2, Blackguards, etc. As for the actual game itself, it's a very promising and ambitious computer RPG that feels and plays like one from the late 90s.For an indepth look at the game, check out my video:

												Just no.This game honestly feels like they had a beta version, went  out to lunch, and an intern accidentally released it as a full game.The combat system is mediocre, and the AI is rough. There's almost no tatical options, with the only real strategy being "" beat them on the head until dead, or run away if they're stronger than you.""The basebuilding aspect, which I was most excited for, ended up being extremly boring, with no customization. You always have the same upgrades, that do the same thing, and your base always looks the same.The writing, which they touted as a strong point, was okay at best. NPC interaction is trivial, and it feels like they had huge plans for it, but decided not to implement it at all for some reason.It was a huge buggy mess on release, and as they had an early access period to work through that, that was pretty unacceptable. They did gradually fix some of the worst bugs, but it took a long time and was a gradual process. Overall it was honestly a really disappointing game. It had promise, but failed to deliver on almost every aspect, and ended up being a pain to play.			"

Example if zombies fought in groups together so that on a map you would have maybe 3 or 4 major fights which you can fully enjoy the tactical control of the combat system. Currently, you will quickly grow bored killing sometimes one zombie at a time.. some maps have probably 50+ zombies; very mind numbing. Story: Whoever wrote this games story needs to get some real life experience. Don't get me wrong, the direction of the story is awesome but as soon as one part starts to get interesting the epic idiocy comes out in full.Examples without give out too much details:The group members do not respond as if the world just ended by a horde of zombies. They will try to take 'time off' for insane things like headaches, diarrhea, etc. You wouldn't tell your captain you had a stomach bug in the middle of a battle nor would you 'take the day off' if zombies could at any moment run the shelter over. For that matter, they all are pretty blah about the experience. Personally it feels like the designer got their sixteen year old emo kid to write the story.Despite the short falls it's still worth getting.			"

												Horrible lag when the player moves his character around and awkward dialog. The concept is great, the execution is just bad. The dialog is bearable and can still make the game interesting - going around and finding out everyone's backstory is really cool! Just some parts are bad. Namely, when people are trying to tell you that the zombie apocalypse has dawned. The introduction dialog needs to be completely scrapped and rewritten, it feels like the characters are treating me like a child the way they talk to me initially.Only 1 hour of playtime because the lag experienced while panning the screen and trying to move my character around a room was more frustrating than it was worth. I might try again when I build a new PC because I really like the strategy aspect, but right now it's just not worth the time.			"

												WARNING: This game starts off slow and easy but the learning curve is pretty steep. Yes, killing a single zombie is a cakewalk. Yes, the shelter occupants you start with are a pretty good bunch. Yes, it seems like once you get a chain link fence up all your troubles are over.They are NOT.The game will actually let you fall pretty far behind the curve - and then murder you. It will certainly monkey wrench your plans and will make running your shelter difficult. If you are not careful people, including you, will die in one, two rounds of combat. Don't let the simplicity of the graphics or the basics of combat fool you.Play at your own risk. :)I knew I was going to spend some time with ths game when I found myself zooming in on the map so I could see the details, read the spraypainted graffiti on the wall, and try to figure out just what story was being told with the scenery in a house that was no more important to the storyline than holding three zombies to fight and a little bit of random loot.I like strategic games, I like building games, I like RPG's, and I really liked the Fallout series of games. Any game that is going to give me a dog companion (a perk available in the game) to face the post-apocalyptic future, zombie-filled or otherwise, is going to get my attention. A shelter filled with unique occupants with interesting backstories, single player combat that I have to worry about more than my current health to survive, and wanting to see what new thing happens tomorrow is going to keep my attention for a while.IF you prefer FPS/realtime over turn based games, cannot stand bugs in games, or want the latest and greatest in game graphics think twice before buying this game.IF you like games where you go back to earlier saves to try something different, unexpected ""monkey wrench"" challenges to your plans, and games that tell a story I think you'll like this one.It is a travel around an area map in search of locations for encounters kind of game that has base management, personalitiy conflicts you must settle, and a humor to it.Combat, which is turn based, isn't deep but its' different. Worrying about allies panicing, how much noise is being made, and if a combatant you thought dispatched and done with will get up again to attack you as a zombie are things I haven't had to deal with in combat before. It IS a zombie game full of zombies. Slow, simple, easy to kill one. Trying to balance noise that attracts more of them against the noise made killing them isn't as easy. Neither are the human enemies you come up against, some of which can be quite challenging the first time you meet them - especially if you are underarmed or underarmored. The variety of weapons is pretty extensive. I have three hundred hours in it and I have not tried them all with their different kinds of attacks.This is a game I have enjoyed coming back to and seeing what was improved on in every patch and update. I am willing to put up with bugs to play a good Alpha or Beta game. Why anyone would want to go back to waiting months for a patch that tries to fix everything instead of an incremental improvement/feedback loop I will probably never understand. As often as this game has been updated to fix the remaining bugs and incoroprate player suggestions I'm sure I will be playing it off and on for some time to come.Think you'll enjoy it. I did.(edited for grammar/punctuation/clarity - which yes, probably all still suck and need another patch of their own.)			"

 Dead State Reanimated  This is a turn-based game with RPG elements and the strategic and economic. The main character of the game is the person that we create and we can even give our own photo to the display our face during the dialogues. The action is happening in the state of Texas in the small town of Splendid and the surrounding area. The story begins shortly after the tragic plane crash in which we are one of the surviving passengers rescued by a police officer. After the introduction main story begins and we will try to survive in a world overrun by zombies. Our goal is to take care of the morale, respect and mood of our members. They provide the attitude of people towards our character, the lower atmosphere, the greater chance that they can leave the shelter. After some time, the game will introduce to us a critical moments and we will have to decide which choice is best for the group. We as the main leader we need to take care of everything, upgrading shelter, recruiting new people, trips for supplies and assigning tasks on the board. The game has a very nice atmosphere, but turn-based battle system destroys it a bit. The mechanism of combat system is underdeveloped and is too simple. Personally, I approached this game with a safe distance because I do not like turn-based games but after a few hours I learned to play and it was fine. Sound system is good but there is no voice acting. In the game you move around the map, and just as we get to the place that we want to enter the map changes in the 3D location and we can start to explore. Also, sometimes on the way we can discover the place of ambush, destroyed camps or places where you can collect the fruits and vegetables. You can travel on foot but after some time you will find horses and make a car. As for me, the game was very good, 8 out of 10, however, would prefer to make that game FPS it would have more potential. However, it is still small studio that made this game and I must admit that I spent a lot of time playing this game and I did not complain of boredom while playing, at the beginning is difficult but after few hours it gets easier because of the large amount of accumulated resources.

												This may sound odd, a friend gifted this to me and I thought ""oh well another zombioe game"" but this has been one of the most enjoyable games in the past months for me. The mixture of XCOM like combat and RPG elements is so addicting. I found myself roaming around just to see what's in the next drawer. Absolut entertaining if you enjoyed XCOM and Wasteland2. Takes a while to get into the game but then it's a real gem. The daily dialogues with the 30+ different NPCs you manage is a game worth playing  on its own.I hope the devs add more content over time or do a second part or expansion, hell I buy every DLC. This is really a well designed, content rich game.			"

												I really liked this game even though there were quite a few issues with it like:- Random crashes (thankfully the game autosaves every time you enter a new area so it more or less makes up for it)- Sometimes the conversation bubble wouldn't appear with survivers.But on the plus side:+ The game has an interesting story and it revolves around the people more than the zombies surrounding them.+ The choices you make matter, like they would in real life. Reminds me of MEffect and DAge.+ Had two people murdered and then one of the murderer's killed herself. 10/10+ Killed coyotes, militia and military.... ended up getting out by bus since obviously I'm bad at making friends. Sadly lost Sir Charleston and Bud (still torn up about it).+ Max became unhappy, hopped over the fence and went on a killing spree.+ Aggro Moss randomly asked to have sex, so sure why not. "

Early Access Review
								Even in it's simple state, Dead State is the zombie game i've been waiting for. What State of Decay should've been: A zombie survival game that places emphasis on ""Survival"". An XCOM-State of Decay hybrid, I'd recommend this game to anyone whose a fan of strategy and/or survival games. This game oozes originality and fun gameplay, you'll be immersed very quickly into a tense atmosphere where one wrong step can land you knee deep into a horde of Zombies. The only downside is it lacks a character creation, an element that would help bolster the RPG aspect of the game. Other then that, a solid game. Can't wait for it's release.***EDIT***Since the game has come into beta, I've pumped a bunch more hours into the game and have only scratched the surface of the game's depth and content. However, one issue that I was unaware of was the travelling system; whilst the game is better then a lot of triple A games nowadays, if you go beyond 12PM whilst travelling back to camp, you die. Now, that seems quite harsh, especially with the games lack of an autosave feature, relying on you to spam that F5 every few minutes. The character creation has been implemented, but it's relatively bare right now, a lot of the features being locked and still being worked on. I imagine we'll be seeing more updates to it within the next few updates.That being said, the game oozes style and creativity, and whilst state of decay was a poor comparison with this game, it's a breed on it's own; a XCOM and Walking Dead lovechild. If you love strategy, and you love RPG's that you can make your own story to, then this is the game for you.Can't wait for more updates and more content.			"

												Dead State I would say is now in my top 5 best zombie games around, even though it is still in the early stages. First would say while the game is out of Early Access, there are still quite a bit of bugs and glitches but I have not come across any game-breaking ones and the game does have an ending. But the game is still being cared for by the developers and still getting big patches and fixes every other month or so.Now that's out of the way let's start on the game. Dead State is a survival focus RPG where you play as a created character who survives a plane crash and later wakes up in a school with other survivors. The school is your main base and so the main focus is to help build it up while also going out to find supplies and other survivors to join you. It is cool that your base does change when you build upgrades and the March patch now let's survivors roam around, giving it more life-like. The only thing I do wish is more stuff you can do in the base or also the look changes based on the survivors you recruit (mainly them bringing in personal items to decorate).The gameplay outside the base is similar to games like Xcom or any squad based RPG. You go out with a max of four people and when you arrive at locations, you mostly just look for supplies while fighting off the undead and hostile living. A nice thing is you will have to use different tactics when fighting zombies then living, since the undead aren't as smart and can be dispatch faster. However the good thing is they keep it bit realistic in the sense that taking on one undead or two is easy, but taking on a big group can be deadly. The equipment in the game while plenty, sadly they are not random in stats like Diablo. Also many survivors you recruit will have different skills that can be useful both on and off the field.Speaking of survivors, Dead State is one of very few zombie games that actually get this right. By right meaning every survivors you recruit is a ""person"", a unique personality that can change on how you treat them. You will also get events involving them that also give them more of a background. Course another nice thing is nobody is safe, since the game does have permadeath on party members (though if your main character dies it's game over) that does affect morale. However if you have somebody that does get on your nerves, you can easily take them out on scavenging, kill them, and come back claiming they got eaten by undead. Also by them not being safe, they can also get infected if you're not careful. Luckily getting infected doesn't automaticly mean death in this game, as long as you have antibotics you can fight off the infection. So in a sense unlike other zombie games where other survivors are either as lifeless as the undead or there fates are already sealed, this game does them justice by actually making them people trying to survive with you.Good:-Plenty of survivors that join you, each with thier own look and personality-Lots of areas to explore-Realistic equipment-Good amount of content and lengthBad:-Still good amount of bugs-Combat can drag on little too long-Interface and menus could use some work on			"

												Ok, so where do I start, because I have alot to say. I think if you look at the 113 hours of play time for dead state that I have  on record, you can see that its a game that I enjoy playing thoroughly. Then I see people with 0.5 hours of play time, writing bad reviews for the game, and clearly they havent actually played the game. I find every aspect of the game to be amazing, from the base building, to the combat and discovery and group management.Does that mean that the game is without flaws? Definately not. There are things about the game that I would like to see changed in ways, but the devs did say that we can expect more patches with changes and additions. I just feel that some guy got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, and he got all his friends on board to do bad reviews on the game, atleast thats what it looks like. Show me another game where they have all of my favourite aspects in one game, eg base management, character progression, exploration, looting, the list goes on.Some people might argue that the game was taken out of Early Access too quickly. I could understand why people would be upset about that....if all the patching and content also stopped, but thats not the case. DB devs posted that continued patches and content are planned, and by the amount of patches in the last few weeks, I can see they keep their word.I've played many otehr games, games that cost more, and I've felt truly robbed by some of those whishing i could get the time and money spent back. Dead State is not one of those games.I for one, wish that there were more games like Dead State			"

												okay, i am going to try and give as good a review i can on this.first of all i believe people should give this game more of a try. ORIGONALY i was VERY on the fence about this game. after hearing of massive bugs and the event that went down during the steam winter sale. i was hesitant to buy this game, but then it went on sale and i thought, why not? so i shall give my reasons why i support this game and what ive seen, bugs and all.#1 the bugsYES there are many!!!! BUT, most are small annoyences that can easily be fixed OR avoided.1 corpses tend have there body model one place, but acctually be somewhere else. so if you try to attack a zombie and are confused as to why your charecter is wandering off a different direction, you know why. this bug is a little common, but it useually doesint cause a major problemb or major frustration.2 be CAUTIOUS around 2 or more floored buildings!! these tend to have lag and are very glitchy/ wonkey!! ESSPECIALLY ON THE STAIR CASES!!! SO try to avoid saveing in these areas and go slow. you can eaither take your chances or avoid them. second storys are useually rare or far away from your base. so you wont reach them till your far in game.3 charecter AI i dont find that bad. they tend to do stupid things, but i feel as long as your not running far ahead and stay close to your team they tend to navigate fine. running ahead too far makes the navigation a little confused. this does not mean you have to stick close to them like babys. you have to assume they will go straight for you or take the shortest route to you. if you run around the zombie hoard while your far ahead and your teams just now catching up, guess whats going to happen. so always keep that in mind and that your team can lag behind a little.4 random crashes. i have only had 2 (knock on wood) so far. but the game auto saves everytime you enter a area. there is also the quick save button F5 and a quick load button F9. so when the crashes do happen, they happen very quick and you can just quickly reload the game.5 so far no major lag. lag tends to only happen when a lot of zombies are suddenly aware of you or appere suddenly all together. and agian as mentioned above, in 2 or more floored buildings. it rarely happens.6 mutiple bodys on a single tile in the same position. mainly zombie bodys. useually you have to glide the mouse slowly over the stack to select the different bodys becuase they merge/ cover each other. happens as often as you let it. zombies useually tend to stay seperate unless you funnel them down a hall or something.7 dead state is not very happy with windows 8. you CAN play it on win 8, i am proof of that. but in order to play it on win 8 you have to go to the games main file and set it on ""windows 7 compatability"".these are just some of the most main and common bugs that ive seen mutiple times.#2now that the bugs are out of the way, time to start talking about the main parts.1 i love the charecters. everyones different, acts different, love/ hates different things. and some will ask you for help or advice and you may have to solve fights between two charecters who dont like each other.some charecters you mite even personally hate becuase of their attitude or opinions.and beware, not all charecters have good intentions when entering your group!! so choose wisely!!! or face some charecters dieing from your mistakes.2 i love the loot and moral system. there is a major morale system that you must make sure stays good or there WILL be consequences!! so you must be sure to bring back not only food but luxerys as well. toilet paper, tooth paste, books, shampoo etc.3 recruiting. unlike other games where you have all the time in the world to gather others. this one has lives on the clock. take too long to find someone and itll be too late for them. (useually the clock starts running out around day 30-40)4 leveling. when you first start you have a certain amount of skill levels to spend. chooseing between melee, ranged, leadership, negotiation, medical, science, survival, and mechanical. each time you reach a certain point in a skill, you'll get a perk. chooseing between two.there are also stats that can help things such as your health, carry weight. chooseing between strength, agility, vigor and perception.5 events. each new moring some charecters want to speak with you. asking for more supplys, to take the day off, or advice. asking if they can come with you on the next run. to tell you of a near by location. or just to whine and compain about something. some can be very major and lead to disaster, so be careful on some choices and watch how charecters act. the most major ones will require you to have a meeting and decide between a few choices. not all of your group will agree on the choices made at the meetings.while traveling you will also come accross random events. some can give you new survivors, others can lead you into a gun fight with zombies and looters. reading the event description useually gives you a hint of what will happen.-------------------------------------------------------------------------SO there you have it. the most common bugs ive seen and what i like about the game.is the game worth $30?HELL NO!! i suggest buying it when its on sale. i bought it on sale for only $20. i suggest getting it lower then $20 if you can.if your still on the fence about the game. try the demo. its basically the same, bugs and all.

												Dead State is not a perfect game but something about it keeps pulling me back to play it.It is slow and requires a good amount of planning before you leave your shelter and during battles. The modes of difficulty adds a good amount of replayability as it forces you to rethink your strategies. If you are the sort who likes to mull/brood over every action of your character and you like zombies, consider giving this game a go. This is not for you if you expect to run into a group of zombies and start bashing heads willy-nilly. "

												I bought this game a couple years ago, and I'm finally getting around to actually playing it. It feels like it could be a great game, it should be a great game.  Imagine my suprise when I discover that even though the game is finished, and has been for long enough that it will probably never get another update, it still lacks some very basic, and necessary features. What is it lacking? Facing mechanics.  The same reason I stopped playing 2 years ago. This is a tactial turn-based combat game. Enemies behind you are harder to detect, yet you don't have the ability to control which direction your characters are facing. Seriously? How much work can it be to add a mechanic to choose which way a  character is facing? The developer says they ran out of funds. They had enough to 'finish' the game, and Have even updated it to dead state reanimated, yet couldn't spend the time to add a facing mechanic?Don't get me wrong, I'm very much enjoying the game so far. It's just that such a simple feature being lacking after the game has been 'finished' for this long, really makes it feel like a money-grab. Adding the reanimated update, but not finishing basic features (which were initially planned) is inexcusable in my book. If I had just purchased the game, I would be getting a steam refund, but I've owned the game too long for that. I will not, however, be purchasing any other games from doublebear/iron tower.			"

												UPDATE: Running into a group of hostile looters that out number me 2-1 and then letting a zombie horde attack them while I stand back and watch them kill each other. PRICELESS. I LOVE THIS GAME. This is a great game so far. I love the turn-based combat, looting, and party management. Sometimes things look a little unpolished, but all in all I couldn't be happier so far. I will change the review if this changes. I am steadily knocking back the bad morale everybody talks about. No idea what they are doing wrong. I think the key to that is Loot, Loot, Loot. Comfort items improve morale but you gotta keep bringing them in.			"

												I know there is a lot of negative reviews about the bugs and i wasn't sure if i was going to get this game but i read some of the positive reviews and i decided to go with it.  It's a very fun game and i'm really enjoying.  It's nice to play a single player version of a survival game.  I played h1z1 and dayz and while those games are fun its really hard to enjoy the game when you get killed on sight and lose all your stuff.  I'm not in to writing a big a review of the game.  Most people have already gave a good review of it.  I'll just tell you a little story.  I was on a run and on the way back, i found a camp.  So we go check it out and start taking stuff.  Well there was people there telling me not to take there stuff.  Well i ignored them and they starting attack us.  So i killed them all and took there stuff.  Well first i beat them down and knocked them out and than did a final blow to them.  I go back to the shelter and one of the guys at the shelter told me that i shouldn't do that.  Just kill random people and take there stuff.  I told him i won't do that again but i still do it.  Another time, i got a random encounter on the road where there was a car crash.  There was a guy standing next to a dead body next to his wrecked car.  He wasn't saying anything so i wasn't sure what to do, so i just killed him.  No consequences on that though.  I think it was suppose to let me recruit him but i think it was a bug because he wasn't saying anything.  The bugs in the game aren't that bad.  Every now and than, the game will crash but it takes a long time for that to happen.  The game autosaves a lot so its not really a big deal if the game crashes.  A little annoying but whatever.  It's still worth playing and i hope there will be dlcs for the game.  If you are wondering if $29  is worth it, i would say yes.  You could wait for a sale but i didn't and i'm enjoying the game a lot.  As i get further in the game.  I'll add to my review. Overall, this game is addicting to play.			"

												I would like to give this a thumbs up really I would It has serious drawback and frustrations that just make it irritating to play. I usually do a pros and cons list it makes it easier. VVVVPros:Graphics are ok nothing you can really do in games with that camera point are never glorioussound is goodcharacters are a little different and have there own side quest well more like little fetch quest other then that not much to do with them but switch out when they get hurtplenty of weapons to choose fromhave not run in to any bugs yetcant actually do anything to the building yourself everyone does it for you  cant board up windows or fix fence or anything where there would have been room for little mini games.Con:congratulations to all the physically challenged people who could not hit something with a hammer, axe from 3 feet away you are the only ones who apparently make it through the zombie apocalypse if you expect your characters to really hit with any consistency you are wrong it makes combat just really long tedious and boring.panic even though its a semi nice idea party members are constantly panicking who would just run away by themselves? all the time is beyond me and to be honest they deserve to die but wait next turn for no reason they will come backyou are talking to the same npc all the time yet nothing ever changes really why do the say you should do this?Gameplay can be slow mind numbingly slowww with just constant reloadingresting heals your wounds like you are the most fragile person everall you will do is loot which feels like the same thing every timewould think this game would be great in first or third person or with some better combat.

												I have held off buying Dead State after seeing some people upset over what they felt was the game leaving Early Access too soon to benefit from the Winter Steam Sale.  I have been watching the game for a long time but decided to wait until it went on sale to pick it up.  It seems like Doublebear has been doing steady patching, while maybe not to the level some people want, updating none the less, so when it went on sale I went ahead and decided to pick it up.   I love turn-based games and RPGs and Zombie stuff so it I figured I would roll the dice and drop $20 on it and see what I got.   So far with a couple hours under my belt I am really enjoying it and I haven't ran into any bugs.  The UI is a bit frustrating at times and a couple of times I wasn't sure what I needed to do for stuff like swapping inventory.  A quick glance at the manual resolved those issues.  The game can be counter-intutive at times but counter-intutive isn't the same thing as game breaking bugs.  During my play (I admit I haven't spent a lot of time yet) I have enjoyed the game play.   It does feel like XCOM with Zombies instead of Aliens.   Yes the misses will frustrate you sometimes, but that is the genre.  The game isn't ""easy"" but it isn't ""unfair"" either.  People can fuss over if Doublebear released the game too soon as a greedy move or not.  I don't know what the game state was back in December when it launched, but currently the game is very fun.  Games can always spend some more time in the oven to enchance them, but then again at some point the game has to leave Early Access (though I have a few that I seriously doubt ever will).  But at the end of the day, is the game fun?  Yes it is.  Is it a AAA title, no.  Is the price fair?  Once again that is subjective.  From my couple hours of game time, I can tell you that I wish I had picked the game up eariler, regardless of the sale.  The normal asking price of $30 is a bit high for a indie title, but I believe it is mostly worth the price from what I have seen so far.  I have gotten less enjoyment for double the money.Game prices are all over the place these days for Indie titles so I honestly don't know what a good price point is for games anymore.  That said I based on what I have seen so far and what I have read the game should last at least 30-40 hours, so I think it is a fair value.  So in closing is the game great?  Time will tell.  Has it been fun so far?  Yes it has.  Have I seen any bugs yet?  None that I can tell, un-intitive user interface design, yes, but bugs not really.   Of course I have just begun the game so that can drastically change along the way.  If it does I will be sure to update my review.  But at this time I can say that I would pay the full asking price for the game, much less on sale.   I think the game is good.  It isn't super, but it is fun and fair.With 2.5 hours under my belt so far I would give the game a solid 80/100.			"

												I have requested my money back on this game.  I consider it an Early Access game that requires additional work.  Reasons why it is early access:Game Balancing issues:Morale Penalties are cripplingIt is easy to get injured, and you are out several days unable to collect food, so your team starves.Combat is very hard - I could forgive this if there weren't the other 2 issuesDesign:This probably won't be fixed, but they really should simplify shelter management.  Manually walking everywhere is not fun.  If you had some shelter management screens instead, it would be much better.Reason to like it:I really love the concept.  The problem is the implementation.  Maybe a year from now, they will have a more balanced game.			"

												Once again Steam needs a rating system. I'd rate this 6/10. Given yes/no.. it's no. (I actually have played this over many, many days  but I had to force the exe to use my GX860M video card as it won't via steam. So the hours are wrong)If this is on a large sale (say 70+%) I'd say this is a nice bit of fun. But at $20US this old game is not worth putting up with the bugs; that a near game breaking. The storyline and the world are enjoyable enough. I love tactical combat but this is definately no Silent Storm in quality. The combat AI is okish and I suppose as an early game from the developer it takes time to get it right. (They're AOD and Dungeon Rats are far more mature). I rjoyed the graphics anf the shelter functions and the NPCs were enjoyable. The issue is this game was completed in 2015 and except for a fan patch it was finalised as is. By day 70 I was left with no alternative but to use the console to move past bugs and issues that would cause the end game to fail. It was fun up util the late and end game issues made it a chore. If you are a zombieholic like me, get it, if you are interested wait till it's $4.95 or something. It is fairly enjoyable but at $20 US I  can't recommend this game			"

Early Access Review
								While this game is certainly in an early state, it seems impressive so far. The game is fairly simple for now, but there are a lot of features not currently implemented that will make the game much more complex. For example, there are many structures to build that show up as not being available in this demo that look like they will really expand on the gameplay. The combat is fun, and even in this early build the zombies do a good job of responding to noise in a way that doesn't make them seem either deaf or too aware of small noises. In short, if you like State of Decay, you'll probably like this game as well.			"

												I've just finished my first playthrough of Dead State and I definitely plan on replaying it at some point in the future. In short, I'd say that it's definitely in my top games for 2014.The game is a bit of a curious mix of survival games (think resource gathering in something like This War of Mine) set within a framework of a RPG playing quite like Fallout 1 and 2. After a brief intro sequence you are soon aware that the zombie apocalypse is happening and you are soon put in charge of a shelter in a Texas town called Splendid. It's your job to make sure any survivors (you will find many who you can invite into the Shelter) living there can, well, continue to survive. You talk to people, solve conflicts, assign jobs. And then you wander out into the world seeking resources.The game is viewed from a top-down perspective with a camera you can spin around.Gameplay:There are a few different gameplay actions you do during the game. As described above, the Shelter is your base which you need to improve. This is done via a Job Board where you can assign tasks to your fellow survivors such as building things, be a doctor, or come with you out into the field to get supplies.This is all dependant on the game's RPG system where you can invest points into various skills such as Ranged Combat, Leadership, Medical skill etc. All survivors you meet have their own set of skills (which you don't have any control over, but will continue to grow over the course of the game) which make them suitable for different tasks.There is a base management aspect of the Shelter. You need to keep it stocked with food, gas for the generator, luxury items and medical items. There is a morale stat for the Shelter depending on how well you do.The survivors also hang around the Shelter where you can talk to them and get (fairly brief) bits of their stories. You can also ask them if there's anything special they'd want from the scavenging hunts. Someone may favour whiskey, someone else a cigar. This will raise their mood. If a survivor's mood goes down, they may end up leaving you.Also, each morning there are little interactions, situations that arise in the Shelter. People may be arguing, someone may need to talk to you about something etc. Sometimes there are Crisis Events which is regarding bigger decisions in the Shelter. The characters involved will agree or disagree depending on your choices.The writing for the characters is very good most of the time. It's down to earth and believable most of the time. There are a few exceptions but mostly the writing gives the game a real human feel which is exactly what a game like this needs. You can also find ""data items"" which can be found in the world and decrypted so you can read them. These items vary from the Dead State equivalent of Twitter messages, medical reports, personal letters, message board discussions etc, mostly about the outbreak of the zombie virus. These are *fantastic* and present a real nice backdrop to everything that's happening.I also have to give the developers kudos for including characters with a form of mental illness. Too often in games do they treat mental illness as just being CRAZY! But Dead State does it seriously even while it may not dive too deeply into the subject either.During the day, you're most likely out scavenging with your party (total of 4 members including yourself). This is done via a worldmap travel system (again fairly similar to the older Fallouts). There are many locations to find in the game, all with varying resources, allies to recruit and enemies.The combat system is very much like Fallout. It's turnbased and may feel rather slow and clunky to some players. The combat system feels at its best when fighting against humans, it can get pretty exciting. Most of the time, the zombies are a non-threat. Individual zombies are weak and easily taken care of. Any danger that they pose comes from the being in groups. There is a noise-level system in the game, and the zombies are attracted to noise which creates a very interesting dynamic. If you get into a firefight with some humans, you can soon count on the fact that zombies will start to move towards the location of the gunshots. This creates a great an additional layer to think about during combat. You can also use this to your advantage, luring groups of zombies into a bunch of human enemies by throwing firecrackers for example.VisualsDead State is not a AAA game by any means, and it may look really crude at first. The character models in particular look fairly boring. However, when actually playing, one notices that locations in particular are quite well done. It's not high end graphics by any means but all locations manage to convey a sense of place really well. Whether it's a shopping mall, a neighbourhood of houses, a resort. They work really well actually. Animations are also pretty well done though it feels like it could've needed a few more.AudioNothing special here. The music works well and does its job. It sounds relaxing at the Shelter (except when conflicts arise) and creepy when exploring. Given how much combat there is in the game, the combat music quicky wears out its welcome unfortunately and starts to grate after a while. Sound effects feel pretty ""stock"", nothing particularly exciting.Other stuffMuch drama has been made about the buginess of Dead State and, indeed, I did run into a fair amount of bugs and polish issues. Mostly it seems to be certain story events and such happening out of sequence at times. There are many small annoyances also such as difficulty traversing stairs at times. It feels a bit janky at times, moreso the longer into the game you get. At least that was my personal experience.I had about 5 crashes throughout my nearly 50 hours with the game, I'd say that's pretty good actually.It also has some pacing problems. The game is pretty slow to get going, mostly due to there being few followers at the start and not much to ""do with them"" so to speak. It feels a bit empty. The game shines during the middle when the Shelter starts filling up, people start talking to each other and things start happening. And then the energy goes away again toward the end of the game where you've collected all the stuff you need basically. It feels more like a waiting game then for the end-game to set in. I think the game would've done well to be ""condensed"" a bit, especially at the end it can actually get a bit boring unfortunately.SummaryAll in all, I *highly* recommend Dead State if you know you like the types of gameplay it offers, It is extremely addictive, I found it very easy to play through just ""one more in-game day"". The writing is mostly great and give it all a nice sense of purpose. Like I said above, this is one of my top games for 2014, no question.However, the bugs may annoy you depending on how sensitive you are to games feeling a bit broken and janky. The devs are gonna be actively patching the game so you may want to wait a bit before taking the plunge yourself.All in all, highly recommended!			"

												Didn't feel like the zombie survival I was looking for. There is little to no stealth feature making it difficult when facing survivors. Once alerted they instantly go for guns and start shooting alerting all zombies in the area. I got to frustrated with this to continue far into the game due to so much backtracking and retreating from survivors making the objective area unreachable.			"

Early Access Review
								Ok let me just say if you like arcanum, baldurs gate and many other RPG's from the mid early 90's like most of us on steam grew up with these games. YOU WILL LOVE THIS! This is a early BETA at the moment but it has quickly shown to be one of the best titles in my opinion to come this year. The base building, crafting, survival and conversations through the game feel authentic. You will crap yourself in parts with too many looters or zombies this is a unforgiving realistic survival RPG. This is the game we have been asking for as zombie and role playing fans. The team making this made some of you favriote old games i belive they did Vampire, arcanum, baldurs gate and many more. they genuinly care for the gamers and will talk to you like a best friend at conventions a very humble group that just wants to bring you a game that us now older generation of gamers miss dearly. check it out 25$ is a great price for a game that should be 60$ in my opinion give this team our love.

			This is my first impressions of Dead State demo which is available on Steam Early Access. ★★ Subscribe if you enjoy my videos!		

In it's current state, the game is lacking a story.  There is no tutorial to explain how to go about doing certain things that aren't so intutive.  Dialogue choices appear to not really matter or effect relationships in your group.  Battle mechanics are sub-par and don't feel like a traditional RPG (IE: wasteland 2, XCom, Banner Saga.. etc)In the end my hour spent in my first go through of the game was filled with frustration and ended with a slap in my face ""Thank you for finishing the game"" message when I had clearly lost.  I do not recommend you get this game now, and I would wait after final release until there is gameplay to see if it's worth it then.			"

												Thumbs up with some reservations.    This is a slower, turn based,  lower graphics fidelity zombie game than some others but it does manage to be fun.      It seems to have some balancing issues as there isn't much challenge after the first few days or a week or so.    I'm about 30 days in (game time) and have seen only one challenging fight in weeks.   I'm just finding it tough to rinse and repeat much further given the low difficulty.EDIT: I see they did a big update at some point so this may be out of date.  Haven't played it recently			"

												Overall a pretty good game in my opinion, but I want to write about the things that is not good:Dialouge is often poorly written. Sometimes when dialouge give you choices you get the same consequence no matter what you choose. (may be bugs or to low negotiation skill, idk)Sometimes when I meet survivors I don't want in my shelter I cannot choose to not take them with me, so I have to kill them if I want to get rid of them.Stupid stupid AI.Male portraits looks extremely feminin.

								The game is still in Alpha and it shows with some place holder graphics. However the game is showing great promise and is already tons of fun! It is a  RGP with tatical shooter elements like Jagged Alliance. Each of the NPCs in the game have personality and balancing their wants and needs is as much of the game as killing zombies and looters. If you enjoy State of Decay, the Walking Dead and the whole Zombie Apocalypse, you will enjoy this game. I know I am. Looking forward to future updates!			"

												I've decided to write a review for this game to try to curb down the negativity around this game. I've read many reviews that claim this game is awful, unplayable, so full of bugs that it's not enjoyable and after playing 75 hours of it, I will have to disagree. I'm not saying it's a perfect game or doesn't need more work and polishing but it is still a pretty damn fine game on it's own.Now as far as bugs go, I've encontered a few but not nearly as much as other people claim there are. There was one instance of a zombie disapearing and being unattackable while still existing on the map and attacking you on it's turn and every once in a while the game crashed. But other than that I've been pretty much bug free. What I enjoy about this game? An intresting story/setup where being the leader of your group of survivor of a zombie apocalypse isn't just about mowing through wave after wave of zombies and calling it a day. Taking care of your shelter and your people can be just as fascinating. The combat while not super deep has some interesting layers with positioning, noise making and panic mixed in the simple but effective turn based combat. There are some nice RPG elements added that give some replay value and I absolutely love how you can influence certain events/characters simply by the way you treat them. I also enjoy looking at the shelter evolve with time both from upgrading it but also from smaller things (food in the pantry for example) and wish there was even more of that in the game.My biggest complaint with the game as it stands is how unbalanced it is. Maybe I've just played that type of game too often or maybe I'm too ""efficient"" for what the devs intended but after only 30 days in game all shelter upgrades were built. At day 45 I've discovered what looked like most of the locations. And because of the perks I took I had enough fuel and food to not have to care about it for another 3 months, I had enough antibiotics to be able to shower my people with them, my fence was nearly indestructible and I had enough weapons and armor to have everyone equipped, even characters I knew full well I would never take in the field and even then I was throwing weapons and armor in the recycler despite not really needing any more parts. My overall morale was so high that I think people were happier than before the zombie apocalypse. And now I had to just pass each day until sopmething else happened. And it became a bit boring at that. So I decided to make another game where I would put myself restrictions on how much and how fast I would do things. Every day I would only go on one outing for one location only. Doesn't matter that my inventory is not even half full, doesn't matter that I'm still at full health. It sure made the game go at a slower pace and makes it longer before I'm done with everything but I find it disapointing that I have to put myself these restrictions instead of the game making me take hard decisions on what I need now and what will have to wait later. (think X-Com for instance)I also have other small issues with some desing decisions (like the inability to advance to clock until after everybody is done working) but again overall it is an enjoyable game with a good concept that I hope the devs will keep polishing and making better with time.Oh and for replay value I hope one day they come up with different maps so that people who played the game don't already know where everybody is or where important things are.

												I barely ever get a chance to play video games anymore, but the new wave of truly classic RPGs are too tempting. Dead State is no exception, and did not disappoint. Yes, there were some bugs, but nothing earthshattering. What was earthshattering was the addicting gameplay, excellent writing, and general fun-ness. The only thing I'm left wanting is a slightly larger array of civilian firearms (it's Texas, c'mon), and more quests / story in the mid game. When your only gripe is 'I want more of this game', you know you've got a keeper. I'll replay it when they've added more content.			"

												Kickstarted this game and only recently got around to playing it. I've put quite a few hours into it (a lot offline) and although I've come across some graphical bugs, I've not encountered anything game breaking. I think the graphics are good, combat is interesting and being turn based is great for when you have to stop mid battle due to real life. Story is ok, no nail biting edge of your seat stuff, but does the job. Base building and RPG elements add a nice touch and do more to keep you invested. There is also a forum which I've browsed a few times and has been great for hints and tips.Conclusion: I would (and have) recommend this game.			"

I really wonder why so many negative comments is being posted bout the game. The game is pretty much what it promises to be, a zombiesurvival with turnbased battles.If I would say something negative bout the game, it would be the battle system. So many times iv been stuck in a battle just because u cant leap over k.o.ed ppl. Why the fk u cant? And i cant get the percentage system sometimes, specially with guns. If ur 1 tile away from straight line, ur % can go down to 0, and thats not how its supposed to be. Allso, no overwatch?Othervice, the game is easy to enjoy, tons of humor and scanvenging. I think the price was right on sale ~ 20e.			"

												As an RPG and ""Apocalypse-like"" scenarios fan, I must say this is a superb game. It was a while ago I gave a game this much attention and always looking forward of playing it.Don´t be fooled by the non flashy graphics. The details are all there, but not in a super classy high res version, which I am totally fine with. Its the story and the gameplay that makes this game awesome.Pros: Wide array of allies and dialogs.A bunch of things to craft.Superb apocalyptic atmosphere, but still with some hope, which I rarely feel in other games like this.Open world.Easy to start, hard to master :)Cons:Still some annoying basic bugs in the game.The map could be bigger.More crafting and upgrades of the shelter would be nice.

												Dead State is clunky, buggy and slow near the end. It's also one of the best indie games I've played this year. A post-apocalyptic zombie game where fighting zombies is the least of your troubles, your task is to keep a shelter of ragtag survivors afloat. This means keeping it secure by building/maintaining your wall and posting guards. Keeping your food and water supply going by looting abandoned buildings (or unabandoned ones), building a well and gardens, and raising chickens. Trying to keep your food refrigerated (and stop your survivors from rioting) by keeping a steady supply of fuel for the generator. Dealing with the other surviving factions, either through ""diplomacy"" or force. And so on... There is a fair bit of combat, but for most battles, it's a matter of chugging through and killing everything so you can loot the map. In most cases, either your party is properly-equipped for a combat scenario (in which case you will eventually win) or it's not (in which case you will lose, probably quickly). This is a big reason the game feels slow nearing the end: you know you can kill everything, so now you need to chug through and do it. This is especially true for the zombie maps, since a ""hard"" zombie map is just one with a lot of zombies on it. Human enemies will wipe the floor with you in the early days, but by the end game, there are only a few encounters in the game that will give you any real difficulty. Even some of the scariest-looking ones are actually quite easy with decent equipment. So it's the shelter management aspect where the game shines.In Dead State, you have a great deal of control over all aspects of the shelter's management. You're not only responsible for meeting those basic needs (food/safety/electricity/morale) and assigning work duties, but also internal and external diplomacy. You choose which survivors to recruit, how to deal with other groups of survivors, how to deal with the various cliques in your shelter, and what to do about criminals and other crises. There are a lot of different ethical choices to make that don't boil down simply to ""plus karma"" or ""minus karma"" like many other games. Is it more wrong to turn away a survivor that you know is useless, knowing they will die, or to let them in and risk starving everyone in the end due to lack of food? What about attacking other camps for fuel to keep your shelter from falling apart? Does it matter if they are ""bad guys""? What counts as a ""bad guy"" and are you sure you aren't one? :)Anyway, despite the bugs I thought it was worth every penny. There is a free demo available, which is the full version of the game with a limited number of days, and if you like the demo, you can carry your save over, so if you're curious there's no reason not to try it out.

												I recommend this game with a few reservations.First, it's not for everyone.  The game can be very repetitive.  Managing a group of survivors and locating resources to build and feed everyone sounds fun, but what it amounts to is little more than going from one area to another, clubbing everything to death, and putting all their food/fuel/ammo in your inventory.  Then doing it over and over again.Second, the combat is not very good.  I found it poorly paced.  There is a very basic early game, middle game, and late game, but the jumps between them seem don't transition well.  It's all based on armor, really.  Having better armor suddenly makes you immune to so much damage.  Combat pretty much boils down to doing the same thing over and over again, with very few interesting mechanics.Third, the game is not paced well.  This goes hand-in-hand with repetitive.  There are very interesting storylines and elements, but there are large bouts of nothing followed by sudden bursts of activities, particularly close to the end where there bouts of nothing become longer and longer.  The game could use a BIT more activity/story.With all that said, this game is interesting, fun, and contributes to the genre in a much needed way.  The devs are actually patching/making improvements, so I consider that a strong plus as well.  Some bugs remain, but they're definitely working on it, and I didn't run into any major issues (although a few annoying bugs were present).  I enjoyed leading my group through some tough situations and exploring post-apocalyptic Texas, meeting new people, and exploring a variety of environments.  There is some difficulty in building morale/food stores in the beginning, but this is actually fun and contributes to the difficulty of the game (something that is lacking at a certain point).One final word.  The game has some political (ridiculous conservative/Texan stereotypes) elements to it.  If you're sensitive, you probably won't enjoy this game.  It was  bit heavy handed at times, to be honest.  Still, I enjoyed this game overall and would recommend IF you have a high tolerance for reading text, doing repetitive tasks, and some amount of ""roleplaying"".  You should also, of course, really enjoy the genre as well!			"

												There still are many bugs and errors that do tend to annoy you, However I must admit I do like the game I would suggest maybe looking at youtube and watch someones playthrough then decide weather you can cope with the bugs or not. Personally I would say get it the devs seem to still be fixing things that's great. The games fun challanging. You like zombies and survival based games surivior managment then get this game.  It's kept me busy for a few hours and still have plenty of the map to explore.			"

												Bought Dead State on sale.  Wanted to get it based on the demo and that it is squad based.  However, given the comments didnt want to pay too much.  Even in the Demo saw how annoying bugs could be.  Overall, I have to say a resounding thumbs up for the game though.  It is exactly what I wanted and hence however many hours in I am through the game I felt it fair to let others know who like me have been on the fence.  I like squad based tactics and so I am really most interested in the scenarios for getting supplies.  I like the combat and even enjoy just turning up while I fight is already going on and watching two looter groups fighting it out with each other, attracting a load of dead guys and then being overrun by them.  I then clean up and take all the loot!  Excellent fun!  I also enjoy the tricky encounters, usually where better armed looters/militia control an area and arent interested in parlaying.  Surprisingly I have also enjoyed running the shelter and developing my character in order to do that.  Admittedly the shelter begins to run itself after a time and you get so much food and luxuries that you could hold out until armageddon but it is a nice touch.  Havent got the lab yet but everything else is done.So why wait until on sale?  It is still bugged.  It is a little annoying to see your guys walk through a locked door!  Or right through a car.  Also frustrating to not be able to get to loot which has been placed in a position that is inaccessible (rare though).  Early on (possibly demo) it was real annoying to have killed a guy taken some excellent loot only to get back to the shelter and it had gone missing and no I didnt forget to pick it up.  I think the worst faults, so far at least have been in the hotel  in Austin.  Great idea, real enjoyable combat, difficult and demanding.  But moving between floors is a real pain.  Could it not have been made a bit easier?  You will find it almost impossible to move up or down unless your players are in the right position but you cant move your players to get into that position.  Having one person in the right place should be enough then an automatic move.  If you enjoy squad based tactics (old school xcom not the new) and you woul like to try something different then this game is worth getting, you just need to work out what price you are willing to pay for it.  I got it at £14.99 and that was fine for me, under a £10 get it no questions asked.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been waiting... and waiting for Project Zomboid to get released, and after playing Wasteland 2, I realized that a similar game, zombie style would be cool. Although it's in beta, I like this game a lot, and can't wait to see it bit more polished.			"

												I'd certainly recommend this game if you are a fan of old-school RPGs like Fallout and Arcanum. It has great atmosphere, writing is mostly good, combat is turn-based and done well (though there are still some issues), I liked the exploration and shelter management. Don't know why other people complain so much about bugs - in my playthrough I didn't encounter any (I didn't beat the game though). Sure, Dead State is an indie game and sometimes it shows: it doesn't have fancy graphics, it took many years to develop (being waiting for this since 2011) and there is still a lot to fix, but in its current state it is already fun to play.

												Honestly, the game is very disappointing. The amount of bugs are ridiculous. First off, this company should never have taken it out of ""Early Access."" Even at this point, major bugs still exist, some even game-breaking.The combat is relatively fun; although, extremely simple. You might get bored at the lack of options or variability in combat. It gets old quick once you hit the 100th zombie with a sledgehammer. Late in game, the armor you acquire pretty much puts the game in ""God Mode."" You can take 10 bullet wounds from a sniper rifle and only get a modest amount of endurance/health points removed. ""The Shelter"" was a well thought out concept, but executed poorly. You get very little, if at all, dialogue changes from allies. Allies in ""The Shelter"" are pretty much just nice looking statues. The situations that arise in ""The Shelter"" are so few and far between. At some point in the game, it becomes a literal waiting game whereby you just pass up days because every location has been scavenged, all the upgrades built, and no new shelter crises arise.This game honestly feels half-finished, so much so that there is a major quest line that an ally gives you that is impossible to complete.

												Dead State has so much gristle and fat and not much protein. If I were more willing to save time, I would have wrote a review condemning the game's length and amount of Monty Haul gameplay - because you have to scavenge SO MUCH in this game. Of course, this means going around to all the various places in Central Texas, dodging every zombie and murdering every looter to fill up your backpacks with as many ramen noodles and luxury items as you can carry. TIMES INFINITY. I wouldn't mind if there was more to interact with in the world (and there really needs to be more stuff to do to break up the monotony of scavenging all the time), because having to loot gets so damn boring after a while. I ended up skipping entire days towards the end of my playthrough because I was really sick and tired of having to go out and ♥♥♥♥ing pick up the groceries. And I hated not being able to delegate this task to the two or three people sitting around in the shelter once all the improvements were built. This mechanic, while it fits in really well with the world falling apart and even adds an 'Earth Abides'-style flavor to the proceedings, drove me up the ♥♥♥♥ing wall and onto the ceiling, down the wall on the other side of the room, and back. Like a really angry hamster determined to get out of his cage.So why didn't I just quit the game and play something else? Here's why - this game has some very, very interesting storytelling. When people talk about this game being a spiritual successor to games like Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines and Arcanum, they're talking about the solid storytelling. Brian Mitsoda (he worked on Bloodlines and Arcanum) and two other people made this game, and Brian did such a damn good job with the writing that I kept going despite hating what was going on with the game. And that storytelling is what held my interest throughout the entire game - I nearly could forgive all the monotonous scavenging if it meant more lovingly written, well-researched bits about how the world fell to the zombies, about astronauts losing their ♥♥♥♥ on the ISS, interactions between survivors, between militia groups, between the outside world and the little emotional ecosystem going on in the shelter. Those moments were beautiful and fun to experience.I really had to fight to finish the game, both inside the game and outside. The scavenging took such a mental toll on me, but the storytelling kept me coming back for more. I don't doubt that this is going to be a cult classic among RPG enthusiasts, easily joining the ranks of the great RPG games that don't work all that great but have such wonders to show anyway.You know what? To hell with it. I recommend this game, but  only if you bring several audiobooks or your backlog of podcasts to go along with it. If you don't, the monotony will drive you crazy (unless you're one of those mutants who runs around in a field to beat up slimes so you can grind your way to one-shotting Sephiroth at the end, in which case there is no hope for you). It starts out strong and ends strong, but everything in-between moves so damn slowly I nearly quit several times. You've been warned.			"

												Like everyone else has said, It is just to buggy to get to engaged. Also their is very little depth to the other characters in the game. You will always use the same 3 combat class survivors for your team and the others are basically their to bother your with their ♥♥♥♥♥ing. I really wanted this game to be good, but after several hours I think I am done. I am getting tired of these early access games, It is like the developers create as little as possible to be interesting and then cash out on steam and then quit trying.

Early Access Review
								I have to say I love this game and the only disappointment I get is waiting for installments of the ""beta"" patch to release. The storyline is fantastic, the visuals for such a development is phenomenal. I will still be granting the highest review however this game comes off to me as an ""alpha"" stage game. The fine line between alpha and beta versions seem to be thinning with early release games and for the most part this game is incomplete and missing fundamental necessities to make it an enjoyable playthrough on beta. I understand glitches and bugs should be present, but content should not be slowly incorporated into a beta test but given and tweaked per recommendations by the audience. Needless to say this game is AMAZING and I've dumped numerous hours into it. But for those expecting a satisfying play, wait for the full version.			"

												I'm a really big fan of these ""scavange, fight, build you base, and prosper onwards"" games. Thats why I got Dead State after a few days of it's release. It had a lot of bugs. HAD. Because the developers cared for their game, like  mother for their child. They got rid of the bugs, listened for feedback, and added a lot of content. It's not an Uncharted 4, or a Battlefield 1 graphically but if you were looking for something like that, you actullay wouldn't be here. This is and Indie game, but has a better story, with more replayability then most AAA games I've played so far. You can aproach sitations always in at least 2 ways, but usually more. There are no class restrictions. You can switch your weapons and playstyle anytime you want throughout the game. There is resource managment, making sure your allies have everything they need, and the story can really twist your head around, and make you look foolish for thinking something way differently am hour ago.If you play 5 hours, you will eventually play a houndred. So please, go, buy it, and eventually, it may become a cult game. Then we'll get a sequal :3			"

Played 14 hours straight and I just love it. Yes some of the other reviews are correct in that there are a few bugs including a random crash now and again and some spelling mistakes. Putting those issues aside leaves you with a RPG full of content and story. I wanted a game were I was a survivor in the apocalyps looting to survive and upgrading my character. I also was hoping for some base upgrading which i am happy to say is also part of this game. It generally scratched my zombie survival itch.Don't get me wrong though......If project zomboid had better graphics and a story mode I would be all over that!!			"

								I found this game online on the kickstart page and loved the ideas behind it. It is not quite complete yet but does have a date set for when it will be finished. So far I've had a ton of fun with this game. It's a great Idea of how to set it up. Right now the thing I wish for is more stuff to scavenge or maybe having more stuff show up after a while so you could scavenge the same place several times... As of now once you scavenge an area... its' empty... no point going back...I like the travel in this game and I just over all do recommend the game. I's a great Idea that is still being worked on and will hopefully become a great finished masterpiece.			"

												I am enjoying this game but let me warn you I found it stupefyingly difficult. The overall strategy theme is great, looking after the base, making it more secure, different people with different roles and skills but I think the combat piece at the locations is too difficult. I have played 5 hours so far and I have died, every time, within minutes of entering EVERY location.I have tried stealth, running, combat, weapon changes, altering my party for medical staff but when you are 3 in a party with hammers as your weapons and you encounter 5 looters with TWICE your hit points and they ALL have guns it's all over in less than a minute.I'm still plugging away in the hope I am just missing something obvious. If not, I have to admit the difficulty takes the fun away.			"

												Great game! There are a few bugs but most of these were corrected on the reanimated update and even so the flaws are easily overlooked by the fun I had playing the game. It has a unique gameplay for an rpg since your character levels up based on what you achieve for the group of survivors. The story is very interesting and gives a feeling of living the story of ""The Walking Dead"". From my experience the developers were always keen answering the players feedback and I would like to congratulate them for the great gamming experience they gave me. If you have the patience to overlook some of the flaws of the game your are rewarded with an amazing time playing this game. I paid full price for this game and it is worth every penny.

So...yeah.Get it only if, like me, you're really into zombie-survival based games. If you're just on the fence about it I suggest you don't.I'm not criticising the turn/AP-based gameplay - that worked fine in Fallout 2 and such but somehow falls flat when zombies are introduced.-You will ALWAYS be ambushed by a zombie hiding around a corner as you walk into a room-You will ALWAYS be ambushed by a zombie hiding just out of view inside a house as you walk in since you can't see into buildings until you walk inside-There will ALWAYS be a zombie to infect the looter you ko'd but didn't manage to finish off - instantly turning them undead and introducing another enemy-There will ALWAYS be a looter shooting a gun like a moron and attracting all zombies in the map-Zombies will ALWAYS screw you over instead of the looters that attracted them-You will ALWAYS get ko'd when your medic isn't around-You will ALWAYS get pinned to the ground by a zombie when alone-Your allies will ALWAYS panic and run away - leaving your guy to fight alone when all of you could of taken out the lone zombie-Your medic will ALWAYS overheal when they panic-Your ally will ALWAYS get downed by a zombie in the doorway making you unable to move past and take out the zombie eating him-You will ALWAYS miss when you can't afford to-Your guy will ALWAYS miss when he has only 1 bullet left in the magazine-You will ALWAYS miss with a 95% chance to hit-You will ALWAYS miss 5 times in a row when it only takes one hit to finish the enemy off.Phrase of the day with this game is ""Oh for f***s sake....""Seriously i've played this for 12 hours so far and achieved nothing because something always screws me over.

												Now it's been sometime, I'm posting a new review in place of the old one back when it was still in Early Access.I've been very interested in this project since it first appeared on Greenlight and have been following it's progress. It's a turn-based zombie survival game where you manage a shelter and have to deal with many harsh situations that may happen based on the survivors you have as not every survivor is as steady minded as you could imagine. Some look for love in the wrong place, others are mentally disturbed (due to what has happened and the situation you are in now) and you can even recruit animals to the shelter which give their own moral bonus, but also eat into your food supplies too.All the characters in the shelter have their own personalities. Some can even point out new locations where there would be a large storage of weapons or food based on their life before the disaster struck. Some can be very likable like the Loving and helpful Renee or others will be blunt and emotionless like the officer, Vic. There are multiple endings and hours of replayability with the many different dialog trees. I have not yet completed the game, but I have gotten far into it and built everything in the shelter, of course trying to gain enough food and fuel on each excersion to keep moral up becomes difficult with more people.Now I'm not going to say the game is perfect. There are still bugs in the game and issues where bodies will share the same square, however the dev team are still working on this game and want to make it the best experience for all of those like me who are craving for a zombie survival game where you are responsible for the survivors and all the survivors have varied and interesting personalities.If you are still uncertain, I'd suggest playing the demo to get a good feel for it. It has that wonderfully nostalgic feel of Fallout 1 + 2 as well as Wasteland.			"

												DISCLAIMER: I am NOT a big fan of turn-based games, and not a zombie fan...BUT this game is truly awesome.  I strongly suggest a short ""don't give a crap"" run-thru and then start a game you intend to play for a week or two in your spare time.  Or a month or two in your spare time if you're a completionist (I've played for 100+hrs in on game #1 and am nowhere NEAR beating the game yet).Open-world is impressive with this one.  Graphics are not.  Reminds me of x-com only with less glitching.  Extremely well put together title.  :-)			"

												I've played this game A LOT, as you can see from my recorded playtime. I started on it in early access, and did several restarts during the years it's been out. Weirdly enough I never actually finished it, but now that there aren't that many new interesting games coming out, I decided to return to it.I've always been a big fan of the game, regardless of it's problems. There's a bunch of problems with the game, and at this point they likely will never be ironed out. Still it's a flawed gem, and if you like turn-based RPGs with survival elements, you'll probably enjoy it regardless of those flaws. "

												Firstly, Dead State is a diamond in the rough.Let me say that I don't relate to people who fiercely defend titles and developers where the products are incomplete or have problems.  I've seen fans who jump onboard and immediately shout down anybody who has negative criticism of the game.  I pay for (and expect) quality, and really struggle with the new era of gaming which puts the public in the chair of tester.Having said that, I really enjoy Dead State.  A *lot*.It was formally released early December (about a week ago), and there are still a pretty wide range of improvements that could be made to the game.  The thing is, even without them, the game is fun.  It's quite immersive .. insofar as it pulls you into the story and the concerns of your survivors.A lot of games try to achieve immersion these days - but they have some kind of false idea of what immersion means .. making a game grindy and laborious may be exactly how it feels to chop down a tree in real life - but you soon get bored and realise it's just a game. What Dead State throws at you is relationships and a foundation of morale and needs that drives them, and then lets you try and survive in an open sandbox in Texas.Scavenge, deal with zombies, deal with friendly and hostile survivors, try to satisfy the needs of your community - those are the basic imperatives of the game.People interact with you, there are branching conversations - a very significant amount of dialogue.On the downside is that some elements feel a little unpolished.I find the combat to be fun and tense, and the environments you nervously scavenge through to be beautifully drawn .. but the combat mechanics themselves feel a tad simple and unpolished.  People have complained about lack of stealth, cover .. and yeah, I agree - there are some of the tactical systems in the game that could use a second look.What would that achieve ? It would take a GREAT game and make it a WONDERFUL game.Game is still very good in it's present state, I recommend it.			"

												For those who are into zombie-apocalypse games, this game is a welcome new addition. You survive a plane crash and are taken to a shelter which you must lead. The goal of this game is simple: survive. Every day will be a struggle - there are many threats in this apocalyptic world of Splendid, Texas. Not so splendid anymore.The game is both a Fallout-like RPG as well as a turn based management game. You are in charge of managing a shelter which means gathering food, building upgrades such as fences to keep zombies out, finding survivors who may be able to help you get to safety, and dealing with crisis events such as a gang threatening to destroy your shelter. Each survivor has different areas in which they contribute to shelter management and it's up to you to manage the resources. In addition, there are conflicts and events that happen every day and it's up to you to deal with them.If you know Fallout's combat system, then you will know Dead State's combat. All in all the combat is relatively easy - but there are a few encounters where you will literally be in war against a small army of guys equipped with military gear and assault weapons so don't take everything for granted.The looting can get repetitive - it's pretty much kill everything, search containers, grab as much as you can and clear area. Combat is *usually* very easy, but there are modes this game has that will make it oh so much harder. And also, be very careful of what you say to fellow survivors. It takes just one bad statement to make them absolutely hate you. But this is a stressful time, after all. There's an achievement for rescuing all the survivors - some found randomly. All in all, it's a good game, and I recommend it. 7.5/10.			"

												So apparently, zombies are faster, have more powerful attacks, and have a better chance of hitting you than you do of hitting them. No matter who you select for your first party, its like watching the three stooges try to fight the undead. Miss, miss, miss, get eaten.Zombies can also sense you if you are directly behind them. No sneaking allowed.Also, they have 9 action points, which is as much or more than your starting party members. Which means they can shuffle much further than you can move, while apparently getting free or almost free attacks, which is infinitely better than the 3-8 AP required to attack them.All of this topped off with the fact that your weapons hit them for 7-25 damage, up to about 50 with the sledgehammer. This is out of a 50ish HP pool they have. Top that with the fact that they can hit you with anywhere from 7-62(?!?!?!?!) HP, after shuffling as far as you could move, out of your 90-110 HP pool.In a nutshell:-can't tank them-can't kite them-can't evade them-can't sneak past them-must rely on luck to beat them-if you don't outnumber them 2 or 3 to 1, it has a high probability of a loss.When the devs manage to botch what I heard was a good game before ""Reanimated"", they're pretty bad at their jobs. Instead of increasing zombie count or something to make it harder to just sneak up on all of the zombies, they made them super-zombie killjoys. 3 party members vs 3 zombies, one of the party members being a COP (you know, trained to use force against violent, unpredictable subjects) and a member speced to be a melee monster. All 3 die. Why? Because bad game.Un-**** your game, devs.			"

												This game rocks! I had been following the game and reading the reviews for quite some time but was not completely sold on it yet. I downloaded the demo and enjoyed it, so I added it to my wishlist and figured I would wait for a sale. I lasted about a day and then broke down and bought the game at full price. I love it!It reminds me of Jagged Alliance 2 with way better character development and zombies. I am more of a casual game player and enjoy a good story with consequences, this game kept me wanting more and made me stop and think about every choice I made.I have only played through it once, nearly 60 hours, and I have not even come close to discovering all this game has to offer. I highly recommend this game to those that enjoy The Walking Dead tv series too. I was faced with many issues that were similar to what they had to deal with on that show.Kudos to the game makers of Dead State - job well done!!!			"

So many people saying the game's unplayable and stuff.Then I get the Demo, which DIDN'T work on my PC, and lagged beyond repair on my laptop (looked like low-framerate).BUT!!!!I was told to play the game in Windows 7 Compatibility and IT WORKED!I think the game itself is fantastic! I've played through a few days, and counting (please, no spoilers).The gameplay is kinda strange to get used to, but so are all the greats :DAbsolutely everything I think you could want in a Zombie RPG - great storyline, interactive characters, levelling system, multiple choice part-linear part free-roam storyline, and obviously, zombies!IF ANYONE READS THIS - THE GAME'S AWESOME! 5/5			"

												This is one of my favorite games. I love what they did here with their approach to survivor management. So much fun to recruit, utilize, and manage so many personalities. The conflict and the factions set up throughout the game kept me engaged and wanting more.Admittedly, there's far too much combat that gets far too repetitive over time and the inventory management is a complete drag once you have seen all of the item variations a few times. Playing in iron mode is cool in concept, but this game is far too long for me to risk losing all of my progress based on a few bad rolls. If consequences were less immediately dire or potentially game ending, I'd hop on it in a second. I was fine with losing some people through story events or even in combat late in the game once it was clear that I'd be able to finish it. The ending was disappointingly sparse on how the characters made out, but the journey there was well worth while to engage with them on the way.Crazy fun. Want more.			"

												Dead State can best be described as Walking Dead Meets Fallout. With Brian Mitsoda of Vampire The Masquerade, this story driven game will let you decide if you are either a LaMOE or a Crusoe in this zombie shelter game. The story takes place shortly after you wake up in the middle of a world that has gone to hell in Texas. After the cops found you and stitched you up along with two other survivors. You are tasked with at first making sure the shelter doesn't fall apart and take responsibility for the people that you choose to bring into the Shelter and make sure they have enough fuel, food and parts to get through each day in one piece.As a zombie shelter game, there is notably less ""railroad"" situations where you will ineveitably lose allies. Theoretically you can end the game with every survivor alive and well when you finish the game unlike in State of Decay which ineveitably have you lose people to the zombies wherever you like it or not. That said, it's freeform so you can choose to be the few beacons of hope in a bleak genre or choose to bring out the worst in humanity as you kill those that are useless. Leave survivors to die or do internal purges after a mutiny by sending any member who was loyal to the mutineer to a suicidal march.Combat wise the game plays like Fallout and Wasteland, an AP system that allows you to move and engage your enemy with a diverse perk system that gives you your own perks as well as other members of the shelter who have their own contributing abilities to the shelter.The cast of survivor is a colorful mix from old war veterans, to an geek who uses the Fremen Battlecry or the avatar of Brian Mitsoda himself. Picking which survivor to come with you is important as some are illsuited for battle while others have limits to how far their moral compass will bend. A hint to know if your survivor has no qualms beign raiders is their attitude in combats. The more rough ones swear like a Borderlands player character and makes a nice addition to your motley crew of survivors.Replayability sadly is lacking, while i had reservations about playing it again the lack of fulfillment in some endings have made me think otherwise for a great zombie shelter game.Overrall I recommend this game for those who want their zombie survival fix.

												Dead State is... Let us say, a strangely designed game. When you start to play it, for the first few hours, it is very interesting and engaging, if you, like me, can disregard very outdated graphics, somewhat clumsy interface and occasional bugs.At first, survival feels really hard. Every day, yout scavenging party goes out to find food and fuel, and usually can just about bring enough of both back to prevent Shelter from dying outright, but not enough to feel safe. It's a real struggle and it feels interesting. Even more interesting are dialogues with your fellow survivours.Unfortunately, it seems that time or other constraints prevented DoubleBear team from really completing this product. When you finally find horses that allow for faster travel (and, therefore, for two expeditions per day!), you beging to gather more food than strictly necessary for survival. At this point, the second part of the game should begin, but it doesn't. Most of the important events are tied only to day number, not your actions. And since survival is no longer a day-to-day concern, you start to feel bored from clearing same-looking supermarkets, houses and camps.The problem is compounded by many bugs in many scripts. People do not notice completed quests (thankfully, this mostly goes only for minor tasks). People disregard events that already happened. People give you information about locations you have already visited. The worst moment, however, came when one game faction reportedly wiped another, but when I came to their old site, they were there, along with a duplicate of character that came to Shelter with the news of disaster!The ending, when it comes, seems rarther aburpt. There are a number of endings, some of them more anti-climactic than others, but I must say I'm not very satisfied with them.A few words about combat. It's not particulary good, but it's not particulary bad, either. The dead stop being a serious threat quite soon, but armed people remain a problem nearly to the very end, especially in large numbers. AI is bad, but it doesn't matter too much. (And at least it's better than in JA: Flashback). I'd say the combat is on the par with Wasteland 2, which is not saying much, but it's not awful.Despite everything, I had fun with this game. I liked exploration and texts, even when they were bugged.  I wouldn not recommend it for everybody, though. You have to be tolerant of crashes (fortunately, quicksave is VERY quick!) and bad graphics. Still, I feel like a lot of love was put into it, and it shows, even if the end product is somewhat mishappen.I'd say you should wait for patches, but so far there was only one, and with the number of crashes, I'd expect the developers would try to hurry with fixing at least a few of them, so I do not have high hopes. Still, even with all the bugs, I managed to finish the game, so at least it's better in that respect than pre-patch Arcanum was :)			"

												This game could have been one of the best ever. It has flaws typical of a low budget, indie production, despite that I couldnt stop playing. I don't like the game engine to be honest, the graphics/textures are not that good, but at the same time it has little nice details like seeing what you equip. The management part is very nice and so are most of the dialogues but it's the combat that'll take most of your time. It could be better with something like an overwatch system, a real initiative system, STEALTH... No it's mostly random misses and avoiding agro. With better combat this game had a formula to surpass XCom! But don't get me wrong, it's still awesome to go scavenge for goods and see looters run into zombies!The tutorials are too short, and I was googling alot of details, had no problems but a more casual player can feel in the dark about some things. Though it's a game that its clearly worth a try.			"

												Not sure when they changed this game to Dead State: Reanimated (which is a major overhaul of the apparently bugged original version), but most of the concerns I've read about in the negative reviews have been fixed. At least, I haven't run into anything majorly buggy or badly implemented. My one ""concern"" is that items that have stacked together can't be split (or at least I haven't figured out how to do this). Example: I have two fishing poles on my main character, but can't give one to an NPC because they're stacked together. It's pretty minor in the big scheme of things. For some other items it's a slightly bigger annoyance (ammo for example), but overal it doesn't detract too much from my gaming experience.I've been hooked on this game since I got it about two weeks ago and don't see that changing for a while yet. I duly recommend this game.			"

												Dead State is a great turn based game with a hardcore survival aspect to it. You have to recruit as many people as you can while you feed them and equip them for the hard times ahead. You also build up your base AKA the school and there are tons of upgrades for your school from a chicken coop, garage, farm and so much more. The part that most people complain about is they cant keep people happy or other stupid morale problems they may have(they lack people skillz). Just like in real life not every one you have in your town will see eye to eye about certain topics because the game is gonna throw a lot of random events at you that you need to deal with to make some people happy or even angry with you. There is perma-death if you are sloppy and get one of your guys surrounded and 3 or 4 zombies drop down on him for a quick snack you can beat he is getting back up but not as a human. Other complains I have read is that people think this is an alpha but your wrong the developers love this game and you can tell because they are always updating and fixing bugs for you. Come on they just released a nice update not to long ago and some companies would have made it a DLC but not these guys. There is also crafting, anything from armor, weapons, and even upgrades for your car once you get there. On top of that your played character is fully customizable from the way he looks to what kind of skills he/she has. You want to be a medic sure, you want to be a bad a$$ with a sledge hammer max melee skill, computers, gun skill, and a ton more. I have 86+ hours and I still haven't cleared out all of the areas on the map and even the map will throw random events at you. If you like zombies turn based hardcore survival games this will be right up your alley. This screenshot is just a taste of all the thing you have to do in 1 day to make sure sh$t doesn't hit the fan.http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/46505482712255338/9C4AD90CA32930F607A8FF14229CD4C93F55E3BB/And your people can only carry a certain amount of weight so deciding what items you need are crucial for your survival.

												First things first: Just like anchovies or hot sauce, THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.  TRY THE DEMO BEFORE YOU BUY.  The demo will give you a good feel of whether you will like the full game.	Even though I hit the ""Yes, I would recommend,"" button—this is more of a mixed review. (I wish there was a middle option.)  Dead State requires deep thought and sometimes a touch of research.  There is more than one way to play—but you have to figure them out.  Although I personally liked going back to get my stats just right for my personal play style in the demo, not everyone will enjoy doing so.  This is not meant to be an easy game for those that want to just smash up some zombies for an adrenaline rush and gore fest. The game isn't something I'd recommend for the player that just wants to have some easy fun.  It is quite the opposite.	The game isn't very forgiving of mistakes and the right answer isn't simply handed to you.  Options are limited, negatives for the team are abundant and the player character is the only fully customizable ally.  You're forced to work with what you get, even the other survivors.  There is no “hone my skills to perfection by grinding first” easy button.  This game is meant to intrigue your mind and push your planning abilities.  For those hard core players that want to nitpick the details and get things just right, I'd say download the demo and dive in.  The save files even carry over from the demo.			"

												Dead State.  What really should be an indie darling hasn't quite managed to come into it's own.  Let me clarify: the game is interesting, challenging and, depending on your definition, fun.  What I consider the core issue is that it was built with the same engine powering Age of Decadence.  Why is this important?  Well, Age of Decadence is a rather unique RPG and it's engine was tailored for what it offers.  Since Dead State is a more traditional SRPG I don't think this engine choice has really done it any favors.  Add onto that a shoestring budget and you have a game that can't quite meet it's own aspirations.  Like directing a B-movie you decide where to sacrifice to realize your project and I fear Dead State may have sacrificed too much.Before I get into why, I must explain why I recommend this game: If you are looking for a more classical take on zombie survival that takes its cues from pen and paper role-playing experiences with a heavy emphasis on character interaction there's a good chance this one is going to be memorable to you.  And for that alone I can give it a strong recommendation.  It isn't a bad game and it stands in opposition to every zombie game that focuses on little more than re-killing them.So why the longer review?  Largely because my recommendation matters only if you understand at it's core it's a budget product and it shows through in every single place you look.  Combat, for example, is fine if you imagine it like a board game (it plays like one) and use your imagination, but everything feels so static many things would be more compelling in a book: ""The zombie lunges for your throat!  Luckily you push it aside!""  The game is a very spartan affair with simple animation and a barebones audioscape.  While you undoubtedly get into situations that will feel genuinely tense: it's because the premise is done very well and not because it has compelling on-screen activity.That may not bother you at all but for me it's hard to get past when larger issues arise in the continuity and premise.  Many things are presented so matter-of-factly, completely accepted and moved on from without any involvement from the player despite the emphasis on character interaction.  In a story-focused and character-driven narrative this is hard to overlook.  Take the very premise of gameplay: you run the shelter. Sweet, but while you very well may be a competent leader, it's handed to you with nary an objection or conversation despite being just some person they rescued from a plane crash.  The shelter is already established, everyone already knows each other and you are the total stranger.  Yet they immediately hand you the keys and let/ask you manage it.  You can literally ask people, ""What can I get you to make life easier around here?"" immediately after waking up from a head wound! You've yet to come to terms with the plane crash, let alone the strangers explaining everyone is now flesh hungry monsters who only want to kill and eat and your first activity is to get out of bed and build a fence?  Where's the character building here?  It's a classic case of reading the script and all the characters are in on it, this isn't a living intro: it assumes you know the plot of the game and provides an intro to hand wave off your history.  Nothing more.Yes, this is somewhat moot once the game opens up A LOT in the following days and it hardly ruins everything but it strips a lot of personal motivations from you.  You might be the main character, but your motivations are not just at the behest of the writer: you're expected to co-opt them wholesale without the game bothering to give you a chance to justify them to yourself.  For example, if the shelter was being run so poorly you NEEDED to be the leader, or the previous leader was a scheming psychopath or even if you just STARTED OUT as a member of the shelter during their first night, fine, but there is at least one if not TWO or THREE characters with leadership characteristics there when you wake up and yet they concede their positions immediately.  I hate to get so caught up on this but it really did bother me.I could easily dive into more criticisms like these but it really is a matter of engine and budget.  If you know the history of the project and engine, this is likely the best Double Bear could do with what they had.  It is a refreshing entry in both the RPG and zombie genres, framed from the perspective of the people surviving and their relationships, but its presentation makes it feel ten years out of date and the mechanics don't make up for that.  While I recommend it, you need to know what you are getting into beforehand.			"

												Oh my god.I'm really disappointed of this game. Basically the mixture of rpg, survival and round-based strategy is a nice idea but there are some clouds covering the sun here.I'm not talking about the grafics which are okay but about some big design problems. The menus are far away from intuitive. it takes hours to manage your inventory ♥♥♥♥. Sometimes I feel like doing my taxes instead of playing a game.The game is also sometimes annoyingly complicated. After the first mission I searched for a place to sleep for 10 minutes. I clicked right and left on every bed until I finally found THE ONE I could sleep in. What is the point ???Even if the game is so ""realistic"" that you don't want to sleep into someone else's bed - it could give you a hint like ""I want to sleep in my bed"" I seriously thought this is a bug.In the fights your are always surprised. I mean the game shows you a perfect straight street on a sunny day and you're strolling around with your party and suddenly 5 zombies appear in front of you ! Have they been invisible ? Can everyone in your party only look into 5 meters distance ? Same counts for weapon range. I can throw my keyboard farther than these guns can shoot.Best joke is to heal somebody. I was wounded and found a complete, full medkit. Nevertheless I could not heal myself because you need to put the contents of the medkit into your medic satchel to heal someone. Imagine this: "" doc ! doc ! help me!""      ""I can't I have to put the bandages in my special purse first!""In conclusion: Nice idea - terrible implementation.    5 of 10 stars. "

												I've put a lot of time in on this game, I was one of the kick starter backers who wanted to believe but was soemwhat jaded on the promised returns even at that time. The Truth: This is an old school isometric RPG and is faithful to that lineage. It is hard as balls (unless you want to save scum) it's not terribly intuitive to start,  and the graphics evoke a very specific ""little bit dated"" style.Now with all that said, if you are the sort of person that has fond memories of about fallout 1 and 2. The Baldur's gate series and a host of others in that game you are going to like it. You've been weened on hardship and know how to savor when things finally come together after the sting of perhaps some very bitter defeats.The Good: The game is a faithful re-imagining of old school iso RPG's. Yes it trades on a lot of nostalgia but there is also a lot of solid game play and interaction here. There is a wealth of stuff to explore  and characters to balance out and it feels like you have quite a bit of freedom to grow. You can pour hours into this game and have extremely knife edge victories against serious odds. The crisis events and other things pressed on you are interesting and add a definite personality management aspect.The bad: The games interface is clunky, inventory management is a PITA (pro-tip you can manage ally inventory fromt he main shelter inventory, not just your own). Likewise it really really needed a means to check an ally's overall stats from the main shelter screen. I suspect this was an intentional design decision but it hurts the game more then it helps my immersion. Poor combat scaling: Don't get me wrong I like that if you bring a knife to a gun fight you'll get your butt kicked but on the other hand melee feels really under whelming even when you've crossed the distance through the hail of gun fire. Conversely guns start out awesome and just stay that way sans noise and ammo concerns. Lastly the game really really needs (and at least thus far I havn't found) some sort of trading mechanic to get goods you need for stuff you have a surplus of. I've got arrows, bolts, and certain types of ammo coming out of my ears but so far have found a grand total of one stick of deoderant and one box of sleeping pills.The final verdict: If you have the patience for a bit harder experience then seems to get mass produced in some of the hand holding games today you will get a fantastic return on investment from this game, well worth the 30 bucks or less if it's on sale. If you don't then you will probably end up not liking it. "

												Let me start with this, I have owned this game since it came out because I love the concept of it. I started playing at the initial release, but I did not get into the game because, quite frankly, I was overwhelmed by its complexity. I tried again a couple months later, but still did not get into it. I saw that the Reanimated edition was released and finally dug into the game, giving it the time it deserved. I can now say that I love this game and am 100% addicted to it!This game is complex, difficult, and so SO rewarding. It's been said before, but this game is basically Fallout 1&2 plus X-Com plus Walking Dead. And this combo works so amazing! Sure it is not perfect, and could use a little more polish, but the game is so much more than the sum of all parts and is one of the best gaming experiences I had in years.The negative reviews on Steam seem to all complain about the morale system and/or the bugs. I can't really speak to how the game was before the Reanimated edition, but I will say there was only 1 bug that I ran into. It was a dialogue bug that happened during a random encounter, where the guy I knocked out was talking the same text as he said when the fight started. I hit him one more time with my bat to kill him and that solved that problem... I didn't see any other bugs, which is impressive considering the scope of this game.As far as morale... this is the end of the world! It is supposed to be difficult to keep a group together. I struggled through at first and had to make some rough choices about whether to kick people out of my group or not (which I did). But as you progress, it is possible for you to make things work. Overcoming these obstacles is so much more rewarding.  The people that complain about morale are essentially saying the game is too hard, the end of the world isn't meant to be easy and I wouldn't have it any other way.In closing, don't let the negative reviews keep you from trying this game. At the least, download the demo and dedicate enough time to it so that you understand what this game is all about. Once you do, you will find a gem of a game that you'll love and find nearly impossible to put down.			"

												After having kickstarted then played through this game nearly three times in various phases of developement I'm amazed this title still sits as ""mostly positive"". I imagine that a lot of the negative or neutral reviews came in while this game was still in developement- the occaisional crashes, corrupt savegames, noise radius, and other issues have largely been hammered out (my last playthrough of over 120 hours contained none of these issues to memory). This is a great game. Comparatively on the level of the first 2 fallout games - there's a deep crafting tree, a large amount of replayability from the skill tree/dialogues/npc interactions. You play as the lone survivor of an ill fated plane in Texas in the opening weeks of a zombie apocalypse engulfing the world. Boarded up in a school with a handful of other survivors from various walks of life it quickly engulfs the player in the tasks of figuring out basic needs in the new world (security, food, fuel, medicine) while also providing the unique challenge of managing your survivors' happiness and other needs. There will be conflicts that arise both internal and external amongst your group and every NPC that you come across will stretch your party's abilities as well as its needs. As a result, especially on the harder modes- which is the best experience, in my opinion, you will be forced to make decisions regarding what new members bring to the group versus the resources they consume and potential conflicts they bring. The dialogue, of which there is a good amount of, is well written and each of the many NPCs have well written backstories, motivations, and unique needs.   Tied in with the NPC interactions are a series of events that occur- some random, others timed, that move the story forward as well as challenge your settlement. Ultimately, this is a game that moves past the traditional RPG/survival genres to ask the player how they would treat others in such a scenario. This topic is also examined in various lights by your NPCs with their backstories and actions. Aside from being a well made, polished, and excellently written game there's one thing that I've cited as a reason to purchase this game- choice and causation. Rarely in games are there cascading events where one choice by the player leads to both scripted and unscripted outcomes that were unforseen. To be more clear, each playthrough of mine has brought about events and outcomes where ""savescum"" tactics would not work because your choices and outcomes were determined hours or days ago. This game provides a multitude of such occurances. It's hard to explain how glorious this is without having played the game suffice it to say that those that appreciate the ""what ifs"" will play through the game at least a second time.  TL;DR: Played through game 3 times since early developement. Worth the price at $60. Buy it if you have any appreciation for survival/rpg/writing. Watch for this studio's future releases- this is an excellent and so far, it seems, underappreciated game.			"

												Combat is taking an important place in Dead State and sadly, gameplay is very lacking in this regard.Although it's very close to what Age of Decadence (which I liked), somehow here, it feels boring.Music didn't help, I just want to throw my computer out of the window listening to it -_-Conceptually Dead State is still good, the first attemtp of a A-RPG at a zombie outbreak, enough char customisation to satisfy your anyone's taste, with handfull number of perks.But in the end, you'll find the game to be very repetitive, without any mechanic holding you to play it.What it needs is real base assaults, real hordes of zombies invading maps at random, better combat mechanics with much more options for weapons (targeting heads etc.)And then it could become interesting on the long run.

The combat is fun with just a few minor glithches, but what do you expect with a just released game, I've been playing since the pre-alpha and have loved every moment of this game since I was first told about it.

												I've followed this game before I even bought it and I'm pretty happy with the content, I've played this game from beta 4 until release. There is still room for improvement and the Devs see it and will update the game as time goes on. The combat in the game is turn based, if you are careful you can avoid combat completely. The NPC interaction is what I really like, I hope they add more personal quests and crisis moments. I'd also like to see more base upgrades and research, and interaction/events once you get the upgrades. With so many people at the base late game there should more options to allocate the survivors and missions/crisis tied to those.In the future this game could be a 10/10, right now it is a 7.5/10 for me. ***SOME POSSIBLE SPOILERS** The best moment for me so far was when I was on a scavenger mission with fresh survivors, I walked into a downtown area, it looked looted so I decided to proceed with caution. While my team was looting I decided to send one of the survivors to scout the area... and then I saw it... the park...  shards of metal everywhere and what looked like an elderly woman and a man impaled to the benches, I quickly gathered my team, but it was too late a heavily armed raider group got the drop on us. They knocked down the scout nearly killing her, I rushed the rest of my crew over to save her life. Fire, metal and blood, flew through the evening sky, my combat medic rushed over and secured the downed survivor.Things looked like they were changing... then the boss came out. Our pistols and bats did little to slow him down, and we were surrounded. I suddenly remembered my melee specialist was holding on to an assault rifle and my ranger happened to have the ammo, we were able to take out the raiders one by one, my melee specialist picked up a shield off a dead raider and rushed over to deflect incoming fire while the scout and medic found cover, my ranger managed to pick off the last raider, and we managed to walk away with no casualties, hardened by the experience and the new equipment.

												I slacker backed Dead State.  I then promptly forgot about it.  So I only started playing around the time Patch 4 came out.  So I started from then.Warning - This is a game that will be somewhat ruined by reading Wiki's first.  Allies have stories, and sometimes they can be unpleasant.  If you cheat and read about it in advance, you will lose a lot of the enjoyment in the game.Gameplay - Interaction.  There is a lot of interaction between you and the ""Allies"" it adds a lot of flavour, and lets you like and dislike the allies.  The Events are pretty regular, and generally pretty interesting. It can be a little repetitive, and hard to know when something new is available to talk about.Non-Allies.  I don't know if I am doing something wrong, but every survivor group I meet seems to attack me.  Sometimes I miss the warning messages in the bottom left of the screen, which means I keep goign when someone has warned me off.It would be nice if there were more groups willing to trade with your group, but not join.Gameplay - Combat.   Combat is quite a simple turn based affair.  There is some complexity with it, in that you do have a reasonable selections of weapons, there are several tactics that can be used in different circumstances etc.   Important to not however the Zombies are not the true danger in this game.  It is the living survivors who will try and kill you.  Zombies quickly become easy kills once you work out how to avoid notice and whittle them down.  They can still be dangerous in numbers of course, and if your allies get bitten they can be infected, but overall they are not a great concern.  Some of the complexity comes into drawing enemies into each othrer. Throwing a fire cracker to attract any Z nearby right into the middle of a group of violent looters. Fun.And the gun toting loonies aren't easy either.  Well at least not the first time you meet them.  Once you have some better gear it becomes less of a challenge.Bugs. - I haven't come across any game breakers.I did get the pleasnt oaks hostile email howerver.Overall I am loving this game.  I recommend it.			"

												Dead state the game with potential that just simply falls short.When i first saw this game i thought it would be a great game with micromanagable features to make everyones experience different and in a way it is but there is so much that is missing in this game to make it really great. First of all if you are buying this game hoping for a breeze then you are FAR FROM IT. This game is challenging. Not just challenging but almost unplayable at points due to the general difficulty right from the start. Now i played this on its base difficulty with no \""iron man\"" or \""survivor\"" options enabled and this game is still ridiculously hard. Don\'t get me wrong. I love a good challenging game, it makes me feel alive and puts me to the test. But this game takes it way too far as after a good 9 hours gameplay i still feel so weak against everything. I had 3 fully equiped survivors out on a mission but we got stuck in a room and only one could fight at a time meaning that the endless horde of zombies waiting very politely outside the door ended up getting the better of me ONE BY ONE.  Not only is it hard when it is supposed to be but the features it lacks makes it even more fustrating. Want your guys to take cover behind an obstacle to avoid missle fire? Nope. Want to climb on top of a nearby building to escape a zombie horde? Nope. Want to simply trade an item within your shelter to a friendly survivor? Nope. These are just many of the infuriating events that can occur to you and happened to me basically every event. However this game isn\'t all bad. If you feel inclined to challenge yourself to the point you regretably put a hole through your monitor than be my guest because this game has so much to it and can be so much more. I just think that for a \""survival strategy\"" there has to be some element of strategy other than just luck and using the right weapon. Unfortunately the good outweighs the bad for this one so i simply can\'t recommend :(			"

												Overall a fun game, I haven't finished it yet, but I'm at the point where there is no challenge.  It blends a few concepts well, and while I found the game overall very fun, I do have a few issues that I think keep it from being great.  I may not play it again, but I would definitely be interested in a sequel or the same concepts taken in another direction.  If you combined most of the concepts of Dead State and State of Decay into a 4x, I think it would be a very interesting game.7/10 ++Map design, can't say enough about this, it truely feels like you're living in a zombie apocalypse.  From the wrecked cars, ransacked stores and homes, trails of blood, graffiti on the walls warning of zombie inhabitants, to the somber reality that many will simply take their own lives in their houses with their loved ones.  Double bear did a great job setting the environment++Moral choices, did a great job here.  You have several dialog choices, when I made my decision it seemed to be something I would say in that situation.  NPC's that join your shelter will remember dialog choices you've made with them and bring them up in future conversations+Crisis and random keep it interesting, hostile human NPC's can be turned against zombies--Game is to easy, once you get past the first few days, other humans are the only real competition.  They are easily avoided, or distracted, and you can come back later and whipe them out with better equipment--Item durability, nothing breaks, leaving you with stacks of items and weapons.  You can recycle them in later stages for parts, but I prefer a more realistic game and would like things to break and have value--Useless items, there's a large variety of weapons and items, but I spent 80% of the game using aluminum bats.  Zombie s would die in two hits and most humans were no problem, even if they had guns.-Micromanagement is pretty bad starting off, but gets a little better.  It gets annoying having to run to the storeroom to swap items, the job board to assign tasks, and the exit zone of the shelter to reach the map-Map is stagnant, no roaming hordes of humans or zombies, once you clear an area you have no reason to return- "

												As the description noted - inspiration drawn from XCom, Fallout and Suikoden (or even Jagged Alliance)  - but in my humble opinion it is a very basic game, simplified and it could have been made better. I'm guessing that the devs felt the contraints of having this game done (not to forget depleting finances) and thus released in the words of the few ""half-a***d"" title. They did release a working title but of course not without its bad apples (numerous of them). Now for a quick review.Likes:* Good concept (although I'm yet to see a zombie themed turn based strat game at equal of the mentioned titles above) * Gameplay - it's just okay not the best or even great lets just put it - very simple.* Content - the dialogues/script could've been improved. They should have worked on this - it would have been the selling point of the title.Dislikes:* Balancing and gameplay issues - consumers will notice this immediately without even putting long hours * Path finding issues and over simplified combat system - this could've have been made better as I said too simple (no crouching nor scaling its like playing pacman... so flat)* Graphics and sounds - its forgiveable but yea.... I actually turn my sounds off and in windowed mode since the graphics is not the best. * Bugs - it does load, save and having logged in 14 hrs its not actually that long that players will ... well look for another.Out of 5 stars this would have been a 2.5 or even a 2, I would wait out till they fix the bugs or release a patch.

												Dead State, is a great game. It uses an isometric view, turn based combat and base building/management NPC interaction system.The plot has so far been excellent, with well written background stories for NPCs. The dialogue, and the interaction really makes you feel like you're dealing with the daily problems of life in the apocalypse. You must scavenge for supplies, repair your base, and upgrade it, But you have to deal with the people you care for as well. Keeping up moral, finding personal items they need, while assigning them tasks and job schedules around the base.The interface at first seems abit clunky, but took me very little time to get used to it. The sound & graphics, while not cutting-edge, are done very nicely. One thing I'd really like to point out, is the areas you visit while looking for supplies or running errands. Every map area, tells a story if you look. Very impressively done, for example I was looting a local neighborhood and every house every block, you could see the damage or the carnage and piece together what happened there. A car slammed into a power-pole, the trail of blood as the driver tried to escape to a house... The door smashed, his body half devoured in the doorway ! Just little stuff like that seriously adds to the ambience, and feel of the game's setting.I also would like to point out the leveling and skill system, is well done. You really do get the feeling that each level is really going to help you survive. You don't have to reach level X before you can survive on your own ; each of level you gain does give you the sense of accomplishment. And so far most skills, that I've gained/used have a purpose, have a use that just might keep you out of the hands of the Dead for just another day...The bad... The game does have some bugs. I haven't really experienced anything to severe, or to frequent to prevent me from playing on. So far I crashed once, loading a save-game. Just once, and reloading the game and reloading the save went fine on the next attempt. I know there are some odd dialogue mix ups that others have had an issue with ; But so far I have not.Over all, a well done game that is enjoyable.			"

												Dead State often gets compared to Fallout but I think that's unfair to both games. It doesn't have Fallout's dark humour or intricate combat system but what it does have is a fairly complex shelter management simulator. Basically the game is about managing your squad, your resources, your shelter upgrades, and all the survivors who are working in the shelter when you go on scavenging runs (including the shelters overall morale and each survivor's individual mood).A fairer comparisson would be State of Decay or Jagged Alliance 2 (the original). The game isn't about your character surviving in a post apocolyptic world but about a group trying to scrape by in one. The turn based tactical battles are not an end in themselves, they're mearly a way to get more food, fuel, parts and medicine so your shelter can survive longer. Your character levels up but you have no personal goals: it's all about keeping the others happy, alive and away from each other's throats.If you liked State of Decay (but thought it'd be better as a turn based strategy) or loved Jagged Alliance 2 (but wished it had zombies) then this could very well be the game for you.

												well... Yes, i do recommend this game to any casual player looking for some casual experience in a game featuring things as  named in its description and shown on screenshots and in videos. Like turn-based combat, zombies, bandits, survival etc.On the other hand, i'm anything but one feeling like ready to offer a competent judgement on this game's potential as a turn-based one, or compare it to any other tb game, as i prefere real time action. It turned out to be interesting enough  for me to play tho, and i'll definitely give it a couple more attempts (My 1st playthrough was on full hard settings, and i haven't gone too far (it's bound here to how long your main character survives). Failed to collect enough antibiotics and died of infection:).About 7\10 overall, a good game.			"

								I don't think i would buy this given a redo. The level up system sucks. And it gets really repetative. Maybe once it is out of beta it will be more enjoyable. I would really like to see the level up system change but i doubt it will happen.			"

												Dead State is a survival/horror RPG with strong base-building elements set in the zombie apocalypse. (Think Fallout Tactics but open-ended with a strategic/resource management layer). As the elected leader of a small group of survivors, you must go on runs for supplies, locate and rescue other survivors, allocate resources and gradually build up your shelter from a bare-bones school into a fortified complex. You must constantly deal with not only the hordes of walking dead, but perhaps more importantly, the living, who in many cases are even more dangerous. Everyone you find has their own story, their own motivations, priorities, and attitude towards life and what is happening out in the world. As your shelter and group grows in size and reputation, people will eventually begin coming to you, leaving you with a choice as to how to deal with them. Letting in everyone may seem like a good idea, but eventually you will have to deal with the personality conflicts that arise between certain members of your group. Threats to your survival will arise both from the outside and from inside the shelter itself, forcing you to make tough, black-or-white decisions about how to deal with them. Food shortages, supply shortages, morale problems, and epidemics of disease are daily specters. Do a bad job in dealing with these issues, and other strong-willed members of the group may decide to challenge your leadership, putting you at risk of being thrown out of your own shelter.Combat is squad-based, turn-based, and tactical. Traveling to any of the game's many scattered locations to scavenge for supplies invariably results in hostile encounters with the both walking dead and rival groups of hostile scavengers or survivors. Each member of your group has a specific set of skills that may make them suitable as a melee fighter, ranged combatant, or combat medic, and it is up to you to equip and assemble your squad with those things in mind, using whatever weapons, armor, equipment and medical supplies you have managed to scrounge or manufacture. The pros and cons of various weapons and armor, the layout of external obstacles and the internals of buildings, and proper noise management all play into getting your scavenging team in and out of dangerous situations alive and, hopefully, with backpacks full of badly-needed loot.The game does have some interface and gameplay issues, and there have been alot of reports from users about crashes as well as glitches and bugs ranging from annoying to game-breaking throughout the game's release history. Personally, at 60 hours/50 game days in, I have not encountered anything more than a few minor glitches that, while annoying, have not seriously impacted my gameplay, in addition to a few isolated crashes. Luckily, the devs wisely included an automated bug-reporting tool with the full game that will allow you to notify them whenever there is a crash. I would advise anyone who buys the game to backup your save files just in case something catastrophic happens. I will admit that the game could use a few more updates, in my opinion, but more in terms of things to be added or modified rather than fixed outright. Overall I feel that the basic mechanics of the game are solid, providing a compelling and realistic simulation of trying to lead a group of survivors through the zombie apocalypse. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys open-ended RPGs or turn-based strategy games.			"

												The game is amazing.  There are some bugs and glitches that you should be aware of but I'm a month of game time in and it is not interupting game play very much.  Nothing catastrophic, just annoying.  The game reminds me of Jagged Alliance set in a zombie-pocalypse.  It's all about tactical exploration and combat intermixed with managing peoples relationships in a no-holds barred sort of way, improving your shelter, assigning the right jobs to the right people and listening to a rambling DJ (I hope I get to meet him one day).  Try the demo and then buy the game.			"

So much thing can happen even you can already predict what's going to happen. My first play throught are somewhat a failure. I was killed by crippled Davis on day 31. Damn I really enjoy the game. I will definitely recommend this to those who loves turn-base combat :)Guess i'm going to take a day or two off from the game and starts another one. Pros:- lots of NPC can be obtained and it is pretty random.- Random pop places for scavenge or meetup are really random- Various kind of weapons and armorCons:- background music can somewhat become annoying- there's no way to skip enemy's turnI'll update again as I play more.

												Even when it has some bugs (enemies shooting through walls, enemies passing through walls for example) after near 70 hours of gameplay and having ended the game i just can recommed the game to everyone into RPGs and Zombies. This is not a zombie bashing game, its a survival experience, where you manage and develop your own community of survivors, with all the social and survival problems. Social aspect of the game is not very developed, and in the end it becomes very easy (once you have a good set of weapons and armor zombies are a joke). Game ended at day 85 but i didnt have anything else to do since day 79.Anyway, as i said, its a good game that can keep you entertained for several hours. Its not the definitve zombie game, but fans of RPGs, turn combat based games (not as good as X-com) will enjoy it.			"

Early Access Review
								Early Access Review:Single Player, Turn based, isometric, dialog heavy RPG, with resource management, a world map with near a hundred tactical locations on it and a central hub/base which can be upgraded.Plays a lot like if Fallout 1/2 & Jagged Alliance 1/2 gameplay were mixed with Walking Dead's story. Also reminded me of State of Decay, but with turn based combat instead of 3rd person realtime, in that it focuses heavily on upgrading a shelter, scavenging and dealing with NPC allies along with external threats. Dead State is centered around the ""Shelter"", a school that the player's allies have fortified, The problems the player has to solve are both internal and external, NPCs have problems with each other, shelter upgrades break down or NPCs want to know what happened to their loved ones or people they knew. Then there's external threats in the form of hostile factions that the player can negotiate with, antagonize or even wipe out.  So far I've encountered 35 recruitable NPCs who have their own story to tell if I ask them, or sometimes don't ask them. Every morning in the game there's invariably one or two people at my room's door wanting me to either deal with a problem or to provide me with a new location on the world map to explore. One of the central game mechancis though is Crisis Events, which deal with large problems that the entire shelter's population wants solved in one way or the other. Diplomacy by the player can help persuade NPCs that the player's decision is the correct one. Or the player can choose an option that pleases the most people to increase the mood (personal) and morale(entire population) of the Shelter.I also like how easy it is to mod the dialogs in this game. So I can fix problems or change things that I don't like which is always a plus.I recommend this game for anyone who's a fan of old school RPGs.			"

												I bought this game when it was first released in Early Access. I had originally found this game's development page about a year before it was released in Early Access. This game did have a rocky start, and I didnt think it would have a good development behind it......boy was I wrong. This game is not the most epic game ever made, but it is something you should get into if you like Zombie survial/turn-based games. Its not open world, You have a map with set locations, and those locations expand to a small set area (best example I can think of is Wasteland 2). I will say this though, this is a good zombie turn-based game with a great story behind it, and I am glad to have backed it up with my very early access purchase of it.			"

It is a long game and at times it can get repetative and monotonous, however the story is fun and the characters are very intersting. This game isn't just about killing zombies, its about survival and coexistance. Its almost a social experiement. The social aspect of the game is very important. Moral is constantly declining... which is realisitic considering the situation, but its what you do with the time you have with your people, how you lead them, how you can negotiate with them. The game is not easy, but its worth playing once.			"

												In the game of attrition, there are no winnersAt the moment of writing this review, The Steam page for Dead State Reanimated rates this game as mostly positive and that is how I would rate my experience playing it: For every great thing this game does, it is usually followed by a major flaw that undermines the Dead State’s overall impression. If you like to play modern RPGs like Mass Effect, The Witcher 3 or Dragon Age, chances are you won’t find this game enjoyable. But if you fondly remember old RPG classics, like Fallout 1 and 2, or Baldur’s Gate series, and you’re armed with patience then you will enjoy Dead State… most of the time. Allow me to dissect this game for you (no pun intended):Pros:+ Good overall writing and gameplay+ Tactical and satisfying turn-based combat+ Interesting noise level, survival and experience system+ Decent sim management gameplay while in the shelter, with various resources that need to be balanced+ Lots of diverse and unique allies that will join your cause, each with different personality, wants and demands+ Strong level design and good, albeit simplistic artistic and graphical presentationCons:- Game has a very sluggish pace with unavoidable grinding- Quests are far and few, mostly fetch-based and primitive- Disappointing end game content- Thrown weapons are unbalanced- Combat rounds can drag on and game is plentiful with annoying bugs- Limited lore and zombie tropes make the game world a very uninteresting place to reside in- UI and inventory are needlessly complex and counter-intuitive- Minimalistic sound and music design serve to the detriment of game’s atmosphereDead State was made by many creative individuals, including Brian Mitsoda who was a writer for the legendary game Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, and that means the writing in this game is constantly on a high level of polish. All dialogues in Dead State are well written, as well are many data items you’ll find as you explore the world, which carry poignant and memorable articles to read. Nearly 50 allies you’ll have a chance to meet are all well-rounded characters that will follow you on your adventures or help you build more things in the shelter, if you are on their good side. But the off trade is that they don’t evolve as in other games with fewer companions that are extremely well-written and change dramatically as the game goes on. You are stuck in a world overrun by zombies, and you’ll need people, resources and the main headquarter to survive. The Shelter you find at the start of the game is an interesting concept, as it can be upgraded in order to provide a bonus to protection or a new type or resource against the overwhelming odds. There are many resources in the game you’ll have collect if you want to survive another day: food, fuel, spare parts and luxury items all grant mood boosts to you and allies, and keeping them well feed and taken care of is very important, otherwise they’ll fall into depression, inner-struggle and violence or will abandon you completely. That is why you’ll have to collect as much resources on your travels as you can.While you travel on the map, you’ll encounter many settlements that may be peaceful, but usually want you dead. All levels in the game you visit are well designed with many small and welcoming details developers could have easily omit, and add a lot to the overall atmosphere of the game. You’ll have to watch on the amount of noise you make, measured in decibels, otherwise you’ll attract the restless undead to your current location. You can also use the noise to you benefit, by directing zombies to the dangerous living enemies, while you wait out their clash to end and scavenge the remains of the battle. The living are the most daunting enemies in the game, as most of them liberally use firearms that can easily incapacitate you and your allies, and make a lot of unnecessary noise. Zombies on the other hand serve as an obstacle and a nuisance, since they are slow and their attacks are limited. However they can infect you if you are not careful, slowly leading to your doom.Leveling system in Dead State also differs from other RPGs: you only gain experience by surviving another day, and securing as much resources as you can. Surviving battle encounters yield you no experience, but you do get from it various traditional weapons and firearms that can be upgraded in the shelter to be more precise and deadly.  The combat is similar to first two Fallout games, where your positioning, use of a correct weapon on a correct enemy, and wisely using your skills and setting traps and snares are key to your victory. The longer the combat prolongs, chances of your survival diminish significantly. But there is a negative side to this type of combat: turns can slow down as more and more enemies enter the fray, human enemies can go dumb occasionally and move around not knowing how to get to you. Thrown weapons such as grenades break the careful balance of all weapons in the game as they can be flung so far, that if they are aimed at you, you’ll have no option from protecting yourself from their devastating effects.Biggest flaw of Dead State is the slow pace the game is developing and the main story is resolving. There are no traditional quests, with self-contained stories to tell and dramatic impact, only simple list of things to do for you or for your allies. And almost all of them involve annoying fetch-me–this and fetch-me-that demands. The number of encounters on the global map is limited and when you discover them all, you’ll have nothing to do but to wait for the end of the game to begin. And the amount of grinding you have to do is staggeringly bad: everything that is not nailed to the ground, you’ll have to pick up at some point. Your and allies’ Inventory will fill up so quickly that you’ll be forced to go back to the shelter to unload everything you’ve found and then return again to the latest destination to haul the rest of the stuff. This kind of pick-up-deliver-pick-up-again philosophy drags the entire pace of the game down and your enjoyment as well. You’ll also struggle with bafflingly illogical interface: how to split objects in your inventory and move them around, how to access the inventory of the vehicle, how to access skills you can use in combat and how many steps you have to take to assign your allies daily chores to do. And if that doesn’t drive you crazy, a letdown of the end content, the final battle and abrupt endings will leave you wanting for more grandiose conclusion. Music is un-intrusive and forgettable, while sound effects are minimal and underused, thus missing the chance for them to aid in building more memorable atmosphere and emphasize the dialogues and emotional bonds you and your allies share. Still, for me Dead State manages to be an overall mostly positive experience. I wish this kind of game wasn’t settled among zombies, for me one of the most overused and least interesting/frightening horror tropes and it is too bad that the game didn’t try to change and evolve our expectations regarding zombies. But at one point in the game, pressured by many choices, good and bad that I’ve made, and combat encounters I’ve survived and will have to endure, I started to adopt the ruthless survivalist way of thinking without even noticing at first. As I always want to play and do play as a good guy, this game made me aware of how enjoyable it can be to be a bad guy once in a while :D Thus I give it a cautious recommendation to the fans of classic RPG games and zombies, but I’ll also understand anyone who finds the amount of flaws to be a bit too much.

However they can infect you if you are not careful, slowly leading to your doom.Leveling system in Dead State also differs from other RPGs: you only gain experience by surviving another day, and securing as much resources as you can. Surviving battle encounters yield you no experience, but you do get from it various traditional weapons and firearms that can be upgraded in the shelter to be more precise and deadly.  The combat is similar to first two Fallout games, where your positioning, use of a correct weapon on a correct enemy, and wisely using your skills and setting traps and snares are key to your victory. The longer the combat prolongs, chances of your survival diminish significantly. But there is a negative side to this type of combat: turns can slow down as more and more enemies enter the fray, human enemies can go dumb occasionally and move around not knowing how to get to you. Thrown weapons such as grenades break the careful balance of all weapons in the game as they can be flung so far, that if they are aimed at you, you’ll have no option from protecting yourself from their devastating effects.Biggest flaw of Dead State is the slow pace the game is developing and the main story is resolving. There are no traditional quests, with self-contained stories to tell and dramatic impact, only simple list of things to do for you or for your allies. And almost all of them involve annoying fetch-me–this and fetch-me-that demands. The number of encounters on the global map is limited and when you discover them all, you’ll have nothing to do but to wait for the end of the game to begin. And the amount of grinding you have to do is staggeringly bad: everything that is not nailed to the ground, you’ll have to pick up at some point. Your and allies’ Inventory will fill up so quickly that you’ll be forced to go back to the shelter to unload everything you’ve found and then return again to the latest destination to haul the rest of the stuff. This kind of pick-up-deliver-pick-up-again philosophy drags the entire pace of the game down and your enjoyment as well. You’ll also struggle with bafflingly illogical interface: how to split objects in your inventory and move them around, how to access the inventory of the vehicle, how to access skills you can use in combat and how many steps you have to take to assign your allies daily chores to do. And if that doesn’t drive you crazy, a letdown of the end content, the final battle and abrupt endings will leave you wanting for more grandiose conclusion. Music is un-intrusive and forgettable, while sound effects are minimal and underused, thus missing the chance for them to aid in building more memorable atmosphere and emphasize the dialogues and emotional bonds you and your allies share. Still, for me Dead State manages to be an overall mostly positive experience. I wish this kind of game wasn’t settled among zombies, for me one of the most overused and least interesting/frightening horror tropes and it is too bad that the game didn’t try to change and evolve our expectations regarding zombies. But at one point in the game, pressured by many choices, good and bad that I’ve made, and combat encounters I’ve survived and will have to endure, I started to adopt the ruthless survivalist way of thinking without even noticing at first. As I always want to play and do play as a good guy, this game made me aware of how enjoyable it can be to be a bad guy once in a while :D Thus I give it a cautious recommendation to the fans of classic RPG games and zombies, but I’ll also understand anyone who finds the amount of flaws to be a bit too much.

												I only played Reanimated, following my usual rules of giving games at least 6 months after release to solve the main problems. I finished the game, fairly completely, maybe missing 2 or 3 characters due to time, and I also saw two of the possible, positive endings. As an experience, one of the best games I've played in a long time, coming close to the original JA2 experience and surpassing it in certain places. Played on highest difficulty levels, but not iron man (I have a job and a family...;-))Pros: For this gaming genre, a very refeshing theme. Early game captures the survival aspects well, with shortages of people, food and equipment. Interactions between characters are quite deep, with serious and not obvious consequences to your actions. The game is not afraid of serious issues and does not give easy answers. Zombies behave like zombies in combat...be careful and quiet, and they are easy kills. Writing is very good - I especially enjoyed the final discussions after one of the endings, and the little touches from the characters. Combat is fun, and you feel a strong progression in skill as your stats and weapons improve. Humans are a significant challenge early game, with military almost overwhelming, but only difficult in large numbers at the end. Lots of easter eggs! The RPG codex was a highlight...Cons: The base building aspect is over by about halfway through the game. I would like to see many more options here, as even the weapon options are not that interesting. I am not sure if I missed something, but several directions seem to be undeveloped, particularly related to some of the skills people have. There were some very interesting possibilities sugggested and an obvious ending or two absent. Still a few bugs in the quests, especially when you do them out of order. Even at the highest level, infection is too rare. Having more infections, but with the possibility of cures or longer term suppression would have balanced it better. You must take your own character on missions. This makes a combat build important early on.A great pity that an unfortunate early release and negative feedback seems to have killed future games.

Early Access Review
								I Love This Game! It's perfectly balanced with script and action figures. Further improvements that i want to see,Random encounters should be arrange as same areas with different and respawnable enemy/loot seeds. I don't want to enter same area that i already entered and killed/looted everything in it. This would improve the immersion beyond the main story line and specific locations that have names.Adding some events that may occur repeatedly could be totally awesome. You encounter crisis in the game as the time flows and you achive some main situations.  Adding random 'minor' events could give the player more challange and also i would love to have meetings about daily problems.I often use mods when i finish the vanilla. It's refreshing, so maybe it would be good to have mod friendly game mechanics?Did i say I Love This Game?			"

												I haven't played for too long and while I will agree with most that this game has potential I'm starting to wish I had saved my money.  Combat is already getting REALLY repetitive whether it be bandits or zombies.  Equipment and inventory is a hassle and I can't believe it's as interface unfriendly as it is.  The shelter just has people standing around even if you assign them jobs and nothing really feels alive.  All of these complaints may seem mundane but when they add up it feels like a game that slowly lulls me to sleep or frustrates me.  If it was $10 i'd say sure but for $30... I feel let down, especially with all the die hard reviews saying this was good but it feels too much like an old game with half the personality.   I remember playing Baldurs Gate 1 and 2 and even Fallout 2 and was blown away at the time by the story telling.  Not only does Baldurs Gate 2 look better than this and that's a title that's MUCH older, but it's less buggy and the world felt more developed.  I put in many hours just to get my moneys worth but I believe DoubleBear rushed this and dupped people into buying an incomplete game which was vastly overpriced.  Sorry DoubleBear, I know some Devs on your team put their hearts out into this, but when it all adds up it just wasn't worth it.			"

												RIP Dead State killed by the Dead State Reanimated update, died way to early in its life. It will be missed!My true first Negative review.This is one of the worst days of my life. I followed this game since it was first announced or hinted about. I pre-ordered it as soon as the ability came up.I then I started playing it on steam.I was happy but was looking for more from this game.Then came out the Reanimated update which basiclly destroyed the game for me.Zombies weren't zombies anymore in my opinion but more like the infected from 28 days later in my opinion.No more sneaking up and getting in the first attack / beginning of the combat phase with an attack to the back of a zombie.The claim this was to increase the difficulty is the lamest claim I have ever seen for a game.From every post I read the biggest issue that I have seen is the fact that you could become nearly invincible to zombies at a point in the game.That there im torn between, I like it because thats just human nature at the same time takes away from the game itself.A simple answer, give zombies the random % chance of penetrating the defense / armor class of the victim instead of this detection crap they currently use.Even the recent posts since the Reanimated update declare the change really hasn't changed much other than making the beginning that little more difficult.It also destroys the immersion in the game for me and by posts several other people as well.If they put an option to turn it on / off would resolve this issue for me.This was once a dream and now its a nightmare from which a new dream is waiting to be discovered to replace the current nightmare of Dead State Reanimated.

												Many of the other reviews have already said it: the game is more chore than fun--and that's further reinforced by a clunky UI and stale writing (not bad, mind you, just stale). Combat--which might be expected to be the highlight--is generally dull and poorly balanced (on hardcore at least) with zombies/looters almost invariably sensing you from behind, with no stealth emchanism to sneak up on them effectively--and then even with a three-on-one in close combat the very real chance one of your members will take serious damage, as you whiff far too often from point blank range. Combine this with the sparse mechanics, like the noise level, which is poorly explained/clumsily executed (compare with Invisible Inc's alarm meter, or Thief's noise gem, both of which clearly and intuitively provide information while being stylistically coherent inside the game world) and you get a scenario where you can neither effectively sneak around and loot nor effectively tactically engage foes.Base building and management suffer from an abundance of materials as opposed to a scarcity (not necessarily a problem, in and of itself), but it gives more of an impression of inventory management and 'finding x item to keep y character happy' as opposed to a struggle to survive, quickly lapsing into tedium,Sadly, like so many other turn-based games of the same ilk, Jagged Alliance 2 came along over a decade ago and set the high watermark that so very, very many of these games have broken themselves against over the years. Kudos for the effort, but zombie games aren't exactly a scarce genre, and many of the others, from low-fi indie gems like Rogue Survivor or Neo Survivor, through mid-rangers like 7 Days to Die, all the way to high-gloss AAAs like Dying Light, pick aspects and do them better.I don't think this is a 'bad' game, and I applaud the devs for the effort, but I'm really not motivated to play something this tedious when there's already a definite feeling that rewards for the invested time will be minimal.

								Found some grubs and worms in a trash can. Took them home for use as sustenance. Simply great. Would love to see more gross survival things enter into this game as well as a greater urgency on supply runs with starvation becoming a real threat rather than a vaugue concept as you collect shelf after shelf of food. I'm aware most people probably wouldn't enjoy just managing to scrape by with food so perhaps a true survivalist mode or something?			"

												Wow! It's so hard to write this review. I've been on a rollercoaster with this game. At first you can be discouraged to play it because of high entry level - your team seems so weak when tackling zombies at first...After some days and character progression you find out that..man! it's too easy...Having some of the best NPC'd and firearms it's just not challenging anymore...This game needs some serious balancing. I haven't finished it yet (currently at day 55) but I'm struggling to keep going. When you aquire decent armor and good companions you find out that the biggest obstacle is to find enough motivation to find out what waits at the end. Maybe introducing some advance zombies (bossess) would do the trick, I don't know but at later stages you just don't get enough challenge. Missions are repetitive and enemies are not hard to beat at all. On the other hand it's still pretty rewarding to crack some undead skulls and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of those looters :)I guess everyone just need to find out on their own what's your perception of this game. I spent over 100 hours which I don't regret. That says something, doesn't it? (maybe not ;))			"

												Fun tactical combat vs zombies, gangers and mercenaries with a large variety of locations, NPCs and items. There is some choice and consequence in the shelter management minigame. Decent writing with some interesting characters and situations. Enemy turns take too long to resolve, shelter management is shallow/tedious and lacks any challenge, there is a lack of enemy variety and combat becomes rote and grindy fairly quickly. There is a long wait time for the end game to resolve even after clearing all locations. Highlight for me was when you lure zombies into human enemies and start huge battles, get them all eaten and escape with the valuables.			"

												TLDR: After a considerable number of playthroughs this game is easily one of my favorites in the RPG-zombie genre. Play it if you're a fan of survival RPGs with story, zombies, and base building.While it certainly has its flaws, it is rather well made and features a fairly compelling narrative in addition to some engrossing turn-based gameplay and survival challenges that, especially on the hardcore setting, is still difficult even for expereinced veterans. On top of all this, it's also fairly true to the classic zombie lore of films and TV. There's no super-zombies, no 'special' zombies, and the later-game difficulty comes more from other humans--just as it should be.Upgrading your shelter is rewarding and you get to see the fruits of your labor build up over time. Survivors whom you rescue grow stronger over time and you get to (somewhat) influence their growth, deal with their tantrums and moods, deal with allies who get bitten, and so forth. While the story is entirely scripted, there are a lot of events that trigger based on certain conditions, and that makes no two playthroughs exactly alike.The biggest disapointment is the AI, and by extention the way zombie turns are managed by the engine. Most enemies will simply charge you head on, even though they have no chance to win, although there is simulated panic. There are numerous pathing exploits that make some of the harder missions too easy since you can't step over an incapacited body without killing it first. Worst is that some of the larger levels / larger zombie hoardes can take ages to resolve a turn or complete the level, making it a tedious chore that involves a lot of waiting.Still, no game is perfect, and this one is better than most.

The combat system is beyond funny its frustrating.At its current state(no Pun) lol i wudnt recommend its high price tag its a good game and is a great concept but it does need some polishing and changes b4 i wud consider it the game it is meant to be.Update: After the last update i choose to make myself play i knew the devs would be trying to fix it and i thought i owed it to them to try again.So i did and i was surpised how much everything has balanced out to the point that i have played for over 80 hours without realising it.I believe the devs at doublebear have listened and that is what i love about indie devs they listen to there gamersNow i can recommend this Game 9/10			"

												Dead State Reanimated has a lot of heart. But I only recommend this title to people with a lot of time and patience on their hand. Dead state combine several types of games into one. It is fascinating to build a community and fill it with survivors of the zombie apocalypse. It is awesome to explore the numerous characters backgrounds and affect how they continue their stories under your leadership. You also get a fleshed out RPG experience, where you get to equip and level up as you go along. Exploration is also done quite well, in that you explore the surroundings around your little community, to find resources, allies and an abundance of enemies to kill. There are a certain beauty to the turn based fighting mechanics, which is done on painstakingly designed locations, which each tell a tale of the zombie apocalypse. There are small random encounters as well, but even those are also quite varied and unique in nature. This is truly where the game shines, as every place you visit will bring a new setting to explore. You even get to collect snippets of the events leading up to the apocalypse, which together tells a rather fleshed out and chilling tale of how society broke down, from numerous points of view.Sadly this game is not without its flaws. Most prominently, it shows that there wasn't enough man hours to make this game truly stand out in its genre. I really liked that there is a larger story in Dead State, which leads to several endings, depending on what resources you have collected, and how you have interacted with survivors on the map. But the pacing of this story isn't working very well, and it is rather glaring that the development of your survivors storyline simply stop after a couple of weeks in the community. You are also likely to run out of places to explore, on the map, long before the ending comes around. The same goes for projects in your community which simply grinds to a halt. I feel like the developers intended to flesh out this part of the game too, but never got around to it. It is obvious that there were plans for more endings, which was sadly cut out. And the endings we were left with really should have given us more than they did. Basically, this game would have been far better if it had ended around its halfway point. I played this game on the highest difficulty, which should have forced me to make hard choices on where my resources and skill points would be placed, while I struggled to get to one of the endings.All in all I enjoyed this game. I would definitely buy an expansion, if it came with: More fleshed out dialog and character development. More locations, specifically locked away, until the late game, along with more types of advanced enemies and maybe a bunch of boss battles. More projects to explore along with more ways and choices to improve the community. Make the hardest difficulties a struggle to complete. But most importantly, make the endings more engaging as well as better fleshed out.			"

												Dead State offers a pretty unique combination of turn-based tactical RPG battles (along the lines of Fallout 2, Jagged Alliance, XCom, etc.), exploration, and base/resource/personnel management that makes me strongly recommend this game. It scratches an itch that few other games get near. A good comparison would be to imagine XCom if it had much more primitive, clunky, unpolished combat, but more more involved base management and open-world exploration.Pros:+ The game bills itself as an ""apocalypse simulator"" and it delivers on this. Rather than going off in a sci-fi direction with the zombie apocalypse, the game is almost disturbing realistic is how people interact with each other and the problems you face. Your main threat (after the first few days) isn't the zombies at all but looters, biker gangs, rogue soldiers, decent people willing to do anything to survive, and even your own party members. In addition, you gradually find little ""data items"" throughout the game which gradually reveal the backstory of the apocalypse. Once again, it is almost disturbingly realistic in terms of how people really act.+ The presence of both zombies and hostile humans in missions offers the possibility some interesting tactics like luring zombies into attacking your enemies. Also, you never quite know what you will find when you go out exploring.+ If you like management games, you'll like how you have to worry about your base's food, fuel, morale, interpersonal relationships, and many other things that you need to keep your eye on for your base to keep going. Resources are scarce (at times), and you'll definitely be agonizing over certain decisions. This is often the aspect of games like this that gets cut for the sake of making a more exiciting action-oriented game, but I like having the management aspects there. Cons:- A lot of things about the UI, controls, and information displays could have been done better. It feels a bit like the 80s when you realize you've got to have a sheet of paper or spreadsheet handy to keep track of which locations you've explored and where you've left some resources that you couldn't carry home. You'll have some frustrating moments where you accidentally throw a grenade at the wrong enemy or accidentally bandage an ally who doesn't need it due to the clunky controls. You'll be grumbling over how clunky and time-consuming it is to manage your base's inventory and equip your party members. These things sometimes make the game feel like a beta version that should have gotten a full makeover before release.- The game starts to stall out in the mid-game when you are well-equipped enough that zombies are no threat and you get to the point of just wandering around exploring random locations, and most of the time you don't find anything interesting that you haven't seen before. I can't complain too much about this, though, because it took me dozens of hours of play before I got to this point.- There are a few small things that are very frustrating in how they were implemented. For example, there is a crafting system to make ammo, but the resources required are absurdly high. Another example is that your main character (who represents the player) has to go on every single mission and is not permitted to heal/craft/build at the base while others go out exploring--effectively meaning you *must* make a combat-oriented character. These kinds of things can detract from both realism and gameplay.			"

												UPDATED (and rating changed)Not recommend at full price, if it's on sale, get it if you are open to the overall ides.Also please read the comments for updates!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is not a terrible game, actually it is a fun game to play and I like it.It just does a terrible job at selling it's strengths!The overall idea is nice, of course nothing new, but still I like it. ""Tactical"" Combat, Ressource Managment, Exploring, Survival, role-playing and npc-interactions in Zombie-infested apocalypse, if that is something which intrigues you, you may have a nice time with it.But alot of the stuff put into it feels unfinished and/or falls flat when it comes to utilizing it's potential, especially the combat, which is sad, but it shines in other (very well hidden) aspects.Combat in general:The combat, one of the main parts of the game, since it happens so often, is lacklusting. One of the most often used tactics is being seen as early as possible, since enemies almost always got the first attack, so you want them to see you early so they first have to get close to you, spending their action points for moving, instead of attacking. Of course this tactic fails when it comes to human enemies with guns.The lack of a stealth system is imo a terrible design choice. You can't sneak up on anybody/anything, at least not without initiating combat a few tiles away, so that you may have at least one (normal) attack on a chosen enemy, which wouldn't be that bad, if wasn't for the high amount of APs you need for your actions. At this point I can only utilize this ""tactic"" with my main char, since all other survivors are almost literally useless (too few APs, low skill values).Also the special attacks are just not optimized. For example, there is an attack called flurry which executes as 3 attacks with 30% reduced accuracy, but on my Main char it costs 6 APs, while the normal attack costs 2 (reduced costs for high dex), so instead of using my APs for 3 attacks with normal accuray, I can could spend them on this ""special"" attack with reduced AP. Just wow, I am amazed.As wrote above, generally enemies move/attack first (if you don't want to waste APs to ""counteract"" this). That also happens when someone reanimates as a Zombie (which is a cool mechanic in general btw). Ko'ed NPCs can and will be attacked by nearby Zombies, thus getting infected. They die and come back as Zombies. But why do they have to have the initiative then? They come back and can immediatly move and attack someone. Again imo another bad design choice.The Gunfighting: Mostly you wouldn't want to use guns, since they make too much noise, thus attracting nearby enemies (which is btw one of the good things about this game), but nevertheless there are moments you don't care much about noise, but how it was executed is just not good. Reloading takes an insane amount of APs, it's 7 (out of 8) for one of my fellow survivors, who was a Sheriff before the apocalypse hit. Okay, I get it, reloading just takes more time than shooting at something, but how translates this former Sheriff almost not being able to hit a human-sized (zombie) target less than 5m away to realism?! Not everyone has to be a good shot, but seriously?! Imo it would have been better if gunfighting was given some more love. The only advantage of using guns, instead of melee, is that you don't have to close the full distance to your target, that way saving some APs, but that's it. Attracting nearby enemies and the scarcity of ammunition are good mechanics/design choices, everything else...not so.Inventory Managment and Looting: It's tedious. Beginning with not being able to check the skills of your people while browsing your storage, but sadly not ending there. It would have been nice if you could change chars on looting screen, when not engaged in combat.Another irritating thing is that sometimes the standard action on ko'ed looters(NPC enemies) is ""attack"", instead of ""loot/search"". Via right-click you change the desired action, but why it is sometimes loot and some other times attack, I still haven't figured out (see comments for update)UI:It lacks ""Tool Tips"", those informations you get about items, skills and so on in other games, also a nice addition would have been a clock display, speaking of, maybe it isn't necessary, have to figure out first, if time passes when exploring an area. In all else regards, it's nothing special, just essentials.The used font also is a problem. On higher resolutions it's too small and the color makes it hard to read. NPC interactions: Fleshed out well enough, even if it may not appear so at first glance (even some ingame days into it), but after some more time you'll find many possibilities to interact with NPCs in various, entertaining ways.Stability: On my system (which is quite stable I may add) the game isn't stable at all. 7.7 hours into the game and it crashed 3 times already, which is something I could excuse if it was a brand new title, because you can't rule out something like this on a diverse platform like the PC, but that shouldn't happen anymore after being for sale for month. (see comments)Last words: It really isn't all bad, despite what you might think after reading this, at least I enjoy playing it, though I believe it to be shy of it's potential and and the price tag is just a tad too high imo. If you are into this kind of games get it for a reduced price when it is on sale (20€ would be okay I guess), though in my opinion you won't be butthurt if you bought it at full price, just don't expect a new standards setting gamechanger.

												This is a pretty casual review but well it's a fun game (I feel like it's getting repetitive but I'm not super far in the game so we'll see) I got it from a sale though so I can't say I'd be as pleased if I had paid the full price fyi... but you can tell work has gone into this (graphics are what they are but that is called THE STYLE).The only negative I'll have to say is that for such a 'simple' game it heats up my computer like a toaster. Also the dialogue choices are a bit amusing but that's not a bad thing. Also you can too easily play yourself into a situation where you can't get out from and have to restart.Would highly recommend from a sale (I'm not being cheap, I just honestly feel like this isn't a 20€ game but rather a 13-15€ game) and if you're into turn based battle and managing.

												I've been playing for about a week and love it so far. Although I don't understand how you can use a stun gun on a guy, have him lying prone on the ground, and completely miss your next attack...well, that's unlife I guess. Living about 2 hours from the games setting adds something for me I suppose but it captures all the elements I would want in a turn based strategy game based on the Zombie Apocalypse scenario. Still figuring things out like why wasn't there an option to negotiate with this survivor camp I encountered? Why did I have to massacre them all and steal their stuff? Sad. I feel a little like Negan right now. I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of the game so far, I hope the rest plays out as well as the start. SInce there is no real end game, I will get tired of it at some point but having fun so far. I recommend it for zombie apocalypse fans who want to experience daily life in said situation and who aren't into the FPS type games like me.			"

												This is definitely one of my favourite games on PC at the moment. It is a great mix of SRPG, base building and exploration and it also has lots and lots of lootz to be found - and used. It does come with a few bugs - which seem to differ in size from player to player - but so far I have only encountered 2 very minor ones which did not affect my overall enjoyment.The Morale system seems very harsh and is a bit of a bone of contention on the forums. I find it a little bit too harsh at the start, but let's leave that for now. "

												 - Some really interesting bits of writing - Too many NPCs bug you about nonsensical things (""Stop taking me out into the field!"" when I'd never actually done that) - Combat has few tactical options. You can't take cover or delay your action. - Too often you are forced into ridiculous fights (15 zombie on a narrow road with the only exit on the opposite side) - During a fight, the active character cycles between EVERY character on the entire map. Even if they're not active or near you. In some maps, after your guys take a turn, it can take almost a minute of just watching it cycle through zombies that aren't active and do nothing. - The turn order is useless for know when a specific enemy will move since their portrait is only loosely related to their in-world model - There's an option to show which containers on the map can be looted (most can't). This is off by default, and turns itself off each time you play - There are horrible glitches in how it renders area with multiple levels. When on a map like that you will often see people floating in air, or have the ground below you disappear - You can tilt the camera, but only very slightly which makes it hard to see certain areas that you want to move to - You can get ""Status effects"" like poisoned, bleeding, etc. These are shown by an icon, but there is no tooltip when you hover over them so you have to look them up in the manual. - The pathfinding is bad. It will show that you can't reach an area, but if you click a few squares at a time, you'll get there - If you want to move to a square that contains a corpse, you need to carefully target around the corpse. - Having the Science skill means your melee attacks inflict Poison. What? - When looting it shows you how much you are carrying, but not how much you can carry. - The game maintains a To Do list, but even when you complete them they will often not be crossed off - In combat, facing is important but you have no way to change your facing - Weapons have special attacks, but there's no way in-game to see what they are. You have to go read the manual.Overall, it's unpolished and unfinished. If you can get it on sale, it's still worth picking up and trying. I wouldn't pay full price or recommend spending the time to finish the game once it starts to drag. "

												This game proves once again — to make an immersive game there's no need to have an AAA-game engine. The most important thing is the story. Here you have the Dead State, where story unfolds before your eyes, and you really feel how you become a new leader of a small community during apocalypse. Yes, most dialogues become repetative soon, but in the mornings you always have some situations happening, and you need to make decisions which affect your gameplay.You need to keep your small society happy, fed and safe; you may set tasks on job boards, and recent game update made it so that NPCs are actually animated basically, and it adds some immersion too.Pros:- Interesting random situations, good decision-making game- A great mix of Fallout/Wasteland2/Fallout Tactics/XCOM and even... The Sims :) Turn-based combat and real-time movement, when time is running only when you want it to run, makes gameplay run smoothly, at your own preferred pace.- Good dialogues, not very short, and not too long — you won't get bored reading them- Immersion is greatCons:- Some repetativeness in NPC dialogues- Some UI issues- I had couple of glitches and CTDs while I was playing, but fortunately there's a quicksave and autosave function- Background music is great, but it is repetativeFuture suggestions, although the game is in it's final state, I see that devs still actually change some things:- It would be great if there was some voiceacting involved :) - More randomness to the radio? Dynamic news?- Ability to send additional scavenge parties without the leader?- Loot balance? I'm on my day 31st now, still can't find any DVDs for recreation room, while I have lots of DVD players :)			"

												 Gotta say I love this game.  This is what Indie developers can do when they work hard on a project they believe in, and see it through to the end (....>..>  Looking at you Rust and others)  Anyways if you like either Tactical games, or zombies, or sandbox games, or exploration games, or shooting dem bad guys, or just scavenging your enemies bodies for cool new stuff then you must buy this game.      To simplify, this game is an strategically more detailed XCOM but with Zombies instead of aliens. Thik of it as ""XCOM Enemy Unnown - Zombies Ultimate Survival Edition"" if you will.  I mean freaking zombies, who doesnt love zombies.  Global defense isnt your goal, but Survival of you and your fellow survivors that matters. So build your Base Defense the best you can, keep your people safe, especially while you are out looking for weapons, food, fuel, water, a can opener..... (lol) etc, you get the point. Oh and zombies, I Mean Freaking ZOMBIES!!! DUDE!!!!!    Combat is tactical and turn based, youll want to weigh your options if you come across zombies or people. With zombies its a choice of ""Do I wanna take em down quietly one at a time with my axes, knives and such in melee risking return/counter attacks or do I want to risk the noise and pull out my .12 Gauge Semi Auto Shotgun and get it done fast with no chance of them getting even near me.  Also using a party member as bait works well to, just dont use anyone you actually like because you can expect them to survive long enough that you learn their name but thats about it, hes gonna die in a mission/trip or two.   Now with humans its a whole other ball game, are they friendly or hostile?  Are they pretending to be friendly to get easy access on you with a nasty suprise later. They got guns!   Oh Crap!  but we are sneaking through a town full of zombies and we are to smart to fire our weapons and call the Zeds down on us all, buuuuut are these other people just as smart or will they open fire as soon as they catch you in the corner of their eye?   In total, there is a lot of fun to be had with this game, a lot of choices both in story and out of it. Suport this dev team, they do great work, and all of te content updates have been free, no BS DLC to speak of, they make it and just drop it in there for us to enjoy.			"

												Amazing game.  Buy it!  The writing is terse but perfectly composed:  you get to know these characters and care when they die, or turn against you, or become disillusioned with your leadership (yes, all this can happen organically within the game system).  This game creates a tremendous sense of atmosphere and freedom:  every place, however insignificant, has a story if you look closely, and the game throws plot events at you at a slow but believable pace that lets you explore and deal with the crises that emerge naturally from the dynamics of the world and your own play style.  This is one of the very few times I have felt like I do when playing a tabletop RPG with a truly excellent GM.  This writer knows what he is doing.  Plus... this is a very satisfyingly long game, especially given the price:  look above to see how many hours I've given this game and I haven't finished it nor can I guess how it might end other than... well... badly.

												If Fallout 2 and State of Decay had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child, this would be it.Edit:  Seriously, this is a very good game.  The plot can be gripping if you allow it to be.  The characters have personality and they can get on your nerves, but if you want to keep them [you do want to, you need their skills and manpower] you'll have to placate them.  It's not impossible to make everyone happy, but it does require some effort.The turn based combat is a lot of fun, even given how much of it there can be it never really came off as tedious to me.  There are even a few situations where you can manipulate the undead to help you in wearing down some enemies for you to swoop in for the kill.The story and atmosphere are immersive and it's was easy enough for me to lose myself in the game, especially if you have a favorite character personaily or concept to role play with.I most certainly endorse and would recommend this game.

												I give this game a very very tentative positive review. Overall, you get what the game promises up front, so there is no deception as far as marketing goes and there being a free demo is a huge plus.That said, I have issues with this game. For one, I feel like having a main character that you play as is very limiting. Of course you should always play as the leader, that's the style of game it is, but if your character is deemed unfit for leadership, game over. If your character dies, game over. I think this is far too limiting and they should go with a 'State of Decay' model in that if you die, (or as in this game, if you're stripped of leadership, or banished, whatever) the next NPC up becomes the player character. I just think that one thing limits this game far too much.I also wish you could negotiate with human looters rather than be forced to engage them in combat or run. I mean sure, there are always going to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you just can't talk to, but I find it hard to believe that your group is the only one that would be even willing to negotiate.But overall, I enjoyed it while I played it and intend to play it more in the future, so even with the negatives, I can't give it a negative if I'm still playing.

												This is a very interesting game, I can only give it a so-so rating.The graphics, it's pretty lowgrade and very cartoonie. So if you are big on visuals than look elsewhere.The idea behind the game is very good. Set in a zombie end world scenario, you are a survivor trying to survive day to day by collecting resources and gathering npc party members in a stronghold. You character is fully customizable in terms of skills and stats. The NPCs are not, only a few choices in game on which way they will specialize, but those of use played Baulder's Gate and some RPGs this is a minor inconvinience.The game play is not bad, u have to manage ur shelter/stronghold. Collecting, gathering, or fishing for supplies day after day to keep everyone fed and fuel for the generator so you have electricity. You need electricity for alot of functions in your shelter so it's best to keep the fuel stockpile full. Meds and other supplies also is needed for the shelter. The constant threat of hunger, low meds, and lack of fuel keeps you running out to grab more and explore more. This is very good part of the game and keeps the days rolling.The Combat is very basic, i mean it in a bad way. no cover system or anything. extreme linear movement in a square grid system, firearms have very little range and there is preciously little ammo making using guns frustrating. Also gun fire or loud noise attracts random zombies, they spawn at edge of map and walk towards the sounds, it's a good idea but then it's really lame because only 1 zombie come, well per noise meter raised. Sometimes they dont come at all, i mean there should be some indication or more zombies. It's very frustrating you cant take cover behind a stone pillar or  a tree or the corner of the house and you see the enemy shoot right through obsticles. So combat in this game is pretty terrible. Im comparing to earlier games like wasteland 2 or xcom. This needs work.Story is very good and there are unexpected turns, you can't keep everyone happy is the underline theme.So in this state I cannot recommend the game because I simply dread combat everytime i runinto it and it's every few minuts while scavenging. I get so bored.			"

												When I picked this game up, I thought, :bleh another zombie killing game with barely any plot to it."" I was wrong. There is and isn't a story. The story is to survive, which is the most common theme, however, it does NOT focus on zombie killing. That's just a bonus. It's a story about how people need to survive off of each other when everyone's worlds  shatter collectively. Many needs can happen, people can experience bad memories, (especially when you have one of your teammates get eaten by a zombie then come back) and so much more. It's like Romero's movies. Sure there's zombies, but the worst enemy is the people who will do anything it takes to survive.PROs:*Customizable character creation*Skills with a different trait for a given amount of points put into one thing*Each weapon has its own stats (Some can break. Some weapons are improvised and shouldn't really be use)*Stats are simplistic and easy to understand.*The interactions of people and how they can survive in the world while trying to maintain their own sanity.*The lifeness of each character (Each character has their own personality.)*Animal companions. Have your animals help keep morale up or help defend your base!*Situations that upcome and can change how people can view you.Cons:*Zombie AI. If there's a horde of them, they won't move one by one, they'll all move THEN get a turn to attack each of your characters. I understand these things operate on sound so using weapons isn't great. However, when a whole horde comes, it usually screws you over.*Some characters are kind of useless than others. *Story. LIke I said, it's more focused on survival and the desperation of people during the end of the world. However, if there is a main goal, I can't seem to figure it out.*Combat is a bit awkward.*If you're a graphic snob, aka, HAS to be 1080p and 60 fps, then this game isn't for you. The graphics are good, but not the best. Look for another game. *The motorcycle gang members have super powerful weapons, even at early game, and can bring you down to half or a quarter of your health in one hit and when you DO kill them, their weapons dont have ANY ammo or any on their bodies.Overall I would rate it 9/10. It could use a bit of work, but it is a great game. If you like the theme of the world turning upside down during the zombie apocolypse, and people doing everything they need to survive, then this game is for you. If not, try Left 4 Dead or some other game for your satisfying zombie head shots.			"

												*Disclaimer: I know one of the artists as an internet friend*This is a wonderfully difficult game that seriously makes you think about your decisions. Unlike a lot of other games that are in this thread you gain exp by completing tasks, not killing zombies. Knowing that turns the game into a huge puzzle that given some time you can work your way through with minimal causalties. Be prepared to want to restart a couple times because if you don't pay attention and miss something important you will likely end up dead. My biggest advice is to PAY ATTENTION!Having played through Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines I enjoy Brian Mitsoda's work, and as the head writer on the project expect some in depth, thought raising dialogue. I would seriously play throguh just for the work he was able to do with this.			"

The way the move as a group can leave you some awkward positioning when u bump into a zombie or ten but overall I liked it.			"

												The GUI is a bit choppy, got a few CTD's, game would certainly benefit from more hotkeys, but it still is fairly enjoyable piece of game. And after getting used to the interface, good game kicks in. If you want to play zombie rpg/sim/turn-based strategy, definitely grab it.			"

Early Access Review
								After played this game for about 6 hours, I can say that it is absolutely worth buying.Even it's an early access title, you can see already the main mechanics the game provides.The setting is well choosen and has good overall atmosphere.Having reached the middle of the demo (after 2-3 hours of gameplay) the game starts getting real addicted.The random encounters make the game even more a thrill as you never know who you cross when returning to the base after a successful looting day.You will have even the possibility to take decisions which will impact the storyline and so give you more than one way to play the game.The fact that noise attracts the zombies and enemys around is giving a tactical benefit to the game as you need to decide how to take down the different kind of enemys.I would recommend this game to all the fans of the old Jagged Alliance series and Turn-Based-Tactical-Shooters out there.

												This game can be enjoyed immensely by the type of expectation you have.You will experience the following during this game:A) An enjoyable strategic experience that is uniqueB) Some inconsistancies as this is not a AAA titleC) Some frequent crashing as the developer continues to update the titleThere is a lot of charm to the game. I find myself playing continously coming back for more even though I know the game does at time crash and can be inconsistent with expectations on how to manage your headquarters.As long as you understand this is a small development team working very hard on a unique experience you will enjoy. If your expecting XCOM level polish you will be disappointed.    The game accomplishes what it primarily attempts- a strategic, loot diving headquarter developing zombie game.  "

												Uninspired gameplay, ugly graphics, mediocre fighting mechanics... and a price tag of 15-20 bucks is an absolute robbery, try the demo first if you ever intend to buy it... Better yet go buy jagged alliance 2 unfinished business (not the ♥♥♥♥ing remake), a game that's been developed in 1999 looking way better, playing way better and waay more engaging than this pile of garbage... in order to play this ♥♥♥♥ you're going to need to overlook a lot of things.Stay away from this game... as far as possible...

												The game, at the moment when I played it, was quite buggy. The game does come across as somewhat alpha in certain areas but I could overlook those parts and enjoy the rest of the game just fine.You can read positive things from other reviewers, I'm going to focus on the negative aspects of the game while still reccomending it for any cRPG fan or zombie fan.Sometimes the character you're moving stands completely still and glides across the floor.Sometimes when you run across a large distance of the map one of your companions get stuck along the way and 'appears' to be running along right behind you until you see them glitch back and start re-running from wherever they got stuck.There are certain rooms and lootables that are not accessible because of path issues. Nothing that major really. You lose out on barely half a dozen items each time but it's still a bit annoying. What I mean is that you open a door to a hotel room and you can't enter it. Kind of like a misplaced invisible wall.Zombies and mercs and stuff just stand still pretty much constantly and there are times when you simply walk into a gunfight where the opposition will have the first move with no way to circumvent it.SPOILER The 'end game' happens after day 80, however there is only enough interaction between NPC's in the shelter for 60 days (at least that's all there was for me). So there will be this long boring gap of pretty much nothing happening after 60 days./SPOILERThe melee and ranged are completely unbalanced. Melee is fantastic for handling zombies but useless against late-game humans whereas ranged make zombie fights extremely tedious (and it's a waste of high-tier weapon ammo) but are pretty much a necessity for late game fights. It got to the point that there are human enemies in the game that can 'only' significantly get hurt by critical hits of high tier ranged weapons. So invest in Ranged 'and' melee.The car guzzles 'way' too much gas even with all the upgrades. Don't bother with it.I'll leave it at that for now.			"

												A good zombie story really isn't about the zombies and here is a good zombie game that also really is not about the zombies. Lead survivors, manage a shelter, and discover how quickly you start to resent less useful survivors when you have to go out daily to get food and gas to keep everyone feed and happy.Very happy I backed this on Kickstarter and greatly anticapting the full release....Post release and post December Patches...Now out of Early Access I would still happily recommend this game to fans of turn-based games. Light RPG system with light base building/managment involved. I wish the RPG aspects were deeper but the game is still very enjoyable and quite engaging.I personally have not had many bug issues. Only seen a couple bugs myself and they did not caused a crash or even stop gameplay.			"

Dead State combines the best for me, Zombies aand Building.   It will be even better when the one-week time restriction is removed but it is still fun until then.  I have not had any problem with bugs or figuring out how to do something yet, but I read the manual first.  You will have to search for the manual on the forum thou since it is not included in the download.			"

												Not enjoying it , not nearly good as i.e. Wasteland2 D.C.Others already wrote this game pro's and con's, with many of problems already pointed to developers in discussion fourm. Not much is changed, problems mostly remain.Game has serious issues on different aspects, for me most annoying are:1. Leaving some action points for self-defense or ambush like in wasteland2 is not possible.2. Inventory management is so complicated and time consuming it kills my mood for play3. Cannot go over dying enemy on doorstep (choke-point), cannot kill it because it is under other dead bodies, cannot exit battle mode until it's dead...Because of gameplay mechanic problems, game feels: dead, static, too slow progressso i would not play it any more, and I would not recommend it to a friend. There are better executed games in this genre to waste time on.			"

												-I won't lie the game have issue at the moment,Nothing game breaking but still annoying.If you hate game with bug wait for patch to fix them.Dead state is  INDIE game where YOU get to lead a group of survivor in the zombie apocalypse/survival RPG(the words zombie will never be mention in this game.)Get food, gun and other useful item while you walk trouth the ruin of post-apocalype Texas with your band of survivor Hoping to see the light who make you safe once again........Or the the flash from a gun right in your face.Dead State is RPG tbs(turn base system) with is more closed to the original fallout 1 or 2, Than a tactical turn base combat like x-com or even xenonaut(Meaning that you can't crouch or take cover behind object) but still offer trustful combat situation with is allies who react diferent from one to a another toc ombat or even.Here a few negative and positve point about the game,-negaitive:no voice over soo if you hate read text stay away there a lot of text(like 10 000 line)Outdated grapic but good for a indie teamlike mentionning no cover or crouch optionscripted story line...-positive...Nope a bad thing game is really good And have multiple ending.MASIVE game time quality more than 50+ hour of gameplay for one playthourtMore than 40 recrutable npc with there own personalitygiant map to exploreFree expension coming later greath amount of event that will occur durent the gameAND A LOT MORE....This game have a unique chram once in this hard to get out,This game is a indie gem a 18/20 for the moment(waiting patch).Before buying make sure you check video about it and make sure the game run in your computer.

												I am edditing my review, I want to be heard and since my Fierhorn79 account is banned and my super old Fierhorn account was perm banned by steam at the request of Doublebear for ban evasion. *The Highlighted Review Below* (Brian's DoubleBear statement) http://steamcommunity.com/app/239840/discussions/0/627456359689053892/My reply to Brian and Dead State DevsI wanted to take a minute to both defend myself and address Brian and Annie Mitsoda's statements.When I saw that Brian Mitsoda made a response it gave me hope that he and DoubleBear would address that main reason for my review not just the fact that the Review was wrongfully flagged by someone at Doublebear and then continue into a rant trying to discredit me. That main concern being the business decision to move a game from Early Access to full release during the Steam holiday season. The game on the release date had a long list of known bugs, several of them either game or story breaking. Yes there have been patches and some of the bugs have been fixed, but this does not cancel out they original concern. The choice that was made looks like Doublebear tried to trick gamers into buying a game thinking it was finished when in fact by DoubleBears own known issues list on the day of release it was not done. I and now I think others feel that a company should be held accountable for these type of actions. I have never asked for an extreme punishment, all I expected was for Doublebear to say what was going on to cause them to do this and to issue an apology to their loyal fans. Is open communication too much to ask for from the people who funded your game. Instead of dealing with my concerns directly Developers and mods have tried to silence myself and others. This game would not be a reality without people like me with our little 30 dollars. The attitude that I have seen from DoubleBear has come off at entitled and ungrateful for the opportunity that has been given to them. Now onto less important stuff. My defense.First of I want to say I was deeply offended by Annie Mitsoda's personal attacks on me on tumblr. Being called a @ickbag & #ucker was far less offensive than the way she disregards my 30 dollars. Just so you know that 30 bucks is three hours of my work day. I might be nothing to you but I put my hard earned money towards your dream.http://imgur.com/p97JvCIhttp://murderblonde.tumblr.com/post/105832304380/exhaustionBrain and friends at DoubleBear continue to claim I engaged in ""abusive comments towards both the devs and mods"" and this is why threads were locked and deleted. This is not the case , I as well never harassed anyone. They can't provide screen shot of where I did any of the things they claim because they did not happen. What screen shots of locked and deleted threads they do show are just snippets without showing what anyone else is say. I was never off topic ,never spammed, never directly attacked anyone. The claim that I harassed DoubleBear requesting a public apology be given to the community is just absurd. I was the only one on any of these forums to get banned when there were people making direct personal attacks on me that were defending the developers that were not even given a warning by the DoubleBear mods.1)First thread was shut down for no good reason.2)Second one I thought maybe they shut it down because the attacks on me. I knew I did not break the rules so I made another post pasting most of the OP and then adding another paragraph to make it new. This was right away shut down.3)Third post was a little snarky post about how they shut down post that are on the top that are critical.4)Fourth post was actually made by another person. This is the one I got banned in and I did nothing except ask Brian to say sorry. Never broke a forum rule once. No warning just a ban. Yes you will notice #114 &115 are back to back but that is only because the I did not copy the second part over from my wordpad. You will notice that there are several posts in between #115 and my next post. Too bad the devs only provide what I say in a attempt to manipulate the way this looks.http://imgur.com/tjdBGs9http://imgur.com/Tj84fUi5)I by this point was not happy. I felt like an American being silenced and someone who my 30 bucks and support was being treated like trash. I contacted the mod(Caidoz) through a private ban email. Its funny how they just provide one snippet of the conversation and deleted the email from my account so I can't provide a picture. Yes I did say I can just create tons of alt account in this private chat. I wanted Caidoz to know his ability to silence had no power over me. I never once said I was going to abuse this and mass spam threads or upvote my own review. First of the time and money it would take to get 300 accounts is ridiculous. http://imgur.com/l0XxiVXI have had this alt account for 6+ years and I did not use it until now to defend myself after many attacks. So with all the above being said I am a forgiving gamer. If DoubleBear publicly apologies for the early release and explains why they did it then I think everyone should forgive and get behind this company to help them finish what I think will be a great game when complete. On a personal note I think Brian and Annie Mitsoda's own me a private apology for the slander and attacks personally against me.Fierhorn79**********************************Review**********************************Wanted to start off by saying I was a huge supporter of this game pre Steam Early Access and during early access. I enjoyed beta testing the game for DoubleBear and helping them to use the EA process to better the game. I think the game is a blast even in its frustrating buggy state.Now onto the reason why I think people should not buy this game or support the company DoubleBear for any future games until the Give a public apology.I don't know about all of you but I found Kickstarter and Steam Early Access to be a wonderful breath of fresh air. I was sick of big AAA and medium sized AA Developers and Publishers pushing out 3/4 made buggy games that after I paid full price for had to wait months before it was patched up and enjoyable. This was the norm and I was sick of it.So I started supporting only EA and Kickstarter games, more than I could afford at times. Dead State is one of those games and I was very happy to support Doublebear.Sadly DoubleBear betrayed its fans and sought to deceive new buyers into believing that Dead State was a finished product in order to take full advantage of the Holiday shopping season. Brian and the Dead State team had pages of known bugs and some of them were game and story breaking. Ask yourself what reason would a Developer move a product that is known to be a buggy mess from Early Access to calling the game fully released. We the gamers are there Publisher and we were not on their backs pushing them to release the game in a unfinished state in order to reap the profit from the Holiday season. My over all point is that when small gamer funded games pull the same fast one as big AAA developers something has to be done about it. This type of behavior and not be rewarded.These type of actions corrupt the new system from within. If this is allowed to happen then we get get a bunch of small studios acting just like the AAA ones because they can. I and many others went onto Dead States forums to ask for an appology and get an answer why they felt the need to move a unfinished game from EA to fully released. We all found ourselves pounced on ,forum post locked and in several cases found ourselves banned. These type of actions are those of people wanting to hide what they did not ones wanting to correct the mistake that was made.I don't know DoubleBears reasons to fall to to such a low level. If they had funding problems there are so many other more honest options. We gamers have shown ourselves to be very giving.I ask people to avoid this game until the game is finished			"

Early Access Review
								Okay, so I'd be one of the first gamers to tell you that I do not buy early access games, even if i really want to play it, i dont want to ruin the finished product for myself. Well this game changed that for me. Specifically, it was reading reviews from people hailing how awesome the game was with over 500 hours logged into this game - an early access game with that many hours clocked in by one person really grabbed my attention.So, going out on a limb i decided to get this game - figuring hey, I'll at least get access to the full version when it comes out, and probably cheaper than if i waited.A good choice, I think. Now I only just started playing the game, but holy crap is it addicting as all hell!So, to start, the main gameplay of this game is a turn based RPG, much like Fallout 1 and 2 (hell even the UI is layed out the same for the most part), except you have a party of 4 that you take out on ventures with you. But the game is so much more than that. The travelling around and fighting is actually a small part of this game. The core of the game is that you're basically the leader of a Zombie apocalypse team that found themselves barricaded in a School. The school is your base, and you can upgrade the base with tons of different things, like a better fence, a workshop, a garage for fixing and building cars, and so much more.So how it works, is the game day starts at 8 am, and you got free roam of your school. You can go around talking to your team members, ask them about their attitude and certain things they'd like you to grab them from the field such as soap, or chocolate or what have you (getting these items for them will increase their morale, which plays a huge part in this game, but I'll get to that).You have a white board in the cafeteria, where you can allocate your members to go do certain jobs during the day, each job takes varying hours (and will decrease if you get another member to help them with it), mechanical jobs will go much faster if you have someone with a high mechanical skill doing those jobs.Each member has their own set of skills (as well as the PC that he chooses at the beginning of the game, and can increase as you 'level up') and you decide what jobs they do depending on their skills.While the rest of your team is doing jobs (you can have the PC do some of these various jobs, but you cant do anything while that happens), you can pick a team of up to 4 members as your raiding party. With these guys you can leave your base and get to travel the map (which is literally a map of texas, with all the interstates and towns and cities and all that). Travelling the map takes time, and is slower or faster depending on your travel method. At the start, you can only travel by foot, but later on you can get horses and even cars to speed up the process.As the time goes by during the day, your members back at base will be doing their tasks you assigned them, while you are finding random super markets, hospitals, neighbourhoods, and so on and looting any materials you can find, weapons, food, luxuries, parts and tools and so on.However, you MUST be back at your shelter by 3 am, otherwise you get a game over (im pretty sure, i never let myself be out that long yet), so obviously you cant travel too far from base without some sort of transportation.While going to various locations, you must avoid or kill zombies, who are not only hostile but if they get a bite on your allies while their health is low, they infect them. Your allies, if infected will go up to 3 days without treatment before they will kill themselves or turn into zombies and attack you. There are antibiotics you can find that as long as you have them in stock, your allies will take them staving off the infection (but not curing it), so you can keep infected allies indefinitely, you just need to have a supply of antibiotics.You can also find other people, looters who are hostile and you must kill to survive, to even other survivors you can recruit to join your cause. However, watch out when firing guns off liberally in a battlefield, as it attracts zombies, and getting guys infected is the last thing you need.On top of all this, the most important part of the game is your shelter Morale. You have a morale level that goes up and down depending on recent events and moods of allies. Every ally has their own morale level that can be increased by giving them special items, keeping a stock of luxury items on hand, and even having other allies do jobs such as cooking for the crew to bring morale up for everyone. Morale is affected by everything, ranging from having broken generators (or no gas to run them) to the amount of food on hand, to having a secure base or what have you.If morale with people get too low, they may find that they are better off out in the wasteland and leave your crew, to even if morale is so bad for everyone you can have a mutiny and your crew will outcast you from your own base.This game is so damn addicting, I wish i had more time to play it haha. I would recommend this game to any RPG fan out there, specifically if you like survival horror. A solid game, and worth the money for sure. I would even go as far to say that this one could be nominated as Game of the Year, especially if im only playing an unfinished product so far.			"

												Rating: 5.5/10. I've been playing this since early access.Pro:- The story-line is good, bring out the taste of the old RPG like Fallout.- Interesting decision making that will affect the storyline.- Highly replayable with different character class.- You can f**k a pretty chick, but only once. I'll give 10/10 if you can f***k all the characters anytime you like, I mean come on in zombie apocalypse dire time we need this.- They did add and change the game feature based on the suggestion from the early access players. Cons:- Until now the character face customization is still not available in full version. When asked they replied the developer will add in this feature when they got time.- Not worth current price, wait for less than 10 dollar or so. Better spend your money on Wasteland 2- Wait until they fix all the F**king bugs, it's still buggy and the developer started to slow down because the sales had slow down as well. *they claimed to fix when they are free (or when people are purchasing this game)- The developer company is greedy. The developer had raised 330K Dollar in kickstarter, which is more than enough to finish an indie game like this and startup a new company. Not to mentioned they got sales on Steam.In conclusion: Game wise, really mixed up. Recommend this game but just buy Wasteland 2 1st and wait for 80% sales. Not worth the current price. The later you buy this game the better			"

Early Access Review
								Well, i'm a kickstarter backer and...i'm disapointed. This stuff is terrible. Disgusting everything - design, gameplay, interface, dialogs, location. Sorry, but it's a failure.			"

												I'm a huge fan of turn-based combat and post apocalyptic settings, so Dead State was an absolute treat to play.  There are some minor bugs that turn up now and then and some frustrating line of sight issues that allow enemies to shoot at you through walls and doors, but on the whole Dead State is both fun and challenging.

												This game is one of the better zombie survival games, where you actually have to survive. You have to make sure your defenses are good, you have food and water, and that you have medicine for when the survivors get sick. You have to manage your resourses else your group won't survive for long. The turn based combat is reminicent of titles such as fire emblem and final fantasy tactics making so that even people new to playing won't have too much dificulty picking the game up. There is a con, the invintory system is confusing to use at first but once you understand how it works it's simple. Overall I would rate this game an 8/10.			"

												Dead State is a game in the tradition of Wasteland and the early (isometric) Fallout games.In spite of the fantastical setting of a Zombie apocalypse, the characters are very relatable. You are a survivor of an airplane crash (the pilots got overwhelmed by the infected) and you find shelter with a few other survivors in a local school. You need to repair the fence, find food and fuel for the generator and most importantly you need to keep up morale. You can assign tasks for the people to repair or build things, like a recycler, a well, a workshop, a roof garden and so on. Gradually you become more and more self-sufficient. You can find new survivors to strengthen your workforce, but you also have to manage their conflicts and deal with crisis events, and maintain your authority.You can lead a scavenging party of max 4 to find resources and contacts outside the shelter. Zombies are everywhere, and you are in constant danger of being swarmed by them, and even have your people bitten and infected. You may also find armed looters, gangbangers, hostile survivalists, rogue soldiers, and demoralized police on your path.Although the graphics and sound effects are basic, they are expressive and effective.The game is quite engaging and suspenseful, and I can recommend it with the caveat that this game can really, really test your patience.There is an extensive demo available.

												This is a really good game. some minor complaints i have is how hard sneaking is or if you had an abundance of food/fresh food you could increase moral by perhaps 25-30 by holding a feast or something. Also early game can be really hard in the sense that the only way to get good items like the UZI, rifles ect. is by killing coyote bandits and if all you have is 38.s and 9mm pistols or maybe a sawed off with low ranged skill, good luck have fun. 9/10			"

												After playing big games like for instance elder scrolls online, (disapointments) i really enjoyed this modest game, It has a great story line and a rewarding gameplay. They put a lot of thought in the characters! If you really follow what the characters say , its even very funny.Despite of a lot of bugs in the game  i liked it, that says a lot. Even with all the bugs, the game is good enough to let you ignore them, also because they are not game breaking bugs.Some unresponding enemy´s. often in your advantage. Some problems with buildings, with more then two stories. And an occasional reaccuring problem with a friend standing in the middle of a hospital bed.So decide for yourself, i'll give the game a thumbs up because i think the game deserves it, but keeping in mind that there are still bugs that need to be fixed.For the money that i payed for it, i can ignore the bug's but now the game is finished (to soon) i think that with those bugs it's a bit to expensive. The developers should finish their game.Edit/There was another update, so that´s positive. I will have to play the game again, to see what´s what. After i do that i will edit this review.Conclusion, I liked the game and i don´t have any regrets buying it. No it´s not perfect, but it´s something else.			"

												One of the best turn based roleplaying games ever made. Graphics are decent, but run slowly when show crowds and sometimes crushes to desktop: to avoid problems save quickly as an habit, in this case the effort worth because game is really good. Mechanics is wonderfull, remembers the firsts Fallout titles, but has deeper rules because the player lead a group and their shelter for everything: build upgrades, craft or repair items, manage social conflicts, find more survivals and needs as food, fuel, materials... is really advisable read the manual. Combat is oriented to patience tactics, silence, concealment and ambush. Types of weapons and armours are variety and complete. There are two kind of foes, humans of hostile  factions and classic zombies. The sandbox map is huge, with 60 locations, each with a specific situation. Think logically is important, decisions bring consequences and different endings.Texts of choices and missions has no bugs. Touch every common topic of apocalyptical genre, and is really long: explore every corner take circa 200 hours. By the adult dialogues, lack of frenzy action and technical issues, not recommendable for teenagers.			"

												Has a very amateurish feeling unfortunately (even for a indie), lacks atmosphere. Seems very sloppy too (playing the latest / last build too), e.g im supposed to fix a fence, i fix the refrigerator (only thing there was to fix, for some reason??), game tells me i fixed the fence.. lol.I don't know, i get the feeling they just didn't care too much about this game. It clearly has some things going for it that potentially could be great, but the effort isnt there, it's dull. Very unfortunate imo, been so looking forward to a zombie game. Backed this game ages ago and waited years to try it (wanted it fully patched etc to have the best experience).   "

												Awesome little game, quite addictive and I adore the effort they went through to make sets feel like they're a part of a zombie apoc, as opposed to some games I can think of. My only gripe is the game is way too easy. I've never had anyone die, people should be dying left right and center. That and it suffers from static looking NPCs, takes away from the base-immersion slightly. Still I immagine double-bear wll work on these elements.			"

												IF YOU'RE HAVING ISSUES WITH THE GAME CRASHING TRY THIS:http://steamcommunity.com/app/239840/discussions/1/620713633843067876/I was at my wit's end trying to run this game. The longest I could play it was 10 minutes before game crash, freeze (requiring manual close), computer lockup (requiring manual reboot) and game crashing so hard that it caused involuntary reboot (sometimes with BSOD!).I have a fast system with dual GPU's that can run high graphics (I used auto detect), so there's no issues with the base hardware. [I have no issues with any other games.]I used Display Driver Uninstall to install a perfectly new/clean version of my graphics drivers.I REINSTALLED WINDOWS 10! I'm still annoyed at all the stuff I have to reconfigure or reinstall.Even after that, the game failed again and again.I was ready to leave a thumbsdown when I finally found that Troubleshooting Guide.Something on there solved my problem and now the game runs basically fine. If you're having issues with the game crashing, try it before leaving a negative review.I suppose you may not like the actual game but in my opinion what you see is what you get. It's exactly what I wanted.Well, I wanted a game that was supported by the developer, but we can't have it all.			"

												A zombie RPG with base building and depth.  Combat reminds me a bit like the original Fallout.  Skill trees, upgrades, resource management, being able to give your other surivors meaningful orders....There is literally no part of the above that is done poorly.  Cannot recommend enough if what you are looking for is described above.  The tutorial is a bit long though, so many features are disabled until you are a few hours in.  Don't judge it based on the first couple missions; everyhting isn't unlocked yet.			"

												Fun turn based zombie apoco game.Great for a indy title.However, I do believe small additions can make this game great for any production level.It needs a bit more customization. Don't force the main character to remain.Have it if he dies you can continue as the other survivors. So it becomes group focused, instead of a single leader.Taking a few notes from XCom this could be a amazing experience especially for a Ironman mode play through.I personally believe you need voiced dialogue for the responses. But it is understandable not to, it would increase the story for me at least. With out the emotional reaction of the voice actors it is no where near as impactful.Aside customization of your own character, and maybe other survivors in your group.They have done a great job with the items you get, and luxury items.They could extend a bit more, but that at this time for the first entry is well done.Instead of it focusing specifically in Texas. Maybe have it focused around a country.This is near the start so it makes sense for walking distance places to have supplies still.But, it would make it more interesting if you traveled across a landscape to get supplies.Such as multiple states. As well it gives the opportunity for different environments.A lot is here, and the fundamental system is great for what it is. But it could be great, as of now it is good.I suggest picking it up if you are a turned based RPG fan.			"

												This game caught a lot of flack at first because it was released a bit early, and if we are talking honestly it probably did. It was buggy and I would save often cause I knew lots of things could go wrong. I think that effected the ratings quite a bit. BUT with the new changes and even before this game holds up.  If you like people and recourse managment you'll like this game. There is a real sense of urgency, of trying to squeeze as much out of everyday as you can. Once you have 20+ mouths to feed you have to be sure everything is gonna run smoothly. The human enemies are certainly tough and finding new ways to fight each group or situation is always entertaining as well as challenging.			"

												I updated this review, here why:http://steamcommunity.com/app/239840/discussions/0/624076851253971030/EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAnd after a lot of time there is, Dead State!I was looking forward to this game, since the kickstarted but i was waiting for the Steam realease.First of all remember, you are PRE-ORDERING the game with a little discount ( 5 bucks ) and you will get a demo to play a bit and when it's out you will get the full game!I played it until the end 6 hours in total, explored all the places, scavenging all around the Texas and soo on.I found the game really good, it's interesting and has a great concept and mechaning but he has some things to clarify:1) The game is good for me, i'm a game zombie fan and i always loved such games where you can manage everything and do wathever you want like State of Decay, but i'm a bit disappoint from the Demo because he seems to be always repetitive and it's always the same in everything, for example l was forced to do 3 playgrounds because of some bugs with the Save / Load system and i thinked ""Maybe now it's a bit different, the zombies are in random places, looters are founded in random places and soo on"" but for now it's always the same, zombies in same places and they are even the same textures, looters always at the same places and they don't move except rare times only the loot seems to be random2) I liked a lot the X-Com turn based combat system, it's interesting and i found it fun, even the add of the noise detector it's interesting, wich means everything you shot your noise have the chance to attract more zombies out and inside the map, this can be used has a lure and a lot of other tactics, for example i explored a place with only my character and i found it with 5-6 Looters with better weapons / armor of me, soo i shotted around and 3-4 zombies of map have come, i lured them to the looters and they have killed almost all of them and the looters have become zombies and they have killed all the other looters then i killed all the other zombies and i conquered the camp with only a revolver and a fireaxe, this concept it's very interesting and can be an obastacle lf you want to use a lot of firearms and going around doing call of duty 360noscope.3) The story for now was interesting, but nothing special i think, i hope this game will become more ""Freeroaming"" because for now he seems too linear and withtout a lot of choice possible, they say the game will be ""Months"" long and with over 10.000 dialogue options but i really hope they will give us a repliability, because there is no point to play this game lf all the things will be always the same except for the little decisions we can make ( Example, to save some survivors, making visits in places and such ), i really hope for a freeroaming game4) The places to visit are not a lot ( around 7-10 for now ) 1 supermarket, 1 pharmacy, 1 enemy camp with bandits, 1 town all of the starting city, 1 resident area of the starting city, 1 random church and other places now i don't remember, they are interesting, very well made and the effects are ok for now, but has i told you they are always the same, zombies in the same places, not too much to interact with just sometimes the bags you found around and i found them already boring for now even because the zombies don't move! I will find it more funny lf random zombies can come out of the map and roam around the map, but for now this can be not a problem, since a lot features are not been implemented yet soo we just need to wait to see the rest of the game for now.5) The crafting part of the game was interesting, but not too much for now. You have the same jobs of some games ( Farmer, Doctor, Nurse, Chemical, Mechanic and soo on ) but for now they can't craft for you a lot even because you can't build the areas you need to make them work. For what i have seen you can only craft some things like lethear armors, military armors and helmets, your own ammunitions for pistols / rifles ecc but there is not too much variety he seems like State of Decay where you can craft only little things like molotovs or fireworks to lure the zombies away.6) The place where your hide it's a school, a normal place we see in some zombie movies or in zombies games ( Like Zombie Fort lf somebody knows that title ) and it's very well maded, a lot of classrooms where can become new areas, basements, garden where you will build farms and other things, but for now everything it's looked. He seems a bit empty for now even because the npc's you have are just stuck in the same place with the same pose and withtout an animation, soo they are like statues and it's a bit sad.7) The animations for now are nothing cool, the zombie animations for when they try to bite you are ok, when they die they use the same pose ( Soo for example lf two zombies dies in the same space, you can loot only one ) and it's nothing different, the walk of the character is nothing special even for the looters and when the zombies uses normal attack they just slap your face sometimes.For me the game is great, he has a lot of potential and can be fun! For now you can't do anything and there is no point to play it more then 1 max 2 times, i hope they will add a lot of random things, they will fix the enemies stuck in the same poses forever, they make the game a bit more ""Live"", random zombies / events and such. For now lf you want it look first on some gameplays on youtube because he can be for now a bit frustrating to buy, or you can simply wait the 3-5 months they said for the game to finish.Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad english, but it's not my main language :3			"

												While there are some issues like the occasional random crash, sometimes wonky camera controls, a lack of an indicator for max carrry weight while looting something(95.3/110 for example. all you see is the 95.3). and most recently, the innability to communicate with a dog I found in a house because apparently with dogs i can only speak to them from behind, and this dog has his back to a wall, so i can't interact with it at all, I would certainly recomend this game to SHTF gamers and people who enjoy RPG meets base building.Its kind of like 'wasteland 2' meets 'state of decay'/'the walking dead'EDIT: almost a year since the last time I reviewed this game, and while it feels more polished in a lot of ways, it still has some issues.still no max weight indicator like 95.3/110.00. all you see while looting is the 95.3. you have to go directly to your inventory to see your actual max carry capacity.when a particular character jumps the fence and leaves the shelter during the night, the narrative and dialogue tell me that he took ONLY his axe and that he wasnt the type to steal, and yet the electrified baton, corrogated shield, and the armor with 8 defence(whos name escapes me) are missing as well.Enemies sometimes move on top of one another and get 'stuck' where neither one can move, can sometimes attack, and cant be killed(in my experience).The screen sometimes jumps around a bit RIIIIIGHT when I'm selecting my move/attack target and I waste a turn goig in some random direction instead of attacking. this usually isn't too much of a problem, but in a tough fight where every single turn counts... it caused me to waste about 1 hour of time having to reload after the camera jump caused 2 of my party to die.

												Dead State has positives and negatives.  I expected a completely open world which, frankly, has been a standard since Might and Magic and Baldur's Gate.  I restarted the game to carefully follow the tutorial.  Then I had to figure out myself how to find locations on the map when they're not already marked so I restarted again because I lost a day or two.  Later I learned that you will not find some locations until an ally tells you about them.Despite that, I found Dead State to be fun and engrossing.  The shelter, the upgrades, the morale system, and the crafting system are all excellent.  Combat is flexible and you can approach a fight in many different ways.  I spent about 30 hours on the first 16 days and enjoyed it a lot.After that, I started to find some of the religious, political, and personal issues of the allies to be a pain in the butt.   I just wanted to survive the zombie apocalypse not be a politician and social counselor.   If there are zombies around your fence, aren't people going to be a little more concerned about survival.  Some of these allies that  show up are just plain unrealistic.  It's like Dead State turned into some nightmare, reality show.Finding comfort items and medicine for allies was great.  Looking for family members - awesome.  Beyond that, if things are brought up I'd rather look at it through the lens of surviving the immdediate threat of zombies.  For most people, I think a safe place from zombies is more than enough to keep their morale up.  Just my opinion.So I'm giving the game a qualified thumbs up.			"

												I updated this review, here why:http://steamcommunity.com/app/239840/discussions/0/624076851253971030/EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAnd after a lot of time there is, Dead State!I was looking forward to this game, since the kickstarted but i was waiting for the Steam realease.First of all remember, you are PRE-ORDERING the game with a little discount ( 5 bucks ) and you will get a demo to play a bit and when it's out you will get the full game!I played it until the end 6 hours in total, explored all the places, scavenging all around the Texas and soo on.I found the game really good, it's interesting and has a great concept and mechaning but he has some things to clarify:1) The game is good for me, i'm a game zombie fan and i always loved such games where you can manage everything and do wathever you want like State of Decay, but i'm a bit disappoint from the Demo because he seems to be always repetitive and it's always the same in everything, for example l was forced to do 3 playgrounds because of some bugs with the Save / Load system and i thinked ""Maybe now it's a bit different, the zombies are in random places, looters are founded in random places and soo on"" but for now it's always the same, zombies in same places and they are even the same textures, looters always at the same places and they don't move except rare times only the loot seems to be random2) I liked a lot the X-Com turn based combat system, it's interesting and i found it fun, even the add of the noise detector it's interesting, wich means everything you shot your noise have the chance to attract more zombies out and inside the map, this can be used has a lure and a lot of other tactics, for example i explored a place with only my character and i found it with 5-6 Looters with better weapons / armor of me, soo i shotted around and 3-4 zombies of map have come, i lured them to the looters and they have killed almost all of them and the looters have become zombies and they have killed all the other looters then i killed all the other zombies and i conquered the camp with only a revolver and a fireaxe, this concept it's very interesting and can be an obastacle lf you want to use a lot of firearms and going around doing call of duty 360noscope.3) The story for now was interesting, but nothing special i think, i hope this game will become more ""Freeroaming"" because for now he seems too linear and withtout a lot of choice possible, they say the game will be ""Months"" long and with over 10.000 dialogue options but i really hope they will give us a repliability, because there is no point to play this game lf all the things will be always the same except for the little decisions we can make ( Example, to save some survivors, making visits in places and such ), i really hope for a freeroaming game4) The places to visit are not a lot ( around 7-10 for now ) 1 supermarket, 1 pharmacy, 1 enemy camp with bandits, 1 town all of the starting city, 1 resident area of the starting city, 1 random church and other places now i don't remember, they are interesting, very well made and the effects are ok for now, but has i told you they are always the same, zombies in the same places, not too much to interact with just sometimes the bags you found around and i found them already boring for now even because the zombies don't move! I will find it more funny lf random zombies can come out of the map and roam around the map, but for now this can be not a problem, since a lot features are not been implemented yet soo we just need to wait to see the rest of the game for now.5) The crafting part of the game was interesting, but not too much for now. You have the same jobs of some games ( Farmer, Doctor, Nurse, Chemical, Mechanic and soo on ) but for now they can't craft for you a lot even because you can't build the areas you need to make them work. For what i have seen you can only craft some things like lethear armors, military armors and helmets, your own ammunitions for pistols / rifles ecc but there is not too much variety he seems like State of Decay where you can craft only little things like molotovs or fireworks to lure the zombies away.6) The place where your hide it's a school, a normal place we see in some zombie movies or in zombies games ( Like Zombie Fort lf somebody knows that title ) and it's very well maded, a lot of classrooms where can become new areas, basements, garden where you will build farms and other things, but for now everything it's looked. He seems a bit empty for now even because the npc's you have are just stuck in the same place with the same pose and withtout an animation, soo they are like statues and it's a bit sad.7) The animations for now are nothing cool, the zombie animations for when they try to bite you are ok, when they die they use the same pose ( Soo for example lf two zombies dies in the same space, you can loot only one ) and it's nothing different, the walk of the character is nothing special even for the looters and when the zombies uses normal attack they just slap your face sometimes.For me the game is great, he has a lot of potential and can be fun! For now you can't do anything and there is no point to play it more then 1 max 2 times, i hope they will add a lot of random things, they will fix the enemies stuck in the same poses forever, they make the game a bit more ""Live"", random zombies / events and such. For now lf you want it look first on some gameplays on youtube because he can be for now a bit frustrating to buy, or you can simply wait the 3-5 months they said for the game to finish.Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad english, but it's not my main language :3			"

												Dead State is a different approach to all the Zombie games out there. The game is driven by npc characters personal stories which are many of times linked to missions and side quests. The game's main focus is not on combating zombies but base upgrading and keepings your surviving npcs morale happy and keeping them safe in zombie apocalyptic world. Combating zombies is only an obstacle to these objectives and your base can come under attack by the living and the dead. Among your npcs are personalites that may clash with each other and even you the Protagonist in the story. Zombies can kill you if you dont plan an attack when you approach them in a turn base combat. Outside of combat is free roam. Think of this game like ""This war of Mine"" meets ""wasteland 2"". The developers seem to be continuing to fix bugs and add more contents to this final release game...			"

												Great little gem, the graphics aren't impressive and the UI looks a little bland but don't let them fool you, the game itself is very good, you get to explore a dead world, face hostile survivors, avoid (if you want) to kill innocent ones, even if they are rather aggressive and manage your shelter by building upgrades, negotiating with the people inside, dealing with the forming factions, listening to requests and making decisions. There really isn't something like this in the market right now.			"

												I have exactly 100 hours of a single play through in this game, so I figured I would give a quick impression. This has probably been my most enjoyed zombie apocalypse themed game yet, and I have played almost every offering on the market. The game does need smoothing out and some balancing and some randomization for the map and big story events or end game would go a long way to make the game more replayable. That said, the scavenging, base management, and combat is all addictively enjoyable. Even the character development was very well done and each path of skill advancement can have a huge impact of how you tackle the zombie apocalypse (i.e. you are not required to be a combat monkey to succeed). For fans of turn based RPGs with base management elements, I would highly recommend you pick this up!			"

												Great game, needs more shelter upgrades though. I had recruited 40 people at the end and there was just not enough room. Something like expanding the size of the Shelter Fort would have been cool.One thing, everyone came to me with their problems, loss of loved ones, depression, hunger, sickness whatever - But nobody ever asked how I felt. Or tried to help me, apart from Grant I suppose but im not sure if he counts.I would have liked it if the player character wasnt so invincible, maybe they should have had the ocasional sick day or depression, I mean in my game he had just lost his whole family, wife an dkids in the plane crash. And all he gets is ""Oh sorry about that, listen would you mind being our leader and going out and finding materials to repair the fence and food and stuff thanks bye.""Also its strange that the Player has to lead every scavenger party, what if you were playing as a scientist or a mechanic? ANd your skills are needed back at the fort, building upgrades, repairing the wall, making bullets? No sorry you have to lead the scavenger team so you have to put points into Ranged, Melee and Survival. Anything else is just a waste. Why bother giving us the freedom to create our own character, then railroad us into having to make them a soldier/fighter?Zombies got really repetitive to fight after a while, but the Human enemies were fantastic.Otherwise its a great game, I hope they make a sequel as it definately could use some improvements and be even better.

												I want to like this game.  I want to play this game.  Unfortunately, the game has different plans.There's a mid-game mission where your small team raids a large biker gang base.The first time through, I was doing well - getting through by the skin of my teeth, coming up with solutions to both biker attacks and zombies, playing them against each other.  Two women in plate mail I'd scavenged from a Medieval Times restaurant were wailing on everyone with swords and explosives while a Vietnam veteran made headshot after headshot and a veterinary student ran around bandaging the wounded.  I'd been at it for two hours without saving - the game doesn't let you save in battle, and isn't great at detecting when you're not in battle, so the whole map is essentially one long slog.  I was almost done but then . . . the game hard crashed.Okay.  Fine.  It happens.  Like fifty zombies and gang members, that's a lot to calculate, I guess I can sympathize.  Second time through, let's try this again.This time, I was betrayed by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way the game handles stairs.  The second half of this battle is arranged in such a way that, unless you are extremely lucky, one person gets stuck in the tiny space between the bottom stair landing and a nearby enemy.  The rest of the team, rifles in hand, sits around at the top of the stairs and picks their noses, unable to come down the stairs or affect anything on the first floor until a space is cleared - which it won't be, because the one person able to go down the stairway will, within a turn, be gunned down.  So your other three party members sit, helpless, as their friend slowly bleeds to death, because she's blocking the tiny space allotted to stairway movement with her heavily armored unconscious body.  This is after forty-five minutes of pitched, unsave-able battle, mind you.This last I allow was my fault tactics wise, but, my god.  I had, essentially, a sniper at the top of the stairs, unable to help his friend six vertical feet away.That said, rage aside, I can't bring myself to not recommend this game.  It's one of the best-written RPGs I've played in a while, and hits just the right combination of despair and hope with its mechanics.I mean, I'm extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.  I feel cheated of more than one long-fought victory.  But once I've cooled down, I know I'll try that battle again, and cross my fingers that nothing breaks this time, because I really do want to bring my little group of survivors through the zombie apocalypse to better times.

												If you like turn based zombie survival ... buy this game.  The last big update was a while ago but it fixed major issues and addressed a few things the community wanted changed.  The character stories are not deep but they are engaging; however, the overall storyline dies towards the end and leaves a successful character with an opportunity to death spiral wondering what there is next to do.  For the price though it can't be beat.			"

												I enjoyed it.  I played it twice through to try different approaches (Mr. Goody-goody, and Mr. Brutal-pragmatist).  I almost gave up half-way through the second play because it was not that different, and was VERY repetitive by then.  Not much replay value. A few glitchy moments, but nothing game breaking. However, I really did enjoy the first play-through, and it was well worth my time.  Catch it on a good sale, and you won't be disappointed.			"

												Full disclosure: I backed this game on Kickstarter.  What is Dead State?  It's a game that does a similar premise to State of Decay, but in a different way.  Instead of a 3D action game, this is an Isometric X-Com-a-like with traditional turn-based combat.  It is not an easy game early on, with difficulty decreasing as better equipment is found.  I *cough* resorted to some save scumming (reload and come back with more firepower) if I misread who the foes would be or wandered into a place that ended up having unusually tough enemies.   I managed to beat the game after 79 hours of play, but managed to defeat it on my first try.  There is a bit of grind-y nature to discovery, looting and zombie-battling.All in all, though, I enjoyed the game enough to play through it entirely to see it through.  I did lose interest around Day 70 and more or less had to power through the next 20 or so.  I don't know if I'll play it again since I was sucessful.  I can see if someone doesn't manage to beat it wanting to try it again, though. "

No.I can see massive improvements since the demo, but 3 years in, Im wondering how big the dev team is (2 people? 3?), because they still have a massive way to go (check out the list of known bugs, none of which include the short list I made while playing).Save your money, this game isn't ready yet.

												All that time wasted,I finally get things under control, remove the bad apples from my group and what does the game do, The game shoots you in the head if your moral is not above 0. Go back a few saves and do things different, still shoots you in the head.  Apparently you were expected to play the game thru as a leader the placates the week and stupid characters, even though you are given the options during dialog to play a strong leader, but if you do play that way, without warning the game just kills you.  Even this could be forgiven if it did not take so long to get to this point. I will not waste another minute of my life on this game, and neither should you. Now I am off to clear up some wasted hard drive space… This game was one inch from being great then it shoot itself in the head. "

												So far, the game is LONG and HARD. Straight off the bat, you'll be hit with a minus ## in morale - don't worry, just keep going out and try your BEST not to get your guys KO'ed. If you see a red skull show up next to a character, HIGHLY SUGGEST that you reload (game autosaves everytime you enter and leave an area) - red skull means infected and will NEVER go away.Love the tactics that can be used in the game, tons of loot EVERYWHERE, there's quite a bit of realism, like the hacking mechanic in the game, and though annoying, panic and horror does make battles harder or easier (depends on which side gets hit by those ""run for your life!!"" character freak outs).Pros: - Dead State uses a REAL map from Texas (the only area that seems made up is ""Splendid"") for the game map. - Lots of different types of enemies. - Sound alerting the undead/infected is a plus for realism. - Large number of built upgrades (as well as equipment modifications). - Unlike a lot of zombie games, there are TONS of recruit-able allies. - There's a vote system (once Vic gets back). - Can pick lock doors, disarm security alarms, or simply kick the door in. - And a powerful yet unstable psycho character can join you (sad when I lost him).Cons: (a lot need correcting and fixing)- Typos and spelling errors EVERYWHERE! - Tutorial mentions that you can sneak up on enemies (FALSE).- Animals and Crawling infected are far more likely to KO player than those standing up! (WTF?)- Feeling of being forced to build places (allies want it, don't get it done by #day, they leave).- Boyfriend infuriated you didn't tell him about girlfriend (not spoiling) even though you are NEVER given the option TO TELL HIM (add the option, makes zero sense to not be able to tell him an him getting infuriated cause you didn't say anything!!).- Turn Order (top right of screen) - Understand when the enemies you're fighting are in the turn order display, but SERIOUSLY cycling through EVERY SINGLE ENEMY ON THE LEVEL? (Big Con!)- Characters in Panic/Horror can make losing pretty easy (both pro and con).- Areas do not respawn loot & enemies (realism is a pro) but expects player to remember if area is cleared completely or not (# of times visited and days since last visit is ok, but having to remember what is cleared an what isn't can get annoying and wasteful since Time isn't on our side).- Allies' Moods feel broke - It gets frustrating & annoying when despite your efforts, the ""moods"" don't ever seem to change (Morale is oddly separate from this).- Cannot pick skill & stat point use for Allies. Though it adds to challenge, it still blows that the skill & stat points for allies is out of the player's control, this just forces a player to not bother with the pathetic allies, keep the important ones at home, and pray the allies that go out with you don't focus on a skill you don't favor (more of a con than pro).- And Todd. He prays while we act. He thanks god instead of us. Seriously tempted to commit Wrath on him....Despite all the cons in the game, frankly Dead State is STILL a good game. There's a lot of stories in this game based on the characters you befriend, and those you just outright want to body slam through a wall. Feels like Final Fantasy Tactics meets The Walking Dead - both very good games, and Dead State feels like a mix of the two.Yeah there's a lot of cons that I listed, and not many pros - but most of the cons are personally (my opinion) what needs to be fixed, changed, and corrected by the developer of Dead State. Once those are taken care of, the pros will undoubtedly outnumber the cons.The game's graphics aren't spectacular, but the visuals matter little when the gameplay is experienced. To the Game Developer of Dead State - Please take note of the listed Cons, most are errors, typos, bugs, and others are simply game mechanics that need adjustments. This game could be awesome, COULD BE (has the potential), but right now its just a good game. I've barely explored the map, gotten many tough battles, and made quite a number of interesting allies. Honest Opinion of the game: 7.5/10. If most of the listed cons are fixed, changed, or adjusted, it could easily become 9/10.			"

												What a piece of garbage, is what I seriously feel towards this game and the attitude the game devs put into this game. I really don't mind if a game stays indie for a long time. But seriously?, when you have games so abandoned you get the same wasted potential that you get from Day Z. I actually backed this game out for Kickstarters, because I felt as though this game was going to be worked hard on.What did I get a 6/10 burnt out trash, with broken gameplay that supported you retrying a level dozens of times, just HOPING that the game doesn't crash on you. Sneaking and Combat are both lackluster in this game. You always feel like your getting no where in this game.Music is 7/10, It's mediocre nothing memorable but not god awful as well.Gameplay is 4/10 Complete garbage, rarely works and when it does it still always encourages luck wayy to much compared to strategic planning.Maps is 5/10 some of the maps are reasonably large for the character and diverse but the chances that you would enjoy them is horrendously wasted due to lack luster gameplay and incredibly repetetive routines.Seriously there are far better Zombie Survival games out there, I can't believe I'm saying this but EVEN DEAD STATE WAS BETTER THAN THIS.

								Such potential.....Thing is it looks and plays like a N64 game, the animation are laughable but yet it still could be fun.BUT there are no difficulty settings, yes weird i know, im only on my third mission i think it is and they tear my team apart, leaving 2 or 3 of them standing full health with guns and even shotguns, the balance is pathetic tbh.Oh and i have hardly seen any Zeds, every enemy is a Human Looter, sheesh.If you want TBC then go for Xcom, Wasteland 2 and The Banner Saga, all of these are far far superior and polished than this, as they would be as this one is early Release, but you can see the style etc they are going for.Its just the little effort in things i notice, but the graphics are terrible, the animations are from the 80's, all forgiveable if the gameplay was addictive, and it is not, as mentioned the difficulty is very very hard and there is NO difficulty settings at all, combined with the poor, even terrible unbalance makes it a hell to play.I wont reccomend it till its further down the line , but keep a eye on this one it ccould be good in the end, but with the unbalance its just infuriating to play, its certainly not fun.

								I love zombie games. State of Decay, Project Zomboid etc etc. I don't love this. I don't even like this. Combat is awful. Story is completely missing. (I do realise it is an Alpha but seriously.) Dialogue choices matter precisely 0%. Map system and how you move about is even worse than the combat. Furthermore, you - and I, have been lied to. This is not early access in the slightest. It's a demo. Which you will be able to get for free when it's released. DO NOT BUY IT YET. Maybe I jumped the gun, loving everything zombie. But that was 19 pounds I'll never get back. Wait till the demo is free, I even followed this game during development, and on their site for years it has had nothing about demos or release dates, and now they are selling the DEMO. Not early access. I realise I have mentioned this twice but that is how much it F***ed me off.			"

								I liked the looting part and interaction between the different characters but unfortunately the cons out weigh the pros. as for the cons here's a list.1. Bad combat. the combat needs to be improved for example the cop in the game misses almost all the time with the pistol even though the target is right next to him.2. No checkpoints. If you die that is it and you have to start over from the beginning. maybe a hardcore mode/regular mode?3. The esc key. If you press the esc key in game it takes you to the main menu and loses your game progress so you have to start over.( this is what did it for me to make this review)4. main character is the only one able to go out in the world. granted you can bring people with you but you can't send people to different locations to collect supplies? little unrealistic.5. Being able to target your party in combat is very frustration. why is that even an option?!I understand this is still beta/early game release and there is more work to be done but until these issues are fixed Im not playing it again. this game has great potential. don't ruin it			"

												I recommend this game. It is fun, it is challenging, it has good gameplay value. You will enjoy it for 40+ hours, you get ok value for your money.  It's not particulary buggy, it plays well and is balanced. So that's all the good bits.Unfortunately, the game, even the reanimated game, seems like it was never really finished. Unless your not very good at playing these type of games, you will probably level out your base and fully kit out your team a long time before you get close to actually finishing the story line.I never finished the story line, towards the end of the game, it just became a grind, all my people were sitting in the base playing video games, it got boring, even the story got a bit boring, like they had used all their inspiration in the 1st 20+ hours of gameplay.So overall, this is a good game, but it makes you kind of sad, as with a little more work to pace the story line with the skills and gear progression, this would have been an amazing game.Enjoy.

												I tried the demo and it seemed interesting. So I bought it for $8 bucks on sale. That's what I feel this game is worth. The combat is rather simple once you figure it out. Z's will attack the closet person for the most part and if you have a fire ax/sledge it's game over for them. Guns are pointless because they alert everything in the area (which is realistic). You can ""add"" stuff to your shelter by saving up enough parts and working on it for a number of ingame days. This adds a slight bonus and takes away from the monotony slightly.So basically every day you go out and do the same thing, search for food, fuel, and luxery items to make your people happy. With combat rather simple it's a rinse and repeat grind waitng for the next addition to fisnih so you can  start buidling the next ""addition""  that will add another slight (and I mean Slight) bonus to your base. And then wait as your people make weapons/grenades for you. I wish steam had an meh okay button instead of recoomend or not. It's not a bad game but it's not an amazing game either. It kept me interested for 18+ hours but seeing as there is no real story line beyond just collecting loot I don't think I'll put much more into it.			"

								before i get started i should say that i do like the game. its fun! but its got problems. and right now id say anyone who's thinking of getting this game should hold off. the bugs are to many and have in some cases force you to quit and reload. other bugs make the game feel off like the dialogue.the dialogue has a lot of bugs, some are nothing to worry about. one however caused around 3 people to die, when only 1 should have. the game play is ok but needs more work. some content is either not there or doesn't work at all. like some NPC given jobs. im told to go here to find someone, i go there and nothing happens... at all.one more thing, i really feel like this should be said. it's been going around that the game is to be made a full release on 4/12/2014i dont in anyway think the game will be ready by then. unless they're holding out on fixes and content that should have been released now.all that said hold off till the game is a full release and people who have bought the game already have a chance to review it. i also honestly feel like the devs may be thinking about running off and leaving a half baked game behide. seen it happen a fair bit and my gut is telling me it could happen here.

Long story short, I changed my mind after looking at the youtube reviews as well as reading up on the good reviews again and I decided to try this.  I have not regretted it since, this is the only game I look forward to coming back from work to play and I have repeatedly tried to find every spare time that I have to play this game.   The story is very good, the base building, ally recruitment, and exploration is fun and the turn base aspect allows me to play a leisurely game that I can pause at any time.Folks who liked old school fall out, will love this game.hope this review helps...cheersChungie			"

												The game is pretty decent to start with, but becomes overly tedious towards the end. And the endings themselves are completely lackluster.Which is a shame, because there was some interesting exploration of humanity in the wake of a massive disaster; ethical conundrums where you have to weigh the needs of the many against the few; what to do with criminals, and even one situation where you have to help decide what happens with a pregnancy.So it is a shame that the ending was as dull as it was. No real resolution to the story, at all.			"

												I recommend this game. It is fun, it is challenging, it has good gameplay value. You will enjoy it for 40+ hours, you get ok value for your money.  It's not particulary buggy, it plays well and is balanced. So that's all the good bits.Unfortunately, the game, even the reanimated game, seems like it was never really finished. Unless your not very good at playing these type of games, you will probably level out your base and fully kit out your team a long time before you get close to actually finishing the story line.I never finished the story line, towards the end of the game, it just became a grind, all my people were sitting in the base playing video games, it got boring, even the story got a bit boring, like they had used all their inspiration in the 1st 20+ hours of gameplay.So overall, this is a good game, but it makes you kind of sad, as with a little more work to pace the story line with the skills and gear progression, this would have been an amazing game.Enjoy.

												I waited to buy this game for awhile.  I didn't want to get it in its alpha state, because there are about 100 zombie survival games out there right now in alpha.  I see lots of negative reviews for this game and while it does have some bugs, I only experienced a few.  Storyline is pretty good for a zombie game.  Survivor management, resources, and even crafting are pretty good.  Talking to your survivors could use a little polish, but I think its definitely worth 20-30 bucks.  If you like zombie games and you like turn based games like fallout 1 and 2 this is a good game.  I was a little leary of the turned based combat but its really not to bad.			"

								Dead State (Demo)Story: 6/10Gameplay: 6/10UI: 4/10Multiplayer: NADifficulty: ModeratePrice: Not Worth ItPros-Giving your survivors jobs to perform at your base adds a nice simulation aspect to the normal action zombie shlog-Exploring and scavenging abandon areas is fun-Attacks have a bit of variance depending on the weapon you're using-Environments are well designed and have personality to themCons-Very buggy, prone to crash or have the screen go all black-Actual combat with zombies can be frustrating when it happens in enclosed areas (allies can't move past or through each other)-UI is very unintuitive, you can even attack your own party members if you click on them to select them-Actual zombies aren't much of a threat when compared to insane scavengers-You'll never encounter more than a few zombies, and as long as you engage them wisely, they are never really a threat-Turn based play doesn't feel right for a zombie game, at least not for this gameI really wanted to like this game, I have been excited about it for years as more and more news of it's release came to light.  It seemed like the people making it were really into zombie culture and were promising a well made zombie simulation game.  Unfortunatly, I don't think they were too experienced when it came to designing actual gameplay.  The story is pretty generic zombie-survival fare.  You wake up after surviving a plane crash surrounded by a bunch of people who saved your life when they brought you to their safehouse and patched you up.  From there, you are basically given jobs to strengthen the safehouse and you try to survive your first week in zombie land.The actual gameplay is little more than making sure all your people are in the right position when you start a fight with a zombie.  If you do it right, you'll kill the zombie almost every time without it even noticing you.  If you do happen to be noticed as you approach the zombie, it will get a free attack on you and possibly beat you down pretty badly just in a few hits.  If you have a group with you, sneaking up on a zombie is a crapshoot unless all your party members are stealthy.  Once combat begins, you basically hit the zombie with debuff attacks then hit it with power attacks until it's dead.  (Blunt weapon for zombies, edged weapons/guns for humans usually works well)  If you're fighting humans, then there is a bit more of a challenge as they often have at least one pistol guy in their group.  (And, unlike most games, getting shot really hurts.)  Also, their gunshots may bring more zombies, but I've never had them bring an amount that worried me, (2 or 3 tops) which was a bit of a disappointment.I think the feel of the game is the most disappointing thing.  The zombies in this game don't seem like a threat that should have brought down society.  Most areas in the demo only really have a few zombies to deal with and they just aren't that scary. There should be the danger of hordes, being overwhelmed, and getting tired from too much combat.  None of that really comes into play.That said, this is just a demo so it's possible the final product will be much better.  However, this game is not worth the $20 price tag they are asking.  Wait for the final product or until they lower the price tag to something more reasonable.			"

												Based on the latest release of - Dead State: Reanimated.Progress through Dead State proved reminiscent of pre-millennial RPGs such as Fallout 1/2, Baldurs Gate and to a lesser extent, Vampire: Bloodlines. I'd consider this the highest praise I can bestow a game. The creative minds at Double Bear were involved in the creation of such cult games and have succeeded in achieving the sense of wonderment I found absent both in Pillars of Eternity and Wasteland 2, both of which attempted the same trick of capturing the essence of these earlier titles. Personally, I found both PoE and WL2 shallow interpretations, with story, immersiveness and game mechanics triaged for improved graphics. I suspect both titles will be forgotten while the legacy of their predecessors will continue. Given the teams behinds those particular titles were also involved in the creation of what I consider the ""golden-age"" era of cRPGs, I'd just about given up hope of finding another immersive isometric RPG. Maybe the real minds behind the greatest RPGs had left the business, died, or transcended to a higher plane of existence. Maybe, like myself, they were tired of the excreta being squirted out and trotted about as the ""greatest RPG of all time"" every few months. Maybe it was time to find a different hobby.Thankfully, at least one of the minds involved in the creation of cult classic RPGs is still among us.  The sense of an expansive and hostile world awaiting exploration, the advancement of both your character and relationships within the base alongside combat that retains old-school strategy but boosted with modern animations is unique among modern RPGs.The personal interactions are significant, with extensive dialogue trees that vary depending on your own actions and the emotions and morale within the base. Plus, there are a huge number of friendly NPCs, with 90% being unique and memorable. As an example, you can negotiate with a Vietnam veteran to kill his infected wife and join your base. You can either encourage his martial mentality, or relegate him to the kitchen. He can end up drunk and you can either admonish, mock him or give him time to recuperate. You can improve his mood with cigars and bourbon. You can encourage him to recover his old combat skills or serve the base more domestically. He can confront and threaten you if your leadership suffers, and you can either regain his support through negotiation or shoot him in the back as he leaves your room and insult him as he bleeds to death. Such extensive interactions are present with the majority of the NPCs within your base. This isn't Dragon Age type fluff, you aren't bored with slowly voiced over descriptions of the sexual preferences of Quinari princesses in the lands of make-believe. The topics of discussion are life and death, the answers are realistic, sometimes grim, and darkly humorous or a distraction used prior to a sneak-attack.Yes, the zombie premise has been overdone. Yes, there are bugs (Fallout 2 and Bloodlines were also released in such a state). Yes, it can be hard to maintain morale and food in your first game. Yes, you may found the graphics not the greatest. If the screenshots are repulsive to you, this won't be your preferred game type. This game has depth and complexity, not 4D-quantum-parralax-10.1 reflective sunbeams accentuating the convexed-v-synced-bump mapped textures of the player characters rear end, each bun modelled with a 6-point physics skeleton for life-like jiggle as you waddle around. This isn't style over substance.The Easter Eggs, such as the Friggin Chikin scratch card and bill-board signs, plus Dougs nerdy advice about attacking those crazed meth addicts with critical hits to their eyes is appreciated fan-service to those of us who immersed ourselves in such iconic RPGs almost two decades old. Dead State may seem out of place in the current horde modern RPGs, however it restores my faith that future RPGs can retain the same complexity, intrigue and challenge that made their predecessors so renowned.

												Looters and Zombies Oh My!  Think Project Zomboid with a Tactical Battle System!Dead State: Reanimated is all about survival, you start off with a small group of people in a shelter and you can choose how you want to expand, when you want to expand, or who you want to expend.  The game comes with some critical choices that you might need to actually read a guide about if you're working on achievements.  Overall the game deserves at least a 7.5/10 from me and I recommend picking it up, below are some of the key reasons why or why not to!Pros:Rather Unique (in what I've played) noise system in which you fire a gun or shoot off a firecracker and things hear it and go to the location.  Makes for more strategic gameplay, can't always be a firefight, sometimes you want to make noise to attract zombies to enemy locations.  Rather cool system.HUGE fan of Tactical Battle systems that are similar Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem games, mix in just enough looting, inventory management and rpg elements and you have yourself a solid game.If you're a fan of the Zombie Genre, or being able to Control what happens to your ""followers"", like say take them to a random location and stab them to death.  Then this is the game for you.Cons:Bugs - In multiple playthroughs I ended up with a character laying flat on his face in the infirmary.  Not sure what this was about.  There was also an endless encounter between Zombies and Enemy NPCs where I did nothing but press spacebar for a few hours and they fought the whole time (eventually I had to restart the encounter).  Mind you, this game is an indie dev and I'm all about supporting smaller companies, so I assume that these bugs will be fixed at a later date even though that later date may be a while away.Price - This is kind of a big one believe it or not, I got the game when it was a bit cheaper so it doesn't affect me as much.  When there are awesome games like Shadowrun out there and many others in this tactical genre at the 15$ price point it makes me question why this game is double the price.  I could understand 20$, I just think anything more than that for this game is a little much.  It's a good game, sure the dev spent a lot of time on it and all.  I'll wait for Dead State's sister game Age of Decadence to be Bundled or go on sale below the 20$ price point before I purchase it. "

												Awesome, I like this game a lot.  It reminds me a lot of the original Fallout games.  It's part RPG and part turn based squad level strategy - both game styles I enjoy.  There's enough content and areas to explore to keep you happy for a long time.  It really does feel like 'The walking dead' in many regards, I think the developers have accurately captured the look and feel of a zombie apocolypse.  I'd go as far as to say it's the best game I've played in the last year, and the best zombie game I've seen.			"

												The definition of the success, to me, is how addicted I am to this game. This game totally got me addicted! It is a successful rendering of Fallout 1 and Tactics. My wife was like, ""what the hell are you doing? Why are you glued to the computer day and night."" I haven't experienced that since the original days of Fallout.Indie games rarely draw me in. But I must applaud this game's success. Some reviews complain about picture quality and easy level of the game. It is exactly what I am looking for. This game is for those who miss the old days of Fallout 1 and Tactics. I am enjoying this game very much. It caters to a specific group looking for a specific kind of game. It is not for everyone. If you dislike action, open world/crafting/multi-players, RTS and prefer old fashioned turn-by-turn, RPG games. Then this game will be for you.			"

I wanted to like this game so badly, i just kept coming back to it, but honestly, playing it feels like work.  I continued on, hoping that it would click and become enjoyable, but i think i'm going to have to give in at this point.  This could have been a good one-but it isn't.			"

								Bought the game, early access sure, but it won't run, post to forum, write to support, not even a simple response, reply, acknowledgement. As to the statement, help shape the game, seriously??? No support even when i cannot start the game, you will listen? Ya right.Still not working for almost a week now and still NOTHING.			"

												Based on the latest release of - Dead State: Reanimated.Progress through Dead State proved reminiscent of pre-millennial RPGs such as Fallout 1/2, Baldurs Gate and to a lesser extent, Vampire: Bloodlines. I'd consider this the highest praise I can bestow a game. The creative minds at Double Bear were involved in the creation of such cult games and have succeeded in achieving the sense of wonderment I found absent both in Pillars of Eternity and Wasteland 2, both of which attempted the same trick of capturing the essence of these earlier titles. Personally, I found both PoE and WL2 shallow interpretations, with story, immersiveness and game mechanics triaged for improved graphics. I suspect both titles will be forgotten while the legacy of their predecessors will continue. Given the teams behinds those particular titles were also involved in the creation of what I consider the ""golden-age"" era of cRPGs, I'd just about given up hope of finding another immersive isometric RPG. Maybe the real minds behind the greatest RPGs had left the business, died, or transcended to a higher plane of existence. Maybe, like myself, they were tired of the excreta being squirted out and trotted about as the ""greatest RPG of all time"" every few months. Maybe it was time to find a different hobby.Thankfully, at least one of the minds involved in the creation of cult classic RPGs is still among us.  The sense of an expansive and hostile world awaiting exploration, the advancement of both your character and relationships within the base alongside combat that retains old-school strategy but boosted with modern animations is unique among modern RPGs.The personal interactions are significant, with extensive dialogue trees that vary depending on your own actions and the emotions and morale within the base. Plus, there are a huge number of friendly NPCs, with 90% being unique and memorable. As an example, you can negotiate with a Vietnam veteran to kill his infected wife and join your base. You can either encourage his martial mentality, or relegate him to the kitchen. He can end up drunk and you can either admonish, mock him or give him time to recuperate. You can improve his mood with cigars and bourbon. You can encourage him to recover his old combat skills or serve the base more domestically. He can confront and threaten you if your leadership suffers, and you can either regain his support through negotiation or shoot him in the back as he leaves your room and insult him as he bleeds to death. Such extensive interactions are present with the majority of the NPCs within your base. This isn't Dragon Age type fluff, you aren't bored with slowly voiced over descriptions of the sexual preferences of Quinari princesses in the lands of make-believe. The topics of discussion are life and death, the answers are realistic, sometimes grim, and darkly humorous or a distraction used prior to a sneak-attack.Yes, the zombie premise has been overdone. Yes, there are bugs (Fallout 2 and Bloodlines were also released in such a state). Yes, it can be hard to maintain morale and food in your first game. Yes, you may found the graphics not the greatest. If the screenshots are repulsive to you, this won't be your preferred game type. This game has depth and complexity, not 4D-quantum-parralax-10.1 reflective sunbeams accentuating the convexed-v-synced-bump mapped textures of the player characters rear end, each bun modelled with a 6-point physics skeleton for life-like jiggle as you waddle around. This isn't style over substance.The Easter Eggs, such as the Friggin Chikin scratch card and bill-board signs, plus Dougs nerdy advice about attacking those crazed meth addicts with critical hits to their eyes is appreciated fan-service to those of us who immersed ourselves in such iconic RPGs almost two decades old. Dead State may seem out of place in the current horde modern RPGs, however it restores my faith that future RPGs can retain the same complexity, intrigue and challenge that made their predecessors so renowned.

												Looters and Zombies Oh My!  Think Project Zomboid with a Tactical Battle System!Dead State: Reanimated is all about survival, you start off with a small group of people in a shelter and you can choose how you want to expand, when you want to expand, or who you want to expend.  The game comes with some critical choices that you might need to actually read a guide about if you're working on achievements.  Overall the game deserves at least a 7.5/10 from me and I recommend picking it up, below are some of the key reasons why or why not to!Pros:Rather Unique (in what I've played) noise system in which you fire a gun or shoot off a firecracker and things hear it and go to the location.  Makes for more strategic gameplay, can't always be a firefight, sometimes you want to make noise to attract zombies to enemy locations.  Rather cool system.HUGE fan of Tactical Battle systems that are similar Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem games, mix in just enough looting, inventory management and rpg elements and you have yourself a solid game.If you're a fan of the Zombie Genre, or being able to Control what happens to your ""followers"", like say take them to a random location and stab them to death.  Then this is the game for you.Cons:Bugs - In multiple playthroughs I ended up with a character laying flat on his face in the infirmary.  Not sure what this was about.  There was also an endless encounter between Zombies and Enemy NPCs where I did nothing but press spacebar for a few hours and they fought the whole time (eventually I had to restart the encounter).  Mind you, this game is an indie dev and I'm all about supporting smaller companies, so I assume that these bugs will be fixed at a later date even though that later date may be a while away.Price - This is kind of a big one believe it or not, I got the game when it was a bit cheaper so it doesn't affect me as much.  When there are awesome games like Shadowrun out there and many others in this tactical genre at the 15$ price point it makes me question why this game is double the price.  I could understand 20$, I just think anything more than that for this game is a little much.  It's a good game, sure the dev spent a lot of time on it and all.  I'll wait for Dead State's sister game Age of Decadence to be Bundled or go on sale below the 20$ price point before I purchase it. "

												Awesome, I like this game a lot.  It reminds me a lot of the original Fallout games.  It's part RPG and part turn based squad level strategy - both game styles I enjoy.  There's enough content and areas to explore to keep you happy for a long time.  It really does feel like 'The walking dead' in many regards, I think the developers have accurately captured the look and feel of a zombie apocolypse.  I'd go as far as to say it's the best game I've played in the last year, and the best zombie game I've seen.			"

												The definition of the success, to me, is how addicted I am to this game. This game totally got me addicted! It is a successful rendering of Fallout 1 and Tactics. My wife was like, ""what the hell are you doing? Why are you glued to the computer day and night."" I haven't experienced that since the original days of Fallout.Indie games rarely draw me in. But I must applaud this game's success. Some reviews complain about picture quality and easy level of the game. It is exactly what I am looking for. This game is for those who miss the old days of Fallout 1 and Tactics. I am enjoying this game very much. It caters to a specific group looking for a specific kind of game. It is not for everyone. If you dislike action, open world/crafting/multi-players, RTS and prefer old fashioned turn-by-turn, RPG games. Then this game will be for you.			"

												Took charge, tried to accomodate everyone.Special luxury items kept disappearing as soon as I got to the shelter.

												I personally loved the game, its a different style than a lot of survival games since it actually includes base building. Like the other reviews have mentioned, its missing a few UI things, but honestly, a lot of that I view as cheating slightly, of course you wont know where loot is magically, or who is stronger than another under 20 lbs of armour. Mind you, its not worth the full price of $30, I'd say it falls in the range of about half that, $15 or so.			"

												Add this to a growing list of games filed under 'missed opportunity'. What annoys me most about this game is not the slow gameplay or combat mentioned in other reviews but the fact the game state is not the same when when you resume playing a day or two later - it has played on by itself and survivors have gone/died. I just want to be able to save it and resume from where I left off. Apparently there are work arounds for this but I can't be arsed to change files deep in the game directory and then change the computer clock and then spin around 3 times reciting the alphabet backwards - someone just write a program please!

								I've been excited about this game for quite a while, on the presumption that it would be fundamentally similar to XCOM in structure, only dealing with a zombie apocalypse. After having played through the EA version of the game (a long demo, really), I have to say that it's exactly what I hoped it would be.The EA version has little accessible content, but it does a good job of showing you what all will be available in the full game. If the final game lives up to our expectations and to the promise of this EA demo, I'll be playing it for months. :)			"

												Now that I've put in a few hours (12) in the game, I can make a pretty comprehensive review on this title.First off- Dead State has rough edges, surely, but overall, it's an enticing zombie survival game, with emphasis on squad and shelter management, improving your abode while trying to weather out the apocalypse. You'll set up your base in a school in a fictional Texas town, trying to make ends meet without succumbing to the horrors of the zombie apocalypse, which is not limited to the shambling dead. The game makes good use of the setting, providing a few differing factions and splinter groups set up in the ruins of the world, each striving to survive- sometimes at the expense of others. You won't be getting many warm welcomes, and most of these will turn out to be ambushes, so that the thugs in question can loot those canned pineapples from your carcass.Thankfully, not all of Texas is going to meet you with guns blazing- sometimes, diplomacy is the way to go, and investing in the skill trees can net you surprising results, varying from avoiding armed confrontation with hostile groups, to negotiating new location information, talking depressed survivors into fighting for another day or even recruiting some of the tough-as-nails survivors to join your growing community. Naturally, characters of nominal importance are the only ones you can actually recruit- you can pretty safely discern hostile troops from their lack of name, and the ubiquitous looter gear they're armed with.After 12 hours, I can safely say that I am glad I backed Dead State- it's proving itself to be pretty much all it boasted, albeit with a few rough edges. I find myself playing 'just one more day', trying to meet up daily demands and the missions on the To-Do list. You're free to explore the end of the world, utilizing your own judgement and goals, although it does pay to placate and bribe your growing group of survivors every now and then, just to keep everybody happy, healthy and ready to eke out a meager existence in a world filled with ravenous undead, trigger-happy looters, gun-toting militias, renegade cops, mercenaries and just ordinary people trying to survive at all costs.Pros:- Solid tactical gameplay. Aside a few odd glitches in the 1.0 (multiple enemies occupying single tile, some impr. weapons losing their ammo charges- pepper sprays, nail guns and the like), you can pretty much plan, and execute raids on the many locations in the game, sometimes taking an active part in offense, sometimes defense, and every once in a while, just playing both hostile survivors and the zombies against each other.- Stealth versus guns-blazing approaches- you're free to use your own judgement in how to deal with each location, but the game will most likely toss a zombie or two on maps where you announce your presence by three rounds rapid.- Varied locations that, although using same buildings from time to time, are still distinguishable from each other.- Emphasis on Survival, instead of shooting one thousand zombies. Stealth, planning and a bit of cloak and dagger can get you in and out of many situations where most games would provide you with one option- violence. In Dead State, violence is usually the last, least desireable option.- Different characters with various backgrounds, motivations, likes and dislikes, which are factored in the daily business of your Shelter. Some are nearly joke characters, while others have to cope with the tragedies arising from losing their loved ones to the zombie plague.- Good range of skills, weapons and choices for improvements on the home base- Great concept art, character portraitsCONS:- Still a bit buggy. Expect they will sort 'em out in the future patches, but be ready for clipping foes, misplaced pepper spray and nail gun magazines, one or two zones where Turn-Based-Combat trigger is broken and the fight will continue, despite no active hostilities. One shut-in recruitable survivor dialogue which should end up in violence, does not.- The game really doesn't give you a heads up that initiating hostilities towards obviously hostile survivor groups first can lead to a MASSIVE negative morale in home base. You see a crazed shooter, you better have them initiate combat, or suffer the consequences.- Static game zones: Sadly, once you've cleared out a game zone, there's nothing left to do there. And you can't mark these looted areas off your map, but have to rely on your own memory.- No way to mark vital resources on the map, like discovering and making note of a sack of concrete mix you'll need later for HQ upgrades.- Some of the menus are still a bit difficult to navigate/ too small to read on higher resolutions.- Survivor inventory management in the HQ is a bit tricky to locate, but once you pick up on the drop-down menu on the upper left corner, you're set. Also, ammo dividing can be achieved with the CTRL-click on ammo stack, after which the portion allocated can be moved to the HQ stockpile, and distributed to your survivors.- No real soundtrack or voices, sound effects that stick to mind.

												Update: I still haven't beaten the game, but there are a few things I'd like to add to my 10-hour first impressions. The positive recommendation didn't change though. Characters still feel bland. The dialog is, for the most part, very generic and there are many characters in my shelter that I barely know, and didn't even bother to get to know their names. Part of the problem here is that, what makes them special (eventually), comes by way of them taking the initiative to talk to the player about their problems or ideas. Those events trigger at different times, and not very often, which means that most will probably remain forgetable for a long time. This system is fine as it is, but I believe there's much room for improvement there.As I found more people, and as I invited them to the shelter, the game became significantly more interesting and I became much more immersed in it. In the morning of each new day people will talk to the player making requests (like not working today), suggestions and other stuff. There are also crisis events that trigger rarely and result in a meeting between the main characters forming a makeshift, small council to discuss an issue. The role of the player is as the leader of this shelter, so he's expected to have the final word in these matters. There will be some moral dilemmas along the way which at times made me really feel responsible for these people well being.As for the difficulty, I described it as escalating quickly in my first impressions, but after getting good equipment and weapons, along with leveling my character with a focus in combat, that difficulty curve quickly peaked and now is taking a big dive. Combat is way too easy now, especially against zombies. Apparently the main character can't get infected, which, along with the fact that they can no longer do any damage even if they hit me, makes them just an annoyance. Other humans still pose some challenge from time to time, but it's rare. I expect another spike in difficulty soon, otherwise I'd have to say this game has severe balancing issues. In terms of shelter management, even with a character build not meant to excel at that, it has become easier lately as well, though not as much. Raising morale, getting enough antibiotics to keep infected survivors alive, and getting fuel are the main causes of tension. It became incredibly easier after getting a horse, and I expect it to become even easier with a car, so again, I expect events to trigger that will put more strain on resources soon.As for bugs, I found quite a few. I recon many are supposed to be fixed soon, but at the time of writing, there will be some glaring small issues that indicate lack of polish. The only really bad ones were crashes, which only started happening recently, but twice in two days, in which I lost some significant progress. It's my fault for not saving, but an auto-save feature would have been very welcome.One thing I'd like to test is its replayability. I want to create a new character that is all about running a shelter, managing people, leading them in combat, but not being a good combatant himself. That should make the game harder, and I like the idea from a roleplaying perspective, although I don't know if a second playthrough can be different enough for that to be fun. On the other hand, I'd like to beat the game first, but I have no idea if I'm close or not. So there, my opinion of the game improved dramatically because I got totally hooked as time went by. I recognize how hard it must be to balance the tension between the combat and shelter management parts of the game, and for the most part, it does a very good job at it. The text below was written much earlier into the game.---This ""review"" was written at around 10 hours of gameplay (so pretty early in the context of this game). Up to this point, my experience with the game has been positive. Here's a quick rundown of my experience with it. I've seen many comparisons with other games, so I'm going to frame this in comparison with them. - Unlike TWOM and XCOM, this one plays from the point of view of a specific character that you create in the beginning.- The character creation is fairly simple, but allows for many different playstyles. From looking at the options available, I see that you could play the main character as ranged, melee, shelter manager/leader, or a mixture. I don't see options that would allow secialization on a stealthy gameplay though, which is disappointing. There's 4 general stats (analogue to Fallout's attributes) and around 10 skills with perk choices built into the skill progression system that allows for even more customization.- There's a shelter stage, and a combat stage that would be familiar to XCOM fans, although unlike XCOM, they play the same. In the shelter stage you walk around the shelter talking to people, assigning jobs / upgrading facilities / creating items by interacting with an object, getting or storing items by interacting with a container.- Just like State of Decay, you have to manage the resources of the shelter, in the forms of food, morale, antibiotics, fuel and the mood the specific characters.- When you leave the shelter, you'll see a map whose mechanics will be familiar to anyone that played the original Fallout games, with random encounters and all.- The gameplay in the remote locations you find is close to the original Fallout, with the difference that you control your party members as well during combat. There are many little new mechanics that I like, for instance, if an ally is blocking your way to an enemy, you can swap positions with him by spending two Action Points (also useful if you want a character to shield another). I found the combat part to be very unforgiving and difficulty ramps up quickly while you'll be scrounging for bullets and other stuff.- I found many issues with the text, sometimes being cut off or being hard to read due to lack of contrast with the background, but those instances aren't too bothersome and not game breaking in any way.- The narrative and cast of characters up to this point seems bland. Little of it made me care for them, which I think is a failure in this department, as I think this is important for this game to truly shine. This is one thing I don't want to judge so early into the game, but I would expect to be more immersed in the narrative by now.SummaryI'm having a lot of fun with it. It's fairly nostalgic if you played Fallout, and the mechanics seem to be well designed. Graphically is not very polished, and doesn't seem very unique from an artistic perspective (like TWOM is) which makes it look very generic, but the mixtures of RPG, turn-based tactical combat and resource management mechanics of the game are its greatest assets. I'll update this later on, but this is my first impression of the game. I'd recomend it for anyone that played the original Fallouts and XCOMs, but I doubt this would grab the attention of less patient gamers.			"

												i've only been playing this game for a few weeks, if that, but the dev's have made tremendous leaps in that time period.All in all, i'm very happy to see this game get the positive reviews it deserves, which made me reach out too :) Anyways, highly recommended, though i do wish there was more content...like more ways to customize weapons, more open ended? Thats just me being personal, game is completely solid the way it is :) Worth the $ :D			"

												Base management, turn based combat with free flow open world exploration, simple yet powerful levelling system...WITH ZOMBIES!If you enjoyed the original Fallout series you will love this game. Along with the turn based combat and exploration, a well implemented base management adds an extra element of planning and strategy. Levelling is not based on kills, but rather on a goal system, meaning farming every kill on a level is not at all necessary, and avoiding combat is at times the best strategy. I have not played many hours but already I can see this will be one of my games of the year.The game does seem to be a bit buggy at this stage (from my limited playtime), but the devs are definitely on top of things and are listening to their playerbase, so I do not see this as much of a problem at the moment.

												This is a great mix of squad turn based strategy mixed with zombies.Pros:- Entertaining and tough battles, similar to Fallout Tactics or Wasteland- Interesting mix of characters- Background stories and characters make the zombie apocalypse seem real- The tense interactions with the characters at your shelter feel like you are just barely holding it together- Later on, you need to carefully consider how you grow as your resources start to get tightCons- Many of the conversations with characters have only one right way of responding. No incentive to take a dark turn- While the crafting is interesting, it would be great if there were many more recipes "

												Great old school rpg fun. With all the baggage that entails.Zombies are boring but the conflicts that all disasters create between people are interesting. Dead State understands this, and that's why it manages to remain captivating despite the overdone subject material. It's a turn-based rpg and you travel the post-zombie-apocalypse wasteland in search of loot to bring back to your shelter. There's loads of combat, base building, and managing the personalities in your base. The combat isn't anything to write home about, but it's on par with Fallout 1 & 2. The writing is really great, and one of the best parts of the game is reading through the dialogue you have with the people at your shelter. There's tons of opportunities to be a truly disgusting person without being stereotypically evil.Like all great old school rpgs, however, it's got its fair share of bugs. Don't get me wrong though, it's very playable - there's nothing game breaking - but slight annoyances can add up if you're sensitive to that sort of thing, you little babby. Save often and keep multiple saves to avoid headaches. Graphics are fairly dated, too - although the character portraits are quite pretty.I've played about 26 hours of it and it's definitely super impressive, coming from a small indie studio. More like this please. Maybe with a robot apocalypse next time.			"

												A combination of old-school (some would say antiquated) turn-based RPG mechanics and survivalist simulation. All over the map in terms of balance and characterization, and the UI is shameful across the board. Over the long haul, however, Dead State's charms begin to manifest. It will take awhile before the game starts to get going. A safe bet for the first-time player is that you'll be about 10-12 hours in before the first character conflicts kick in and you start exploring places more spectacular and atmospheric than deserted small-town main streets and suburbs. Story content is gated by in-game days and it takes about a week (each day an hour or more of gameplay, depending) before things start to really happen. If you can't devote that kind of time or don't have the patience (and not everyone does!) then it's a take-or-leave game. It squeezes surprisingly little from its premise otherwise (there is SO MUCH you could get from a hardcore RPG set in a zombie apocalypse), and clearly marks itself as an earnestly made first game from a new developer. I would say that if you're into 90's Interplay classics, have time on your hands and really, really love zombie fiction, it's worth the $30. Otherwise? Wait for a few patches or get it on sale. But it's worth the look if you're into turn-based RPGs.			"

												I wish there was a maybe button for recommendations. So to start this game still should be in beta stages with how many major bugs there are. I have not run into many game breaking ones, other than ones that cause crash to desktop. I find if I do not save at every opportunity it is garneted to crash at a bad time. When people come to the gate once in a while the camera gets stuck there.The gameplay itself is fairly fun. I do enjoy the mesh of real time exploration with the turn based combat. however line of sight  seems a bit off at times, and seems obstacles do not effect how hard it is to be hit or hit others with guns, ie on the other side of a table or car hood.The shelter is neat as it changes, though a few upgrades could be changed a bit, as there is plenty of ground outside they could have used for farming rather than the small things on the roof. one needs to get the 25 % food reduction perk rather soon as food consumption gets rather high while getting 10 additional moral per day is rather underpowered. this shows additional balancing should/needs to be done.The moral system itself should be reworked a bit s it seems to easy to keep I up. maybe put a upper limit on it and have luxuries be consumed as needed rather all at once. not so sure how to improve that system but it can be worked on.TLDR Bugs lot of bugs, they need fixed. but otherwise an enjoyable game.

												So far I have about 8 hours into this game and been loving it. Unlike many games these days it offers challenge without artificially padding the stats of NPCs. The dialog, storyline, and relationships in this game are one of the best of any apocalyptic games I can recently remember. Definitely has an X-com, Fallout vibe, yet in its own unique style. At this point it does have a few bugs and the engine is a tiny bit clunky at times, but the developers are some of the fastest I have seen at addressing issues. Definitely recommended for most.			"

Early Access Review
								It would help tremendously if this game was actually functional.I am getting sick of Steam allowing games that are not even remotely ready for a public eye to judge it yet, to get a simple 'early access' sticker smacked on it, and go nuts, it irritates the heck out of me.I got this game cause I have a passion for Zombie games. I even have a 'Zombie' category on my library...You could say I really do collect them, and this one's no different. I've followed it for a while, and I like where its going!I got it for my birthday, somebody buying it for me on Steam, but the moment I pushed play, the game flickered from Desktop to black screen several times before the game claims that some 3rd party engine system is not working due to Directx9.0 being required(Well I have 11.0....). Still, the game refuses to play, and there are no functioning fixes on the internet yet(trust me, I tried). Instead the fact that the game crashes to desktop, made Steam **** a brick too. It claimed that I was in Dead State when I wasn't, and showed it as ""In-Game: Dead State"" several hours after I quit trying...I tried to exit steam but it demanded I 'shut down Dead State' first, which wasn't running, not even in my Task manager. I decided to CTRL+Alt+Del and end Steam's task, then restart it, but even that didn't remove the in-game tag :\I played Mount & Blade Warband for over 6 hours afterwards, and watched Netflix and chatted with friends for 5 hours after that before shutting down for bed, and Steam now claims I have 11 hours invested in this game, which isn't true...The game's just buggy and made Steam angry. :\I recommend 'NOT' buying this game, as it is no where near ready for release, and will 'not' work until they fix the issue, which is apparently because the game doesn't have a 'set to fullscreen' mode yet...

												I am not normally the type to write reviews, but I feel that Dead State is worth a break from the ordinary.I have been playing since early access (First Seven Days release) and gone back for multiple playthroughs with each patch release right up until full release.End result, over 300 hours played on this game and I dont feel I have wasted any of them.YES, there are bugs, some of them are immersion breaking, some are annoying, but nothing OVERLY game breaking. The Devs are incredibly quick to respond to any new bugs found and are continually consulting the player base to find and eliminate bugs as they happen. To me, this is incredibly satisfying as I know my opinion as a consumer is valued.As to the game itself?If you are looking for a pulse-pounding thrill ride as you slaughter increasingly tough and varied monsters in graphic ways with an assortment of zany and idiosincratic weapons....Look somewhere else.Dead State is a htoughtful game that encourages you to plan ahead, from catering to the needs and wants of your fellow survivors to deciding when, where and how you and your team will fight.Sometimes it is better to sneak through an area, get what you can and get out quietly.I found I was investing into the fellow survivors, thinking outside the game to better understand thier motives and how best to make them work. A sure sign of good writing (Although you may not believe it simply from appearances)Finally, if like me, you have played more than your fair share of RPG's (especially from the 90's and 00's) the isometric viewpoint, the turn based combat and even the JRPGesque base and NPC collection will tickle all the nostalgia bones and keep you coming back for more.tl:dr?A great game that may still seem a little rough around the edges, but a must have for any RPG and/or Zombie Survival fan			"

												HelloI finish game at 25.12.2014 and when time I played it there were still some problems with it (expecially with  two level condigantions occasional wall passing trought) but this not change one single thing: this game is absolutly amazing and is this what I was looking for time when last good fallout game ( what was fallout 2) was finished by me.This game is not only about visiting locations one by one and pick up every item You found (but is also liked by me part) but also about human relations, tensions, cooperation and leadership. Some times there is no good deicion to take but You must too. You always upset some one and as more people will be with You that more part of upset will be.(From mechanical look: we got something like crisis event when our little democracy (where You have last voice) make meeting and take decision.).Ofcourse in game are also bad guys, neutral guys and guys who You can just make hate You. So enemies are not really zombie. I will not spoiler story here how ever :-) Only I can say it can be bit more build up of lines with each of group.What else we can found are little stories in locations (some one mention this before me but I found it same way). We got little hut in the forest, with table, blood... some psycho live there? Or some situations moved from culture/games/books - for example You visit bar meeting Mike and Mallory KnoxGame need some fixes but there is nothing what make it not playble. I really really enjoy it.			"

												I would recommend this game if you enjoy the genre or RPGs in general. Although the combat is lacking a bit in depth, it is enjoyable for the most part, and the exploration is interesting. Yes, there are bugs, but with each patch it gets better, and the current build has been extremely stable for me, although ymmv depending on your system config.One of the best parts, in my opinion, is the character stories that play out between days, and the different characters you meet while exploring which include several famous names from movies & past games.Being a story driven game there is good bit of reading involved, so if you're not into that you may not enjoy it as much.The writing is excellent, and is quite funny at times as well as dark & somewhat disturbing at others. As it is right now, I'd give it 7/10 because of the technical drawbacks, but with continued support, patches & polishing, as well as future DLC, it could easily rise to a  10/10 game.

												HUGE Potential, HUGE let down!Being a XCOM veteran I was full of excitement at the thoughts of this game and everytrhing it was supposed to offer, however on starting the game it was a massive dissapointment. The fight engine has left too much to luck and odds ""how hard is it to hit a zombie from the front with a sledge hammer?"" well according to the programmers its 5 times more likely to land a hit from behind than in front. This being so it takes four team members two rounds with two to three hits each to take out one enemy. I could understand odds being used on XCOM but why with melee weapons and why such appaling odds. And to make things even worse a gun reload takes a full turn. Add to this multiple enemies and you're in for anal decimation. All in all a great idea destroyed by mismanagement of game dynamics.If you're looking for a great zombie apocalypse RPG than buy State Of Decay. A lot better and more fun it has better graphics, game engine, playability, costs less and more lifespan.  "

												A very good idea which unfortunately wasnt executed well enough. therefore I can not recommend it to others.The game was released before it is ready, probably due to sales season.In an early access you expect bugs, but in the (finished!!) version the amount of bugs were immense. I am not going to list all, as there are forums for these. but I will go through some bugs that ruined my experience below.Good sides,Turn based, tactical combat (not great as there is not cover system etc, but decent)Survival (in the first few weeks you really have to fight for each chocolate bar and manage parts and morale) later on they become irrelevant.open world and a big map.GraphicsGraphics are old but i like it anyway, I am not after shiny textures. Gameplay matters for me.AudioAudio is unfortunately quite poor as music variety is quite limited and static, and there is almost no voice in the game. Characters on levels communicate with subtitles over their heads, which you can easily miss if you are looking elsewhere. There is no message log (like in fallout). There is a combat log which could use some improvement. Sounds effects are below decent.Gameplay.Pathfinding and AI in general is terrible. My characters kept sliding to their destination often through walls. Enemies can also sometimes shoot through obstacles. Enemies can knock down your entire squad without a direct line of sight, using a single granade. (maybe they have thermal vision, which isnt implemented in the game :)  )Interface could really use some polish. there is almost no info on statuses, just an icon which doesnt tell you if that character has reduced strength or perception, etc... Armor in late game is too strong both for you and your enemies. Assault rifles can have problems without critical hits. Zombies are only a threat during first weeks, later on they become a joke, which destroys the mood for a zombie game. Minor bugs are somewhat ok. However, after hours of battling 10+ soldiers/mercs with full armor and assault rifles (to combat is slow, which I like as it is expected in such a genre), to crash to desktop on the last soldier is not fun. dont know about others but I have had so many CTDs. (dont tell me to update my graphics driver, or restart my computer)The quests are also quite poorly made in the sense that the choice you make earlier is not reflected to the next day and people in the shelter complain (or are sick) as if you made the other choice in the crisis event a few days ago. quests dont get ticked off, or people in shelter keep saying the same things over and over.The game is based Looting and keeping your people safe/well fed/ healthy. However in order to loot large maps I had to return to them 10 times.I dont want to sound so harsh (although I probably did with all the critism). it is  a small company and I appreciate that they try to bring old turn /squad based RPG back to life.  it was just an unfinished product with a lot of bugs released earlier than it should have been. if they lack manpower, they should have waited a bit more to polish the game.

Game is generally fun for patient players. So lets get to the bad stuff. Ideas were  good but executing them were really bad. There small or no realism can be found. Commbat is exteremly boring. If you engage more than 4 enemies you will be bored. Also combat mechanics are somewhat lazy.Combat is exteremly repetitive. It is like chess you move your chars around and kill stuff. No challenge at all. Too buggy and devs actually didnt put anything into game aside from fixing game breaking bugs and annoying stuff.  I can easly say this game is in still beta. But if you have nothing to do or play like me you can spend many hours wondering around the texas or unlocking some events.			"

I don't know what other people think but the updates and story content is lacking. Is this the finished game? end of?I was soo excited to see a game similar to State of Decay have a turn base style of combat and thought even though the graphics are simple they were effective and this would allow more time to create and develop a rich story and gameplay. But i feel i was sadly mistaken. Conversations with survivors are limited and repetitive and the actions you take don't effect much. The people will still repeat the same conversation ever if everyone else is dead.....Like i said the concept to this game is amazing but right now i feel like you guys have just taken my money and left me with a game you no longer care about			"

												A really good turn-based, zombie RPG from DoubleBear with base management and pretty good writing.  There is a lot to explore and a good variety of items.  Interesting art style and great variety of NPC's.  The noise mechanic is also cool.  Enjoyed attracting zombies to a fight with scavengers to pit them against each other.The game has a pretty steep learning curve if you don't read the manual.  A lot of things are not obvious nor intuitive.  The UI is a little clunky and there are still some glitches in the release version, though these are not really game-breaking nor take away from the overall experience.  Mostly some weird moving animations or inability to access containers the first time they are clicked on.Overall, a pretty solid game and fun to explore.  Hopefully some future patches will clean up the bugs and they do some work on the UI stuff.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but in the end I can't recommend buying it in its current state even after multiple patches.+ Combat can be tense in the early game before you get good weapons/armor because you don't want to attract too many zombies or human enemies all at once. Note emphasis on ""early,"" see below.+ Base management can be fun, especially once you get lots of survivors who then start interacting with each other which can lead to interesting crisis events. Probably the best part of the game.Seems to clearly draw from Suikoden, what with being able to recruit lots of characters to your home base who have vignettes and even being able to build a suggestion box to read often humorous suggestions from them.  Until you get a lot of survivors the base is pretty dead though.+ Can scratch that loot tick before you get tired of looting. Nothing like opening a single container and seeing a ton of nice loot.- The game still has a lot of bugs including ones patches claim to have fixed (see: certain stairs in the hotel only working after rejiggering your whole party position so you can use them, enemies especially zombies clipping into each other while moving and merging into one tile, etc) which can make playing a chore.- Combat breaks very quickly after the early game. You start finding armor that lets you ignore damage, quickly making zombies irrelevant and humans who don't have guns higher tier than the armor you're wearing irrelevant until eventually you have such good armor there are no longer enemies that can threaten you without critting. This cuts both ways and eventually the only significant way you can damage certain enemies is on crits, especially the really annoying ones with riot shields who you should basically not bother with if you aren't critting them with weapon types they're least resistant to. You can find and craft various gas grenades that trivialize combat against human enemies who aren't resistant to gas, which is like 90% of them including the top tier ones since you just blind or even knock them out and then pummel them while they're helpless. A zombie game where zombies quickly become irrelevant because your armor is so good they do nothing to you and humans become almost irrelevant soon after has serious issues.-The interface is one of the worst I've encountered in a long while. You spend a lot of time looking at inventory screens, and because of that what might be minor problems in another game or taken alone quickly add up to become frustrating. There is physically no way to drop an item you realize you don't even care enough about to recycle (see below), you have to dump it into a container somewhere on the map. If you want to move things from the car to your base's stash that don't auto stock, you have to first move it to your main character and then move it into your stash (hope you invested in strength!). You have to move things one by one from character inventories to the trunk in the field because you can't move things from multiple characters inventories like when you trade between characters (another interface issue because you have to actually select it as an action on the field by right click cycling through other options instead of just pressing ""I"" when you're not in base). I can go on. Again, these might be minor issues in other games or taken alone, but since by this games nature you spend so much time messing with inventories it adds up very quickly. The idea of getting loot in a game with a large emphasis on looting actually became a chore that I began dreading.- You can recycle things you don't want into ""parts,"" one of the resources in base management once you build a building. This is just completely ridiculous. First of all, once you build a recycler, you no longer have to care about parts because you can recycle trash items into more parts than you will ever need. This is a game partially about resource management where you can build an easily accessible building that lets you ignore one of the resources. Let that sink in. The other issue is it encourages you to pick up every piece of garbage you encounter so you can turn them into parts encouraging the most base loot hording behavior. This is already annoying if you're a lootaholic in games like Elder Scrolls series, but compound it with unfun messing with inventories and you can see why I never wanted to see another inventory screen in this game again. They nerfed this building at some point in beta and its still ridiculous. Guys you don't need to try to make every bad idea you come up with work, just delete it and move on.- There isn't really any story until extremely late in the game. I'm talking like 80+ days in. That might appeal to some people, but by like day 30 I had my base pretty much set up and no longer had resource issues. That left 50+ days of basically going through the motions for the sake of it. Resources quickly become irrelevant when you get good transportation so you can bring home hundreds of pounds of materials home in a single day from no longer challenging maps. Lets not even talk about recycling.- I don't care about graphics in RPGs but if you do... play another game. Not much going on in the audio department either.I don't want to keep going because again, I really wanted to like this game. I think they have made an admirable effort considering their situation and resources. But that the people behind it made an admirable effort doesn't mean you should buy a game, and in its current state after beta and multiple patches I can can only recommend this game to extreme fans of the genre who are also extremely forgiving. I like to think I am in that category most of the time, but this game in particular soured me.			"

There are still major bugs that will hopefully get fixed. Story is ok but mishandles contraversial issues on multiple occasons which alwas seemed to come at a point when I was really starting to have fun.			"

												Never have i ever been more involved and addicted to a game or storyline then Dead State. The game will entice anyone who enjoys zombie based games, turn based game, survival or just fantastic dialoge and story.  Do NOT miss out on Dead State you will love it from start to finish. 10/10			"

								When this game initially came onto early access, I ignored it amidst all the other Z-type games that came out during the same period.  I finally picked up Dead State at a whim and I have to say that I should never have bothered with the other titles.  This game is surprisingly good and interesting to play and makes for an interesting mix of building up your base, finding supplies and trying not to get your teams killed.  No XP for killing stuff, encouraging players to be a little more clever about how they explore and hunt for supplies.  The devs are active and each patch brings about new and tangible enhancements.  This game is definately worth supporting.			"

												This is a pretty awesome game for a while-- but the story flat out stops around half way though. By 30 game days in, I'd upgraded everything, acquired everything and had enough materials to just skip whole weeks at a time without paying attention. There was no end goal and no indication that I should be doing anything.After looking it up online, I'd found out that the game just --ends-- at around day 90. Day 90?! I finished all of the content by 30! And without spoilers I'd add that the endings to the game offer no closure or sense of accomplishment- they're just events that stop the game.So avoid. This is a game that could have been good, if the last half had been finished.			"

								Dead state is a survival Turn based Rpg. It is free roam in the area until u come into combat which then turns to turn based combat with the traditonal grid system, and spend Ap points to move and use actions. The searching and raiding houses for weapons,supplies, and other goodies is a thrill, especially when u get caught off guard in a unfavourable battle. Although still in alpha and still quite a few bugs and not to much content, this game has very good potential to be a great turn based strategy thats not the traditonal swords and shields.

												Its fun, really. If you like kill zombies and savages and micromanage your shelter it is game for you. Ye its buggy, but not unplayable. And seem to me that guys at dev tring really hard to patch what they can. You scavange food and luxury stuff to keep your shelter safe, you gather materials to build upgrades (and sometimes gather horses and chickens for your yard garden). You order your fellow survivers to do daily jobs or go hunt for supply with you and they argue with you and with each other and you need to solve the stuff or they will kill each other leave shelter or steal stuff ... What i do miss so far (but havent finished yet)- shelter defense is only tablelar - guards + fortification vs enemy = result- kinda easy in second half of the game - so far only ""normal"" zombies - I mean they are various, some even in armor, but no special tanks, putrid Zs, tongue slingers etc... actually Zs stopped to be dangerous in midgame. Human enemies are.- you form a search party around your character so if you wanna scavenge your character must head out (even if you would like to heal him or train him) "

												As far as indie releases go, these guys got it as smooth as anyone on release day. There are bugs, which are getting squashed. So far none of them have really bothered me or my game and im really diving it this game. One bad patch came out and was quickly rectified, which happens to the AAA devolepers too. I wouldnt really hold it against doublebear.The game itself hits my sweet spot of gaming. Turn based, rpg, strategy gaming with base building. The closet analogy game released recently would be Wasteland 2. So its easiest to compare them and would be relevant to most gamers too:Dead State (DS) has base building which i love. Wasteland 2 (WS) doesn't have this, and the way that game was made makes it seem like it SHOULD have been in there. The way the second half of WS was written it seems like it should have been included and it to me it felt like a great chance to extend that game was ignored.WS was too campy in my opinion. It made far too many referential jokes and nods and what not to the previous game and the genre in general. I felt that was a mistake. DS tries and succeeds in maintaining a better immersion in the zombie filled world and takes itself seriously. So over all DS beats WS in its game world.On the negative side DS needs to be balanced still. Combat goes from wildly hard to wildly easy. Not long into the game only a few characters can mow down a battalion of zombies with little effort. That being said, the inclusion of so much fighting other humans can be tricky. You will find in the long run, its the living humans that are truely the real enemy in the game. But im sure as the patches come, feed back is gathered, and balance is achieved, this won't be a negative for long. Graphics are passable for the game, but they bog my machine down way more then should. If you have a low end machine you might run into problems with graphics on anything other then lowest settings. My machine is middle of the road and i have to run middle of the road graphics. While comparative games generally run much better. This is probably an optimazation issue, which of course, tends to get taken care of in patches. From the already released patches it seems like they are trying to get this ironed out. There plenty of stuff to find and loot in the game. Much of it though is not anyting more then having the words FOOD and LUXURY ITEMS written on a holder card and given different names. While they may be 1000 items inthe game, 900 of them are functionally identical, but the fact i can horde up toilet paper and candy bars makes the game feel more immersive then it really is as far as loot is concerned. I almost wish the game made a distinction though between toilet paper and tooth paste and it didnt just all end up as one pool when you bring it back. But that would probably have made the game turn into a consumables stockpile sim, which i might like, but i bet most gamers wouldnt. So I accept the way it is, and be happy enough with it.I would have liked more base building features. Base defense battles (which may or may not be included but i have yet to see one). More weapon and armor types (though honestly there already a lot, but i just would like more). My biggest gripe is the lack of documention of some things. I find data items before I am told how they could can used, so i spent a long time trying to figure out why i couldnt access them in the library. I also got confused when unlocking blueprints inthe workshop had the same icon as the actual item construction. So i did blueprints and couldnt tell know could build the item, i thought it just made more blueprints. But fortunately the devolpers watch the forums and answered in minutes (literally minutes) and i got it sorted out. But its a good sign the game is complex enough to not be instantly figured out, but i would have liked better tutorials/documentation. If you read this whole review, you will know i am whole heartedly recommending this game. This game had me up til the sun rose the day of release playing it. Its probably been 2 or 3 years since a game did that to me. Thank you to the devolpers for making this game!			"

												I'm really sorry to not being able to recommend this game.In a nutshell: great story, lousy game mechanics. A pity.I played it twice: first time, total disaster.Second time, hyper-success (not challenging).The story is fine, realistic... it's clear there's a novel writer behind the game.The negative part is... the game itself. Seems incomplete, lots of unfinished features.So the story and atmosphere are very realistic, but many game mechanics are unrealistic.I am very disappointed, for the storyline is great as the atmosphere, yet too many bugs make it unenjoyable.I was forced to quit the game for good when I saw that the car contents are not automatically transferred to the shelter stockpile and, even worse, when at your shelter, you can only transfer items from the car to your personal inventory and then, via another cumbersome interface, transfer them to the stockpile.The breaking bug is that my character had little strenght and thus could carry few items at once, so transferring from car to me, and from me to stockpile was unbearably painful.

												All in all, I appreciate a game that brings the element of base building along with zombie combat. I don't tend to be very good 1st-person, as I fail at the twitch factor miserably (lol). However, it would be nice if there was a clock on the top of the screen at all times and pack animals, so we don't have to run back and forth to get everything. Also, more chickens and how about the ability to grow more by utilizing the roof and two other patios (so called because they look like the one that currently has the garden. Lastly, what about wandering zombies? When my party is our scavenging, how come they don't run into zombies in-route? I think these are easy additions (BTW - I'm in software as an SDET). Now, if you really wanted to do something fun, you'd allow us to move to another location or add/remodel the shelter/school. I'd love to get access to the roof areas (including the other two patios). Now, this would be a big change, but one that would breath some more life into an already interesting, if not grindy game. Anybody else have ideas?			"

								First of all I want to say that I love this game! This is the kind of game that takes you back to the glory dfays of the Fallout series.  I have however recently run into anm issue that makes the game unplayable.  Until the last patch IU was able to play, but now I get piexel shader error (direct x) that I cannot get past (hence making the game unloadable).  I have changed nothing opn my system so I am not sure what is causing this.  I have sent several messages on the forum dead state boards, but have received no response.  Is this a known issue that patch 4 did? Still totally reccomend this game once I can play it again!			"

												Played game some and can definately give a good critique now; I hope reveiw is  NOT seen as negative, but the constructive criticism it is. It appears that game makers do check these critics or we're just in sync with each other; thank you for the updates already made to game.Creators have added a way to attach own pics but I have to leave this critique for now because it's still relevant to a degree:    Character creation looks promising, but currenty selections are girly men and rough women. Also you apparently have to have some peircing, tattoo, or hair style fetishes because thats what's offered. character progress either as a preprogrammed set of improvements, or the main character can select where the points go. However, there is no xp bar or knowledge of when or where those improvments are coming from. you just check character screen every so often and go - yay!Inventory screen is severely lacking. When you return to base, only main chacter is accessible. Meaning he/she has to have all property on self in order to go through it. There is an auto remover for community items, but the items npcs are carrying are unaccessible at this point. Game was feeling linear in beginning; approaching a more sandbox like environment? I like that now your ( upto four man) team can now move somewhat independent by hitting j-key. It appears that game is leading us to the point where we can possibly recruit human survivors. Will all people be possible to talk to? or just a few scripted ones? Will a dialogue option be added to support this? My current experience is to visit local park, be attacked and win then be told back at base that I am a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for killing an innocent!?!  No control over that so I assume it's in fix mode. Some positive ideas, good luck with them - your the smart ones making it appear in game.   I also would think more resources or replentishable resources might be needed; or even, (just ideas) a gas truck  location, truck is stuck can't move, but I can send team to collect gas once in a while. Or maybe more ammo stashes, or reloading options, or even black powder firearms options (imagine the chicken farm that gives food and potassium nitrate for powder). Any chance on creating forward bases or safe houses, meeting other commnities for trade and safe haven. Imagine the house where you post a small team and can  add upgrades to or re-enforce. This would allow team to cover much more area on foot without the getting stuck and dying part.All these criticisms and bugs aside, the game seems to have so much potential I can't help but love it. Good luck team, I hope you  guys make a  great game.			"

												You can get a review of the features from different places. These are my impresisons.Is the game perfect? No. Is the game very good? No.Is the game good? Maybe.Is the game fun? Maybe.Let's get the elephant out of the way early. Dead State has a host of issues. Combat is simplistic. The zombies aren't really a threat. There are numerous bugs and I have experienced numerous crashes. Certain game concepts are poorly explained. The UI can be rough in places, especially dealing with inventory. You can't eject people from the shelter. Areas don't get monster respawn. Enemies are always in the same place on every game, limiting replayability. The list goes on. So there are many legitimate reasons why some people may not like it. Yet I enjoyed it for a while. The game feels old-school, almost in an original Fallout sense. It plays slowly and methodically and you have a chance to really get to know the world. Issues and situations are thrown at you, sometimes with no easy answer. It has that ""one more day, one more turn"" feel that most good games have. I always have something to do, explore, build and always a new situation to handle. The person who is bit - do I get them out of the shelter because they're using up all my antibiotics? Or do I do the merciful thing and keep them here? How do I handle an abortion issue?Does a woman's right to choose outweigh the necessity of repopulating the human race? Do I go fishing for food or do I try to scout that new camp to find supplies to reinforce our wall? Combat at times is difficult and after a fierce fire fight you can feel tired, not elated, but it's always nice to get the spoils of your victory. This is one of the first Kickstarter games I backed and I don't regret it because I wanted to see a game like this made. I had some fun playing it and it piques my imagination. There are many areas where the game could be improved and maybe that will happen and maybe that won't. If it does, Dead State may become a very good game. If it doesn't, I still got some enjoyment for my time spent with it. So why the negative review? The game is just simply too poorly balanced and too buggy to recommend. Combat is horribly unbalanced - you'll want one type of weapon and one type only because it's so vastly superior to everything else. Zombies are so easy to beat that they present no challenge whatsoever. A zombie game where you aren't afraid of the zombies is not a good thing. Bugs abound everywhere, including some show stoppers that won't let you finish the game. The NPCs that you meet aren't really interesting and their stories don't really go anywhere. The only threats are other humans and most of those interactions are exceptionally simplistic and almost all end in firefights. So between the balance, the bugs, the dull NPCs and the simplistic combat, after the first few hours you've seen everything the game has to offer. Simplistic combat + unscary zombies + few tactical options + bugs + simplistic NPC interactions  = unhappy Blackadar. It's too bad too because this game was close to being very good. It just needed another 6 months of real polish before release. It didn't get it. Long story short, you MIGHT have some fun with this if you're old school like me. But eventually you will probably tire of the bugs, balance an bad NPCs and you'll toss it away. I stuck with it to the bitter end, including an ending that required console commands to get past game stopping bugs, but that's because I'm a glutton for punishment. So I have to give it a thumbs' down. Go give your money to the Shadowrun games instead - better stories, better settings, better combat and better balance.			"

												Unbelievably addicting.  I lose all track of time and it really is a cross between Xcom and the walking dead.  Great concept, a few bugs to work out, but that's why it's a beta.  Keep up the great work and ideas!After 60 hours I'm still in love with this game....the developerss keep making the fixes where they need to and are dedicated to the players..just can't beat this zombie game.  Way better than State of Decay that I used to play on the 360.			"

												The is nothing in gaming history that I find more tedious, more unrewarding, than rolling a miss in a rpg.  Despite that, crpg's have been a staple of my game purchases for years.  For me, it's a ""good outweights the bad"" trade off.  That is not the case for Dead State.   Layered on top of tedious combat is Dead State's painfully plodding pace, slow performance and lackluster features.  This makes for a totally unrecommendable game. I liked the concept of the game and I do supprt the resurgance of crpg's.  That's why I contributed to this game and others like it on Kickstarter.  Unfortunately there is nothing classic about this game.  It is a shame, really.  Just from the amount of dialog you know they put a lot of work into the game.  They do continue to patch the bugs and promise more content.  But ultimately I don't find it worth the time.			"

								Maybe not yet, even though it's hugely enjoyable, it needs a little work. The developers seem active on the forums, and know most of the issues, and the end product will be excellent. I loved the game, even with it's bugs, and played the hell out of it, only to explore the whole map, have my food producing items break, and ran out of food, slowly seeing my well run well maintained school develop into starved murderers and people shouting at me, quite depressing, the zombies broke through the fence before we all killed each other, so there's that I suppose... Not sure if I'm the sort of person that could go through all that game again, but I think I might, after a few patches. I'm following the game to see what they fix, and I'll jump back on board again I guess.			"

												My thoughts on Dead State my first 2 trys at 20 hours each.Well... fighting zombies, gangs, thugs, and bringing truck loads of loot to disgruntled NPC's only to end up being shot by a dude in a wheelchair I thought was my friend which prompty ended the game...both times.However,My 3rd playthrough is actually going smoother thanks to a few console commands to help with morale issues. (Even if an ally is in a good mood there's a negative penalty to morale. ???) Also I had to use a command to remove some negative permanent status effects not being removed on its own. (I had 3 characters that were on fire for 24 hours) It's a pretty addictive game for the most part. It reminds me of the old-school icewind dale games to some degree. The AI could use some work, a cover system would be a nice touch during gun fights, but over all I found myself frustrated at the bugs in this game but kept playing away anyway.			"

								I remember reading about this game months ago, and then kind of forgetting about it. After completing a game of Wasteland 2, the turn based RPG bug bit me again.. totally reminding me of FO,FO2, and Jagged Alliance of days past. I searched steam for some more, and rememberd Dead State.Ive put some decent hours into Beta Patch #2 so far and I really like where this is going. Its got all the elements of past turn based RPG's (ie. combat, micromanaging, strategy, building) and more. You wake up as part of a group in a school, which becomes your ""base"". You have to stock that base with food, weapons, etc.. from surrounding areas, all while looking out for zombies and bad guys. Along the way, more can join your group and you have access to all the group for job tasks or scavenging. You dont level up by killing anything, you level up by completing ""shelter goals"". Some of the goals include gathering so much food, med supplies, luxuries, etc.. I thought this was a neat way to gain more skills for your characters, totally away from the norm of killing for skill. I like it.Im on day 25 or so on beta patch #2, and I'm coming to the point where I may have taken in too many people at once, so each day ends up being a search for food more than anything, luckily there are ""fishing spots"" to walk to and test your luck harvesting fish. In fact, I see the potential to have hundreds, if not thousands of locations on the map along with encounters because of the way the map scren and travel works.. this could be a pretty content loaded game moving forward.My Jagged Alliance heart wants to see more specialized firearm variants, as right now, they seem to have one firearm per ammo type. This may be wishful thinking, but would be pretty cool moving forward. I know its the zombie apocalypse, but cant that dead soldier just be carrying a MK17 SD variant or something ;)I'm sure others will complain about the ""graphics"" in some cases, but for me, they dont matter as much.. these games are about the adventure, the open world, the choose your own tasks, the story.. you make it what you want to survive. The true turn based RPG thrives non-linearly, and this game certainly has that potential.All in all, the game is well worth the purchase, even at this early access stage. I think we are in the middle of a turn based RPG game renaissance, and I couldnt be happier about it.  If you like this sort of game, micro managing little pixel squads of people, and, well, the zombie apocalypse.. get Dead State now, you wont regret it.			"

Early Access Review
								The First Seven Days of Dead State's Zombie Apocalypse Tactical Survival Game   The game as it is just a glimse into the final product, call it as an early access, demo or whatever, it is just the first seven days of the storyline with limited access to some of the features. Still, I am very impressed and excited by the game.   First of all it is a very traditional old school roleplaying game, the combat is great turn-based, very similar to Jagged Alliance 1 or 2, or Fallout 1 and 2, even to UFO series (the old ones especially). There is character sheets and stats to improve which have some effect in game. Obviously in the end game we might see better how these skills and attributes (and even perks that is not yet in the game but planned) will influence the game and give a boost to replay value.   The theme is from the Romero's zombie movies mostly. Zombies are slow, dead bodies, no mutations and freak abilities, differs mostly by the state of corpse. If you are fan of Romero's movies you would like this. If you are expecting a huge range of monsters then you will be disappointed. But if you can get along with it you might have a nice experience. The true enemy is the conditions, the lack of resources, other human beigns who compete for what left, ad your own group. There is a good amount of social dynamism even in such early state of the game and this will be just better. You influence your group morals by what kind of job you assign to them, who are you taking out to the dangerous scavenging missions, how much you listen to their advices and who do you listen to, and so on. There is a hint that there will be some power struggle among the group in later in game.   The tactical combat is good enough, if you learn the tricks it is not very hard, but honestly sometimes it can be difficult if you are not careful and the game can punish you very much if you are not careful or do a mistake. That is good in fact and makes the game just more interesting. If you are fan of turn based tactical combat, this game is for you. Weapons do have some special attributes, like cutting weapons can cause bleeding to living beigns, crushing weapons can cause disorientation, with some weapons you can knock your enemy prone and so on. Also there are some psychological conditions in effect, like panic when you are overrunned by zombies (a sure way to die quick).    There is penty of improvement to be made of course, and I list some which I think would make the game even in early access better. 1) Inventory screen: at this point I could not be able to reach the other survivors inventory at the base, and as you only able to command your main character in the area you have only a very ineffective way to equip your companions. A screen where your in-party companions could be equipped from the base storage would be great). Also it would be nice to be able to drop items to ground or just simply to exchange with others in the tactical maps. At the moment I only found one solution to trade items with companions, and that is to utilize the 'containers' already placed in game, put the items there and then change the control to other character and get those.2) It would be nice to see some notes or hints in the maps you have. You encounter empty houses, or places with some corpses and you wonder what's happened there. It would add to the horror if either you might able to collect clues what happened or youhave your companions comment on the situation.And finally I want to praise the music. It is great, melancholic, sad, but also in a way calming. It gives back something of the theme wandering in a city emptied of life. Well done and thanks fr th experience. I am looking forward to the final game and any updates. "

								This is a good game. Yes it does have faults. Yes you could argue it is still 'not finished'. I repeat, this is a good game.It feels good to buils the school, it feels good to grow the survivors. I read lots of people saying it isn't finished and not to buy it, yet most of them say they like it? It is a small Dev team, if you are sensible you would understand that they were under pressure to release as LOTS of people wanted to play the game. It is a very playable game. I am certain that over the next few  months the Dev Team will polish out the bugs. I, for one, will look forwards to playing the game again when bug free.In the meantime I have enjoyed it very much. I hope the team design (difficult) a more open ended game with possibly multiple bases and no set ending. (continually supported by DLC until interest goes)Thanks DB. Keep doing what you are good at.			"

								This has the markings of what will be a very good game. I'm enjoying what I'm playing so far intensely, and the new update has definitely added a lot of intriguing elements. One thing I will say though is that the current save/load system is pants, so hopefully that will be rehauled and properly usable in the final release. Otherwise I'd definitely say give this a try, it'll be worth the price tag by the time the final build is released.			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game.I’ve been watching it for a long while and started playing around Halloween. I am a big fan of turn-based games, base-builders and the zombie apocalypse-survival genre. Dead State is mature in theme and has a lot of different luxury goods to try and keep your group happyDead State is a graphically good looking game, but unfortunately one rife with bugs.There are typos, and floating inventory items – but these minor issues which can be over looked. A big problem in the game for me was when I had started building the well for my base. My project leader became sick and had to take a day off from working on it. When she returned to work the next day, the game refused to recognize that any of my characters possessed a crowbar, which was deemed a requirement for the task. I equipped her with three, in every imaginable slot. Nothing seemed to appease the game. While I was frustrated, I was determined to play on.The Coyotes are a violent, enemy group of rival survivors and they are VERY powerful in the early game. After several attempts to defeat them (there were no diplomatic options) I decided that you had to run from them. The Coyotes fire their weapons discriminately in combat and the sounds draws wave after wave of undead reinforcements down upon you.  Added to this, there are situations where, in combat, your move options are limited by fallen companions, KO’ed foes, terrain and areas of control of standing combatants, effectively trapping your characters so that they cannot fight enemies, while your foes continue to pump you full of lead. In tight spaces this can be lethal for your group.I finally quit in frustration. I really wished that this game could have been more polished. "

												I really, really wanted to like this game.I’ve been watching it for a long while and started playing around Halloween. I am a big fan of turn-based games, base-builders and the zombie apocalypse-survival genre. Dead State is mature in theme and has a lot of different luxury goods to try and keep your group happyDead State is a graphically good looking game, but unfortunately one rife with bugs.There are typos, and floating inventory items – but these minor issues which can be over looked. A big problem in the game for me was when I had started building the well for my base. My project leader became sick and had to take a day off from working on it. When she returned to work the next day, the game refused to recognize that any of my characters possessed a crowbar, which was deemed a requirement for the task. I equipped her with three, in every imaginable slot. Nothing seemed to appease the game. While I was frustrated, I was determined to play on.The Coyotes are a violent, enemy group of rival survivors and they are VERY powerful in the early game. After several attempts to defeat them (there were no diplomatic options) I decided that you had to run from them. The Coyotes fire their weapons discriminately in combat and the sounds draws wave after wave of undead reinforcements down upon you.  Added to this, there are situations where, in combat, your move options are limited by fallen companions, KO’ed foes, terrain and areas of control of standing combatants, effectively trapping your characters so that they cannot fight enemies, while your foes continue to pump you full of lead. In tight spaces this can be lethal for your group.I finally quit in frustration. I really wished that this game could have been more polished. "

												I tried it, wasn't a fan. As others have said this game suffers from poor combat and poor UI design. I think they are on to something here, but it is definitely not something I would recommend at this time. Love to re-evaluate when/if they get the UI issues sorted out.			"

												Pros:- Combat- Base building- Dialogue options that yield different results (cause NPCs to attack you, gain an ally, etc.)- Overworld map and various travel methods- Interesting random encounters and eventsCons:- Base building, job board, character menu, daily results, and inventory UIs- Looting and inventory management- Random game crashes (10 crashes in 66 hours of game play)- Lose an ally's items if they permanently leave your roster- Limited camera angles- On certain levels, the corpses of your enemies may disappear along with their lootPlayed through once just to see to the end. It was fun for the first 30 hours. Would not replay on harder difficulties due to the tedious looting and inventory management.			"

												I purchased this game with high hopes from reading other reviews, but was ultimately disappointed. After a few hours of play I don't feel the game is really as described in its marketing.It seems that Dead State is mostly about crafting and shelter maintenance, with some exploration and combat (and some other negative reviews have described the awful combat system already). These are things I have zero interest in. I was hoping for the ""social management"" and ""narrative"" parts to be stressed more. Instead, there appears to be no story at all, no narrative, nothing driving the game save for the shelter.While this may be realistic in a zombie apocalypse survival scenario, I just hoped for more in the way of RPG and less in the way of ""scavenge small items and make something out of them."" This would have saved it from being as slow and boring as it turned out to be.As an aside, there are also numerous bugs with the tutorial text appearing to give you tips about things you did 5 minutes ago, or are no longer in the room for, etc. More care needs to have been taken with editing and overall experience by the player.Totally disappointed, although someone else more interested in crafting a shelter could find this game fun.

												I really like this game.  I've played it for quite a few hours now.  The mechanics are great and the difficulty is just right.  The storyline is so-so, but the scavenging and combat mechanics are great.  You can really sink your teeth into the game spending hours on all sorts of activities, the limited resources and personnel make you think about how to approach different situations, and you are punished if you fail to keep morale up and your base well protected.If you like Turn Based games, blowing zombies away and managing resources, you will really enjoy this game.

												Attention!I previously wrote a review NOT reccomending this game but I changed my mind.Yes the game had issues that forced me to stop playing after say 8 hours. Yes it is still buggy and sometimes feel unfinished, but this is a game that rewards patience. It has a steep difficulty curve and has some dodgy gameplay mechanics at times, but it gets better.I have now spent around 15 hours and I come back for more.What I like:* Varied locations with a lot of attention to details.* Subplot told through collectibles that has suprising depth. Yes you can miss it and that is the lack of handholding rarely seen today.* A truly believable story of what it means to be a leader of what could be the last of humanity.* A cynical undertone of contemporary politics.

												Pretty decent if you like games like Jagged Alliance. A lot of the elements still needed work in this game but if you want to feel like a Walking Dead sim it does a decent job. When confronted with armed oppoents you can just generate noise and draw a horde towards them, its kinda fun maniplating the zombies with noise. But the AI can be painfully slow, I hid inside a mall store behind a shutter gate with the game in window mode just passing turns until the zombies I attracted killed all the corrupt cops.			"

I can't trade inventory items while at the shelter, I have to walk to a location just to swap gear.#3. I can't level up main stat points with the followers only secondary.#4. Possibly put an online/multiplayer mode. The NPC's in the game are just blah overall, bringing real people to survive would be AMAZING.#5. Add many more items and more places to loot, I find many shelves/cars  where you can't even check them out.#6. I have watched videos of ammo and other things vanishing from shelter inventory.The game is worth the money for sure, but can the Devs please improve the game more?!			"

Early Access Review
								Game won't start.Finally got it working, but it took a full windows re-install (joy).The interface isn't as intuitive as I would like, you right click sometimes and left click others. And there is no 'sneak' option. The AI is also pretty bad. Sometimes you can creep up on zombies, others you can't. When in a group, some attack at the same time, others just kind of stand back. But making noise does appear to spawn new zombies. Unfortunately, they just stand in your exit zone and are easily picked off.The story has been pretty interesting though. And there are some really neat ideas about how to fix stuff up, distribute work, and gain the trust of your allies.Overall, I would say this game would be worth checking out once it is released and has one good patch cycle behind it.

Early Access Review
								After almost 17 hours of play, I can see the game has a lot of potential.  This version allows you to play the first seven game days of Dead State.  It gives you plenty to do and see.  I have played through twice.  There seems to be a solid framework starting to take shape concerning the characters and their personalities in the shelter.  Each seem to have their own needs and desires and balancing these while trying to be productive and survive will be a factor.  The combat is reminiscent of X com, with action points required to move and to perform different attacks (based on the weapon equipped). The Shelter, your base of operations, can be improved with different structures providing additional benefits (only ""the well"" upgrade is available in this version) . Different characters have certain skill sets that allow them to perform task at the Shelter as well , some based on materials on hand, others based on what improvements you have constructed.You must decide when you venture forth if your going to leave a person behind at the shelter to work on a task or an improvement , or, to bring them along as part of the scavenging party.  The more people left at the shelter, the faster improvements get built, but the weaker the scavenger party is which could be catastrophic if you run into trouble.I enjoyed my time playing, even in this products current state, bugs and all (and there are bugs, but I expected that).  I can see the potential and I am optimistic about the final release.  I already pre purchased through doublebears website shortly after the kickstarter sign up ended.  The product description and early info was enough to convince me it would be a game I would enjoy.  If your on the fence about purchasing the game, $24 might be a steep price to pay to try it out.  Waiting for the demo might be a better bet.  I on the other hand view the current state as a bonus.  The devs have opened up their product early to the community and are very receptive to comments and feedback, and will be updating the build as time goes by.  I can't wait for the final release!

												I was pretty shocked to see that my original review of this game seems to have vanished -- it wasn't very flattering.  I can only assume it's MIA because now this is Dead State: Reanimated.So let me begin by saying that I was an original backer for this game, and I have followed it's development closely.  It showed great promise and intrigue, and there appeared to be a great dynamic between the devs and community.  That was, until Christmas 2014.In what was the most apparent and appalling cash-grab I have ever seen by any professional entity, Double Bear Studios knowingly and willingly released this game in an unfinished, buggy, crash-ridden state.  The flame war which ensued between the community and devs is the stuff that legends are made of.  I've hopped back to this game from time-to-time, in the hopes that it was finally completed in a halfway competent matter (again, great premise for a game and I love to support indie studios), but it looks like the project is finally been abandoned by the devs in a semi-working state.  It's still a POS final product, just not as big and stinky of a POS as when it was first released.Pros:Great premise of a game --  Walking Dead meets Jagged AllianceConsEverything Else!Game is still buggy as hell.  Don't even think about trying to play it on Windows 10.Graphics and music are just okayCombat is slow, slow, slooooooooooowwwwwww ... and equally boring.Almost non-existent base building.  Some upgrades are available ... but .... meh.Scripted locations and drops from scripted enemies.  Zero replay value because of this.  Almost zero percent random.A few different endings ... but nothing really that special.  Nothing that would make a player want to go back, retrace his/her almost exact steps again while dealing with the bugs and crashes.$30.00!!!!??  $30.00 for this POS buggy, game!??  Someone is seriously smoking crack if they think that's gonna fly.In Conclusion:I would suggest you don't buy this game.  Instead, spend a few hours reading through the forums starting at Christmas time, 2014.  The evolution of the flame war and the devs self-destruction of this game is far more entertaining and engrossing than the game itself -- and it's free.			"

												This game is out of keeping with my general purchases, but as it was on sale I felt it was worth a go.In many ways this game feels like it could be mission-based content for one of the ""Rebuild"" games, which I certainly mean as a compliment.Theaspects that let this game down mainly revolve around combat. In combat the game feels like a clunkier version of X-COM. The pace is slower than X-COM's, too slow in fact due the difficulty level of game and this leads to the game being less desirable to play for long periods and, conversely, impossible to play for just short periods.However outside of combat; the plot line is compelling, more so than ""Sheltered"" or ""This War of Mine"" which are, conceptually, very similar games to this, albeit in the 2D format. The characters are very varied, particularly when you consider the large number of them and the dynamics between them are intruiging and quite realistic,htis adds greatlyto the hames playability.Overall I wouldn't spend full price on it and due to pacing I may never finish a game to completion, but in generalI think it will provide an enjoyable distraction fromt he real world.

Early Access Review
								Potential, potential, potential.While there's not that much content yet (at least not released to public) and the updates are a bit slower than what I'd like... if you are fan of the zombie genre, this game is for you. It's not the ultimate zombie game, but it's a different take from all the other similar themed products out there.If you are into the more psychological aspect of the zombie survival, buy buy buy. That's not to say there isn't combat, but that's not the reason why this game shines.<< 09/26/14 UPDATE >>So the game has hit BETA state and the first patch has been released. I've also become a bit more active in the game's forums and learnt a couple things that I'd like to share with potential buyers.First, the game is meant to be SHORT. In game time is estimated to be about 3 or 4 months. This is worrysome when you consider that it'll probably take you less than 2 months to kill and loot EVERYTHING in the rather small area map you get to explore. This would mean that you'd spend a substantial amount of time either idle or simply dealing with repetitive task like assigning jobs or going to auto-gather locations.Talking about locations, a lot are on the small size. In most cases, you get to explore an area with only a couple of enterable buildings, which further decreases game time.Combat is still pretty straight forward and rather easy. My biggest worry hasn't been zombies or hostile survivors, but loot capacity. Once you know where you can find a good armor and a decent weapon (usually melee), you can go there almost straight away and get kitted out. Unless they substantially change how combat behaves (specially remove the player's ability to run behind an enemy and begin combat, thus always getting the first shot), I can't see it become challenging. Even big groups can be split appart by causing noise, which usually leads one or two members straight into your ambush just around the corner.Can't really comment much on the game's story as of yet because a lot of the script and dialogues have not been implemented or are currently not working, but even though it does seem to be shaping up to be an interesting zombie survival story, the presumed lenght of the campaign worries me greatly.I'd still recommend the game to any zombie fanatics out there, but be sure to know what kind of game you are getting into.All in all, I would recommend you go check out Project Zomboid before you buy this one, because even though the graphics are worse, it's got the survival aspect nailed down MUCH better than Dead State, and survivor AI is also in the works there.PD: There's no plans of allowing modding to the game either, at least from what I've seen and read.<< 14/03/15 UPDATE >>Well, after waiting for a good while for some kind of patch or content update I find myself abandoned by the developers. There hasn't been any major changes since December and from what I've seen, the Devs already said that the planned ""expansions"" have been called off because the game didn't sell well enough. What does that mean? You'll get a few more patches that fix what should have been functional on release day and perhaps a few more game mechanics that also should have been there on release day. Then, it's game over for Dead State.I am angry at myself for thinking that this could be any good. I've been following this since Alpha and I should have known that this team could not pull off such an ambitious project. Ambitious because it was something new, not because it was something hard to do. Honestly, with dated graphics and game mechanics that seem out of the 90s, how could this game take them two years to make? And don't get me started on the ending and the plot holes and so much other stuff.Bottom line, Dead State brings nothing new to the party. Combat hasn't been improved. Its boring, repetitive and cumbersome (when it doesn't bug out). The story is lame and the characters - while they have a few moments - are blanks that say their lines (the very few they have) and stand around in your shelter doing absolutely nothing. Music is nothing to be remembered. The rest of the game mechanics - specially the survival aspect - are badly implemented, break immersion or simply make no sense.What more can I say? I've been warning the devs about these faults for a long time on their forums and I was always met with blind optimism or simple denial. Now we are 3 months after release and it's exactly what I thought was going to happen: A disaster.To any possible customer:You want Combat? > H1Z1 / DayZ Standalone / DayZ ModYou want Survival? > Project ZomboidYou want story? > The Walkind Dead by Telltale Games, S1 and S2Changing my recommendation to a thumb down. Sorry, but you truly earned it DoubleBear.			"

												I played it when it was just released unfinished in Dec 2014. Then  I finished it once as Reanimated. And then again. So yea, I liked it. I think i have 200+ hours in it.I can only recommend to play it on hard difficulty and iron-man. Then you have to absolutely manage the noise, or you will get swarmed by zeds. Of course AI doesn't care about noise, so you have to plan accordingly.I do agree that combat is kind of lackluster, but I've seen worse. And you have to love looting and screwing around with inventory. Tons of items: weapons, luxury items, food etc. If you decode the messages and then read them in order, you will get some backstory.Game has some balance issues depending on your skill choices. For example if you go for the Lab ASAP (using your character) and take perk double antibiotics, on the long run it is very beneficial (you will end up with all skills maxed out +29 unused). But it will be hard first 10 days. Especially encounters with coyotes biker gang. Min-maxing makes game easier too, balanced chars are usually harder to play.Playing ""good"" hippy type is easier than complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (much harder as you will not recruit as many followers).I never had a crash in reanimated. Shelter inventory window sometimes gets a minor bug which goes away after restart. My last play-through i haven't found Galaxy Wars limited edition, but it is not crucial (just a mood boost for ally).Juts try the demo and decide for yourself. It's so far the best turn based Zed-RPG IMO.			"

												X-com in a Zombie holocaust.You're either completely sold on that premise or don't know what Im talking about. If you're in the same group as I am, and hearing those words makes you go ""OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG"", then the game was made specifically for you in mind.This is and indie labor of love devoted to a very specific game mechanics that lots of old school gamers like myself find lacking in todays ""PEW PEW"" marketplace. People in that group probably know who they are and can accept the quibbles of low budget games like this so long as the broad strokes work, and they do for the most part.Like many criticisms have likely pointed out, the game is definitely unintuitive in certain areas, inventory management being the one that immediately springs to mind. However, in fairness, many of the criticisms I see people saying certain things aren't in game when in fact they are, such as Group inventory management at base, attacking diagonally (must have a two handed weapon). However these features can be lost in the somewhat clunky interface.Basically, the idea of an old school base management turn based RPG in a zombie holocaust either sells you on it's own, or it doesn't. If that premise whets your whistle, you'll likely be able to look past some of the quibbles of indie game design in favor what they did right, which is quite a lot. You'd also be able to look past the unfortunate release timing of the game which puts in smack dab in the middle of zombie mania in pop culture, when in fact at it's inception that would have made it a much more original concept.

												UPDATE:With the new ""Reanimated"" release I felt like bumping this game again.Many of the bugs/issues that were present in previous iterations are now fixed, bear in mind I managed to complete the game before this update encountering only a couple of major issues, but some players encountered more, well...If you haven't tried Dead State yet, I highly suggest to do it now.*****You can craft, you have to interact with a lot of npcs, you have to scavenge for food and other resources, build and fortify your shelter, explore a vast map, you have to fight for those resources against gangs, other survivors and random crazy dudes and you do it in a very good turn-based way, your choices matter, but is not like this world is frozen in time, waiting for you to take a decision.Oh and of course there are zombies, zombies at your door, zombies on the streets, in the stores, in the houses, in the forest...So if this is what you are looking for in a game, well you just found the perfect game: an open world, turn based zombie apocalipse survival RPG.

												I've enjoyed it.  This last patch is kinda buggy, which is unfortunate that it's the release patch and so many people are getting down on the game.  More than my money's worth in entertainment, but like I said, the release patch is kinda buggy and crashy, but it will be patched up.As an example, in my best run, I had about 40 survivors with me, each with their own abilities that level up, we travelled by horse everywhere and did our best to survive by picking fruit, fishing fish, and killing zombies.   As the game progresses of course zombies became less and less of a problem, and different human groups became the problems, including the police, army, bikers and survivalist groups that just didn't like the look of me and  my raiding errrrr hunting party.If what you are looking for is a game with:a) zombies (And angry barely surviving humans)b) fortifying your base (Watchtower, stone fence, garage, garden, shooting range, etc)c) medium level Role play (Most role play actions are done just at the start of each day, and can range from your people asking you for a day off because they feel ill, or asking for particular items out in the world, or a crisis event which may be someone murdered another person in the group)d) exploration (The map has a bunch of stops with maps of varying sizes)			"

												A great indie title by veteran AAA game developer talent (formerly of Troika and Obsidian). The Zombie Apocalypse meets the narrative-driven styling (and structure) of the classic Infinity Engine games. If you like strategy RPGs, choice-driven narrative, and/or the setting, then this game is well-worth your time.Update 06/10/15: I spent a lot time with the game in beta and a bit at launch, but held off playing the game all the way thorugh because every crowdfunded game needs a while to work out the kinks. The wait was well worth it. Double Bear released a ""Reanimated"" edition with a slew of new content to go along with their latest patch. The game I played was a mix between a ""Tactics"" game, Suikoden, and your standard zombie apocalypse fare. What Dead State offers which is unique is the chance to take on the zombie apocalypse on a large scale. It is not a tightly narrative experience like The Walking Dead or an action/survival horror game like Resident Evil. Here, you get to do the stuff they do in the movies or on TV - gather survivors, build a safe place, manage your society, and explore out into the world in order to scavenge, find out what's going on, and find something that lets you hope for a better tomorrow. The game plays out on a large canvas.If you are a RPG fan and/or like zombie stories, then this is a ""must"" purchase for you. It is also a *very* long game with different ending conditions depending on how you traverse the storyline. There are various modes (difficulty, infection levels, etc.) that offer solid replay value. You get your money's worth with this one.			"

												Day 9. Didn't sleep a wink, Elaine was on the stairwell sobbing again setting everyone on edge. Doug's been needling me to take her on a scavenge and leave her gutshot out by the old church. He figures it will draw them out as we slip in the back, given it was an emergency shelter before it was overrun. A lot of provisions in there Doug says, and with Elaine gone, one less mouth to feed means one more meal for me. But I doubt Davis would buy it, that wily cripple likes to remind us of how he took us in. And now the bleeding heart's handing over the last of our antibiotics to some Mexican kid with the bite. I swear to the God that abandoned us, I'd walk down the halls putting a bullet in each of them as they slept if it weren't for the fact that the fence has a hole you could fit a bus through and the noise would bring them in from three counties. Now isn't the time for division. No one survives out here on their own; looters, the dead, or Coyotes, one of them will find you. Make enough noise like the Sheriff did, and maybe it'll be all three.So I hunker down, listen to Elaine bleat and I earn my keep... bushwhacking and scavenging, two or three times more than most. And for what? Another week of waiting to die chewing half rations of Mr Munchie bars and mouldy fruit. I guess it ain't all bad. The new guy that showed up just gave me some chilli sauce and some rechargeable batteries. With all that's wrong in this messed up world, I have to admit, my mood's better already.			"

								Pretty neat game. Really good to revisit some turn based combat stuff. Its holding my attention as a fun diversion from other things.A few quirks still yet but very neat to play.No problems with game play I have had so far.No crash issues.I dont like that you can knock out people but then are forced to kill them outright while down, you cant just loot them and leave them helpless.A few things I am still learning to deal with, but again, overall a good play at this point.

												This game is really addictive, if you are into post-apocalyptic hoarding sims. Your goal is to manage a shelter with increasing population, manage the resources, deal with personal problems of the people and on the side figure out what actually happened. While there are many bugfixes still necessary during the entire game I had a feeling that this is a game made with dedication and love. Also they promised more content for it and I'm already 22 hours in and haven't even explored half of the map. If you can look past some glitches and the graphics this game is actually better than Dragon Age: Inquisition.			"

												Dead State stands alone as a Zombie TBS Rpg, mostly because there aren't any others. The game's core is great, the concept is spot on, and Turned based strategy is, in my opinion, the best mechanical base for a zombie game. The final product isn't as good as I hoped it would be when I first read about it two years ago. But I still think the released game is enjoyable, if short of the potential the setting and style could have provided. IssuesDead State uses the Torque engine just like Age of Decadence, its not that pretty. Better than 2d pixels but it also lacks the ""retro charm"" some pixel games capture. There is very little scripted content like what is found in Age of Decadence, I enjoyed that content in AOD and wish some of these engine utilizations made it into Dead State. Its psuedo open world, you really have no choice in where you go or stay only in the order of actions. This is the biggest issue I have with game. There is very little emergent content, and NPC interactions are very limited. Its either friendly will join you, or shoot first ask questions later. If you shoot first you make everyone sad though.UI is clunky and this is a title you should read the manual for, otherwise you will be complaining about follower item management in the forums. The goodIts a zombie tbs RPG!Classic zombies, ie walking dead style. No sci-fi exploding, mutuant jumping zombies. Could use more of them on screen at once IMO. All the classic themes are present. Gather supplies, fix up your shelter, defend against zombies and bandits, or be a bandit. Good selection of weapons, items, skills, upgrades, etc. You can build a self sustaining fortress, but you can't leave and live in a house of your choosing. This is a great base and I'm excited to see what/when mods get ahold of it.			"

												I'll try to write this review as objectively as I can, but this is my dream game.  I have been waiting for a turnbased zombie rpg with base building most of my life.  Overall the game fulfills this dream.  All it needs to be perfect is a sandbox mode for after you've played through the story several times and seen all the endings.  The devs have stated they may add that some day.The writing and characters are the best I have seen in a long time.  This is due to the writing talent and experience the devs bring.  The head dev is Brian Mitsoda, the head writer for Vampire: Bloodlines.  His wife, Annie VanderMeer Mitsoda of Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir, also contributed her writing talent.Some may find the combat simplistic, but this game is an rpg, not a strategy game and the combat is no simpler than a classic rpg like Baldur's Gate.  There is enough variety in weapons, armor, and special gear to keep combat interesting and allow for a variety of tactics.  Especially with the inclusion of the noise mechanic that attracts zombies.Other reviews may mention bugs, and when it was first released it had a few major ones.  However they have been resolved and the remaining ones can sometimes be annoying but there is nothing game stopping.  The devs work hard to fix them and have released several patches since release.Considering they raised just over 300,000 on kickstarter, I think it is amazing what they pulled off.  I can only imagine what they could have done with the millions other rpgs had raised on kickstarter.So in summary, if you like classic turn based rpgs with some base building added in, you should like Dead State.

												I have been following Dead State for a long time now and I've seen it improve again and again as it's development progressed. I'm adding a review now that it has finally left early access and TL;DR - It's an amazing game. Building your base gives you various objectives to look forwards to. Scavenging is fun and rewarding, giving you that fist pump ""Yes!"" moment when you find something good. Combat is engaging and strategic, although zombies could be a little more threatening (the moment you can kill one with a single sneak attack makes mowing through them effortless).I've restarted my game again and again as new content was added, having fun each time exploring everything new. I'd definitely reccomend the game to anyone who enjoys survival, zombie, or Turn based strategy games.			"

												Turn based!!!1000's of ways to die, or well, 1000's of infected and non infected ways to be killed.  Fairly sure this is my new go to game when lounging around the apartment (not at home of course, well maybe).Strategic and Tactical decisions required at numerous points of the game impact key areas of food, material, who lives and which allies go by the wayside. Some allies are quest driven, some are just zombie bait, remember, though, just because Joe is useless today, doesn't mean that they won't be useful later and when your skills increase.A murderer was found today at the shelter, tried, and convicted, death by hanging at 1700, do you want to know more!?  Face it, the folks that survive a major pandemic are probably not voted, most likely to succeed in a, what is considered a normal, moral society.  Figuring out their problems, solving their problems and saving them from themselves are what a leader of a group does right?With the current release Dead State has got even more functionality and continues to amaze me.Warmest Regards,Suralle			"

												Dead State is a fun tb-strategy rpg game mainly concerning scavenging, battles, resource management, building a secure base and dealing with other survivors during a zombie outbreak. I like the way of leveling survivors, where they earn stats and skillpoints by completing certain goals. During scavenging there're a lot of different weapons and armor to be found, so I can play my own suitable combatstyle. Except battling zombies there're also many social challenges through dialogues between survivors which I like to solve. I've played Dead State since beta came out. The game has still bugs, but the devs are doing a great job frequently releasing patches and showing that they care. As a die-hard fan of survival games I really enjoy Dead State.			"

Early Access Review
								If you're looking for a very fun point and click based RPG based around survivors in a zombie apocalypse this is it. Dead State has been coming out for quite some time now and just recently got released under early access on Steam, if you aren't a HUGE fan of it please do not buy it or you will be disappointed with the length. Basically the game consists of you surviving in a world gone mad, you have to make sure your shelter is adequately protected, maintain relationships with other survivors, beware of threats etc. You can currently only build a well for the shelter but by the looks of things there's going to be quite a lot to upgrade in the full game.You get a map where you venture out to various locations, to collect supplies, etc and fight zombies and looters.All in all its a FANTASTIC game and I'm in love with it and cannot wait to play more. P.S. You'd be looking at 8-12 hours of game-play for the 7 day demo if you explore all the locations etc and do everything.			"

												I've played this game for over a year now, starting way back when it was limited to a 7 day run.  In that time, it has grown and evolved immensely.  If you've played games such as Fallout 1-2. Brotherhood of Steel, or the Final Fantasy Tactics games, or even any of the X-COM franchise, new or old, the isometric view and turn based combat will be familiar and nostalgic.  The game is not a graphical powerhouse, and was never intended as such, it is much more focused on the story, on the myriad and drastically varied group of people thrust together into a desperate survival situation.Every one of the more then 40 characters is unique, from the first handful you start out with to the dozens more you can find and recruit over time, they each have their own desires, demands, and (in some cases) psychosis.The zombies, while an ever present obstacle, aren't the real threat, but then, they really never are.  From as far back as the first forays into the genre, (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, etc,) the zombies are a foe, but not the major threat.  The major threat is, as always, other people.  The dead are easy to predict, simple and direct.  Your living foes, the duplicitious, under handed, cruel, desperate or just good old fashioned bat crap crazy other survivors of this world of central Texas are where the real challenge lays.  They are, by their very nature, completely unpredictable, and profoundly deadly.Over all, this game, while it certainly does have its rough spots, is absolutely worth the money.  The dedication and detail that the development team has put into this title shows through any of the realtively minor remaining bugs, and will likely provide many hours of enjoyment.UPDATE:The Reanimated rerelease, update, add-on, what ever you want to call it, adds a lot more polish and even a small amount of new content for no additional price.  While it was a game worth picking up a year ago, it still is, remaining a rare gem of the early access system.			"

Early Access Review
								I am not a big fan of RTS games (I'm old and slow) so I tend to really gravitate towards turn based games.  So naturally I was very interested in Dead State and followed its development for some time (seems like a really long time).  I didn't actually buy it and begin playing until update 3. I really wanted to wait until release but curiosity got the best of me.There aren't a whole lot of games that do turn based isometric combat really well.  Dead State doesn't do anything new in that regard either, in fact the combat, even though it can be quite a challenge until you get decent armor, weapons and skills it is really very simple. There is no cover, crouch, stealth or very many combat options at all. But it still manages to be very engaging and fun.  With that said it really isn’t the combat that make this game so engrossing.Dead State does a great job of drawing you into the world it’s created.  You need to struggle to survive. You need to struggle to keep your base running. You need to struggle to get along with your ever growing group of personalities, oops I meant fellow survivors.  You’re in charge but you’re challenged to stay in charge.  You have to choose whether to allow in, or to keep some useful troublemakers.  Word of warning some people might not be what they seem to be!  As the game has developed through various updates; it’s now on update 5.5, the dialog has gotten a little more polish. It is fairly deep as it is but it could be deeper, just a slight knock in that department. The stories are compelling but a little shallow. There is plenty to do at the base, but also not much to do at the base at the same time. I know that’s confusing let me explain. The game progresses at the close of each day, sort of a big ""end of turn"".  Every day you set up your job assignments and go out into the word to scavenge. Back at base after you talk to your fellow survivors, there a few lines of dialog and dialog choices and that’s pretty much it. So even though you begin to care about some of your survivors and your base there really isn’t any way to satisfyingly interact with your base or fellow survivors.In closing what you have here is a very solid good time playing in a zombie apocalypse.  It isn’t very deep but it is still very satisfying and it will eat up a big chunk of your time as you get into that, ""well let me just see what happens tomorrow"" (or the just one more turn) mindsetOverall I’d rate it a solid 7.5 out of 10, it loses points because its combat is somewhat primitive and the stories inside your home community are a little shallow. This game is well worth the cost and well worth your time if you are at all interested it this genre, in other words, BUY IT! PLAY IT! I doubt you’ll regret it! "

												Well dangit, they done did it. Them dang liberals have ruined the world. Now the streets of my beloved Texas are filled with shambling, birkenstock wearing zombies... Basically it is now New York City.But in all seriousness folks, there aint one can of propane left in this dang town. What kinda person makes a game about survival and forgets about the propane?!?!?!(A good game, but not for everyone, with good writing and character development. It is not often you find a game that takes the proper amount of time to actually write down what the charcaters are going to say then decide if it is right. Some very subtle humor, and some not subtle, along with some fun bits of homage to such things as Brekaing Bad and... I kid you not... a very obscure reference to a Newsradio episode from 2 decades past? Really Brian, really?)So if you want to play a story while having to smash zombie heads and fight off looters for the last twinkies in the state... buy it.			"

								Great game, Easy to get into, hard to master. Still some rough patches as it being Early Access, such as uncompleted locations, and certain bugs BUT this game has been updated more than regularly since I've purchased it. Unlike most games THE DEVS ACTUALLY LISTEN IN THE FORUMS!!!!!!!!People post about a certain bug, or certain things they'd like in-game (IE: ability to unload guns and stack ammo). Fun Turn-based strategy concept of the zombie apocalypse genre. If you are a Turn-based strategy junkie this game is a no brainer for you to pick up. Those of you that want that COD: Nazi Zombie ....thing....lol well this game won't be your cup of tea.			"

												I have been waiting for this game since I first heard of its concept! It is everything that I wanted in a game, a 4x game that has Zombies, survivors and a base of operations. With researching, scavanging, creating and assigning jobs it gets even better the longer you play it!  I really liked it when it was only a 7-day early release version, I love this game now. Even with some of the problems, it is totally worth playing. The creators are continously updating and tweaking it to make it even better. If there is a found problem that you (or anyone) reports, they work on fixing it asap. The problems are few, and I have only expierenced a couple while it was in early release, but when they patched it, the problems dissappeared. This game is very worth the price to pay. Buy it, play it, enjoy it!			"

												First day, went into restaurant looking for supplies. Scared girl in hoody jumps out screaming ""Get away from my stuff!"" She tries to stab me, but misses. Cop in my group panics and fires a shot at her, hits Cindy (her name) critically in the abdomen. Me, not wanting to escalate the situation, flees to the restroom to hide. Trucker chick in group gets adrenaline rage, smashes baseball bat across Cindy's skull, knocking her out. Meanwhile, zombie attracted by gunshot comes out from kitchen, and before we could do anything, zombie starts to chow down on unconscious Cindy. I come back out from washroom to help kill zombie.  Zombie gets dispatched, but Cindy revives as a zombie and attacks me again. Anita smashes her skull with bat again, killing her again. Anita calms down from rage, and expresse remorse over killing Cindy, twice.11/10 Best  Walking Dead simulator ever.			"

												There are many ""zombie/survival Sims"" out there now. Most are single soliditary type of adventures, but games ia all about the true manageing a community of surviviors. The maps are varied and there are many locations. It does take the whole X-com approach to turn fighting and despite the bugs the game is still pretty fun. It's also very immersive and the developers has been very receptive to the community and implmenting bug fixes and new contant since the Beta. Truly a labor of love for over 5 years from this indie developer and it shows. Very underrated and one of my favorite games to play as i kind of like managing a society. This is a game that has actually gotten better through it's beta stages to the state it is now. A 9/10 for me and would recommend to anyone with a Zombie or hoarding management itch.			"

												Very well written game with interesting story and good atmosphere. Do not expect it to be mainly combat focused as the combat is bit trivial. What I find really outstanding are the personnal stories of the cca. 40 survivors you can have in your shelter.As of 19.12.14 the game isn't as polished as it could and should be and some bugs might spoil your experience. Not all endings are implemented and some personnal stories of your survivors are incorrectly sequenced/finetuned but the majority is done properly and there are really many of them.Very nice addition to the game is the possibility to decode messages and files(150 of them) from other survivors where you can read stories how the disaster happened and some other interesting reading. Conspiracy theories etc. fitting well with the overall atmosphere of the game.Building and running your shelter and its inhabitants is done nicely even if it might not be challenging for experienced players.

												Slow-paced Zombie survival RPG. Build a base, recruit survivors, and try to maintain some civilization. Not particularly flashy or sizzly, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

Early Access Review
								I personally think this is a gem in it's genre. If you never played a turn based tactical rpg before, just try it. What is there to lose? If you already did, great!When it comes to turn based tactical rpg's, I have played a lot of them. We all agree we loved Jagged alliance 2, but all others have been received with mixed feelings. Not many of them could break out of the standard formula of a squad of six, besides silent storm, the setting was always more or less the same.This game doesn't feel like jagged alliance at all and that makes it so great! The setting is very, very well chosen. In a post apocalyptic world money becomes unimportant, so you have to start building yourself. The combat system is primitive, but handles very nicely.Also, living people and zombies live side by side. Every now and then that makes for interesting combat situations. Don't let knocked out foes lie around when zombies still roam the combat area!On top of that, a lot of what you will be doing is managing. Your team will consume food, gasoline, antibiotics and so on. They will not all like eachother and you will sometimes fail.Personally, I think the game has a lot of potential of becoming a new benchmark and making the genre surpass its never found glory. I am pretty happy that I helped the makers a few euro's closer to keeping up the good job.			"

												First of all, I love this game. (8/10)It has right the amount of progress to keep you playing, looting and dealing with moral choices...But it has some major issues too:1) You can stalk up to enemies in realtime and most of the time make the first blow. BUT the pathfinding Ai is really bad for your team (not the selected player that one is good). (especially with 4 ppl in the party) So you end up with one to two ppl next to the enemy and 2 ppl more than one round away.You can't do that in Turn based mode, cause the enemy instantly knows you are sneaking up to them even if they didnt see you comming.2) You can not pause the game to make changes or give orders. That wouldn't be bad, if the turn based mode would not just end after no one is close by. (You see someone is comming, hit Space Key and want to reload before the actual combat begins. Yea.. right.. damn picked the wronge Character, Space again.. realtime continues.. bam they see you.. combat starts... all weapons shot empty -.- )Having a complete Party movement without going to realtime would be great. (or a Pause mode with beeing able to give orders)3) Loads. Having loot that has weight is a nice game mechanic and (Warning potential Spoiler:) later when you get to use a car, you can load stuff into it. All nice, but im missing the possibility to have additional Horses or a Trailer for your car (cause it can only hold 200pnds of loot... even a Fiat 500 can pack more Stuff)And you must unload the car by hand. (every Character has the option to choose the whole inventory and move it to the shelter stash. But the car is no Character so you have to unload the car into your player char inventory and after that you can move it into the stash.4) Sorting of the Task Board.... it just does what it wants, after you have changed one task.Sorty by Job... Change Char XY from No Job to Guard Duty... and complete chaos. (if its a problem with the code.. just don't sort after a change)5) Science Skill... i played now for 30+h and I only got one char in my group with science above 6... but he has NO mechanics skill.. so i can't build armor -.- (because it needs Science to research in the workshop but you need atleast 1 point in Mechanics to unlock the Workshopmenue in wich you can resarch it)If there are coming more Patches and new content, this game will be awsome.Until then its great, and if you see it in a sale.. buy it.(Maybee you noticed, im no native speaker, so please forgive me my mistakes) "

												The world ended and I got to loot a Twinkie Snack Cake factory.  Best Christmas ever.  10/10 Would apocalypse again.  Some crashing, but generally speaking just hitting quick save before changing zones made it a minor irritation.  Had the same trouble in Fallout back in the day.  It's almost nostalgic crashing, in a way.  Other than that, no major bugs for me to date.  For a more serious review, I give it a solid 7-8/10.  Graphics are reasonable, challenge level is reasonable so far, and the premise and execution are interesting.  No major UI irritations.   Story and character interactions are decent.  All in all it's a phenomenal concept that I can't believe hadn't been done in this form before.  If you like X-Com type turn based combat, it's a great entry in that genre.  If that's not really your bag, it's probably more of the 7/10 I gave it above.  Still well worth playing.			"

												I read alot of the reviews on here for this game before purchasing, a long list of positive, and I think theyre crazy. I purchased this game for 30 dollars and I feel ive been ripped off. DO not purchase this game for more then 10 dollars, its not that level of playable. It has clunky controls, 99 % of the items you find are not actually useable, theyre either quest items or food/materials that you store in your safehouse. The game starts without voiced dialogue, intro, or special effects of any kind. The character creation screen is laughable, they took 5 character faces for man and woman, wioth  5 different attributes; neck tattoo, choker, skin color, 5 different hair, and shuffeled them around to make it look like they have 100 + charaters to choose from. While I obviously havent given it much time, I was soooo shocked at the poor quality of game I just purchased for 30 dollars that I had to write a review.  Most importantly the game isnt fun. Your bored before you ever begin. Your bored at reading instructions, your bored during combat, your bored looking for where your suppose to go, your bored watching your party travel across a 2d map.

												The game's released. It's been a rocky launch technically.They probably rushed it a bit too fast, but it's pretty solid. If you have the patience to put up with bugs and glitches you will find a good game here. The developer seems intent on stabilizing the game in that regard. It's an interesting mix of survivalist group management and turn based tactical resolution. The combat AI is fairly linear (You aggro zombies and looters and they attack), but that works fine for this genre. My biggest complaint is that gun combat mechanics are VERY weak once you start fighting militia and rogue soldiers. It's the exact same run-n-gun AI from the early game except these guys have assault rifles, body armor, grenades, and a firm desire to expend all that in killing you.  Consider carefully before starting a campaign in Ironman mode.  The game keeps you on rails to start with limited options, but that opens up as you go. For me the game's become more rewarding the longer I've played. I like it a lot.			"

												To start with, this game is worth the money, however there are a couple issues:1. Allies stats never improve, it pretty much feels like your character is the sole reason any of these people survive.2. You can't access your allies inventories while in your base. this combined with the weight carrying system and the auto deposit system makes it somewhat annoying. i.e. You will have stuff that isn't auto converted to resources that is simply stuck on other characters until you leave your base and go someplace else. 3. bugs, occasionally you will run up to a zombie, initiate combat, and low and behold..... nothing. I have tried everything but occasionally the attack cursor will simply not show up causing me to have to retreat to a safe distance while pounding my head into the desk.If these issues could be fixed it would be an amazing game. currently it is worth the money but just barely			"

												Having a lot of fun playing as a custom class survivor named ""Biff Tannen"" who is low on perception, and a little dim, but pretty sturdy in the other stats! Also went all in on melee to try that out, and so far so good. He takes a licking and keeps on ticking. The other survivors are having to make up for his shortcomings a bit, but I think that is half the fun of Dead State's character creation and working with a team of survivors with different strengths and weaknesses to get through the zombieocalypse together.The explorer in me is also really digging finding new locations to roam around in and loot for a large variety of melee and ranged weapons to try out with my team.

												Despite the lack of polish, glitches, crashes, character clipping, erratic character movement, minimal sound, frustrating dialogue options with seeminlgy no results and constantly moody NPCs, Dead State has really got it's hooks into me. At it's heart, it's a fantastic game idea which I can't put down. Trying to coordinate the daily run(s) to grab supplies and, more than likely, get hurt a lot by both the undead and the living whilst trying to unearth valuable supplies, antibiotics and gas in particular, whilst also ensuring that you've got the right people doing the right jobs to upgrade your base is highly engaging. Finding the two antibiotics that you desperately need on the last looter that you down really gives you that excitement that all good games provide.Is it finished? No, not by a long shot. But can I work with that? Yes. That being said, I also cannot wait for the final, polished version. For someone who has had a 15 year hiatus from old school PC gaming, I was lured back by Wasteland 2 and have been well and truly sucked in since. If the devs can get Dead State up to the same level of quality that the guys behind Wasteland 2 achieved, that would make me a very, very happy man.Double Bear, please keep the work going. You've got the bare bones of a fantastic game. It just needs a really good wax on the top coat.			"

												Awful. Was suckered into this by almost all positive reviews; seems peculiar that those ones popped up early, and most reviews since have been damning (and rightly so). Would be surprised if those positive ones were legit, based on their claims and timing.-This game has basically non existent sound design. Barely any music to speak of and no voiced characters (which I sometimes see as appropriate, but this game needs anything to liven up the dull repetitive dialog it has).- Combat is supposedly like X Com or similar. It *wants* to be like that. But then it decides to have inconsistent rules, unclear directions, and a ridiculous scarcity of options or depth.- It's suggested that the Base building mechanic might function like that in State of Decay. No. The big empty building you're given remains as such.- I will readily accept that games needn't look good. But this one has a complete lack of polish, and plays like it's still an Early Access game. Very disappointing.I can't recommend this mess in any way, and hope other people aren't misled into getting this.			"

								Really enjoyed what I have played of this game so far. Its only in Alpha but you get the idea of where the game is going. I am hoping by the time it gets to Beta and even release that they have really added flesh to the bones. Think of this as Jagged Alliance with a Walking Dead theme! Keep it coming!			"

												There are dead people attacking you. There is a shelter you need to manage. There are dilemmas to handle. There  are rouge military and police. What is there not to like?Looting and building the shelter is fun. So is handling the whiny survivors. As my character evolves I pick different followers for the looting missions. I find horses, upgrade the car to use the trunk and so on. I really liked the atmosphere and the challenge.I am an optimizer. The game got a bit too easy too quick and there isn't (so far) a difficulty setting. Given I haven't finished the game yet (I am at day 35 - my impression is that it will go to 100) I cannot say if there will be more surprises yet. I have not visited every location, nor found every follower. But regardless I have had a lot of time and I want to congratulate the indie developers for adding this piece of well tasting candy to the bland world of mass produced computer games.Money well spent! Kudos.			"

								To start. I LIKE this game. I really want to love it. You can see the time ive put into it. Im a zombie fan, and an RPG fan, and this does both of those... well. Not great but well. I like what it does. However it has a serious crashing problem. even with the latest patches. I cant play more than an hour without a CTD. this issue has existed since it was in early access. unfortunately I dont believe the game is supported any longer. With more time and money i believe this could have been an outstanding game. But sadly at the end of the day. If you love zombies and rpgs, I believe this is the only one of its kind. And you should experience it. its good. otherwise perhaps not.			"

												This game should be much more fun than it is. All the pieces are there, but the fun seems just out of reach. Interface awkwardness is one of the biggest hindrances in the game. The story and the feel of the game are great and there is massive potential here, but the devs really need to make a few improvements to make the game more accessable and therefore more fun. I almost didn't want to recommend this, because that's like giving the devs permission to leave this game in what I have to say is an unfinished state, despite the fact that it's been 'released'. I want so much to immerse myself in the game, but frustrating bugs and poorly designed mechanics keep pulling me back out. In short, this game really lacks the refinement needed to call it 'released'. To be clear, I am NOT comparing this to modern AAA titles, in fact I play mostly indie games, but this game still needs some love to be not held back by design issues.You can expect a classic Fallout-esque RPG experience, with sadly few interface improvements over those older generations of games. The biggest dissapointment is that the crafting and base improvement mechanics seem so thus far to be completely on-rails and thus much less engaging or fun than they could be. This style of combat system has also come very far since those days, yet this game encorporates none of those advances.If this was a base 100 rating system and not yes/no, I'd probably give it 72/100.

												Before purchasing this game, you have to realise this is an INDIE title made by a small team with a small budget. It cuts some corners, it's not as polished as the bigger titles. Can you live with that? If yes, then it's a little gem of a game.It's a turn-based zombie apocalypse fallout-esque ""loot the world"" RPG. Like scavenging? Like old-school ""dumb slow"" zombies? Like exploring stuff and building up your home camp? This is it.At the moment of this writting, be aware that there are still quite a few bugs in the game, but most of them are minor or can be overlooked and the game is still enjoyable. However, the devs have been very visible and present and it's obvious they are working on those right now; expect many patches in the weeks to come.It's not a tactical combat game; the combat is not as integrated as some dedicated game like X-Com. Don't go in expecting a ton of tactical combat options, as almost everything is organic, and battle is closer to chess than an actual firefight. Movement and positioning are as important as the type of equipment you bring to the table, and personally I like it that way; there's no artificial game effects, everything is part of the way you handle your squad. Getting swarmed by zombies? Pull back and use a choke point. Getting mowed down by human enemies with guns? Move behind cover and force them to come into melee range, or pull them into the nearby pack of zombies, etc.The rest of the game contains a lot of dialogue and decision-making. Dealing with your ever-growing pack of survivors keeps you on edge, as you never know what kind of event is going to pop up each day, which keeps the world interesting. Exploring the map and finding a new zone full of goodies to bring back to your base camp is an awesome feeling, like finding a treasure room each time, and random encounters run the gamut from new allies to just a few random zombies to bandit ambushes.The maps were nicely crafted, and have this sense of ""events past"", you can almost read the story of what transpired at the location you are visiting, with the crashed cars and the blood streaks left by the zombies that must have dragged the screaming occupants out, etc.All in all, a nice game that will only get better as the devs fix the bugs. Its premise is also quite unique, and I'm giving this 100% of my support, as I want more games of this type to exist.			"

												This was not fun at all. Super linear fighting. The only variety is ""Am I going to get ♥♥♥♥♥ by unhittable zombies or ♥♥♥♥♥ by 5+ looters with guns?"" You can't even place all your people into combat effectively from the start since entering combat is most of the time not your choice which means at least one of your survivors is going to get hit right off the bat no matter what.I had a zombie completely surrounded by 5 survivors yet the hit % was less than 50.. Out of all those attacks only 2 connected. I tried to play this seriously and after 2 hours of frustration I would not play this again.			"

												Update 12/7/2014Now with the fix ill give it a postive review. Game may not be perfect but its fun and its easy to lose yourself into this world. Good buy for $30.First things first.I love this gameill say it again I love this game, its amazing ive played 36 hours and i dont think ive done 50% of it and already have different plans for another playthrough. So why dont I recomend it ? It has bugs and lots of them. Now i can handle a few minor bugs, and have encountered several of those, in adition to that there are a couple things that arnt well thought out like a major game event that if you hit too soon your basically need to restart a save from before ( before going to the hospital make sure you can handle a squad of military upon leaving ) but I even found away around that. 36 hours in my game is broken I can no longer create a party and to top it off my horse functionality is broken. this all happened after vic got into a fight with regina? I want to play this game right now but i cant do anything i dont have fast travel and i dont have a party, ive looted everything close by and i cant handle anything further by myself.the game is clearly in beta, it is fun when it works it really is alot of fun, but its broken.Please fix this game i want to give it a positive review.

												I picked this game up because it seemed like a decent zombie RPG, which very few seem to exist except for some crap subscription ones. I was pleasantly surprised to find Dead State to have very interesting and varied gameplay. If you like RPGs like fallout, you'll find hours of fun in this game. The graphics are far from amazing, but they're not horrible either for an Indie game. When you play this game do keep in mind this isn't some AAA title from Ubisoft, this is is a game built by people who truly love what they do. I found the price a bit steep, but I believe eventually with more content (multiplayer even?) this game has real potential to be the next Dayz. Overall I'd give this game an 8.5/10, it's far from perfect but pretty damn fun and unique.			"

Pros: interesting setting. base building. turn based. interesing allies.Cons: zombies too easy. Some human NPC's too easy, some too hard. Some bugs still in game but dev's are working on patches due to feed back. Allies in base static.			"

												You've probably played a lot of zombie games over the past few years, the market is flooded with them, but trust me when I say Dead State is worth your time. Taking the idea of old-school turn-based RPGs and giving them an undead twist, DoubleBear has created a game that insanly fun and just the right level of challenging. If you are in any way a fan of either zombies or surivial games, then DS is going to have something to keep you interested. Instead of being rewarded for mowing down hoards of zombies with impossible weapons, you gain your experience by improving your shelter, helping survivors, and picking up whatever small creature-comforts you can while you walk across a large and dangerous landscape looking for food, weapons, and any friendly faces you can come across.Dead State is by no means a perfect game, but it's one that I find myself coming back to quite a lot. Even now, bugs are being fixed, features are being added, and everything about the game is improving. I can not urge you enough to give this game a try, even if your taste in zombie games has gone a bit stale.			"

												Game is not worth buying at the moment.  Every aspect suffers from huge amounts of bugs, many bring game breaking bugs.  Particularily the endings (if you havent been hit by a bug which prevents your storyline progression) which kills the entire last 1/3 of the game...  Even bugs which themselves are not inherently game breaking can interact with other bugs or wonky mechanics in order to essentially turn into a game breaker.The one place the game has the potential to shine is the interaction between survivors, but even that is hampered by poor implementation and bugs.  All other aspects of the game are mediocre to begin with, but then made worse by shockingly bad implementation and glitches.Leave it for a few months, say 3-4 months from when this review is posted.  Should be enough time for them to have patched most of it, will probably be good at that point.  But if you dont really give a ♥♥♥♥ about buying and playing unfinished games you should get it now, fun enough.Also the company itself is dodgy in many ways (googling it will be better for you than me posting it here), if you are the kind of person that uses that as a qualifier for your purchases.

												I rarely bother to write reviews, even for games that I enjoy, so understand that for me to bother putting pen to paper (so to speak) means that I am blown away. Dead State is an incredible RPG; it's everything that I want and look for in a roleplaying game. This indie title blows contemporary AAA RPGs out of the water. The turn-based combat offers lots of options and tactics. The map roaming with spontaneous Point of Interest discovery harkens back to Fallout 1 & 2. The decibel system, which shows you how much noise you're making, encourages you to be creative instead of running in to every fight with guns blazing; the last thing you want is to attract more zombies. The stronghold improvements that you can make, and managing the morale of the people you lead, makes this game about more than just killing. Take a hike, Bioware. DoubleBear just showed you who's the RPG master.			"

								I have been following this game ever since its kick starter and im happy to say im very happy with the result. Even though its still early access and the release is december 2014 the ammount of content you get is great. As far as early access goes this has been one of the best.If you liked the oringal fallout 1 and 2 games then you will love this with the added management aspect of the game. For such a small team of developers they have done well in pushing this out with the ammount of content it has and they have actually listened to the community for feed back and improvements during early access, can not wait for the full release in a few weeks, defo worth the price.

								I have really enjoyed my time playing, it has it's own set of challanges, although the challanges are similiar to other games of the genre(food, surviving, managment) The real difference is it approaches the challanges differently, so far anyway from the time i have spent playing the game. Along with adding some new challanges such as the moral feature, finding an amenity such as toilet paper never seemed like a luxury until put into the context of the game setting. The turn-based  combat system is easy to pickup and overal works very well. Also the weapons themselfs i feel all have advantages and disadvantages which could really change your play style. You need to decide if you use a gun you risk alerting looters or zombies and with a heavy weapon such as a sledgehammer you get higher damage but as i have noticed you miss the enemy alot more(it was literally the death of my character when i missed)One of the things that has been touched on in other reviews is the expectations of the game. I personally expected a freeform game where i could just go out and do my own thing, although i do feel an aspect of that it also feels guided in a way. It is worth a buy in my opinion.			"

								I backed this on Kickstarter.  The idea of a turn based ZRPG with survival and base building and management elements really intrigued me!  Think UFO: Enemy Unknown with zombies!Please be aware - you are NOT buying a demo!  This EA release was a promise by Doublebear to it's backers that an early access demo\beta would be released.  I guess that it makes  business sense to put it up for preorder at the same time!   Please ignore the stupid ""devs cashing in"" comments on the Steam forums - IMO, they are most certainly not!  The project lead (Brian Mitsoda) has a long history in game development (my favourite being Vampire: Bloodlines).  My impression of these guys?  They're in it for the love of making the game, not to rip their customers off!  Please note - I'm definitely not a fanboy!There are some issues with this build.  Combat is grid based, and sometimes (more often that not, let's be honest), it's impossible to attack a mob on a diagonal.  Also, due to the early nature of the build, most of the base building features have been disabled.  There are also some enhancements that should be implemented (e.g. being able to put your party into ""overwatch"" mode, and and the ability to look through windows!).All that aside though, would I recommend this game?  Yes!   Even this early build shows a lot of promise.  But if you're the impatient sort, then I'd suggest waiting a while until the game's been cooked a bit longer.  You could probably derive a few hours play out of the current build, but it'll leave you wanting more!  However, if you're a fan of the obscure genre of turn based combat, then what are you waiting for?			"

												I was looking forward to this. So far I must say it is a good effort but beside that it should still be in early access, I don't think it is priced properly. I am all about helping indie devs but for $29.99 I would expect something better. This game is lacking in most areas. To name a few:1. I did not find a way to remap controls. WASD it is... I guess.2. Managing your base and the interface choices the devs made are just non intuitive, and cumbersome. You need to walk to certain rooms just to access a certain menu i.e. the job board. Why? How is this a good choice from the player's perspective? There are many great examples out there. Why not just copy one?3. The tactical part is weak compared to Jagged Alliance or other turn based games. Run to close distance, shoot, or smash, repeat... No hiding, no sneaking, no crouching, no aiming. Really weak...4. Player and NPC skills are overly simplified.5. Tactical maps are very small.The good:1. The only zombie turn based out there right now. At least I am not aware of another one.2. Graphics are not bad for an indie game.3. I like the way survival is managed. You need to keep scavenging, manage morale, etc. I find this original.Overall... I still can't recommend this at full price. I would say this is a good $15-20 game. Not $29.99! I am sure the bugs will get fixed, but there are major flaws in gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
								I admit to being a sucker for almost any game with zombies in it, and not all of them are great. But this title has a lot of originality and potential. The foremost I'd like to point out is the leveling system. The food and resources you bring into your shelter count as experience gained. So leveling is dependant on your ability to obtain what the shelter needs to survive instead of just grinding XP on zombies and looters which is very refreshing after years of playing rpg's. The characters you can interact with feel alive and well written. Which makes me excited for when we start to see more dialogue interaction added to the game.I preordered this game well over a year ago, and while this game has taken a long time to get to beta; In my own opinion it was well worth the wait. Not all of the shelter upgrades work yet, and I've only run into one bug that has caused trouble during gameplay which is when the camera gets stuck outside of the border of an area. The game seems to run remarkably stable, as I've had only one crash after 14 hours of play. My only real gripe isn't a bug, but a current feature in the game. If you don't return to the shelter before midnight, the survivors will supposedly give up on you and it's an instant game over. This doesn't feel very realistic, and should be changed.That said, this game is hardly feature complete. This is an early beta so if you buy, that's what you should expect. I have had a blast playing so far. I like the combat; I like the leveling system, and the writing is good in my own opinion. I expect a lot from this game in the future, and I'll keep on playing it as updates come out. "

								First of all I understand this is an early access so I wont talk about bug. Here are the point I found out:1. Zombie that you dont see shoulnt spend 3 minute moving while you wait.2. The game need a new GUI... This look like a proof of concept.3. NO REPLAYABILITY. I tried to restart 4 time, exact same zombie and looter at fixed position. No surprise.4. The term ""START DEMO"" is present in the game. QA someone ? if you dont want me to think im buying a demo dont show it.  "

Early Access Review
								Warning: At the moment of this review the game is still in beta, we are aware that several features may be missing/broken/incomplete and will not take this into consideration for the current review. It may be updated once a full release is made. Dead State ... Me... And then there is you, reading and asking yourself : Should I purchase this or not? Let me start with the facts: Dead State is a survival RPG where civilization has collapsed due to a pendemic turning people into zombies. There are still other humans out there but most of them are hostile. If you don't like zombies, survival and exploration then this game ain't for you. For those still with us and asking what's the game?, let's elaborate with the following key points : -The game is set in 3rd person and most if not all actions are issued with the mouse. So no random shooting, gun blazing, taking shots -NO- -But there is combat of course. Combat is turn based and relies on characters stats as well as probabilities (luck). -RPG elements are not classic : You won't get points for how many you slaughter but for the objectives you accomplish. Therefore you shall focus on survival objectives rather than bloodbath. -Combats are not meant for lenghty bloodbath and encounters for several reason 1. The noise meter limits greatly the use of firearm, to the point where it becomes a last resort kind of option 2. Injuries are common and healing will take valuable equipment and action points (AP) 3. You will rarely encounter a horde or group unless you bust the noise meter (hitting 200 will spawn zombie in the sector) 4. Combats are not exactly thrilling and are often not at your advantage. For all those reasons it is best to avoid combat. -The map is divided in sectors. To leave a sector you must access the entry points (usualy on the corners of the sector). Once you do that you can select the travel option and open the large map where you can travel to various areas, idly wonder randomly or go back to your shelter (a public high school ... ugh school of all the places in an apocalypse really?). -Speaking of the shelter it is a microsociety with a struggle for power, where everyone has needs and where you can eventually assign tasks to members. Shall they join you on the field or repair something or clean around etc... You will have to set a daily objective. This society has needs as mentionned, the first one being food. You will often find yourself packing every piece of food you will find on your trip. You also want luxury items to bring up morale. Finding building material is also a priority since there are many things to build and repair.  Other loots include weapons, ammos, protection, fuel, tools and medical gear. Quick mention to antibiotic : A member of the group who becomes plagued with zombie infection cannot be cured with antibiotic, he can be preserved as human. Therefore each contaminated member will consume 1 antibiotic a day. Since antibiotic are rare, you might have to end up asking some of them to leave. Ugh sad. -Last word about the shelter: You won't have much to decide about the building location or else. It is that building, end of the topic. -Save often is a precious advice. Loots can be somewhat random but opponents too. Running into a troop of bikers armed to the teeth will often lead to all of your characters death and if you main character (you) die, it's game over. It's time for What's the Game pro's and con's Pro's : -Rich variety of weapons and gears-Decisions have an impact-Real feeling of crisis and survival-Good ambiance-Open-world style game with good replayability-Interesting concept-Loots don't respawn, feeling realisticCon's : -Combat system can be frustrating and dull -Graphics could be re-worked (Feels like 2001 graphics) -Limited party size (4 members) -No real sneaking/crawling/stealth modeOur final verdict: Is it worth buying ? Wait for the full version unless you get it from a bundle (Humble bundle or else). For those of you willing to put the cash in, it's a good game that will cost you a movie ticket but offer you many many more hours of fun. Decent game but not a hit.  "

Early Access Review
								This game is very much still in early access. They released the game far too early in order to grab a slice of the Christmas sales.The game is playable in it's current state, but it still feels a lot like playing a beta. Lots of graphical glitches, lots of UI anomolies (even during character creation), maps that involve stairs are still very buggy.The game itself sees you as a survivor joining a survivors commune and attempting to...well...survive. You can upgrade various rooms in your base to provide medical facilities etc, but they haven't bothered to create a seperate graphic for the room before and after the facilities creation. So on day one the base looks exactly the same as it will once you've fully upgraded it.The game is limited in that there are a finite number of areas, and once you've fully looted an area there is no reason to go back to it. Zombies don't respawn and while there are some random encounters they are still very buggy, areas are reused and once you've visited one area type and looted it, any subsequent encounters that use that area type spawn fully looted so are pointless (you get no ""XP"" for kills).I've played through this game 4 times now, and have always hit a game breaking bug and stopped. Why do I recommend this game then? I'm still holding on to hope that they keep working on it and get it properly release ready, it has a lot of potential.			"

								It's a good game and a good idea, no doubt.  But, $25 for the beta release is a little steep.  The game seems to be missing about 60% of it's functionality.  I see the potential and it's exciting if the developers pull it off, but the beta release is just kind of weird and awkward. After about 2 game days, you've basically done everything you can.  There's no xp system and you have very limited options in places you can travel.I would say this game fully finished is worth about $20.  I don't mean that in a bad way, it's definitaly worth the purchase, but when you can buy Skyrim for $30 - this game can't live up to that pay scale.			"

								This game gets better and better with every update. It can be tough and stressful. Requires patience and strategizing. There are a few features that can be annoying but only really add to the strategy, such as the movement squares in confined spaces. Be prepared to have your allies in the right position or lose them. Quicksave will be your best friend. It would be nice if they added another few or even another 7 days to the early access, but it's good to play through here and there to see what's changed with the updates. Will take about 4-5 hours to beat in its current state (doing everything right) but it used to take a bit more as some areas have been consolidated and / or removed. There are now customizable characters and random encounters that can vary the game time depending on how you roll your character. You'll probably wanna play through again just to perfect your interactions with characters to reach that kind of game time.Some of what I've said will only be relevant for now, the next update could change a few more things, but the core of the game is damn solid and I can't wait until it's finished.

The game is a simple top down TBS with interchangable items and a possy that joins you on your missions, currently id say dont get this game enless you really really want to support its future progress because all tho im quite a fan imo its a bit to unrefined to play seriously.Bug level 6-10 (some pretty steep bugs like 2 main bugs in combat, stuck out of the zone three times in my 2 hours of play and a nice bug when i was spamming through the intro chat to try again after i got owned)Enjoyment 7-10 (smashing zombies always fun..

												Dead State seems to be an unfinished product. I really started out _wanting_ to like this game; feeling the need to play a good RTS game for quite some time and was left disappointed.The Interface is, on its surface, intuitive-looking but is in reality quite difficult to use. As an example, when your main character is fatigued, it is not recommended they be used for 12 hours due to a 25% penalty to dodge and accuracy. There is no way for you to use a different survivor to go on a mission for supplies, etc. The game's ""passing time"" (fast-forwarding time whilst in the shelter) doesn't seem to affect this. Combat is awkward, clumsy and frustrating. Reloading takes too many action points on the occasion where you're desperate enough to use a gun and as for melee combat: good luck. 80% of the time your character fails to connect with your victim leaving you swinging wildly at your attacker/victim and burning up precious action points which could have been spent healing yourself/party member if you're lucky enough to find bandages. On the opposite end of combat, your attacker/victim is almost guaranteed to hit you. You'll spend much of your time on a losing battle regardless of what weapon you're carrying. I do like the fact the melee weapons need to be at an adjacent square in order to attack but getting within range early on is difficult due to no armour, limited action points for attacking and not really having faith your attack effort will pay out at all. I once was in a combat situation where I was attacking 3 or 4 times a turn and ended up missing 100% of the time for *5 turns!* Needless to say I loaded from an earlier save and avoided the area all together.Party member's stand idly whilst attackers approach you without so much as mentioning you're about to be attacked.Random encounters are a literal roll of the dice. You might find yourself equally matched (yet still using the awkward combat system) or completely outnumbered/overpowered and may as well load from an earlier save. I've gotten into the habit of saving just prior to venturing out into the world due to the complete randomness of the encounters.The games manual touts not being able to gain experience by simply killing zombies or using any other skills directly. The way you actually level up your characters is by assigning them tasks on the job board or picking up enough of X item to meet the needs of the various types of goals. While this might seem like a good idea in theory (an interesting way to make the player level up and gain skill) it falls short due to the items being discovered are left to random change when your ""zone"" seed is generated. This makes gaining skill points feel like a long-dragging chore instead of a rewarding experience. Doubly so if you cannot guarantee your party members are going to be in fighting shape for their randomness that is the combat system.Overall DoubleBear has done a pretty good job but there are some things that indeed need tweaking. The combat system is fun when you're able to actually affect the outcome of the situation but for the time being it seems to be completely random and demoralizing. "

												Being honest, i didnt give it much time because of the steep learning curve, a shade under 4 hours. There's a good game in there but it's just not anywhere near the surface.  It's nothing like Fallout 1 or 2, XCOM or Suikoden, it drew inspriation from those titles and then went it's own way, which unfortunetly for Dead State was backwards instead of forwards. The concept is good, it just never pulled me in, the way i wanted it to.			"

												This game could be good or even great, but unfortunately it is overall only meh, and that at most.Small part of  what I have written here: steamcommunity.com/app/239840/discussions/0/35222218616416894/#p42 unfortunally I ran out of charters for this review.Read post for full review & summeryI will tell you why this game get these bad results if it could do so much better.Mostly but not only because it is so bug ridden. It is so buggy that the Iron Man mode seem impossible to me.I have plenty of examples:You leave the map ... crash. You open inventory ... crash. You are going into bed ... crash. Opening trunk? ... crash. Not every time, though. But as longer the game is running as higher the chances are. ... And unfortunately it seems as sooner you are in the game the more often it crashes. It crashed the first time I went to bed, and now I am playing on hours without end.And the bad thing is the game save it options to disk not when they are made or applied but when it is shut down ... means I had to set it up 3 times. (2nd time I should have know better but still didn't know that it crashes that often... so I set it up the 3rd time and shut down the game immediately)The walking sound is also bugged. If too many characters are walking or even less (party of 4 is enough) are running not all step sounds are played back. The playback is interrupted by the next causing something that sounds like  small bird shaking off water after a bath ... it happens so often (every 10 seconds or so) it annoys the **** out of me.Crafting is sometimes buggy ... having all requirements but still not be able to craft items.The very limiting sorting of the inventory sometimes breaks (indicated by having more than one category highlighted) leaving you unable to find stuff in later game. Only restarting the game fixes it.Sometimes some inventory parts using up the same slot or are at least displayed in the same, so that one of them isn't reachable. Mostly involving ammo. Moving stuff around, reloading (I think), or restarting (90% sure since I never had it in a fresh started) the game fixes it.Character animations in shelter are sometimes broken, making the NPC look like he is KO or dying (had even a blood puddle one time) only for it to stand up a few seconds later. In that time you can't talk to it. (Error: Not Reachable) Except if you manage to walk close in the right spot.Some text warns you that enemy can hide behind shelves and stuff.... but trees and buildings do the same ... even if not intended to. Means character (/party) can see it but I can't ... because trees are blocking view anyway ... and sometimes roves are not removed when they should ... so you can't look inside even if you avatar can.[irony]But at least sometimes ... as adjustment ... you can see inside buildings through walls.[/irony]Weapon stacking ... that is totally broken ... some weapon stack, some not at all. Some stack somehow but create new stacks without reasons ...Like the .38 Snubnose revolvers I had ... 1 stack with 2, 1 stack with 3, one stack with 10 ... at same time and all in same storage (shelter storage)Got the survival specialist guy after I was almost done with shelter upgrades. He told be that it was good but would recommend the mushroom farm. Which I had build relative early. ... also direct after building it the crap in the room was gone (beds) but came back sometimes later and till now clipping though the mushroom farm equipment.And from the last kind ... not really game breaking but annoying as heck bugs are a lot more. (edit: while writing this text passages were moved stuff around a lot, and don't remember which bug this was related to ... originally I started at game breaking ones and worked down to annoying).E.g. sometimes you can throw a grenade on a spot where an enemy stands ... but if you need it most you can't .. often if  several zombs occupy same square (which should be impossible anyway). Or only one zomb per square is affected from a grenade. More zombs per square also making aiming at them to matter of patience and constant clicking.Fighting is also buggy. When having enemies in fighting range even though you have attacked them already the game sometimes decides to end the fighting mode. End all effects (from fire grenades or buffs or so) letting become enemies aggro and giving them also 2 extra turns ... just to screw you and your tactics over.That and even more bugs ... there are so many that I start to forget some of them.And there are those questionable game play decisions. Some of them feel like remains of a whole more complex system which was scrapped last minute.There are a few of them that annoy me:
First of all why is this game in FU*KING imperial? Never learned proper units in school?Then there is e.g. the 200 pound limit of the trunk ... ok that much would make sense for horses ... but for a car? ... where is it from? Some east-European communist country ... build in the 80th ... and held together only by duckt-tape?Also some of those object weights making no sense at all... I bet the developer at some point said: ""Screw it, deadline is rushing in, we are rolling dice"".Map can't be viewed unless you are scavenger team.POI on map can't be marked for further planning.Map filled up already but planned to come back later to one point since it is still full of goodies ... but something more important is to be done before? ... Fat chance .. or more like no chance ... especially if you have to put the game away for some time ... you probably won't remember.No F*CKING sorting for the inventories. (aside from categories, which aren't even working fully, or even available [see trunk]) If the shelter storage fills up looking for something becomes a nightmare.Not sure if bad game play decision or a bug: Some medical equipment isn't showing up in the Medical tab.To name them: All drugs: as ...FlashbackSoothinumAdrenaline ShotStuporaxI might have forgotten someor Medical SatchelThe game does not often communicate clearly ... some decisions are pure guesswork.For dialogs you might argue that in RL you would also not have those hints I am asking for, but I say you would have others like facial expression and the way people talk ... e.g. you can say the same sentence but the way you say it can make your opponent know that it  meant serious, or as joke, or you annoyed as ****. And in RL you would have a lot more interaction and therefore know those ppl a whole lot better.Game also failed to tell me if I need to equip every NPC in my group or if I just can trash the stuff.Also after building the correlated rooms. Do I still the the parts? In meanwhile I also got my hands on spare parts of those ... Do they do something? (e.g. 5 dumbbells)Tasks... duration as well as requirements seem complete arbitrary .. you also can't look what a character could do without interrupting his work. Only way to make this save is at 8:00 AM.Warning that a bonus is not given is showing up when reassigning tasks at 8:00 AM ... when it shouldn't.I understand how the noise system works in this game, but calling it dB is driving me nuts.PLEASE DEVELOPER: If you have not clue at least take a short look into wikipedia. The dB unit has a logarithmic scale. Means 20 dB is not twice but ten times as loud as 10 dB, and 30 dB is hundred times as loud.Doubtful decision to make people run around the whole time ... probably to make it more ""lively"".IF YOU WANT FU*KING TALK TO ONE PERSON ... WHICH IS NOT EVEN POSSIBLE FROM THE GOALS SCREEN .... YOU HAVE TO RUN AROUND FOR HOURS TILL YOU FINALLY FIND THEM.If I could I would knife everyone and put them into the infirmary ... just because then I know where they are. "

												Updated 1/24/2015:TL;DR: Dead State remains quite combat focused, and while there is a lot of interaction to be had much of it may not be seen in a single play through the game. For a strategy RPG created on such a limited budget by a small team I consider it to be an entertaining experience that was well worth my time and money, and look forward to seeing what Doublebear does in the future.Dead State remains an entertaining experience, but although it is released it still has some balance issues. Late game there is practically no reason to use the apocalypse armor over the Advanced Tactical Vest, which is a required component of the apocalypse armor. Combat can be rather enjoyable, but for experienced players it may be too easy. That being said, I've seen numerous complaints on the forums that it was too difficult, so I suppose they've struck a reasonable balance. I'm looking forward to the release of Iron Man modes, and although the game has passed the 1.0 mark Doublebear continues to flesh out the experience and address issues in the game itself.If you're new to the strategy RPG genre and are looking for an experience that can be completed without a lot of combat this is probably not that title. Conversely, if you're adept at playing Strategy RPGs and want consistent end game challenges, this is also not that title. Doublebear has managed to create a fairly engaging game that revolves around both combat and crisis events and ally management. Unfortunately for the experienced player, they may never lose any ally and therefore won't have a problem getting so much morale that they never experience the darker aspects of the title. Meanwhile those who aren't able to manage the combat portion of the game may well lose so many allies that they have a hard time keeping allies.I enjoy Brian Mitsoda's writing style, and overall I found Dead State to be a very entertaining experience. That being saidDead State is shaping up to be a really enjoyable zombie survival RPG, and while it has tactical combat, the primary emphasis is going to be on the survivors and their personalities. Making sure that everyone has some semblance of normalcy in their otherwise upended lives and navigating the perils of the post-disaster world will eventually entail a lot of the experience. As the game stands, a lot of it is about the combat. It makes sense that they would want to expose the most replayable aspect of the game and get users opinions on it, and while it does strongly resemble the Age of Decadence on which the game has been built AoD has varied enough options for tactical combat that Dead State has a solid foundation on which to build in that regard.As of right now (6/29/2014), the first seven days is all that is open to players for exploration and testing, but in the not so distant future plans are to open up more content for eager fans who want more. While I have only played through the first seven days twice I am likely to wait on that update before I dive back into Dead State. While the combat and potential choices in the first seven days is appealing, I'm rather more interested in how the game unfolds with regards to various factions and additional allies. At the end of the day, the first seven days is a fun tactical experience released to acquire feedback on aspects of the game that are still able to be changed. The game will revolve largely around the shelter and keeping your survivors from killing one another or hating your leadership enough to fracture your group into factions that each pursue their own agendas.If everything unfolds in the direction it seems to be heading, you could potentially apply a variety of the shelter aspects to another type of disaster and the transition from zombie apocalypse to plague or famine or the destabilization of the magnetic poles and ensuing havoc EM radiation would have on unshielded electronics and minus the scavanging expeditions where you had to bludgeon people to death with a baseball bat things could feasibly progress in a similar fashion.

								I have survived day 1, got the supplier for the fence. This is now the priority. Day one is complete and all survived. Man, and I have to mention one aspect in particular … the sound of a baseball bat on a dead skull sounds just awesome.The graphics most certainly need some work. I have encountered no bugs of any kind and the turn based system seem to work just fine. The attack animations I find a bit lacking and it might become a bit annoying if it’s always (with the sounds) the exact same. But bear in mind that it’s still early access and who knows what might change. All in all the game mechanics works well.I honestly love this game and cannot wait for the finishing touches and the complete game. Hurry, hurry.Do I recommend this game? I must admit that I was reluctant to purchase an early access game but I really believe that the finished product will be well worth purchasing. So from me it’s a definite yes.Happy skull cracking guys.			"

												I am not giving this game a Thumbs Down because it is a bad game.  I do so because it is not finished, and because I hope that it will be a better game six months from now.I got my money's worth out of this game.  68 hours for a $30 game is worthwhile to me.  I am simply frustrated because I believe I would have enjoyed the game much more if I had played it after more bugs had been worked out, references to commented-out content had been removed or restored, and the pacing and event timers were changed.This game felt much more like an Early Access title than a final build when I played it.  If, a few months from now, you see new reviews indicating that this game feels like a complete product, then I encourage you to check it out.  In its current state, this is not the best game that Dead State can be.			"

								Awesome game so far. As of this review, the game has been released only the day before, and is only the demo of the first 7 days. The premise is fairly simple: basically, hoarde loot from missions on an overview map while also assigning jobs and tasks to npcs in your bases, which includes being able to take them on missions with you. Pretty good concept, and definitely fills a niche and itches a scratch of building a defense against zombies and hoarding loot [food, weapons, ammo, etc.]Approximately a 7.5/10 at the moment, I'd live to give it an 8 or 9 but it could use more polish and so far its in early access beta with a limit on game time. At present, it is really good, but I definitely look forward to the finished product.			"

Early Access Review
								Very enjoyable, considering the game is currently in early access, looking forward to the full release!  I finished this 7-day version of the game in about 7 hours, but I haven't explored a couple of locations yet, so I guess it could take somewhere around 10 hours to complete this if you do everything. People claiming to have finished it in 40 minutes are either lying, or just rested or rushed through content every day without exploring anything. A single combat can last for 10 minutes or more.The game is not finished yet, being early access, and it does have some bugs. I had about 5-6 crashes, and got stuck in combat once. It also lacks a lot of functions, that will be implemented later, like character creation.The game puts you in a situation, where you, after surviving a plane-crash, becomes the leader of a small group of people, trying to survive during a zombie-apocalypse. You have a homebase that can be upgraded (but a lot of this is not available yet, I could only fix the fence and the well in this version of the game), and in order to get building materials, food, weapons, and other stuff essential for survival, you have to explore locations like a shopping mall, a church, a camping site and other places in your surroundings.There's a lot of tension when exploring, death can be waiting around every corner, in the form of zombies, or armed and hostile looters. A careful approach is required, sneaking up on zombies, taking them out one by one, or avoiding them. It's also important to be quiet, guns are very effective, but the sound will attract more undead.There are interesting things to discover (when exploring), and the world doesn't feel copy-pasted. Maybe you encounter a man who has barricaded himself inside his house, writing warnings ""trespassers will get shot"" on the wall, or maybe in a bathroom, you find a woman who's commided siucide. Little things perhaps, but it makes exploration much more rewarding.  Combat is turnbased and works well, it's challenging, and your decisions is usually what determines how well you perform, not blind luck. Most weapons have different types of attacks, and can cause status effects like bleeding or dizzyness. If someone dies they stay dead (or gets up as a zombie if bitten), this is not the kind of game where everyone gets up after every battle and regenerates their health instantly.In your homebase, you can assign different jobs for the other people in your group (like repairing something, or making molotov coctails).You can also have dialogues with them, and depending on how you treat them (will you be kind, threatening, or sarcastic for example) you will build different relationships with them, that will have consequences later on, according to the developers. How well this will work is impossible to tell from the EA-version though. Writing is good for the most part, except a few awkward lines here and there.There isn't much handholding in this game, I personally like this, but some people will no doubt get frustrated, you do however get some directions, about where to go and what to do, when you talk to the other survivors.   I also strongly recommend everyone to read the manual before playing (there is a link to it on the Steam-forums),this way, a lot of frustration will be avoided. It's often difficult to figure out how to do stuff (like trading items between characters, or leaving a location) due to lack of tooltips, and a UI where some information can be difficult to spot, like when the travel button lights up.The visuals are good enough for me, but, of course, can't compete with AAA-titles. Animations and character models are not very good, but environments looks better. Music is great however, and enhances the mood of the game. I really liked this early version of the game, it does have the potential to become a great survival-rpg, if the full release lives up to this remains to be seen, but so far so good. Recommended to people who likes challenging old-school rpgs, where a careful and tactical approach is required, not recommended to people who require non-stop action, AAA-graphics, and quest-arrows.

								In the current version (10/14/14) this game is ok. A few problems I've noticed is that apparently you can miss a 9mm pistol shot at a person right next to you. I can know nothing about guns and still be able to hit somebody that close. Another thing is wiffing at people right next to me with my axe. How do they even have time to dodge that, let alone me needing skill to miss that close. More multipliers should be added depending on distance.			"

So this IS B+B to me.For ALL its positives. I have to drag up a thorn in my side...I recently replayed and ran through and where MOST encounters are exactly as you expect.Considering the crap hit the fan and the dead walk..I found myself avoiding... High pop areas.NOT because i was worried.  More because i wasnt sure i could complete (noisymourge) in a (REALTIME) day.because of tyhe volume of zombies On the actual map location.The game. (Sadly) Spends sometimes an eternity scrolling through the total zombies in the area.I wont go into the fact that my party turns sometimes fall out of sequence and i have to shuffle them to get in an order i can A.Defend. Or B.Attack.An example....... I strayed close to a fence to search a dumpster. 1 Zombie was closer than i thought and being  location attracted. It proceeded to make its way around the map. To me. (Round a fence through a door across a carpark)I Understand the game needs to check zombie locations. And activate the ones IN the encounter..But i got so bored of watching zombie faces scroll past whilst waiting for my turn tonight..I actually Quit.I Truly love this game.. But there must be a way to speed that up.That IS THE ONLY REASON I wont advise anyone to buy it. "

								This game impresses me more and more each time I play it, with the amount of content and play through that is avaiable. With the final release set for next month if you are thinking about buying it I would definitely get it come release.This game sat on my wishlist for 3 months before I brought it because I was unsure about spending $30 on an early access game. When I finally brought it I did not regret it in the slightest and think it is well worth the $30.There are so many aspects to the game, you have your main character with abilites and stats management and then the array of weapons you can use and the different attacks available for each weapon. then you can have specaility items, armour and your inventory management. This also crosses over into your party, managaing 3 more characters weapons, armour and inventory.Travelling round the map you have a wide range of locations to visit, with different layouts and a wide variety of loot to find. Intially i was not sure if i would like the turn based combat but quickly found this to not be an issue. You not only have to fight zombies, but wild dogs, and enemy npcs each brining there own separate style of combat. You also have travel options on the map running, horse riding and driving a car.Base management is a whole differnt aspect in itself, building upgrades, assigning jobs, managinging moods keep you occupied while you are not out smashing heads!This game combines all my favourite aspects of zombie/survival games and has so far provided me with hours of entertainment and I look forward to a whole lot more.

								Even though it still has lots of road to cover and gas to burn, this game still is helluva fun. I wish it would become more challenging though. As of now, any zombie-encounter can be solo'ed by a melee character with no problems.After a couple of gameplay hours I didn't (at all) pay attention to the fact that I was supposed to be subtle and hide from everything. Seriously, it felt like I was playing Fallout after finding that bozar and CAmk2 in the toxic cave where Smiley is. The only problem I've encountered were scavengers, and after a few more hours, I got my hands on some heavy defence items, which negated the damage ENTIRELY (i.e. You've received 0 dmg, 60 absorbed by armour.

												I am in abosulte love with this game. It really makes the apocolpse feel just like that- the end of the world. Combat is simple but brutal. Social issues and individual character personalities exist. With so many other factors. Probally my favorite part so far is that there ""is"" right and wrong and there isnt. I watched a camp of looters (Adverage people who just steal and run of zombies) Get torn to peices by a huge mob of undead. The looters had guns and knives and only killed 2 zombies before running away or dying. The need/want to get new surivors, new wepons, food, antibiotics, parts and everyting makes each day feel like a challenge. Im always cringing when i go to sleep and end the day for fear of whats going to happen when i wake up the next morning.

												Short Version: 3/5.  Turn based version of ""State of Decay"".Long version: This game is good, but not great.  If you haven't played State of Decay, get that instead. If you've played SOD into the floor  (I've played 1000+ hours on it) and want something in the same wheel house, then the turned based combat aspect of this game can be a nice change of pace.  The combat system feels more like old-school AD&D games, like think back to 90's RPG games where you take a group of adventurers out - that's not bad, it's just kind of dated - and where SOD makes you feel on the edge of your seat at high levels, this just kind of annoys you if you start losing (which won't be often if you take out a healer and make your character a melee warrior). Still, I enjoyed it and considering the amount of truely terrible zombie games there are out there, this stands above a lot of the trash on Steam.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I've actually had in since it was in Alpha and just a one week demo. It's gotten considerably more content from then, but not much real polish. I like the idea of this game, but the execution of the design is rather clunky. First off, as people mentioned before, the interface leaves much to be desired. It's quite easy in the heat of combat to try to click on the HUD and accidentally move that character too far away to do anything useful in a single click. You are able to walk over dead bodies, but you're going to have a real hard time finding a spot that doesn't highlight the body to loot rather than the space below it to move on. Rotating the camera is necessary a lot of the time, especially when searching for hot spots where you can loot items, but a lot of the time it's in vain actually because there are usually very few places you can loot things from, although you do need to scour the whole map to find them. The turn-based/real time aspect is kind of weird in cases like where you're trying to break down a locked door. It goes into turn based for a second, makes noise, and the zombies in the area come to your location rather quickly. Like I appreciate trying to jump into combat faster but zombies aren't THAT quick. Another aspect that leaves much to be desired is the real time movement before combat. You can have up to 4 members of your team and they don't run that close together, they run sort of in a staggered formation that when you go into combat mode there's 1 person in the front that can attack and the rest are usually too far to do anything the first turn.

												I like this game.I always like a game where you build your character (RPG), build your community and survival is your driving force.Combat is turn based tactical.Community building is GUI only (via the white board in the cafeteria of the school)There's a lot of depth and many ways to skin the cat.The choices do matter (though you don't necessarily know what choices impact what)Things I didn't like:Not a lot of replay value. Unless you're an obsessive perfectionist, once or twice and you pretty much exhaust all of the choices.Many of the choices are benign in nature, which make it difficult to tell which ones are important enough to impact the story.

												In theory this is a great idea. In execution, not so much.There are some good things to it. The concept reminds me of The Walking Dead the show on the tele. Maintaing your shelter and going out looking for supplies. Party exploration, and multiple ways to travel whether it be walking, car, or horseback.The gameplay falls flat, the movement point combat does not work here. Maybe I am being cynical becasue there are so many games that ues the MP gameplay I am burnt out of it. When not in combat and exploring it plays like a RTS. Which ok, that part isn't bad.There is no voice acting from what I saw, but there are grunts, cries of pain, and zed screeches. I think the creators just used their voices because it doesn't even sound good. The music as well is ok, I don't know why they feel it is necessary to add the sound track for sale but that is a whatever.That, and I feel the RNG is rigged against you more than XCOM is if you believe that.All in all I can't ask for a refund, so my two cents are as follow:I didn't like it, but that doesn't mean you won't. I say try on a sale, I bought it for low so I don't feel cheated out. I hope there is another one, but this time with more polish and a different gameplay style.			"

												Enjoyed this game. If you like Squad-focused turn-based combat in your games (like Xcom or more similarly Silent Storm) this will fit the bill. It also does a pretty fine job of delivering on what so many zombie games fail to -- a convincing simulation of what running a post-zombie apocalypse might be like. Crisis events, managing jobs/morale/resources and really getting to know your survivors, their skills, and how best to use the people you come across. The cons? I wish inventory management was more streamlined -- opaque at first it is easy enough to pick up, but there is still an issue of needing to move hundreds of pounds of stuff around -- (I appreciate how much a person can carry is an important element of a game where deciding what to loot and what to leave behind is key, but after you get a CAR the idea of repeat trips for piles of items just seemed silly.) -- There were a couple of bugs, but nothing I couldn't navigate by using the forums. Solid title that is a bid of a tarnished gem -- while it's a GREAT game, it falls in a couple of ways just short of being an AWESOME game. Still, for an Indie game it cannot be denied the game deserves MASSIVE praise. I especially liked how truly diversity and differences were made a part of this game regarding how survivors interacted -- Not just the obvious questions of sanity or racism in an apocalypse scenario -- but ideas of Sexuality, Mental and physical disabilities, religion, criminal tendencies, classism, language barriers -- by the end of the game I felt like practically any quirk I could think of was somehow represented, which was also a nice touch. Glad I played,			"

												Anyone who read my previous review of this will notice that I have changed my opinion. This is simply because the last post full release patch has fixed many issues and the developers continue to improve this product (the next big patch is due mid-late January). In my opinion it should have stayed Early Access until this latest patch.This is a deep game that rewards patience in the early stages. You start out with just a handful of allies and very few options but as you venture further from your base, discover more locations, and find more survivors (who come with their own individual traits and problems) then things begin to get interesting. You can develop your base far more quickly and new options for addittional facilities start to appear as new survivors bring their unique skills to the table. Plot events progress in a similar manner with most being specifically linked to certain characters and your enjoyment of Dead State will snowball as you gain momentum.Dead State is not an easy game to quantify in terms of genre; being a combination of man-management and resource allocation, Sims-like character appeasement, building development, open world exploration, and story-driven role play elements. But the CORE of the game is none of these things but rather an XCOM-like, turn based, tactical combat. And this last, despite being highly enjoyable when taken in context with everything else, still has a few rough edges. Regardless of its flaws (which are becoming increasingly less significant as the developers continue to listen to the community and improve the game) Dead State has finally flowered into something unique and satisfying IF you can push through its slow start. With the promise of further improvement in both game mechanics and extra content it has been turned from something best waited on to something you shouldn't really be without.Previous score 67%, current score 82%, expected to finish in the high 90's.

Early Access Review
								Game delivers exactly what it promised: Team-based, 3/4 tactical zombie survival / base management in open world environment. There's a lot to sink your teeth into with this one. Basically you lead this bunch of survivors and every morning you get a quick briefing of things / place to explore before setting them to work and you and your scavenging party set out to find some resources to survive another day.Throughout your travels you'll come across other survivors, some good, some not so much. But its you against the zeds so every live body helps. There's lots to explore and different modes of travel, and the shelter will requires lots of upgrades to turn it into a haven amongst all the chaos around you. There are items you need to collect to improve survivor's morale throughout your travels, in turn they will give you advice and mark locations on your map for you to explore. The overland map presents lots of random encounters during your travels, some good, some bad.The shelter is what it's all about. You are constantly struggling with the other survivors to turn this little elementary school into a bonafide ZA haven. And it has all the ability to do it, with 2 floors and multiple rooms you will have everything you and your survivors will need to survive the nights of Splendid if you plan accordingly.Combat starts off appearing simple but as you get more followers and more weapons you can then start to have very tactical battles, with different status effects and AOE biological weapons to help keep the battle in your favor, making impossible-looking battles into 3-round wipe ups if you're careful. Both ranged and melee are viable (I stick to melee, this is a ZA)The maps run from classic overrun parks and hospitals, to dark scenes of lost hope, to some really...unique scenarios that I wouldnt have expected. Games like these are what makes all the risk of joining an EA worthwhile. Would highly recommend.			"

												This game has real potential. I really enjoy many parts of it but the bugs and crashes are extremely frusturating. The devs need to address these issues quickly and compensate players for spending $33 on what is an unfinshed game when they marketed it as finished. I see great potential but that is up to the devs if they put in some time and effort to fix a broken game. I would recommend this game with a strong caution, good game, good concept, good potential, but needs work fast to fix the bugs and needs to be expanded through free updates for a while before the devs even think about charging for DLC, as quite frankly I feel rather ripped off at the moment.

												When they said it was inspired by classics like Fallout and X-Com, I think they were talking about the difficulty. Dead State is a thoroughly enjoyable game of mashing the quicksave button as every door you open seems to either have a beefbus zombie behind it with ten-thousand action points and that never misses or a looter with Navy SEAL marksmanship. Meanwhile, your team consists of the people who put their pants on one leg at a time and couldn't hit the broadside of a barn even if they were leaning against it. Considering combat is 80% of the game, you would think someone would've put more time into balancing it out.			"

												This is a great turn based strategy game set during a zombie apocalypse. It plays very much like fallout 1 / 2 with an added twist of also developing a base filled with NPC characters. While the zombie plague leaves your members forced to scramble for supplies you will encounter human adversaries who are often much more dangerous foes.The game also uses an interesting sound mechanic where to much noise can attract attention of zombies or looters. Break down a door with a sledge hammer and you can bring down a wailing horde of zombies... or a looter double barrel.The game has been polished up nicely since early access. You may still get a bug here and there or a crash... but my experience has been very good.I am happy to say I kickstarted this project and the game came out great. If you are a fan of old school turned based games and into CRPG this game is great. A refreshing setting for an RPG while also having great strategy and downtime while in your base. Easy 9/10 from me.			"

												is the game 100% Flawless? Nope the Fog of War system and turn based combat make this old school and you can have frustrations at said game.the two things i would add to ANY new player is the following1) Push Z in game to see all loot nodes2) Right click on other characters when out in the field with your main character selected you can use thouse icons to your advantage such as the backpack icon = infortory grats you can now mangament your characters items around pretty easy.Its differculty is based more on YOUR gameplay style if your someone who quick saves evey single combat turn and then reloads if it gos somewhat dicy? your going to then screem ' Da Game is Ez! ' If you understand how combat works and know the old school system of combat (Take fallout 1 for example) you will have a easyer time at said gameIs the game perfect? NoBut ask yourself thisDragon Age Inquisition is that game perfect? Nope it has people complaining about crashes and bugs and other things,  I have only seen one person on Dead State complain about a crash,  ONE ive seen in the past weekend alone about 24 people complain about a crash (Including myself)Yet that game gets 9/10,  Over-rated if you ask me.but if you think Dragon Age Inquisition is a good game and dont mind Turn based combat / old school style of gameplay with fog of war and such? you will like Dead State.I mean serioiusly my name is THAC0 if you know what that means your a old school gamer then and you will probly like this game as it reminds you of the older games (Like fallout 1 Style before the FPS versions came out and such)i say a 6 or a 7 out of 10,  Annoying to play at times due to fog of war and the RNG and what knock but can allso be fun as heck at times over-allFor anyone reading this I understand that you will probly argue that nothing is wrong with Dragon Age inquisition (Which is false) And think its perfect,  Which is a immature thought to have nothing is perfect common fact.  The point in this arguement is to point these things out that people are STRONGLY ruled by biased option if someone says its dumb it must be dumb,  Type of mentality,  Be nice if people where mature a bit more.

												ead state as the core of its mechanics set up: pgrading teh schoo, scavenging zombies the nterpolitics and elationship mechanics of the shelter are in place too.  The reason i cant recommend the game is because ead state feels unfinished, and seems to follow the same path as alot of other unfinished and rushed games lately.  I can forgive a crash here or there , but many of the story elements of the game are broken.  For example alot of characters will ask you to do certain tasks, when you do so though they wont acknowledge that theyve been completed.  At times this caused a drop in relationships for some characters such as Vic or Paul.  *SPOILER ALERT*    What broke the camels back for me was that  There is a character that you can rescue who has the possibility to produce a cure, now in a open world zombie game where alot of stories can be done or ignored, producing a cure is the closest thing as you can get to an end game for the most part and having such a major story aspect of the game broken when it is supposedly finished is unacceptable  *SPOILER ALERT END* .  Overall teh game functions solidly , barring the bugs, but it feels like a betrayal of trust when the developers tout the game as complete when it is only partially so.  Edit 1: Flag was removed but the rest of the review still standsEdit 2: I just want to add in that , most major story scripts are bugged.  An event will happen that should , say make an area destroyed, but if you go to this area everything and everyone there is the same.  This effectively destroys the end game, I spent about 30 in-game days just skipping doing anything waiting for story elemnts to occur on and off.  STAY AWAY from this game till the price drops, or the Devs own up and properly take care of things that should have been done when it was declared ""FINISHED"".			"

												When i first started playing this game I was caught hook line and sinker. I love the 3 genre it combines (zombie survival, classic rpg and non-linear) and thought that this was going to be one of my favorite games. However as you progress through the game you quickly realize how many flaws there are not only in coding, but also game mechanics. As for positives about the game...really nothing. The only reason why I was able to tolerate it for 20 hours is like I said, I am a sucker for the genre but as for the game in and of itself there is nothing that it brings to the table that can't be fulfilled from dozens of other games without all the bugs and hassle. Cons-Player Character has 1 line of backstory...don't get me wrong, I love customization, but backstory for the main character is vital in an RPG. The only succesfull rpg series I can think of with limited backstory is the elder scrolls series, but those games use the prologue to shape the character's development. This game on the other hand has one of the most limited and useless prologues I have ever played.The most repetitive turn based combat I have ever seen. All of the zombies are the same, the human npc have terrible AI with nothing intruiging about their movements, and the biggest baddest npcs in the game are a joke since they have such high armor class, if the player goes into a fight in the same armor its practically just flailing at each other for a few turns doing nothing strategic...sort of like a failed rpg hack and slash comboThe game uses a failed view system called ""fog of war"" which basically means that if you aren't in line of sight of an enemy then you can't see them and they can't see you, but it does not work for this game. In a turn based rpg if you can't find an NPC that you accidently aggroed you might be running around tiles with limited action points just wasting away your life.Horrible shelter morale system- some of the NPC express themselves almost like they are in an emotional polarity shift, they can do stupid things (don't want to give spoiler) even with a large morale rating and everyone being above average moodDroll upgrades- The shelter upgrades barely change the looks of the base at all, aside from this small garden plot on the veranda and a car showing up to put fuel in, everything looks the same from start to finish- some visual recognition of progress would be niceThere is loads more to list like technical glitches, location issues etc but that pretty much sums it up.Rating 3/10Like a lot of other reviewers I would say to wait until it's at least 66% off, since the 30$ price tage is not so steep			"

												Dead State has gone a bit under the radar of most people, and that is a shame, because even though I got wind of it too late to Kickstarter-back it, I bought it the moment it was fully released and I haven't regretted it for one minute, except for the fact that it's eating up virtually all of my free time.Simply put, Dead State is an amazing game. Granted, it's not bug-free (though no real game-breaking bugs so far) and the interface can be a chore (as well as an enigma at times), but once you're used to its quirks, Dead State becomes an incredibly addictive and involving experience.Yes, we're all tired of zombie games, but I will gladly make an exception for Dead State, and I promise, so will you. If I describe it as an interesting cross between Fallout, State of Decay and X-Com: Enemy Unknown, then it should probably be enough to make the hairs of any serious gamer stand on end. And rightly so, because the game pulls off all its aspects perfectly. And it even has a well implemented 'timer' mechanism: you're pressed for time since morale decays and food supplies dwindle daily, but on the other hand, you don't feel like you're being rushed all the time. There's no clock counting down, no constant reminders. You set your own pace, and as long as you don't waste your days doing nothing, you should usually be fine. I scavenged every day, trying to take on at least two locations per run, which is as far as you can stretch your daytime (and your characters' backpacks!), but I am currently sitting on a comfortable stockpile, so there's no need to micromanage and fuss over every single hour of every single day. But you know damn well that you can't sit still either.During your travels, you'll meet other survivors. Some you'll just stumble across, others will even knock on your door of their own accord. While you can turn them away, it's ill-advised to do so. Sure, every survivor you take in means another mouth to feed, but they pay off their food consumption by working for you. You can give them jobs yourself, like putting them in the scavenger party, making them construct shelter upgrades, guard the fence, and all other kinds of work. And as the days go on, the needs of your shelter grow as well, making it critical to recruit every survivor you can find. Every survivor has his or her own backstory, dialogue, demands and specializations, making for a diverse and lifelike feel of the shelter, where you have to assign jobs based on their capabilities.The shelter itself can be upgraded, X-COM: EU style, to provide benefits and make new things possible. You can construct facilities like a workshop, a garage, a rooftop garden and even a chicken coop and a recreation room. All of these upgrades, however, take time and parts, and you'll find yourself strapped for the latter very often, so don't think you'll be able to just build everything from the get-go, it requires careful decision making, especially since unexpected events will also require manpower and parts, so you need to keep some in reserve. This makes for a paced game experience, where you'll constantly have things to strive for, instead of falling into the ""build-everything-then-be-stuck-with-idle-workers-and-no-real-goal""-trap many similar games have perished in.The scavenging party, which is always led by your characters, consists of up to four people, and their exploits will be the bulk of the game experience. You lead your team out there, in the lands around the shelter, and collect everything you can, ranging from food over luxury items, to weapons and shelter upgrade parts. Every scavenging run is a shot in the dark, since you'll never know what, or who, you'll come across, and while the zombies are dangerous enough in their own right, human enemies are so much more so. Sometimes you'll have no choice but to pass by a location because you know you're simply not strong enough (yet) to take its residents on. Which of course makes it all the more satisfying when you then come back to give them a good walloping.If you do decide to do battle, you'll do it in classic isometric turn-based style. This gives you more tactical possibilities than you'd expect, since every weapon has its own range, requirements, and statistics. The battle system is most reminiscent of the 'real' Fallout Games (the Interplay ones), except, sadly, no groin shots. In battle, the first and most important decision to make is whether or not to break out the guns. They're powerful, but come with one massive drawback, and I don't mean ammo consumption (although that certainly counts too). Because guns, as you probably know, are loud. And loud things, as you probably know, bring all sorts of nasty things. But whether or not you'll resort to the powder burners, combat means tactical decision making, and some faith in the random number god. Which is exactly how a turn-based RPG battle should go.There are a few minor flaws. It's not an entirely bug-free experience, but most bugs range from aesthetical (sometimes characters moonwalk), to only mildly frustrating (enemies clipping into each other, characters not following the leader correctly). Some are even kinda beneficial (being able to access the car trunk if you haven't brought the car, for instance). I have not encountered any game-breaking or truly frustrating bug yet. The interface can be a bit irritating at first, but once you get the hang of its quirks and unwieldy design, this becomes nothing but a minor inconvenience.All in all, Dead State offers an interesting, involving, and even downright addictive role-playing experience with base-building elements. Like the Civ games make you go ""just... one... more... turn!"", Dead State will make you go ""just... one... more... day!"". This game, like Divinity: Original Sin and Shadowrun Returns, is proof that Kickstarter can, and does, produce absolute jewels, and in turn, proof that game makers make the best games when they make what they want to make.Final verdict: if you like Role-Playing Games, Turn-Based Strategy and/or base building, you owe it to yourself to get this game. It's easily one of the best games of the year. Buy it, even if it's not on sale.			"

												This is my second review for Dead State.  My first review was written almost immediately after release and was highly negative.I started playing the day of release, but it still had quite a few issues back then. I'm on my ""third"" character, but have yet to actually finish the game. I started anew after the recent patch as pretty much all of the ragequit worthy bugs that I had encountered worked themselves out.That being said, I have played many indie titles on steam. This IS A GOOD BUY. My initial opinion was the opposite, but I can't stand by that anymore. The Devs and Mods are a very close knit group and the communication between them as well as the community is amazing. I would not be surprised one bit if they continue adding content over time, which seems pretty common with indie crews that create a game out of PASSION like they did, and not out of a pricepoint.Lot's of peoples main question regarding a SP only game is the replay value and length of the game, I will give you my thoughts on that first.REPLAYAs it stands right now the game is definitely fun for at least one playthrough, and it is a LONG playthrough. There are lots of places to explore and cool things to see, as well as special weapons to hunt down, achievements, special enemies and special recruitable characters as well.  Now I have not reached the end-game.  I have one character around day 55ish right now, another around 45, and my first character is somewhere between 60-70, I believe.  As far as I can tell neither of them are super close to the end of the game.  A lot of it has to do with your playstyle, as well.  I made it a point to maneuver the entire world map on my last character and have found ALL SORTS of stuff I had no idea about, which will elongate my game.  Think Fallout2,  tt could be a 20 hour game, or a 100+ hour game.  While this is not as in depth as Fallout 2, the same principle stands.  IMO, at 30 bucks, even if this game was 30 hours it would be worth it.  A dollar an hour of entertainment?  Ok, deal.This current character is my third to reach roughly day 50 so far.  Even having replayed those fifty days three times now, it was not a complete grind like I thought it would be.  The key to keeping this game interesting for me was varying my character builds.  First character was firearms.  Second, melee.  My current character is a bow character (STR and PER), and is INSANELY fun to play.  Granted, there are those ""Oh, great, I have to do THIS part again"" feelings, but the majority of those were routed in some bugs from older versions AS WELL as my not fully understanding the game mechanics on previous plays.COMBATCombat is... Well, it is honestly not the best.  It doesn't necessarily detract from your first playthrough, but there are no cover mechanics (xcom) and once you get some decent gear the zombie fights are as tense and nerve wracking as beating up sleeping ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ toddlers with a cricket bat.  But, the devs state several times that zeds are supposed to be easy, and it is the human NPC's that are trouble.AI Much like the original Fallout and Fallout 2, enemies are NOT scaled to your level.  This means if you wander into the wrong spot too early, you are going to have a REAL bad time.  I always enjoyed games that did this, so while I think it's a great perk, some may think it's poor design.Currently, enemies are static unless agro'd by a noise or by seeing you, though I think I saw a dev or mod say they were working on a patrolling AI?  Once again, does not impact your first playthrough much/at all.WEAPONS/ARMORThere is a decent selection of armor available in the game, which all have their pro's and con's and will make the critical gamer think hard.  ""Do I want to sacrifice an AP for more defense, or would I rather give myself an extra chance to hit?""  Helmets with visors and masks will affect that characters visual range, which I thought was a very nice touch.  Higher grade armors CAN be hard to find, there may come a point when you think the entire selection is leather jackets and tactical vests.  Not true!The weapons are equally varied, and also have the added spice of unique named weapons.  These are the money makers.  Increased crits, THC, damage, custom look and names, and they usually come with a little backstory.  VERY fun once you get some of them!You also have the ability to create minor upgrades for some of your firearms and armor through the use of a player built workshop.STORYLINESome of it is event driven, some of it is time driven.  It moves along at a fair pace, not so fast that you don't have time to explore the map, and not so slow that you get bored (generally, there are a couple times where I thought my game was bugged because nothing was advancing, then the next day... it did.)You also learn more about the survivors you recruit.  Nearly every one will come to at some point asking you to perform X task for Y reason.  Some are time sensitive, others are not.  They usually ALL give you a little glimpse into their backstory, however.This game puts almost more stress on the aspect of MANAGING a post apocalyptic shelter than it does fighting zombies.  You will get crisis events and your ""sub-leaders"" (key NPC's in your shelter) will voice their opinions.  I have yet to see one where an answer you give will make EVERYONE happy.  Some of them require you to put a little thought in and weigh risk vs reward, i.e should I spend these supplies to prevent something that MIGHT NOT happen, just to be safe?  Or should they be put to use on a more immediate issue elsewhere?Additionally, certain NPC's react differently to different conversations.  If you have a raging hard ♥♥♥ with a meanstreak that lived a rough life, are you going to coddle them and bend to their whim, or draw a hard line to make them respect your role?There is not a lot of written/spoken backstory for the majority of locations, however I have not come across a single map that didn't leave something to the imagination (assuming someone has one :p ).I would recommend my friends buy this game at full price. The fact that it is on sale would make me buy it for them if they were still on the fence.You can go ahead and look at my previous posts, when I first got here I was HIGHLY critical of the game on release. I have done a complete 180. This group of devs got me, and they got me ♥♥♥♥ing good.			"

												I am such a sucker for zombie games so I'm surprised I didn't like this game. Most of my qualms with this game aren't with the gameplay itself. It feels poorly optimized. Also, the control are un-necessarily bad and complicated. The game looks pretty ugly too. One of my larger issues is just how bad the soundtrack is. It's been quite some time since I've heard such annoying ""Base"" music or ""combat"" music. I feel incredibly ripped off. This game might be worth 5 bucks but save yourself the money and don't throw your hard earned 30 dollars at it. IT IS NOT WORTH 30			"

I give it 4 and 1/2 stars out of 5. as  i previously stated the new year is already on us and already other zombie survival games are showing their head and they have alot on this game, except for the fact that this is most likely if not the best turn based game but to make this game compete with the other games that offer well so much more you really need to think how can we make this game even better, cause honestly i have not logged in for a while now cause i am a serious survival zombie nut and i am sorry but yes i prefer some of the recent new games that came out to this title simply cause i think this game could do more.

												Very bad game.  Bad controls, cliche characters, repetative and way too much done to add difficulty just to drag the game out.  You need fencing, but you can't salvage the miles and miles of fencing you will see in the cut-and-paste locations you visit.  Need parts to fix a car? Zero chance the missing parts are salvageable from the dozens of cars you will pass.   A book store had three books and two magazines, just to keep resorces scarce, and a town only had two stores in it?  Zombies are attracted to noise, sure, but clearing an area first before you make the noise should mean it's safe.  Instead, zombies appear out of thin air in a town with a population density of 10 people per square mile.  Lazy and cliche game design all the way around coupled with a crappy combat system.			"

												I can definitely see where the positive reviews come from and the brief amount of negetive reviews appear.Dead state looked very very promising when I started playing it. I had various bugs and crashes occur which I thought: ""ok this is probably just because this is a game in progress. Then I realize its a fully released game and I start to hope the devs fix the problems. I notice I continually have updates for this game which encourages me to continue playing the game. Overall however I've slowly felt like I'm beating a dead zombie with this game. So here's how the story goes.1st Game Play: Awesome. Loving it. Seems like this is going to occupy a good week to 2 weeks of my time and probably have good replay value. Get somewhat far into the game and it crashes... continuously.2nd Game Play: After an update I load up the game only to find that my previous saved game has been completely corrupted and thought: ""oh well, Ill just start over. Its got the official release. Maybe there is a bunch of different additions to the game. NO. NO THERE ISN'T. But I digress.3rd Game Play: I know the 2nd game play didn't really end anywhere other than I just stopped playing it for a couple days. But with the 3rd and final game play (atleast until the bugs are fixed) I get further into the game than I've gotten in the prior 2 game plays. Yet now for some reason the travel by horse has become slower than traveling by foot and for some reason when I add NPCs to my ""search party"" they don't come with. I don't quite know how to fix this bug (if it is a bug) but its annoyed me to point where I just stopped playing and decided I'll wait it out.So to make a long review short. This game needs some real fixin' And until then. I don't really see the point in playing the game unless you're going to be able to enjoy it the full way through. Please please please fix this game up. I really do enjoy it (for the most that I can play) and would like to see the future potential in it.			"

												I would like to warn anyone who is thinking of buying this game - it is definitelly 100% overpriced.Please do not take me wrong. It is a decent game which would definitelly find it's fans. It has a cool system of interpersonal relashionships management, lots of loot to play with, RPG traits and HQ development. But. The graphics are ridiculosly simple. The characters animation robotic. The choice of choosing a static picture to represent your character without any animation is pathetic. I can not care what is goin to happen to this pictuers who are constantly popping out lots of BS. Also, I came to the point when my character's face in all the dialoges was one of a Caucasian guy but there  was a black guy running in the game itself. So incongruent and off-hand the whole approach to the graphics is in this game. Another big thing, the combat system lacks depth, it is all about getting to the correct distance from the zombies to hit them first. From the variety of weapons the actual choise of combat options is limited. Due to the fact that more powerful weapon requires more action points to spend, it seems that all the weapon differes in the name but pretty much the same effectiveness wise. All in all, Dead State is not a bad game. Moreover, it is still in alfa. However, animation wise as well as the character development wise it falls miles and miles  low from even TellTales Walkind dead. Similar to that, combat wise it has nowhere near to stand to brilliant Xcom enemy series. When you start thinking that there are such games on the market like Alien Isolation, new Dragon Age and even Evil Within which you can buy for roughly the same price Dead State seems to be undoubtedly overpriced. Consider yourself warned.			"

												I like tactical RPGs like X-Com, Jagged Alliance, etc.  So I thought I'd like this game, and I did for a while.  Until the complete lack of polish started to get to me.  I don't FEEL like I'm in a zombie apocalypse.  I feel like an errand boy for a bunch of whiners.  Characters in the game are always the same, they always want the same thing (deoderant, coffee, batteries) which raises their mood level (gotta keep morale high).  However since they are unchanging, it feels like I'm constantly grinding to keep their mood high by bribing them with things I find.  For example, the one cop you start with has a gun but he says he's never used it before.  You can ask him for it but he refuses.  You can continue to ask him for it forever and he will always refuse.  I don't understand why these dialogue options exist if they do nothing.  This game is also quite flat and has very little in the way of randomization.  If you restart the game you'll find all the same loot in all the same places.  I do understand that this is an indie developer, however I don't think they should've undertaken such an ambitious project.I payed full price for this game, but after playing it, I'd say I'd pay about 10$ for it.

It's a shame the game had promise and could have been something special but as it stands even after the ""free update!""

												Beware of SpoilersI helped fund Dead State through Kickstarter and genuinely wanted to like the game but in the end I have to give it a thumbs down.The combat isn't the worst but I felt it missed some golden opportunities. Specific target locations on enemies' bodies(We are always told to go for the zombie's head, you know...), a better cover system, and overwatch would all have been nice additions.The maps were believable but grew old after a while. Been in one pharmacy, been in them all. There were a few exceptions to this rule but not enough.The crafting system was nicely done, but somewhat hard to gain access to. The science lab in particular required very specific characters or the player aligning his character's skills in a very specific way. I also wanted more items but I understand that may come down the line.Dialogue was spotty in some ways. There is quite a bit of profanity. Some places it is quite believable, like where one character( a D.J.) rants about how depraved mankind has gotten but other places it was overdone. Many of the conversations contained misfires about events that had already occurred. Some of the characters seem more straw than others. I do want to congratulate the writers on the shelter survivor Davis. He was totally believable as a former firefighter injured in the line of duty who won't let a wheelchair slow him down. He was one of my favorites and a an all too rare character with a physical challenge. DoubleBear didn't shy away from emotional or mental challenges either and my hat is off to them for it.I did think the characters were a bit whiny given what all I was bringing in. But hey that might have been just me.The survival aspects were thought out but again I thought more could be done. With so many unburied bodies the diseases that would have been percolating... Zombie bites should not have been the only risk of infection.Don't look for super vivid graphics or ultra cool sound. I personally thought the visuals were okay. Sound... iffy.Again I should stress that this game was made on a Kickstarter budget and had limits but I still feel it could have been so much more.			"

								Graphically Dead State is on par with the general expectation of a top down turn based game. in it's present release state it should be considered a nothing more than a liner prequel story 7days before the main game play that would come with the main release. Mechanically the game is sound, with exception given to the combat system which has a tendency to lock up the game's global mechanics; this commonly occurs when engaging the Zombies or ""those things"" as they are commonly referred to within the story line; as the word zombie seems to be taboo with the developers when they were writing the games story line. The use of the word ""Demo"" within the main menu screen has thus far caused no end of trouble for the developers recently. As this has implied that this present itineration would not be update or replace with a full version upon its release. I would implore the developers clarify in pure and simple terms, what will happen to this release when full version is deployed and to replace the word ""demo"" in the main menu with ""prequel"". until the present bugs are fixed and clarification is given in a formal announcement on stream; I cannot in recommend this game to others. despite its obvious potential to be a really decent game.

Early Access Review
								Been stalking this game sense before they had a kickstarter and was excited to be able to play some of it. Though I did run out of things to do in the first seven days, the game lived up to everything I have been waiting for. I did however find a handful of bugs that I'm hoping will be resolved by the time the full game is released. Things to notice before purchase:The full game is listed at $30 when released if you know you want it, now is a better time to purchase.Find the manual before running game. It doesn't appear anywhere noticeable after download and is online for anyone curious about how the game runs. I skimmed it at best due to its long length. But might be an insight for someone unsure on this game.This demo only runs the first 7 days with limited things to do. I wouldn't purchase it unless you are sure you want the full version which is still under development. If you can wait for the full version to come out a demo will be free at that time.Be prepared for bugs. Though annoying they didn't manage to ruin my gameplay but could easily become frustrating.Personally I loved being able to control my own group as I loot the surrounding areas for all they're worth and would easily recommend the game to anyone with a love of zombie survival.

								People are posting long winded complaints about this game being ""A demo"" and not a full beta. First off I'd rather play a polished demo than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ full beta that makes me have the game. I'd rather the $25 beta than the $60 wasteland 2 beta that's going on right now. The game is amazing. It's still a little buggy but I love what I played so far. I really think if you love survival games you'll love this. It's like a RPG version of Project Zomboid. I think my best description would be combine State of Decay and Project Zomboid.			"

Early Access Review
								Pretty much what it says it is... a demo. Not a whole lot to be done. Will be interesting to see what the final product looks like. As it stands; quite a few freeze-ups/bugs, and fights are so sloooooooooooooooow. (Could really use some faster animations.) Also lacks a few characteristics of favorite RPG's such as character customization/creation and so forth. I'm also hoping it's more open-world than the demo indicates.Edit 6/11: Lot of bugs have been fixed, but still have problems with random crashes. I suspect they will be fixed too as the game is still updated frequently. Some of the stuff such as character customization has now been addressed and the game is pretty open world. My only complaint at this point is how slow fights go. For example if you are fighting two or three zombies on a map with 25+ zombies that you haven't engaged yet... you still have to wait until the game cycles through ALL of the zombies before taking your next turn. I have literally spent more than an hour in one fight, particularly when using weapons and creating noise, more zombies will spawn to cycle through.			"

								so do we get the full game considering we paid for it? i've never seen it not work like that but it's a little confusing considering... the game itself is everything i wanted from dead state, its a little hard to figure out (actually almost impossible) but it runs like a dream, the graphics are above expectation and the style is rare but golden. you don't get many decent turn based games these days. i have recomended this game to my friends, but i have also warned them that it is a demo at the moment and i'm not sure if the full release will incur a second charge, even if i personally consider this early view of the game worthwhile. but if you decide that your going to charge me, or anyone else an extra $30 on top of the early access game fee (which it doesn't look like you will but based on comments i have seen so far i have to mention) i at least have to post this message as a warningdownload at your own risk... this may end up another world Z			"

												Hmm, It's early (almost an hour) and I don't know about it. I only put a thumbs up as steam wouldn't let me just skip the thumbs review. I think others should give a chance.Some thoughts though. Just my experience as a person who enjoys games and as a person who designs games as well. Take them for what they are : opinion.UI - clunky. Should be intuitive, at the beginning of the game it says to go in some directory find some manual that's more in depth. What putting a tab in the game was too much trouble?Reloading a gun - I don't even know how to do this. I thought it would be obvious like drag the correct ammo type on a gun. I have a snubnose .38, it says it takes .38 ammo - I think I should be able to A) right click or whatever and say load ammo B) drag and drop ammo on it C) I don't know, something else. Instead I have no idea. Someone saying ""Well you need to read the manual"" How about a nice cup of shut the hell up. Reallly. I'm not asking for a hand holding - I hate that. I would at least like some idea of how the hell you are supposed to something basic like that.Combat - clunky. It's trying to be xcom but it's not. The presentation of showing a zombie right next to you, and shows you swinging your axe/club/wrench etc and it goes right through and says ""miss"" is just poorly presented.  It's not that I know you can miss, like in real life it's the way its presented. Feels not fun.Controls are semi ok, the 3rd person rotating camera I'm actually ok with. I can't say I recommend or not recommend this game.  I don't think a game should be a case of ""Well you will get used to it"" or ""You need to read about this and that"" or ""Well you are not playing it right"" or whatever lame excuse someone wants to cook up. A game should find the fun. Period. If I'm not having fun , all the comments are pointless. It's like concetrating on the person instead of the underlying issue. Does no one any good.I'm still playing, and I plan another hour or two before I decide if I'm jumping ship. There's your review.12/09/14 I tried playing another 30 minutes. Everything above, yea throw that out the window. This game is really bad.			"

I had a lot of high hopesfor it but after X number of game hours.Dull is about the only word i have for it. I would have to say it is mainly becauseof the combat engine, lack of ""options"" etc. Some may find the gameentertaining to an extent. If you like the X-com type of fighting, give it a trybut all and all you will find this to be dull. I will keep a close eye on this and seewhat the DEVs add.

												First off, i want to respond to someone that clearly hasn't played the game long enough to know the basic combat mechanics, so people won't avoid this game based on a rather misinformed review: ""-can't tank them""You can. Maximize vigor, strength, and put on a heavy armor. ...But that still doesn't mean you should, since dead character will stay dead. Avoid any direct confrontation if possible, whether it's against looters or zombies.""-can't kite them""Every type of enemy has a certain vision range. Just make your party hides in a certain spot and *very* carefully send one party member to kite one or two of the zombies.""-can't evade them""Put more points towards agility. But this is a survival strategy game in the first place, so what you really want to do is to kill off any threats as carefully and quietly as possible. And to add: positioning is *crucial* in any strategy game, so if you somehow messed up and got a party member surrounded by zombies, then you're the only one to blame for that. ""-can't sneak past them""Stealth is a totally viable option, and is the preferred way of doing things in this game. Zombies has a rather small(er) visibility cone, so you CAN evade them and quite easily too compared to sneaking past looters. They do have better sense of hearing though, so if you're planning to do a sneak attack do it quickly. Initiate the attack a few squares away from behind the zombie.""-must rely on luck to beat them""Every strategy game that has RNG relies on both skill and luck. I see no problem with this.""-if you don't outnumber them 2 or 3 to 1, it has a high probability of a loss.""Outnumbering them does indeed kills them more effectively, but that doesn't mean you can't send a party member with high Vigor and Strength/Agility plus a high enough melee skill to face off against a zombie one-on-one.I'm not saying the game is perfect. It's buggy at times, writing is... okay, and the graphics and animations are not exactly what you'd call stellar...But the game still offers exploration in a rather big world map, the strategy part is quite solid, you can recruit and manage survivors who also gives you choices and consequences that matters, and the best aspect i personally love the most: homebase management. I just wish they would offer more base other than the school though, and more interations between each survivors.Overall it's at least a 7/10 game, and is totally worth the price tag.			"

Early Access Review
								First of all, let me say that I am very impressed with Dead State so far.  I love the concept, and the interface, and I can tell it's destined to become a great zombie/survival game.  It is clearly still a work in progress, but that doesn't bother me.  I wanted to write this review to give the developers some intel on the bugs I've encountered so far during gameplay, so hopefully they can be addressed in future updates.  I love the game, but find that it has gotten a little more glitchy and harder to successfully play since the release of the last update.  Please note that these are notes I have taken since I started playing, and some problems listed here may already have been fixed.  But I just wanted to note everything, just in case.  So here we go...My notes are as follows:(1)  I wish you could split stacks of the same items in your inventory screen, so that you could easily split resources (like ammo) among party members or drop some (but not all) on the ground.  Right now, I feel like I have to load all the guns I have with my main character because I can't figure out how to divvy up ammo among party members, unless they each pick up some ammo for themselves here or there in scavving.  This also becomes an issue when dealing with weight, since some characters can carry more than others, and it could be possible to split heavier items to distribute the weight better among the party members.  (2)  In my game, when there are battle effects to a party member (which appear as small icons to the right of the party member's face on the left of the screen), I cannot hover over those icons to determine what effects they are having, and how to cure them.  Instead, I have to have to open the game manual (or just use my memory) to be able to figure it out.  It would be easier if I could gain info while hovering over these status icons.(3) The stats for weapons in inventory should show how many action points are required to use the weapon (at least for basic attacks).  It's helpful to know, before you equip something, that it takes 7 AP to use, rather than 3.(4)  On the job board, the stats for party members should show their HP, so I can be sure to assign the healthiest members of my group to active party/scouting/scavving/fighting duty.(5)  It would be nice if I could trade/provide equipment to various party members directly from the main storage shelf in the shelter, instead of having to equip them on the field with only items in my main character's inventory.  (Or if I could at least have a way to see the inventory of these other players while stationed in the shelter.)  I find it difficult to know what other party members are carrying, unless I've recently been in the field with them.  (6)  The pike weapon (the pitchfork) doesn't actually attack when ""mangle"" is selected.  It simply uses 7 AP while nothing happens.(7)  Priscilla's dialogue has some minor grammar errors:  ""I barely every left my family's farm"" should be ""I barely ever left my family's farm"" or ""I barely even left my family's farm"" and ""I saw Todd's program and he preaced about tolerence"" should be ""I saw Todd's program and he preached about tolerence.""(8)  When asked to make a decision about whether to engage in water purification system repairs, I was only given the option to side with Vic and refuse to make the repairs.  I don't know if this was a glitch, or something that resulted from my negotiation or leadership skill levels, or maybe my relationships with Vic and Todd, or maybe my lack of appropriate stored resources.  But I thought I'd mention it anyways.(9)  When Max joined the group, I was able to add him to my scavanging/scouting party immediately, even though he was supposed to be recovering after we found him at the gate.  So it was weird when he ""woke up"" in the game for the first time, since I had already been out fighting and scavving with him an hour before.  To avoid this weirdness, he should be unavailable for work on the job board for one or two days after his arrival at the shelter, until he recouperates.(10) It would be nice if there was a place on the Job Board or somewhere else, where you could easily see what day it is.  I can't easily determine what day it is.  (11)  I encountered two glitches in association with use of the watchtower:  (a) Doug has yelled at me about 10 times for failing to construct a watchtower.  The first time he did this, we were already in the process of building it.  The next times, it was already built, and I had assigned Doug to watchtower duty, so he should have known it was already built.  I think Doug should only yell at you once if you're actually doing what he says to do.  If you don't do it, he can continue to yell at you, but he should stop screaching about it once the tower is built. (b) When I set Doug to watchtower duty (and this only happened once, but it was a major glitch) and then took my party to scavange the truck stop where we picked up three new survivors (the 17 yr-old and Japanese woman being among them), Doug ended up ""accidentally"" coming with my party as a fifth party member.  You are only allowed to have four party members at a time, so Doug took the place of Joel in the icons on the left of the screen (although Joel was visibly still in the party).  Thus, I couldn't trade with Joel, even though he was fighting with me in my party.  During this time, I couldn't see the blue highlights on the face icons to indicate which party member was selected; doors, walls, and objects like tables and counters were ignored and walked through by party members (leading to unintentional encounters behind walls I didn't expect to pass through); the health of my party members never seemed to decrease, despite being in a significant battle, and despite the fact that when I returned to the shelter, my party members' health was shown to have decreased significantly; the decible system seemed to get stuck in the red, even though we had stopped using guns, and the zombies continued to fill the area until there must have been more than 100 of them.  (Perhaps this is supposed to happen in the game sometimes, but I wanted to note it since it's the first time I've seen the decible system stay maxed in the red for more than 10 turns after gunfire ceased.) (12) After the last major update, I am noticing the following glitches in the game, which I did not notice before (though these glitches seem to come and go, and are not there all the time):  (a) sometimes dead AI players in combat still look alive, even though I can search their supposedly dead bodies and cannot attack them anymore.  Because they look alive, the combat interface seems to believe that combat is still ongoing, so it doesn't release the group from combat until we slowly leave the area; (b) sometimes my healer can't heal my party members in combat when they are K.O.ed, even though my med bag is full.  It won't show the heal option when I hover over the K.O.ed player; and (c) sometimes the game won't let me fully kill an AI enemy who is K.O.ed.Okay...that's it for now.  Thanks for listening and working to create a great game!  If I find anything else during my play, I'll let you know.  Can't wait to see the game in its final form!!   "

								(the time played indicated doesn't reflect the real hours spent on this game because I only play offline)This game is a MUST HAVe if you are fan of survival zombies + lots of exploration on a quit big map + ressources gathering + team management + strategy (how the ressources should better be used, which PNJ should be let join the team of not (more manpower but also more mouth to feed, and so on), also what should be the short term/long term strategy to adopt) + some crafting + turn based fights + old school look (a bit like Wasteland 2 but slightly less good).If you are not a fan of all that, this game is probably not going to fit your tastes.But if you are fan of all that, you are really going to enjoy this game, even if it's still in Beta so still has a few bugs but nothing major as far as I can tell.Personnaly I love it, so thanks a lot to the small studio that did it ! :-)			"

												this is one of the very few games like it in its genre its a turn-based rpg zombie game (never seen a game like it on steam) ill start with the bad(there are very few) it does have conflicts you have to solve they feel a bit tacked on all it does is increase or decrease morale. I have never come into any game breaking bugs and the devs are constantly working on it. it does have two endings (i think)it is truely unique and fun game at at great price			"

												Another zombie game that plays on your expectations and wild fantasies of survival-Booring dialogues-Generic characters-Simplistic combat with nothing tactical about it whatsoever.The only way to win is to bash them one by one before they do that to you-Raw UI. You get used to these types of letdowns but that doesnt make them forgivable!I cant really name any pros,i had absolutely zero fun with it and I wish i could get a refund when i could.Dont make the same mistake of supporting Early Access games that were kicked out of it way too early!!!

A shame they cocked it right up releasing a game that was unfinished, buggy as all H E double hocky sticks and clearly still in Alpha stage, Beta would be generous.

								Very excited to finally get some hands-on time with Dead State even though it is only a small taste. It has everything I've been looking for in a zombie game. As expected in any work in progress build there are a few technical issues and features not yet implimented but the team has addressed them on the forums and I have no doubt everything will be taken care of in the final build.Quick summary, It's fun and very challenging. It has replaybility because it's easy to bite off more than you chew at first, so alternate methods are easy to explore. Can't wait to see more! Keep it up Doublebear!			"

								This game has a REALLY solid foundation to build upon. I Kickstarted this game a while back and have really been looking forward to it. Think Walking Dead (show) with turn based combat or State of Decay (another solid game) with turn based combat. While for the beta you can't create your character, you will in the full game along with the dog(e) companaion. You have to manage a base, resource, moral, and most of all your sanity dealing with other people. If you played the Facebook game, Last Stand: Dead Zone, this is similar to that game minus the Facebook ""give us real money for XYZ or bug your buddies"". I'm on day 3 in the demo and I'm enjoying what I'm seeing so far. I'm aware it has some jank to it, not all features are activated but I'm liking what I'm seeing so far. The game has a ton of potential and a must for those of use that enjoy turned based combat and ""base"" building.			"

								XCom meets Project Zomboid.  Well, both of those games actually have more features but the game has it's moments.  The worlds / places you travel to are limited to maybe 3 or 4 buildings.  When you gather supplies and bring them back, you are very limited with what to do with what you collected, since the computer seems to take all your loot and sort it for you.  I'd even say State of Decay has more ""shelter building"" features than this game.  If the shelter had more options, more building, more hands on things rather than a ""labor"" board, the game would be much funner.  It is very overpriced for what it has to offer.I read from the creators that the game isn't really in alpha, but more of cut short.  If that's the case, there really aren't that many features to keep me interested.   I will continue to play and rate it positive simply because I just enjoy this genre, but there are much better games for the price point.Game play below.  Also tutorials on how to activate missions, use the inventory, heal, reload weapons, and use the UI.

								It brings back the feeling of the first two fallout games, but mixed with the ""zombie apocalypse"" gender.There is a few bugs here and there, and there might be the need of adding several new features and options, but since it's still in beta/early access, there is plenty of things there can be changed.So if you like ""squard command"", ""zombie apocalypse survival, and a mix of real time strategy and turn based. then Dead State might be a good choice to play.

												This is a week buy reccomendation.It is fun running your own little colony in the zombie appocalypse.  Some of the stories and interactions are interesting.Overall though, the game still has quite a few frustrating bugs.   The interactions that the player can have wth the members of their colony are simplistic and one dimentional.  The graphics could have had a bit more polish, and a little voice acting could have brought a life to an otherwise bland game.			"

								The game overall is playable. I like the overall concept of the game and its been holding my interest and I have been wanting more. Still a bunch of bugs and not all game features and areas are in or complete. I personally would not call this a Beta, still more alpha to me, but I have been enjoying myself. I would not recommend buying the game if you don't like to help find/fix bugs and have random crashes and currupted save games. Wait a few months or buy it when its released. If you want to support the game and help, make sure you read the known issues list so you understand what to look out for and what are the current limitations of the game.This game has a tons of potential and I like that the developer is very responsive. I will be playing and watching this one closely.			"

												I really need to say a few things about Dead StateDead State is an amazing concept for fans of not only survival games, zombies, but general story-telling and in-game representation of real people reacting to the chaos of a world falling apart.The game starts out strong, with an interesting storyline, detailed interactions, and interesting exploration of the world around you - not only by physically going out there but hearing and reading about how things came to be this way and what's happening because of it.I frankly adored the first few hours of playing - and then this games seams began to showCharacters that only showed up the day before rebelling, no dialogue options to solve certain problems, and an ending that truly made me wonder why I began playing in the first place.What was the point of playing if - no real spoilers - the game simply fades out after a picture of essentailly ""JOB WELL DONE"" flashes on the screen.If you read this review before buying - don't buy this game.

												How can be a very good idea transformed into a poor game. However, the graphics is not bad -except the characters when moving during fight.- People special need and Base management is a mess...moving character around the building, find stuff, find other characters, find other rooms is something very basic. Other guys are always need the same...cigar, sleeping pills, etc. After a while you are just running around and bringing cigars and spices, etc. like a grocer.- Conversation...simple, boring, flat text options. The same questions and similar answers.- Turn base fight...your guys could not hit the enemy from point range....using ""weapons"" means nothing, it is the same near-random generator fight. Moving during fight...I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off when my team was unable to move out and died in a toilet. Nonsense. Cannot attack with meele weapon, just from 90 degree. I have seen similar game on my Commodore 64 when I was teenage.- Music, sounds, noise...the same 5-6 effects are repeating.- Characters can move across walls. Nice. Just the enemy, not your team, of course.- What I can say ""positive"" is the idea of the game and the base development. This part is the best written code, it is working and nice. You can build things, like mushroom farm and the whole population is living on mushrooms. Broaf....- Unfortuntely base management as I said, very simple. If something is wrong, just assign someone to fix. Cleaning and maintenance is simple...watchtower I have need some people to watch but the oldest guys can do the job. Probably with strong glasses...All in all, the idea of this game is great, the implementation does not worth the price.			"

												 Despite a few present bugs, and as much as people seem to be ♥♥♥♥♥ing about bugs, I've honestly enjoyed my time spent playing it. It really scratched the 'long term' zombie survival itch, something which is missing from most every zombie game presently.      There seem to be a few weird attempts to shoehorn in issues that are politically charged, like This gay Texas ranger shows up, the guy is really useful, really high stats, but he shrugs off his 'partner' dying in a car crash and just carries on without any problems, I know the guy was in the Army, but jeez. Knowing this 'controversial character' thing, the issue of him being gay will probably come up and you'll have to choose a side. and at one point a lady helicopter pilot wants an abortion and the preacher who was a missionary and worked in foriegn countries wants her to keep it, and you gotta choose a side, and theres more NPC conflict interactions like that, most of which aren't issues if you've got good negotiation and leadership skills.     Maybe its just me understanding that issues like these are inserted into games, not to make a meaningful message, or take a stance, but, added to try and generate 'buzz' or 'controversy' That sort of thing feels a little hamfisted, but npc dialogue isn't that important anyways, and whats present is pretty good, nothing absurd, but, I think the writing is a bit lacking in the overall amount of it, it would be nice to see more circumstantial responses and general dialogue.Now, lets get to the meat of it, the game: Turn based like fallout 2 and a ""S.P.E.C.I.A.L""-lite stat system, with actions that use AP in combat with free movement when out of it. It works, its good, I like it very much. There are the occasional out of combat pathfinding bug, but thats not a problem really. Its really enjoyable.     What should be added: The ability to reload a single shot for less AP or something like that on certain weapons, maybe accessories you can find and attach or use with  weapons to change their stats, like speed loaders for revolvers, better recoil pads, scopes, stuff like that, maybe even give the same treatment to melee weapons, maybe wrapping some barbed wire around a bat, etc.I really do hope the developers keep adding content or open the game to being modifiable by the community and stick it on the steam workshop.Its a good game, made by a small developer, and I recommend it.

												As much as I want to love this game, I can't give it a passing grade. I love isometric, turn based RPGs... yet Deadstate doesn't scratch the same itch that Fallout 1 & 2 do and I'd reccomend going to those games before going with Deadstate. I did not buy the game, I played it from a friend's library so I'm just sharing my thoughts here.[ http://url=store.steampowered.com ]  [/url][ http://url=store.steampowered.com ]  [/url]The overall combat feels lacking with no real special animations or flash to give it that lasting appeal. There are no brutal fatalities like there are in Fallout, hint go play that game.Scaving feels underhwelming as the end result of your work ends up getting autosorted when you get to base and the amount of things you can do with said supplies are limited. Project Zomboid has a more rewarding Scaving system and I'd also say go with that.[ http://url=store.steampowered.com ]  [/url]It all feels pretty bland and generic. I won't rip on the graphics as I believe in gameplay>graphics. A game that seems like a carbon copy of this, but feels better for the price is a game called Survivalist. Its got worse graphics, but the price is only a dollar or so, trust me its better than it seems... just mute the music when you get in-game.[ http://url=store.steampowered.com ] http://store.steampowered.com/app/340050/ [/url]While it's certainly not the best, its not the worst and could be picked up on sale for >10$ I saw Deadstate a long while back when I was naive to the early access/survival game trend and had foolishly sunk cash into another Zombie early access game  called  The Dead Linger (Which  Surprise! turned out to be a flop, money wasted but lesson learned). After being burned by that I decided to pass up Dead State, which I'm happy I did for its original price. However, I saw how hard the developers worked on this and tried to make it work, but I simply cannot give this game a passing grade for its current price.TL:DR, here are some better options to spend your cash on:FALLOUT 1 & 2[ http://url=store.steampowered.com ] http://store.steampowered.com/app/38400/ [/url][ http://url=store.steampowered.com ] http://store.steampowered.com/app/38410/ [/url]PROJECT ZOMBOID[ http://url=store.steampowered.com ] http://store.steampowered.com/app/108600/ [/url]SURVIVALIST[ http://url=store.steampowered.com ] http://store.steampowered.com/app/340050/ [/url] "

Early Access Review
								Avoid it. Updated about new version at the bottom.Dont buy it before release, devs are updating it very rarely, they probably stop producing it in some time. Game has been since february 2014 , now its 22 of july and only 3 updates with some minor bug fixes.3 weeks later - no update, seems to me this game is abandoned. Also moderators are locking treads that are asking questions about timeline and that are not 100 % fanboySo we got new version after 2 months and nothing changed. Yes, you got a lot of new locations, but you cant loot them. You got encounters, but enemy are dissapearing and you cant loot them. All major bugs are still in the game. Also developers support fascist civil war in Ukraine, because half of their team are from it.  So dont buy it if you dont want to help nazis. Половина разрабов - бендеровцы. Знал бы об этом раньше никогда бы не купил ваше ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥оподелие.			"

												I just wanted to update this saying it's also really excellent if you've ever lived in texas. I lived in austin for about 9 years and it's cool to see the towns around texas represented.  Also, is there another way to x-fer items from npcs into storage, or does it always have to go through you... cause this is the biggest drawback in seamless gameplay for me...if you really like the turn based combat in xcom (the new ones) you'll like this. I think the combat is excellent and I never get bored of it.  They also do a great job making you feel like you don't have enough stuff ... at least early in the game. The characters are fun, and I think I got different ones in 2 play throughs, There are still some bugs and some issues with inventory imo, but nothing that's going to ♥♥♥♥ you off too bad. If you like turn based comat rpgs this game is way better than most, and really up there with xcom and the new shadowrun. So far I like both those other games a little better, but I am only a little bit into Dead State. It's rocking much harder than I thought it would.			"

												I don't play many games apart from my main favourite which is RPGish, so I think it's time to put in my twopennorth. I started to play Dead State about a week ago, and I found it pretty tough, and also frustrating in several ways. Today was patch day, and it plays so much better. Well it does for me. Now it will run in widescreen on my laptop, so that's nice. And there's an autosave, so that's nice. I am currently playing with as much survival emphasis in my character build as is sensible, I include the mom and daughter in the away team, and one other. Apparently I will be able to have 4 companions now...yes, that's also nice. On our shopping trip today we got a load of meds and fuel, and plenty of food (even a few apples), so we had the next day (gametime ofc) off. I am still laughing at the tooltip for Elaine which says ""Undamaged"". Ha!  I am looking forward to getting a car of some sort, because that will be also nice. So, here I am, now walking softly but carrying a big stick, and not really getting mad at the game anymore. I like it and have now recommended it. it isn't perfect, but it is cheap, and I think it represents very good value.  Happy holidays to you all from England.			"

												Deleted my old review and decide to make a new, more sincere.I'm in a love/hate realtionship with this game.Had three save files corrupted. Had many game stopping bugs. Had to deal with wall crossing zombies, hoverin allies and buggy interface overall. And most recently, had just dowloaded the new update and had three game crashes in two hours.But I just can't stop playing it. Saying ""it has potential"" it's not quite accurate. It kinda lives to it's potential - but falls to it's deficiences. Hope for constant updates and increases in content. I like what I see, I just don't like to star over so many times.			"

Early Access Review
								Firstly let me say I'm a KS supporter. I backed this game years ago. I""m pretty satisfied with what I've playe so far (limited as it may be). there are many positives to this game, the story seems like its going to good, the gameplay is compelling. The TB strat aspect is very cool. Hopefully in the final game we will have our base attacked, be able to relocated and be able to farm areas for tools and survivors. I enjoy the fog of war, the difficulty of the game and it seems like many many more things will be available once it launches.Now onto the negative. This is NOT a EA game, this is a DEMO. In EVERY EA game I've played the game will evolve over time, more content will be opened and entire things may change. In this DEMO everything will remain pretty much the same until the game launches. We will get nothing after the first 7 days are done. I understand why they did this, however they lied to us about what we would get. We were promised early access to a beta type game and that we would have the abliity to help mold this game into what it would become. We instead get this.Let me be clear, this is going to be a good game if you enjoy TBS with a dynamic of base and npc interaction. This will be a good game for you if you enjoy zombie survival. But dont be decieved, this game is a DEMO and you can get it for free in a couple of months when it launches. If you don't want to buy a demo just wait in my opinion.			"

												So i havent played this game for 3 months do YOU know WHY!!! Because without use the alpha buyers knowing they took the game out of alpha giving a HALF finished product that is Fu***ng good. Now im not saying Double bears production is a bad Studio im saying the people Runnning the Studio are bad. I was in LOVE with the idea of this game i went along getting the alpha and then reanimated edition. Now why im i saying this that well it looks finished, But the map isnt finished the story ending was to be ""improved"" they sad 5 FU***ING MONTHS AGO AND STILL NOTHING. I wish when there was a time when gaming studios finished there products like Paradox Interactive but well Double bear production just gives you a half finished game.(this is my angry review). NOW:(My profassional review): The makers Double Bear production is a gaming studio not known alot and so couldnt get the attention like EA or Infinty ward. The game was in the Early-Alpha a already nice game but alot of things, Animations, Objects and items needed to be added so many buyers waited and waited. Now and then a bug fixing update nothing special and the BAM Reanimated releases many buyers hyped,because they get it for free because they have the base game already.(including me) Then on the store page it still stood : This Game is in Early Alpha then about 3 months ater with no updates only news about dongs on mirrors, I look on the store page and the message about Early Alpha was gone. I was confused so i took it upon myself to find everthing i can about what happend nothing just nothing only to find 1 week later a tidal wave of discussions why Double bear productions left us so im annoyed about this.This game isnt finished their are NO updates and the amount of content for money is bad you pay to much for to little i do not recommend this game and just wait it out see if anything als comes out, BUT if you have all the money in the world just SUPPORT THIS AS*HOLS.

												Here's the thing: I like this game. I spent several hours playing it. The story is ok, if you like that whole ""post-apocalyptic-zombie"" theme.BUTIt really feels that this game should still be in early access, for it has a bunch of annoying bugs and glitches that shouldn't be on a final release.This is my little list of complaints:- Some items don't stack in the shelter inventory, while others, that are exactly the same, do.- You can't throw items out... You have to find a lootable container to put the things you don't want there.- Combat can be really glitchy, if you are on an area that has more than one floor.- Glass windows and doors should allow you to look inside a place before you enter it (c'mon guys!)Based on pricing and on the rushed development feel of this game, I cannot recommend it. Even though I really whish I could.Maybe after a couple more patches, I'll change my review			"

												I wish i could like this game but I don't and thats all because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat system my charecters always get killed cause they don't have enough action points I wish it was kinda like This war of Mine where there are no action points you can use one charecter to kill a guy but in this game you have to use all your charecters which sucks cause usually I have no space for all my charecters to fit when getting into a fight.  Also i wish you could get out of the Combat mode when fighting cause i sometimes just want to retreat But NO You must kill the person or Persons attacking you first to get out of combat mode which sucks cause you can only move so much in combat mode Unlike This war of mine you can move freely with out having to stop So i can retreat and avoid getting my people killed in this war of mine but not here i have to stick to my ground and kill every body before I retreat Which just sucks. For people who are looking for a good survival game check out this war of mine  This war of mine has a way better combat system and you don't have to worry about Action points you move and fight freely in this war fo mine with out having to rest your charectersSo i don't recomend this game so leave this game and check out this war of mine way better!

												It's a lot of fun.  Turn based combat Fallout-style, scavenging in the zombie apocalypse for food and base upgrades, people management with distinct personalities, keeping morale up is a real part of the mechanic- and each morning there are some choices to make.  There are a lot of aspects and they're all entertaining, and with some nice touches of humor in the background props.  I'm not finished with the game and still the story and goals are evolving.  I feel like the characters progress and have opinions, and actually ended up taking them on scouting missions based on who I ""like"" better instead of strictly their stats.  Well, once.  It takes a very long time to wait through rounds of medics and salesmen failing to bash zombies, until the big rig driver's turn comes around and she finally lands a staggering killing blow with her sledgehammer.

Trudging through there were moments that I liked that kept me playing but many more that made me feel like uninstalling this game. In the end this release of a game is not finished and I can't recommend this game. Perhaps later when this game is more polished but not right now.

												This is NOT yet a complete product. It should still be in early access. I experienced a bug that causes a permanent negative status effect on my party members. It makes the game nearly un-playable. When I visited the game's web site seeking a fix I found that others were experiencing the same problem and there was no fix. I also found that their forums were full of celebatory posts about hotfixes for other game-breaking bugs that were fixed post-launch.I chose not to buy this game in early access for a reason. If I'm going to buy a game I want a complete, playable product. I was excited to buy this game at full-release only to receive a product that was more glitchy and unplayable than most early access projects are.Maybe one day this game will live up to its' potential, but as it is now DO NOT BUY. Save your money for complete games, or wait until there are enough patches for this to be playable. These developers need to learn to wait until their game is playble for full release rather than ""mostly playable"".			"

												It is not Xcom in the zombie apocalypse to be that it would need fleshed out combat mechanics.. you cant change facing, there is no overwatch, there is no attack of oportunity, there is no prepared action all there is is a half baked 'stealth' mechanic and bonuses to hit from behind and the sides [ remember no ability to change facing !!] all in all the combat side is checkers rather than chess in terms of tactical depththe path finding is comically badit is an oportunity missed, maybe the Devs were not talented enough to create turn based combat mechanics or they had had their money and couldnt be arsed who knows..EITHER WAY IT IS NOT WORTH THE  £22 PRICE TAG..

												I don't understand why all the positive reviews. Maybe I'm just not getting the game like you guys are.I bought this mainly because it looked fun and seemed like a zombie version of Wasteland 2. It is almost alike, but this game isn't very good to me. Below are a list of pros and cons I can think of.Pros:It's addicting and fun.Cons.-The enemies are too strong. You start a game with weak weapons and whatnot. I understand that. But the fact that it takes 3 people to kill 1 zombie is rediculous! It shouldn't take 3 people and 5 turns to kill 1 zombie. Same with humans. 3v1 + turns. That's just really.. Really dumb.-AI are not smarter. Do not believe the description. If an enemy has a gun, they will keep using it until they have no ammo left. So if you're fighting 1 looter and he has a gun, you have 3 people, he's going to cause 150+ noise in the first few turns. By time he runs out of ammo, it's too late. There are a dozen zombies swarming you and the looter. At that point you might as well quickload and avoid the 1 looter altogether and just exit the area. This game kind of forces you to avoid combat or else you're going to suffer heavy damage against 1 enemy.Like I said, the pro was that it was fun and addicting, but the two cons make it unplayable.. If it takes 5 turns to kill 1 zombie with 3 people even with using side and back attacks, imagine the difficulty of fighting 2 zombies with 3 people. At least 1 person will get infected, one person will get heavily wounded, or worse. The fact that using alternate attacks reduces your hit chance considerably makes it all the less enjoyable too. I already have 55% chances to hit on side attacks.. Let's reduce it to 20% chance.All in all, this game is good. I'd recommend playing it and all, but I just can't get in to it because of these stupid AI and super resiliant enemies. It feels like they get 200 health and I get 100 health. If there was a medium when recommending, I'd choose that. However, considering there is only ""Yes"" and ""No,"" I'd have to say I don't recommend this. This isn't a terrible game - it's very enjoyable, it's just annoying. I'll continue to play it and try new things out and I'll change my review if i can figure out a better gameplan, but as it stands.. This is really hard.			"

												It is now a good time to buy Dead State! The bugs have been fixed (well, the game breaking ones)and the game is no longer a messy sandwich filled with bugs since launch. Also the other bugs may be fixed very soon!The game has always had amazing potential and still does to this day. Now that the game is released there are much features to enjoy. It may be $29.99 but if you really are unsure of it then please wait until a sale then purchase, I promise that if your a fan of turn-based battles and point and clickers, you will not be dissapointed.

								Dead State is a dead state. A virus travelled around the globe and wiped out everyone. Well, nearly everyone. You are trapped in a school with struggling survivors. Theres one thing for sure. Texas, America will NEVER be the same again. Build appliances that raise morale and scavenge for supplies, weapons or medical meds in a world gone wrong. Ladies and gentlemen! This. Is. Dead State.If you want a review of a game you want a review from, buy the game for me, and Ill write a review ASAP.Your pal, Spud.			"

												I read all the reviews and still bought the game even though they were overwhelmingly negetive. I did the same with Wasteland 2 and I enjoy and still play that. SO I figured I'd give it a shot. I wanted to give it a chance because in theory it is everything I want in a game. Bad decision. I never write reviews but my exerience with this game has forced me to.I don't nit-pick on things. I can get over the basic graphics. I can get over minor bugs. I CANNOT GET OVER MY INVENTORY DISAPPEARING. I spent a day playing through this mess. I got over everything because I knew that small amount of fufillment I would receive from heading out to the world and looting untl I had no more room, coming home and sorting through my spoils, would be worth it. Then I came back to the school and all my stuff is gone. I still have my weapons that were on my main character. But nothing else. Thats it. Forget the fact you can't drop items, or the graphics are weak and the battles are boring. If I am fine with cutting this game down to just basic exploration and looting and am fine with it. at least I would like to keep that loot. Screw this game. Don't give it a shot. Don't wait for it to be fixed. Just don't. It's literally the worst experience I have ever had gaming. It burns so much more knowing I dropped 30 into this. Its criminal.INVENTORY DISAPPEARS WHEN YOU COME BACK FROM EXPLORING. ****			"

												This game has a LOT to love, but almost as much (maybe more, depending on you and your preferences) to hate. I find that the pros strongly outwiegh the cons, but this is NOT going to be the case for everyone. So, in short order, I present a warning label:WARNING! This game contains bugs, crashes, missing/incorrect tool tips, repetitive gameplay, extreme micromanagement, a somewhat significant RNG element to combat, the desire to see you suffer if you don't you abuse quick save or if you play on Ironman, a decisive and unavoidable ""end"" (which is somewhat to extremely unsatisfying), little actual replay value, boring loot, extremely repetitive enemies, negative outcomes for events you didn't even know existed/had a time limit on, and other, smaller problems/annoyances.Okay, so, you just read that warning and you're like, ""But you're still recommending the game? Did you hit the wrong button?"" And the answer is, no, I didn't hit the wrong button. Yes, I am still recommending the game. Why? It's actually really simple: this is the most complete zombie survival game I've ever played. By a good margin to. The only thing that even comes close to this is State of Decay (another fun game), but that had a LOT of things missing from the overall experience that this does NOT leave out.The game is SO much more than ""Board up the windows, get food and meds, smash zombies with sticks."" You got TONS of complex and interesting survivors to rescue, each with a moderate to extremely detailed backstory, and an well written (if mostly cliche) story with a begining, middle, and end (and the story is REALLY long...expect a full playthru of this game to take 50+ hours if you're rushing, 100+ for a good playthru, and 150+ for a ""full clear). There are group dynamics to think of, food issues, morallity issues, morale issues, medical issues, supply issues, factions, gangs, hordes, psychos, pets, carnies, crises, leadership struggles, a search for a cure, a MASSIVE (and somewhat optional) in-world lore database, and so much more. If you've been looking for the ultimate zombie survival simulator, and other games have left you wanting more, left you feeling like something is missing, this is the game for you.There are issues (listed above). Many of said issues can be fixed by reading the (mediocre but not awful) official wiki or Steam guides (there are like 3 of them worth a damn, the other 5 or so are garbage), and occasionally searching in the Steam or official forums. But the big one (IMO), which is the repetitive gameplay with weak instant gratification. If that doesn't bother you (like it doesn't bother me), and you're not quite sick of zombies (which I'll never be), this just might be the game for you. If you've been looking for the ultimate zombie survival sim, this IS the game for you.So yeah, give it a whirl. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.			"

												I'm guessing the game got good reviews based on the genre and not the actual game.  As a fan that has been watching and looking forward to the development and release, only to be utterly disappointed.  The writing has the elequence and style of a 15 year old boy (although that is debatable as I think the average teenager might have been able to come up with better writing).  The game touts the decisions you make affecting he outcome of the game.  What that really means is that the dialogue comes to a grinding halt until you figure out what the character needs,  The controls are clunky, I would say the original X-COM has a better interface and flow.  I knew that the game would have graphics on par with what you'd find 15-20 years ago, but that being said I kept an open mind as there are great games that don't necessarily have modern graphics.  Sadly this is not one of them.  I'm a super fan of the zombie genre and would recommend either Left for Dead game or Dead Island would be money better spent,  What I expected was a game on par with say the new X-COM Enemy Unseen or at least close to that level of production and what I got was a 1996 classic, that would have been great 20 years ago, but has as much appeal to me as firing up the old adventure game on the atari 2600.

Early Access Review
								Dead in the water. ( An early access review of Dead State(2nd attempt)) by Merit Coba.Imagine you are in a restaurant downtown and you are invited by the waiter to come over to the kitchen to help the cook select the ingredients for your dinner, tell him how much you want and describe how to cook it.  You then return to your table. When the waiter arrives with three plates, he puts one plate down and then tosses the contents of the plates on top of the others. What do you get?On the 31st of October a release date was announced for Dead State: the 4th of December.This means that the game must by now, writing early November, be in a state to be sold after some minor tweaking and polishing.Is that the case? Now on the upside this game has many things to commend it.For one is that they made your character's improvement part of a goal system instead of  the usual experience system. Next to that you can kind of improve you other party members by assigning them jobs and at times influence their progress through dialogs. Also commendable is the way they give the game a kind of flow. At the start even a single zombie is a challenge for your group, let alone a group of them, but after a while zombies are no longer a danger but hostile people, those with guns and armor.  Another great idea is how the zombies can kill your party members and enemy humans and make them zombies to. One of the craziest encounters is  when your party runs into a shootout between two gangs while zombies attack from all sides.At the core there are good ideas but this game is far from finished and beset with many issues. Here is a random list.The game lacks a general story line, it is either not there or just not finished. There is a kind of conflict brewing between the militia at one hand and the military at the other, but  when I tried to talk to either side I was told to get lost.  There were some small incidents, like the military asking me for supplies and a proclamation from the militia, but  this didn't seem to open up more dialog.Storylines are broken. An example is the one of Fiona Parks, a girl who is devoted to you. At some moment I was approached by Davis, one of the survivors, telling me how sorry he was about what Fiona did. I had no clue what he was talking about and Fiona was fine. This went of every morning until at one point it was announced that Fiona had killed someone. She duly got a trial(in which she supported the side that demanded her death), then a minute later she was reported to have killed again, was put on trial again and banned. Since then the Davis conversation happens every morning. (At least it makes sense now.)Most zombies don't roam but just stand around so you can take them out one at a time, mostly by attacking them from behind.Groups of zombies or people stop being a danger because you can kill them one at a time by bashing on a locked door that is out of their view, which will then draw in your enemies one at a time(and the door will be restored to full points when you reload a saved game, so you can repeat this until all the enemies have been taken care of). That way you can gang up on one of them and thus take down stronger enemies that would normally wipe your party out.(One tip: give Vic a shotgun. And if you can get the combat shotgun he becomes an unstoppable force. In fact after a while you are pretty invulnerable.)Unfinished maps, empty maps, maps that don't work, doors that don't work properly, invisible barriers, barriers that you can walk through(the Coleman side entry).  Dogs can only be attacked from the front and the back and sometimes not be shot at. Fifth party members showing up unexpectedly. The chicken and egg issue: to build your chickencoop you need to find a chicken, when you do it gets slaughtered when you take it home because you don't have a chickencoop. Some quests are broken(Aggro asks you to get Alan, but he never shows).There is a quest for swapping food for medicines, but you can't get food from your storage, although you can fish for fish. I did so and took the fish with me to this deal. Then the deal was made, but no exchange happened yet I got a message that the deal went really well.The game doesn't keep a record of the locations that you already visited agains the locations that other survivors tell you about, so you get a message that they marked a  new location on your map, but nothing shows because you already discovered it.When fully upgraded the fence can't be repaired(unless it is completely destroyed I guess).Some upgrades on your shelter are described not to function. Some items have no icons. The storage of your shelter is bugged for sometimes the tabs won't work. This seems to effect mostly the ammunition tab and this might have something to do with creating ammoThe radio you can create to assign jobs doesn't work.Ammo you can create yourself and it only costs you a one time price to give you access to an unlimited supply of them. So in the end you can just bang away as ammo isn't an issue(this might by intendend)On and on goes the list of issues. I was amazed about all these issues for people seem to think well of this game, so I checked the game agains steam several times and even have reinstalled it from scratch. I even tried to see I could download a recent upgrade from the double bear website, but they just point me to steam. Maybe steam is hosting a old game or  perhaps what I describe is the current state of the game.I suspect the latter as I see in the forums many of the issues being mentioned.Maybe the game is remarkably patched by the time it gets released but based on what I experienced above and based on the price I still give it a thumbs down.No doubt someone is going to say that what I say is not true, so what I would suggest is that you just look around on the forums that talk about this game and, if it is available, download a demo.I hope that the game developers finish the game properly.. it certainly has it's merits.I have another review here which shows pictures so you have also visible proof of what I am saying.http://meritcoba.com/2014/11/15/a-game-review-dead-statea-tale-of-errors-a-chicken-a-murderess-and-a-ghost-and-lots-of-zombies-too/Log:22 November: added a header.. corrected some writing mistakes.

												Please read this before you buy the game.This game is bored, I have tried be patient to read every single word during the game but it gottoo little resources to be scavenging, required much materials & skills to build new building.We can switch between our main character with other NPC at other places except at our base, so whatever unique resources (such as coffee bean, chilly source) or weapon that we put on other NPC, it will be unavailable at our store at base therfore we MUST think 200% before decide which NPC to carry stuffs.We have medic trainee at base but she is useless because if you get hurt badly during battle, you will not recover your HP to 100% in next day. So why waste food to feed her? Bear in mind: No medication or bandage or food to recover your HP in this game, not like Dead Age or other RPG survival games. Can't imaging if we select the hardcore level... wahaha...			"

												Bought the game on sale because I thought it would be great. At first the game would not start. Finally, after doing alot of editing and such it worked. Graphics are choppy on high end system, so i turned down the graphics and it got worse. In fact it was completely unplayable. Refund button does not seem affected by this.			"

												:Dso.... i was actually banned from the forums for my super negative review of this game during beta... so... disregard every single other review. mine is the only one that matters. this game... is.... ♥♥♥♥ing... zong. i liked it. it took forever for the devs to make it, and it still has some issues with crashing... but if you want a zed survival game, this is the best youre gonna get. you have to feed your entire base, you have to keep them happy with toilet paper and all that jazz, you have to squash your enemies with you tactical awareness.for the stupid people, you know, the ♥♥♥♥ers who failed highschool and all that sharting nonsense.... this game will suck. your survival in this game is directly linked to your IQ. if you are stupid, youre gonna die. miserably. either your own people will kill you, or youll die in combat. for the rest of the world? merry bloody tradalmes, because this game satisfies everything you so desperately crave that only occurs during the apocalypse.the women will worship you if you survive long enough, the USA military will bow down and swear fealty or be squashed by your might, and all those racist prats will beg for mercy when you take control of the only fuel source. this game has everything youd expect to happen during zed apocalypse: criminal factions, MLK factions, Military factions... fighting for food, guns, and toilet paper(id rather wipe my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the faces of the dead, but thats just me...). the leveling up system is very goal oriented, dont expect to gain 10xp per kill in this game, this is 100% about keeping everyone alive and well fed.i laugh reading the negative comments: omg davis just shot me because i was negative yada yada yada... you obviously suck at survivng the apocalypse. i have a morale of something like 10k, ive never had a negative day... im just smarter than you though, so dont worry. ur bad, im gerd. ive been with doublebear since the absolute beginning. ive had my ups and downs with this game. i wrote an absolute SCATHING review for this game during beta, ripped them a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,... but they listened to me, and fixed the problems i addressed. their end product isnt quite finished, but its still good. they have about another 6 months to finish this game, imho, but in its current form id say it was quite good.

												I would not pay $5.00 for this game. Though the graphics are decent and the survival element is there the combat system is horrid to say the least. A choke point between a door? Well lets just say during the (Action/combat) sequence people cannot move out of the way of eachother to get around to the other side to join in combat. Small but with always and I mean always a situation as soon as you dwelve into a new compound. At the start of the game I ordered a police office to shoot his weapon at the zombie approx 2 blocks to his left. I know that a person was between him and the zombie but surely as the zombie literally being 5 feet away and the person 1 foot away the office could aim... Headshot... to my party... Well I knew then that I could'nt recommend this. If say the party was fighting a zombie 50 feet away then he should have a chance to inflict accidental friendly fire but 5 feet away? I think not... SO that makes all ranged weapons very useless as the move action and turn based strategy persists. With movement being clunky and not at all fluid how can You properly raid a building? That is a game breaker. When the most basic mechanic is not instilled in a turn base ""stratagy game"" I sincerely can not possibly recommend this game.Josh			"

Early Access Review
I want everyone to know right here and now that DoubleBear has been exhibiting some very inappropriate business practices, in my opinion. This review is to tell the community of those practices, as well as reviewing the game itself. People, you are basically being lied to by DoubleBear.Before you write a response to my review, please be sure to read my entire review first. I understand if you only want to skim it, and that's fine, but please try not to make an argument until you DO fully read the whole thing. I'd like to not repeat myself, but I do understand that I will be writing a lot and it's hard to read it all. I want to inform all of you that I will not only be reviewing this game, but also the business practices of the developers, DoubleBear. There is some very inappropriate behavior going on on their end and I want the community to know about it. I'm going to tell everyone about it very calmly, and very fairly, but I'm going to be 100% brutally honest. I want the community to know, because they have a right to, and I will be very appropriate about it so there will be no reason to accuse me of being abusive, rude, or anything of the sort. I want to make that very clear.As a disclaimer: If I edit this review, I will always leave everything I originally wrote in this review. I am the sort of person who will admit their mistakes, (unless it's a typo, I'll fix typos without telling you I did that, I mean come on) and who doesn't like to change what was originally there. I will always tell you whatever I am editing (again, unless it's a typo), so that way the integrity of this, and myself, is never compromised.First of all, I want to say that this is a pretty good game. I don't prefer turn-based games, but for a turn-based game, it's not bad at all. A little bit basic, there doesn't feel like there's much meat to it, and maybe that's just because I'm so used to my games having voice acting in them or something, I'm not sure. It's true that it's only essentially a Beta version of a demo, so of course it's not that developed - and I understand that, that makes sense. But that is all you are currently purchasing. A demo. This is not an Early-Access game. It is the first 7 days of the game, and you will never get any more days until the full game is released. That is one of my main problems with this game. You are, essentially, being lied to by the developers. It used to be they had the word ""demo"" plastered everywhere, all over their game summaries and descriptions and even in the early-access disclaimer thing. Now, you can't find the word ""demo"" anywhere, and on top of that, the limit of them informing you what you are actually purchasing for $25 are only these two sentences:""Dead State is currently in Early Access - purchasing now will eventually unlock the full game for you at final release, and in the meantime you can playtest the first seven days of the game (ongoing feature updates are planned).""and""Dead State: The First Seven Days is an early, WIP preview of the first week of Dead State's gameplay - an opportunity to prepare your strategy for the full game and help us test and polish the full Dead State experience.""To the layman? Who only skims the description because, let's be honest, a good majority of people? Only skim. This looks like it is saying ""For now you get the first 7 days, but maybe as we go along until release, we'll be releasing more days."" -- Because that is what Early-Access is, or at the very least is supposed to be -- that is what the majority of gamers on the planet AGREE Early-Access means.People, I want to be very clear: When you purchase this game, right now. When you click that green button, go to your cart, and click the green 'purchase for myself' button, you are spending $25 on a 7-day demo of this game. The most that will happen to that demo is small updates to it, like new items, the battle system itself vaguely changing, and maybe some text changing. You will never, ever, ever get past those first 7 days of gameplay. Not until the full game releases. That is a fact. That is a completely indisputable fact.****I have a lot more to add on here, but I can not fit it all on this review page. Please, please, please click the link to Gamespot at the bottom of this review and read the whole thing, at the very least do so before commenting on my review.****Now, to my actual gameplay review:The game is alright. I know it seems like I couldn't have played enough for very long, but believe me, I got enough time to play that I know exactly what the game is about and how it works.In all honesty? It's kind of like a Zombie Apocalypse version of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. There are some tweaks here or there, obviously, but generally speaking it's very similar. If you're not careful, you could end up inadvertently shoving a character in the middle of like 8 zombies at once, and though that's a true danger in most zombie apocalypse worlds, I have a hard time believing my other characters would take about 8 turns before saving him. That was literally the first thing that happened to me when I went into the game. I literally quit and started over again because the game gave me absolutely NO warning that something like that could happen.Now, maybe it's just me, and maybe it's just because it's been a really long time since I played a turn-based game last, but when I played this game, I got absolutely NO instruction on how to play, whatsoever. And again, maybe it's just because I'm a moron -- I definitely can be, from time to time. But when I first played, I had no idea what was better - was the knife better? Or was the bat better? I had no idea, because I had no idea what the difference (in this game) piercing damage was in comparison to blunt damage. I mean of course most people assume piercing damage DOES more damage, but honestly some basic gamers may not know that, and they're not very clear about it.On top of that, I had absolutely no idea that, when I started, the zombies were all gonna get 2 fighting turns in a row and I was only going to get 1. I also didn't know that even if the screen was clear, they could still appear later, around corners and the like - again, I know that SHOULD be generally common sense, but I've been spoiled by all of the other open-world games out there, and I'm used to a goblin being around a corner before I even get around that corner. I've played so many various games that I NEED to be told the rules in a game like this, I can't just predict them, because I've just played so many other games with so many other rules.Also, for the record, the graphics are pretty bleh. Even for an early version of the game. I mean it's 2014, we expect quite a bit more out of games these days, even top-down turn-based ones.EDIT: THIS IS NOT MY FULL REVIEW. This is only PART of my review. Unfortunately, my full Review cannot fit on this page - so, for the moment, this is all I can give you - I've managed to cut this review down quite a bit, and now you can find the very, very basics in THIS review. However, there is a LOT more that needs to be covered, and it IS covered at the website I have listed at the end of my review.But for now, please read this review with a grain of salt, as it needs some editing and it is not my full review.Please go to the below website to read my full review before commenting below. If you comment below after only reading the very little tidbits I've written above, I will know. You are absolutely welcome to post without reading my full review, but know that I won't be able to take you entirely seriously if you do something like that.EDIT: For now, please read my full review here: http://www.gamespot.com/dead-state/forums/dead-state-review-31359805/?wikiTypeId=5000&wikiId=97268 "

If developers dont pull their socks up. This sort of thing will be a thing of the past. people pay good money for a game that you describedin great detail. and yet what you gave us was a complete pile of sh!t. Finish the game before you call it finished and release it. or people will stop backing you guys.. and all the other moronson here that seem to think this early access is a way to get free money.. Shape up or never get funding for futire projects as no one will trust a word you say. and wont risk wasting more of our money on your poor excuse for a game.			"

												A banana is an edible fruit, botanically a berry,[1][2] produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.[3] (In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called plantains.) The fruit is variable in size, color and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible parthenocarpic (seedless) bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata × M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution. The old scientific name Musa sapientum is no longer used.Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia, and are likely to have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea.[4][5] They are grown in at least 107 countries,[6] primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make fiber, banana wine and banana beer and as ornamental plants.

								This is a review of the first 10 seconds of the game.  During character creation, the default sex for characters is female, which is rapidly becoming a pet peeve of mine.  I'm all for progress and the inclusion of women (and any other demographic that so desires) in games, but ""ladies first"" is hardly inclusive or progressive.  Putting men first here, while also unfair, is at least traditional -- like ""ladies and gentlemen.""  Do the devs expect that most players will be female?  Or perhaps that most characters will be?The rest of the game may be really good, but I've stopped supporting developers who are so eager to be seen not to be unfair to women that they never consider that it's possible to be unfair to men.  I'm putting this up for people like me.			"

								New reviewOk so after playing a little more, I would really like to make another review since I think I WAS REALLY UNFAIR AND UNJUST IN THE LAST ONE. I saw some comments that I didn't appreciated especially from developpers trying to feedback their game.Alright from 0 to 10 my past review was 0. In this review (After update of the game) from 0 to 10 the new ground braking score is -10!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!Now why -10?! I was a little harsh in the last one but now I will try to sound more ""professional"" if you wanna call it like that.1 Guns don't work! Even if you have ammo and you try to reload them, they still don't work!!2 Bandits get stuck!! They keep switching between weapons and the turn never ends                       A. This last point it's fantastic since the save/load button does not work, therefore the game does not save!! YOU CANNOT SAVE!!!3 The game save button STILL DOESN'T WORK4 Loading screen freezes in certain areas like the one rappresented as a office bag5 Some doors cannot be broken/unlocked (specially the one in the food store)6 Characters will start to bleed for no reason (in the middle of a fight)7 DID I MENTIONED THAT THE SAVE BUTTON DOES NOT WORK FOR ♥♥♥♥ SAKE!!8 Terribly boring game, with horribly boring gameplay and story!! This should be played before going to SLEEP (if you can't fall asleep of course)9 Like X COM?? No!!! No!!! No!! You will have to remake a new engine to make it a quarter like x com, this is nothing like it!

												A bit of an half finished feel. It falls a bit short of being great and settles on being good and fun enough. It does survival well enough but the game play always feels like it's lacking something. Like there is no sneaking and the story line feels a bit thin on choices.Still, if you are a survival game fan this is a good buy. Especially if you can find it on sale for less then 20 USD. This is not a game you will finish in one evening.			"

												I had a bunch of fun playing dead state.  The decisions you make really impact your team's dynamic.  I never really had trouble finding supplies or building my base quickly.  Perhaps I had lucky roles, but I didn't find it nearly as challengingas XCOM or others in the genre.  A solid game with mixed great mix of intuitive mechanics, goal oriented progression, choices that impact your experience, and exploration/survival.11/10 - would double tap again			"

												I really enjoyed this game. Over 130 hours in, and my base is fully upgraded and I'm going out on scavenging runs and bringing back loot like the best of them. Starting is really difficult, as the post-apocalyptic world is (and should be) harsh. However, once you're established, it's fun going out there and bashing in human and zombie heads.+ Nice soundtrack+ Fun progression+ Sense of achievement + Lots of characters+ Lots of locations- A bit buggy- Characters (like in real life) can be really whiney- Far too small inventory limit. Why can't you craft bags/carts etc?- Guns are useless as you get swarmed by the entire mapDefinitely worth the money if you invest the time into it.			"

However since the ""reanimated"" update i had to edit my first review. the update introdued a ton of bugs that i simply shake my head at. such as placing pills in a full med bag used to swap out the bandages. now it swaps out the whole bag and when you try to drop the pills back in your inventory....crash..... The reanimated update also brought a lot of basic animation bugs. such as when you click to heal someone you end up with 2 surviors on one tile even after healing is done. oh and don't let me forget about the staircase you have to save and reload everytime you go up and down it. which can be quite a few times. basicly it took me 86 hours in the first play through, and i really enjoyed the game. After Reanimated patch i can't stand to play more then 10 minutes at a time.			"

												""When the final modern human closes his eyes for the last time, a profound sadness and sense of loss will flash before them, and they will feel around their back for the weapon that did them in and remove a dagger made of apathy.""To be brief, Dead State is an indie game that delivers a human narrative in the face of a world shattering disaster.  You play one of the few remaining souls willing to attempt to hold things together by running a shelter.  The primary goal as a player is to manage resources, over all morale and moods of individual survivors.  These three facets are mostly achieved by exploring the areas outside of the shelter to retrieve everything from antibiotics to toothpaste.  This task will frequently involve dealing with the less threatening slow moving zombies but the larger threat is from looters and other hostile groups that will shoot you for your shoes.  There are other faces outside of the shelter that will hold conversations, often these are survivors who you can offer a place to call home, but there are others about as well.This game is not a fast paced charge into hoards of the undead.  It is a cautious march forward in the direction of hope.--Reanimated Update--I can no longer recommend this game after the Reanimated update.  They've made the slow moving outdated combat even slower.  The only interesting part about the game is the character writing and how the stories between survivors evolve through the course of the game.  However, getting to these events is now a tiresome chore that sap all replay value out of the game.  According to the dev's forum posts they have no intention of changing this as they have been defeated by the difficult engine they chose to make their game with.  It's just not worth it after Reanimated.			"

												UPDATE -- 6/8/2015:I am writing this as an update to take into account the “Reanimated” version of Dead State.This is finally the version that buyers paid for, and the one that should have been released commercially.  All the bugs I mentioned or encountered have been fixed.  Additionally, the combat has been fixed.  Previously, it was just a matter of running up behind a zombie, pressing space to pause, and then one-shotting the zombie.  Rinse and repeat.  There was no real risk, and it felt fairly tedious.Now, combat starts as soon as you get close to a zombie, so that previous strategy is no longer possible.  I’m finding that change to make combat much more harrowing, much more of a risk vs. reward proposition.The scavenging can get a bit tedious, so make sure to take breaks once in awhile.  Personally, for me, it was the cutscenes every morning (and the somewhat rare group leader meetings) that has kept me going.  I do enjoy those.The Reanimated version has also added Ironman mode, Hardcore mode, and another mode where your own player character can get infected.  I did make sure to turn that last option on when I started my Reanimated playthrough.When I wrote my initial review, I wasn’t expecting a 100% perfect game, but I was expecting a playable one.  Dead State is now playable through its Reanimated version.  Dead State is a very specific type of game, and so while I wouldn’t recommend it universally, if the concept sounds appealing to you and you’re a patient individual, I would recommend a purchase of this Reanimated version.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review:I've been trying to rationalize how anyone could give Dead State a positive review, and the only thing I can think of is they're shills for the developer.  Either that or they regret wasting their money on Dead State and want others to suffer as well.I bought Dead State due to all the glowing reviews, including Lex's lengthy one.  I haven't felt this burned by a game purchase in a long, long time.  Dead State, as of its full release, is a buggy, cheap mess.  The characters are shallow, repeating the same conversation options day after day.  The combat -- such a central part of a game like this -- is crude and simplistic.  There is no cover or no crouching.  Sometimes if you hover your mouse over the ground, it will show the movement cost.  Sometimes not.  There is no option to aim with pistols, and pistols have a maximum range of literally 15 feet.  Past 15 feet, you have a 0% chance to hit.And here's the thing: I love tactical games like XCOM.  I love base-building aspects.  I love RPGs.  I love zombies.  And yet Dead State fails on all accounts.This War of Mine, a survival game just recently released, blows Dead State out of the water, and TWoM costs $20, less than Dead State.  The sheer fact that Dead State is asking for $30 is disgraceful.  There are free flash games that are better and more fulfilling, games like Rebuild or Last Stand.Graphics don't make or break a game for me -- I play rogue-like games like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup because I care more about gameplay than how a game looks.  However, Dead State is buggy and shallow AND looks atrociously bad.  I mean just absolutely horrible.Pros+ The basic theme had promiseCons- Shallow characters- Massive amount of bugs- Simplistic gameplay- Horrible 1990s UI- Weak narrative- Grating music- Poor camera angles- Ugly graphicsAnd then they slap you in the face with the $30 price.I could go on and on about more specifics, like how putting unique weapons like pepper spray or nailguns in the base inventory removes and destroys all ammo from them.  Or how morale hits rock bottom despite carting back a department store's worth of goods every day.  Or how one NPC gets angry and discusses deserting because he's not in my party enough....  and I've used him 100% of the time.  Or how you have to wait for a heavily armed camp labeled ""hostile looters"" to open fire on you before you fire back, otherwise your party members accuse you of killing innocent people.There's more.  So much more.  I cannot in good conscience recommend Dead State.  Don't waste your money on this lemon.EDIT UPDATE:  I'm trying it out after the latest patch.  I'll give credit where credit is due:  Most of the bugs, if not all of them, that I mentioned have been fixed by the developer.  I don't think I've ever seen game bugs be fixed that fast before in my entire life.  So at least the developers are on the ball as far as that goes.I've found yet more bugs since trying it out again, and it's still a crazy mess not even close to worth the asking price.  I won't say that the developers are inattentive, however.			"

												Although even the Reanimated version of the game is still plagued by scripting errors (story events repeating more than 10 times... Karen!), spelling mistakes, glitchy engine behaviour (enemies being able to spot players and hit them through locked doors) and the lack of the cure ending (even though it's heavily hinted at), I still very much enjoyed DS:R. The writing and dialogue are simply great, the story lines for other survivors are fleshed out well for the most part and the various location for scavenging have a lot of atmosphere, are believable and often tell their own little stories. Moreover, the turn-based style of play in conjunction with the usage of active perks can make combat very satisfying if planned right. The shelter gameplay does leave quite a bit to be desired, however. There's no way to view survivor perks through the task board, for instance, which makes the job of optimising morale gain somewhat tedious. The data cracking mini-game could have been a lot less annoying, too. Although I tended to crack the codes the same day I found the items, which generates a steady flow of skill points - especially if combined with daily gift giving -, I can imagine this process being extremely boring when you've neglected them for a while. On the other hand the shelter map does reflect the progression you make, since it's updated when new facilities have been built. All in all, I would definitely recommend this game, if you don't mind the turn-based isometric style, aren't bothered by micromanaging morale and tasks and can overlook some technical and design flaws. The story and dialogue more than make up for it.			"

												*** UPDATED REVIEW  05/28/2016 ***I really, really liked this game when it came out as it was exactly what I was looking for; a survival turn-based strategy game with an actual backstory, base management and character development. I bought the game while it was still early access and getting frequent updates, all was good.Then fast forward to now... and the development of the game seems to have just been abandoned altogether. There have been no updates, no bug fixes, no indication towards completion and there has been no word from the devs to the community. It's just an actual shame and I'm deeply disappointed because this is a game that I genuinely enjoyed playing.I cannot recommend this game due to the fact that it is simply unfinished and the price for the game isn't worth it for something that has been long abandoned.

I strongly recommand it if you can buy it for 10$ or less. At 20$ it is starting to be a bit expensinve for a one-shot deal.The game is long and challenging enough to keep you interested until the end. I have not encountered some dead time in it like so many games of the same genre.I recommand it just if it is around 10$ or less.			"

												There is always been a love for the classic style that indeed is the original X-Com.  Developing a squad, a team, and gradually through smart play and fighting exploring different areas and using the terrain both for and against.Dead State finds a way to combine the style of that classic game into another popular genre, the zombie apocolypse.  And it really is a brilliant game!  Not only do you have to deal with the different Survivors you can rescue, but you have to deal with their demands and your own.  Plus there's a lot of wonderful ""self character' development, in that you can choose so many little details for your own character.  And there's a wealth of ""background material"" inside the game itself that can draw you into ths world and it's history.  And the choices you make throughout the game are remembered, both the good, and the bad.  You set the course.Classic turn style with squad based tactics, just remember the living can be more dangerous.			"

												Very good turn-based tactical game. Good story and it gives the player a good amount of freedom in choices. I forbid an abortion of one of the survivors, she hates me now but will thank me later when her kid is older (hopefully)...The game has a higher difficulty than usual, you cannot pick every fight at the first days and have to eventually run away when you find yourself in a gunfight while only wielding kitchen knifes and axes... So its not meant for the masses because you might actually have casualties in battles and due to bad choices you made. During the later stages, difficulty drops as you get a hang of the game and much better weapons.Definitely worth buying.Edit: Boy, have I been wrong about that abortion... the game has some interesting plot twists for sure...

												Be warned whilst I recommend this game it isn't saying it is the best RPG I have ever played, far from. Whilst it takes the beloved RPG and introduces the zombie survival element, the fact it is the first project for DoubleBear Productions really shows and I mean REALLY shows. That said Brian Mitsoda also worked on ""Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines"" which was an exceptional game with a few rough edges as well.I had followed the games history since it was announced many years ago and hoped it would see the light of the day as the concept sounded amazing, glad that it did despite its flaws. It could have been a much better game though if produced by a more experienced studio. It is an enjoyable experience and not let down by its short comings provided you are interested in both zombies & cRPGs.Graphically it is ""meh"", you would think that the game is older than it is. That said cRPG's aren't about their graphics so how does the rest hold up?Well fairly well if a bit formulaic, for example when you are at the school (your base of operations that you upgrade over the course of the game) you can speak with your team mates. After a certain point you become aware of the limited amount of interactions. The combat itself is turnbased like XCOM but done nowhere near with the same amount of polish, it works but could have done with a bit more polish and fine tuning.Upgrading the school and crafting as well as recruiting survivors is quite fun and the events that happen are good. The overal atmosphere and storyline in the game make up for its short comings.If you have run out of good cRPG's to play and understand you are getting a lesser quality game than you are usually used to, then you won't be disapointed. If you haven't run out then get other games first like: Pillars of Eterinity, Planescape Torment, Baulders Gate Series, Divinity Original Sin, Wasteland 2, Fallout 1/2			"

												A zombie holocaust is upon us and you have to survive. That means kicking undead (and sometimes living) ♥♥♥, upgrading your hideout, and keeping everybody happy with your decisions. Despite some minor flaws (e.g. can't see other character's stats while in he shelter?), the game is truly complete and offers the full post-apocalypse experience. Radio reports, tension with the other survivors, trying to cope with the old world going down the drain... Having also living enemies (other survivors) adds a lot of realism to the game. I just wish I had tried it before. Hats off to the developers!			"

However, getting to these events is now a tiresome chore that sap all replay value out of the game.  According to the dev's forum posts they have no intention of changing this as they have been defeated by the difficult engine they chose to make their game with.  It's just not worth it after Reanimated.			"

												UPDATE -- 6/8/2015:I am writing this as an update to take into account the “Reanimated” version of Dead State.This is finally the version that buyers paid for, and the one that should have been released commercially.  All the bugs I mentioned or encountered have been fixed.  Additionally, the combat has been fixed.  Previously, it was just a matter of running up behind a zombie, pressing space to pause, and then one-shotting the zombie.  Rinse and repeat.  There was no real risk, and it felt fairly tedious.Now, combat starts as soon as you get close to a zombie, so that previous strategy is no longer possible.  I’m finding that change to make combat much more harrowing, much more of a risk vs. reward proposition.The scavenging can get a bit tedious, so make sure to take breaks once in awhile.  Personally, for me, it was the cutscenes every morning (and the somewhat rare group leader meetings) that has kept me going.  I do enjoy those.The Reanimated version has also added Ironman mode, Hardcore mode, and another mode where your own player character can get infected.  I did make sure to turn that last option on when I started my Reanimated playthrough.When I wrote my initial review, I wasn’t expecting a 100% perfect game, but I was expecting a playable one.  Dead State is now playable through its Reanimated version.  Dead State is a very specific type of game, and so while I wouldn’t recommend it universally, if the concept sounds appealing to you and you’re a patient individual, I would recommend a purchase of this Reanimated version.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review:I've been trying to rationalize how anyone could give Dead State a positive review, and the only thing I can think of is they're shills for the developer.  Either that or they regret wasting their money on Dead State and want others to suffer as well.I bought Dead State due to all the glowing reviews, including Lex's lengthy one.  I haven't felt this burned by a game purchase in a long, long time.  Dead State, as of its full release, is a buggy, cheap mess.  The characters are shallow, repeating the same conversation options day after day.  The combat -- such a central part of a game like this -- is crude and simplistic.  There is no cover or no crouching.  Sometimes if you hover your mouse over the ground, it will show the movement cost.  Sometimes not.  There is no option to aim with pistols, and pistols have a maximum range of literally 15 feet.  Past 15 feet, you have a 0% chance to hit.And here's the thing: I love tactical games like XCOM.  I love base-building aspects.  I love RPGs.  I love zombies.  And yet Dead State fails on all accounts.This War of Mine, a survival game just recently released, blows Dead State out of the water, and TWoM costs $20, less than Dead State.  The sheer fact that Dead State is asking for $30 is disgraceful.  There are free flash games that are better and more fulfilling, games like Rebuild or Last Stand.Graphics don't make or break a game for me -- I play rogue-like games like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup because I care more about gameplay than how a game looks.  However, Dead State is buggy and shallow AND looks atrociously bad.  I mean just absolutely horrible.Pros+ The basic theme had promiseCons- Shallow characters- Massive amount of bugs- Simplistic gameplay- Horrible 1990s UI- Weak narrative- Grating music- Poor camera angles- Ugly graphicsAnd then they slap you in the face with the $30 price.I could go on and on about more specifics, like how putting unique weapons like pepper spray or nailguns in the base inventory removes and destroys all ammo from them.  Or how morale hits rock bottom despite carting back a department store's worth of goods every day.  Or how one NPC gets angry and discusses deserting because he's not in my party enough....  and I've used him 100% of the time.  Or how you have to wait for a heavily armed camp labeled ""hostile looters"" to open fire on you before you fire back, otherwise your party members accuse you of killing innocent people.There's more.  So much more.  I cannot in good conscience recommend Dead State.  Don't waste your money on this lemon.EDIT UPDATE:  I'm trying it out after the latest patch.  I'll give credit where credit is due:  Most of the bugs, if not all of them, that I mentioned have been fixed by the developer.  I don't think I've ever seen game bugs be fixed that fast before in my entire life.  So at least the developers are on the ball as far as that goes.I've found yet more bugs since trying it out again, and it's still a crazy mess not even close to worth the asking price.  I won't say that the developers are inattentive, however.			"

												I can happily recommend this game. Release hit expectations almost perfectly and can truly say I've had much pleasure playing this.Wonderful for a Strategy Zombie Survival.I'll certainly be paying close attention the DoubleBear for any games that make if all reach this level.----- Original Review -----I love this idea this game shows. Truely love it. I could spend so much time playing this game that I'd become a zombieHowever, the state the game is in, it isn't playable.I've followed this game for many months and when I could get my hands on it, I thought why not?Right now, it's just another list item in my steam library.Don't buy this until release date. Not early access.This game has VERY high goals, and they can be reached by DoubleBear.I'll edit this when I believe the game is in a better place.			"

												This game has a good concept and interesting gameplay which is not too linear. It's challenging and somewhat realistic. But it has a downside too. It crashes all the time.. Lets say you are on Ironman mode (save only once a day) and you use all your skills to beat a scenario and it took you forever. Then you return home and just when you return the game crashes. Then you reload and you have to do it all over again. Just happend to me. It's so frustrating. The game crashes about every other level randomly.			"

												Right out of the gate when I tried to set my graphics level it crashed to desktop. Playing the game is clunky. I dont know how else to describe it. Its just not intuitive. There is no way that I could find to map controls and to see the controls it constantly reminds you to check the manual in the install directory. There is no way to see what commands are in game. And I just could not get trades between characters to work in the field. Even though it says to right click on the character that did nothing.This game charges 19.99 and I cant justify that cost. I mean this isnt just indie its amatuer. I suppose if I spent several hours fighting the controls and alt tabbing to look back in the manual then I could figure it out. But hey only a two return window. I just dont have time for that.Cool idea just poor execution.			"

												I had hopes for this game when it was in Early Access but it wasn't finished enought then they decided it was but it was so unfinished they came out with reanimated wich is still basically unfinished as all the characters are basically card board cut outs and they changed some of the gameplay for the worse for me personally the game is very repetetive and boring having almost everything done and just waiting for the end date to come			"
