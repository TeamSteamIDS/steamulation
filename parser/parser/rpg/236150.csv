Early Access Review
								First Impressions:For an early access game this game is already really playable as the sandbox mode works just fine. See this game as EVE offline. You fly your own ship (which you can upgrade or just buy a bigger one) around a HUGE universe that has highway like wormholes and natural wormholes. You can also move around anywhere under your own power so just traveling on highways or through wormholes isn't a must. There are hints of fleets in thwere but haven't been able to start one, although you can already by extra ships and leave them in your garage.Your Ship:Upgrades for your ships are plenty and the weapon systems include, lasers, plasma cannons, railguns, missiles, and much more which you can freely add to any supporting hardpoint on your ship (light for guns, heavy for ammo consuming launchers). All upgrades and repairs happen on the station and I've noticed you really need to shop around the stations to get the best stuff.Your Crew:Yes, this game has crews as even your starting ship is more then the usual fighters you get in other games. There are 3 shipstations which you can hire crew for. The crew gives you boosts on weapons or ship systems like engines, shields and cloaks depending on their skills. Again every station/planet offers different crews with different skills.Gameplay:Random missions are generated all the time wich includes simple ""go there and shoot.."" missions, scan anomalies and bringing around cargo and passengers. You can visit many many stations (and planets) to upgrade, repair, hire crew, trade and lots more. The universe is very much alive as you encounter friendly and non friendly ships all over the place. Some sectors and stations really don't like you and can form a real challange when fighting in those sectors (enemy reinforcemants and stations blasting you). Fighting is mouse controlled, aim and shoot your light weapons by clicking the right mouse button and fire your heavy ammo consuming weapons with X. Also you can give the command ""Fire at will"" which will basically unleash all weapons on all in range enemies (this can be very much fun to watch while you just fly around avoiding damage with guns blazing).Trade is already present in the game but is still in it's first stages so you get very little info on prices except for a news scroller that is viewable on every planet and station.Development:Patches are rolling out in a steady pace and the devs are very active on the forums (Post a question, suggestion or comment and you'll likely get a reply within the hour). This just gives you extra confidence to buy this game in early access and help in it's development.Current Verdict July 18 2014:Highly recommended early access game that is only getting better with each update.*My above opinion still hasen't changed, latest update is again full of content. Recommend to pick up on current sale :)Current Verdict September 16 2014:Latest patches have added full controller support for fans of those things. Also the game is nearly complete as release is almost here, they've been busy with optimizing the game and adding final features, complete campaign/story mode is not finished yet but devs have indicated it's coming soon! (And in the past they've proven time and time again that they uphold their word!).So still a big fat recommend from me at this final stage of early access.			"

												This was the game I wanted when I wanted to be a space captain/pirate.  There are ships.  The ships come in different sizes and configurations.  You start in a tin can with a couple of turrets and work your way up to space battleships.  Some of them can be challenging to get your hands on, if a faction you've ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off is the only one that makes it.  There are different weapon systems, each with strengths and weaknesses.  There can be a story/plot if you want it to be the driving reason behind your space-captaining/piracy.  The game punishes you for thinking you are a main character with plot armor and can charge at whatever your quest is without strategy.  It rewards you for doing a bit of grinding on the side for money and xp, be that with asteroid mining, quasi-legal trading, playing space police, or space piracy.Being a space game, there are a lot of different controls and interface options.  There are less than other space games I've tried.  Navigation is relatively simple, and wormholes, ion storms and radiation clouds make that more interesting than the vastness of space probably is.  You need captain 'levels' to fly bigger ships, but xp can be earned from basically doing anything.  Aiming is done via turrets.  Pick a view mode you like, aim the turrets yourself or let the computer do it for you, find a ship you like, and fly around space.  That's what you're here for right?It took me 40 to 50 hours to finish each story line, taking my time and taking advantage of the vast numbers of pirates just waiting to be boarded and salvaged.  Ultimately this was the first 3d space game I've tried that gave me some complexity while still making 'fly a ship through space' enjoyably easy.  I enjoy leveling, working my way up from the bottom and becoming an unstoppable juggernaut.  I enjoy flying a ship through space and shooting things with lasers, or guns, or plasma cannons.  I enjoy some odd challenges and impossible odds.  I enjoy exploring.  I felt accomplished when I finished the plot in my decked out dreadnought.  I enjoyed this game.  And the free DLC.Spaaaaaaaaace.  What's your favorite thing about space? (mine's space)			"

												TL;DR: At the verrry bottom, ya heathens!This game, wow. It is eating away at my soul here. Like I need to sacrifice another small vessel for creds so I can sleep again.I bought this game cause I had a gut feeling it was what I needed in a game right now. Yeah sure there are others like it, but I just wanted singleplayer and something really solid and fun. An man was I in for a treat! I had no idea I could enjoy a game so much again, like back in the day with all the old systems around and gramps was trying to figure out why the TV is calling him. So far the story has been very engaging with some smug and unsavory characters, not to mention a bunch of stuff to do on the way. Clearing asteroid fields for some spare loot to fill that cargo hold, capturing enemy ships to either sell or dock for your own collection. Beaming aboard your crew to steal stuff for you on a old mining field or enemy ship in battle to turn the tide an steal it for yourself, you will have to tractor beam it the whole way at impulse speeds to the nearest planet or station of course, who wants to do anything the easy way any way? Psssh.You have your classic worm holes you can use to travel or them good ole relays for cash, but who wants to waste money?Also you will run into random slipstreams in which you can use to traverse.. well the verse, by steering your ship properly through it. Be warned about worm holes though you can loose people, but don't worry you can get more red shirts at the nearest docking bay :D.Even combat is savvy. Tell your people to fire at will, take the helm do it yourself or root all power to engines as the words of Firefly's Jane ""Let's Moon'm"" cascades from your lips like lavander and oats. Be a commander, be THE commander. Hire merc ships to roll in your space posse, have a fleet of some bad to the bone misunderstood ship captains looking for redemption and love among the stars. You can of course also customize your ships colors and a few decals, but the real bread n' butter is the all the parts you can fit the ships with. An there is a lot of parts ranging from pulsar cannons to rail guns.You are not constrained in anyway wanna be that scruffy looking nerf herder? You can! Got that Serenity Smuggling Fever? This game has the cure my friend! Wanna travel across space corralling convicts like Cowboy Bebop? See you space cowboy, I'll be chilling with Jet. Wanna make enemies of a gang Outlaw Star Style? Look no further time to pop that space cherry Gene Starwind! Need to feel like you're back in Star Fleet Academy with Kirk? Picard? Riker? Janeway? Tuvok? Classes start as soon as you hit the buy button cadet! An tell Neelix I sent ya ;D.What is also great is that the devs have been very responsive and helpful working with the community to solve issues, active devs have really made this product shine and continues to better. I do hope you get the game and enjoy as much as I am.In my conclusion yes I recommend this amazing game, I have spent the last few years just really yearning for something, but sure what exactly. When I saw this I knew my sacrifice to the Game Satan had finally been heard. The graphics are solid and just breathtaking, the gameplay is as smooth as Bruce Willis's bald spot in The 5th Element. An steam workshop also? All I can say is beam me up Scotty, we can do it Captain this time we have the power.TL;DR: Game good. Combat fun. RPG Loot Funsies. Space much of. Do lots o' stuff. Very shiny graphs. Much impressed. You should buy it too.			"

Early Access Review
								So, you've played Freelancer, Wing Commander or Privateer. Its been years since these games were released and perhaps, for you, just like me, they left behind a massive void. I've leapt at EVERY space sim/rpg that been released in the hopes, that one day, they'll replace what I lost with Freelancer. Sadly they never did. So I saw this on the front page of Steam and thought, heres another disapointment. Well Starpoint Gemini 2...blew me away. This game is THE best space sim I've ever played and its in beta!! Beta will always be beta, that said, this game is solid. When you read the description and see theres only a dozen planets, don't be fooled. The galaxy is ♥♥♥♥ing huge. Absolutely enormous. Open world to boot. No loading screens. Just you, your ship and the stars. There are some absolutely amazing locations, zipping through asteroids, cruising the nebulas...its awesome. Theres a diverse choice of ships for you to cruise the stars with. Gunships, Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, Battleships, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Freighters and freightliners. Each ship category has multiple choices and each of those choices allows you to build your ship in the fashion you want. Do you want a ship decked with heavy batteries, rain missiles and torpedos down on people. Do you want a majority of light batterries, decking your ship with railguns, beams or plasma cannons? Perhaps a ship that can deploy a large number of soldiers to board the enemy ship and take it over. Yea, you read that right. You can board an enemy ship, take it over and either destroy, loot it or sell it.Perhaps the trade life is for you, with a vast hold and fast engines to shoot you away from the pesky gunships. Trade hasn't been completely implemented atm. In Freelancer if you remember, you could see what planets were buying what for what price etc etc. That hasn't been implemented yet so you have to find them yourself. Perhaps your a miner at heart and want to reap the profits from those floating rocks. Go right ahead, blast away. If you want a huge yield you can buy missiles especially dedicated to obtaining larger yields. You can tailor your ship to fulfil what ever role you require. If you need more energy to fire you weapons, buy system attachments and upgrades to improve their energy reserves and recharge rates. Missing that little gunship too much, you can increase their accuracy or their damage against their shields. You can hack the enermy ship and disable their systems if thats the approach you like. You choose a career role. Each role has various abiliies for use that augment your fleet, turrets, shields, movement and various other cool things. Yea, thats right. You can build your own fleet to travel around the galaxy with you. Sounds perfect for a bounty hunter right? Your going to need it to tackle the toughest bounties in the galaxy. You track the bounties yourself and take them down. Be warned though, they aren't alone and they're prepared to fight. Seriously guys, I can't praise this game enough for what its doing. Yea, theres only free roam available atm but you can do WHAT EVER you want. Want to be a pirate, theres a huge array of choices for you and they're everywhere. You want to own your own carrier and deploy fighter wings, YOU ♥♥♥♥ING CAN!!! THIS GAME IS IN BETA and despite that, you can do soo damn much. I've crashed twice and that was in the first 2 hrs, since then, I haven't had a single problem. The galaxy is yours for that taking atm. I highly reccomend this game to all Freelancer, Privateer and Wing Commander fanatics. Even to those who are new to the scene. This game is so diverse and intricate in all its details...but god damn its so easy and simple to understand and master.This game is in on-going development, if its this good already, I can't wait till its finished!!

												====================================== Starpoint Gemini 2	(Updated review!)======================================**Don't Forget to Nominate this Game for the Steam Awards!**LGM Games’ successful debut title, Starpoint Gemini, an RPG tactical sim set in a unique SciFi setting was released in 2010. It was a great learning experience for them and it paved the way for their next game - Starpoint Gemini 2, the sequel. It entered Steam Early Access program in September 2013, and a year later after what most would consider one of the best Early Access communities on Steam, Starpoint Gemini 2 hit the shelves on Steam in Sep 26, 2014.On a personal note, I was honored to have been with such an amazing community. Both players and the Developers worked together so well that I myself strongly believe it was the best early access game on Steam! I made many friends and I truly enjoyed the journey...====================================== Pros	+Huge dynamic game world that can be explored as a whole!+Can play the story campaign or go free roam sandbox style.+Workshop with plenty of cool mods.+A ton of ships to fly and tweak!+Combat in big ships with fleets...+Did I say Mining? Yep, you can mine asteroids...+Very well done Faction system+You can Trade with a good amount of commodities+Developer support that sets a new standard+Best Community on Steam+Awesome Replay value!+Free content updatesConsNone really. Yea, the game is THAT good :-)Neutral+/- Average voice-overs (This is a good thing to me)======================================IntroductionStarpoint Gemini 2 is an action space-sim combined with diverse RPG elements. Control various space ships, ranging from small and agile gunships to lumbering, but deadly carriers. Explore, trade, mine asteroids, and research in a star system no longer hindered by loading points. The entire Gemini star system is now one giant area thanks to the implemented streaming technology. Gain experience and upgrade your skills to change the tide of even the fiercest space battles. Complex, but easy-to-use RPG system with skills and perks to customize as you see fit. This also gives great replay value, you can literally spend many many hours just trying different styles...======================================Game-playI have played EVE online, Elite Dangerous, and lots of other games in the space genre. Out of every space game in my Steam library, this is the one that keeps me coming back for more. Deep, immersive, beautiful. It is the perfect open space sandbox game. To elaborate, yes there is a story campaign mode that will guide you through the lore of the game. It does this via story-missions, in-fact at the start of a new game you can choose to play campaign or free roam(sandbox). A great feature is that even in the campaign you can do the story missions at your own pace. There is a great many of freelance and side missions.I played the first Starpoint Gemini so I was going into this quite excited, but you don’t have to play the original in order to enjoy this sequel anyway(They made the first one playable with the free DLC Starpoint Gemini 2: Origins). It is a space game all about exploring, mining asteroids, trading, capturing, and flying multiple ships and getting lost in a massive dynamic universe. It is the kind of space game I love to get lost in for long periods of time just roaming through space and immersing myself into the game world. This game certainly provides many ways to do it, such as gearing up a ship to go on a mining run. There is so much to do in this game it can get overwhelming at times. (But in a good way)When you first launch the game, you will be introduced with tutorial tip screens. These can, of course, be ignored, but I would strongly advise that you read everyone of them. The interface can be quite complex and there is many ways you can customize the ships so no need to go in blind by turning off the Tips!. You want to survive for more than ten minutes in space for your first captain. There is another matter I would like to clear up as well, this game is not EVE Online or Elite: Dangerous. It is a unique tactical space sim with exploration and missions. Many people including the Dev's would say that it is more comparable to Freelancer in all the good ways...Mastering the ship controls is not that easy at first, because there are a number of ways to view the action. There is the turret view which allows you to swing around the ship so you can track everything around your vessel, the mounted view which puts you just above the ship, and a third person view which puts you just behind the ship. All of them have their own advantages depending on the situation you may be in and half the battle is understanding when to use which view. It takes practice to master this when the combat gets hectic and you need to start switching rapidly between them. As ships have location based shields, being aware of what is attacking (and from where) can be the difference between life and death.This game really shines at immersing you into the life of a deep space merchant, miner, pirate, or whatever you prefer! There are so many options and the awesome guys at LGM have done a great job at making every path fun and viable. There is a ton of customization to help you really fill the role you choose as well. I personally spent several hours just looking at my options the first time I leveled up. Any hardcore RPG fan will have a ton of fun just building and tweaking their character and ship into their very own ultimate space hero... Or a feared pirate. So just let your imagination run wild.I mentioned customization earlier and this game has a ton of it. You can hire staff for your ship which affects its performance: For example, you might hire a crew member who increases your propulsion speeds. You have complete control over your equipment load-out and their enhancements. You can even customize the look of your ship to some degree. All of this is generally handled when you anchor yourself to a space station or planet. While docked, in addition you can buy and sell trade goods, read news clips, access a garage which houses your ships, and more. It sounds like a lot to deal with, but between all the tutorials, which are accessible at any time for reference, and the well-designed interface, you’ll have your hands around it in a reasonable amount of time.============================================================================ConclusionStarpoint Gemini 2 is a game for space lovers made by space lovers. This is by far one of the best open space games I played and it will delight you with its gorgeous visuals. There is a true sense of adventure as you discover new areas of the star chart, with opportunity and danger lurking around every corner so you are constantly encouraged to build yourself up in terms of power, wealth, and relationships with the various factions.LGM and its great team have created an instant classic that will be around for many years....======================================			"

 SHORT SUMMARY:  Starpoint Gemini 2 is a bit shallow and a bit pricey for what it offers, but it is still enjoyable. Overall the story was okay enough to keep me going, and the combat was fun enough to make my stay in Gemini enjoyable. If you are itching for a space sim that is pretty easy to get into and doesn't require a large time commitment to win (around 24 in-game hours for me), this will scratch that itch pretty well. Otherwise, you may want to think carefully on buying this game unless it's on sale.However, the developers appear to be actively working on improvements to the game as time goes on. Some concerns raised in this article may be addressed as time goes on. Keep an eye on the updates page if you're interested in this product!---------- LONGER REVIEW:  The good: Visuals are nice, music is nice, starship aesthetics are good too, and the combat is solid. The universe feels big, and provides a pretty immersive experience of traveling through space. Said universe is also populated by various starships as well, usually around space stations and various other miscellaneous space structures. There are many different factions that like to use certain types of ships and lay claim to different areas of space, and you can easily see heated space battles taking place at faction borders. The HUD takes a little getting used to, but is pretty nice once you learn it. The game itself is a bit grindy as it uses RPG levelling mechanics to determine what ship you can pilot, but I personally didn't mind it that much since the combat was pretty fun. The not-so-good: The story is okay. The Voice Acting for the story dialogue ranges from terrible to okay. Side-story missions boil down to ""repair structure there for $$$ and XP"" or ""kill enemies here for $$$ and XP"" or ""ferry person over there for $$$ and XP"" with little fanfare. After you finish the main story, all you can do are the missions described earlier.  During the main story, certain factions and places will be purportedly destroyed or crippled, but what this actually means is that you will just pretend that the story happened while in practice the universe remains largely intact and unchanged. Certain mechanics are a bit shallow (i.e. hiring crew = looking up which dude/gal has which bonuses, click hire button). Also, while you *can* be a merchant or asteroid miner in this game, it seems to be much eaiser just to capture enemy ships and tow them back to a planet/station where you can sell them.Character progression is RPG-like, yet character skills/perks can pretty much be ignored. Your character's power is MUCH more dependent on what type of ship you are piloting and how well it is outfitted. The RPG mechanics are more akin to a gating system, where your level determines the type of ship you can pilot. For me, the entire game was a bit grindy. This was how it went down: capture/sell ships until I can afford the next weight class of ship, do missions (sometimes main storyline) so I can meet the level requirement of said ship. Repeat until I have achieved highest class of ship. ------ Long segment about what I would have liked to have seen in the game:  Multiple plotlines in the game.  The ""Escape Velocity"" series of games (plot-heavy 2D shooter space-sim) implemented this rather well; there were multiple plotlines for each main faction AND there were also a lot of side plotlines too.Examples of side-plots: testing prototype weapons for a starship arms company, or ferrying vacationing CEOs to a jungle planet for big game hunting, or helping a rockstar go on tour throughout the galaxy only to discover that he's a robot! Or picking up a random stranger and ferrying him to a planet only to discover that he's a leader of a small sect of colonists who are trying to resist pirate incursions, and he implores you to help them with their plight since the Powers That Be in the universe are far too busy (or corrupt) to deal with the pirates. I didn't just do these missions for cash, but to see the story unfolded; to see how these characters reacted to these sometimes tragic events in their lives, and how they would deal with it.I think it's good to have a big Main Storyline as the main attraction, but there's plenty of room in Gemini for smaller guys with fascinating struggles and dramas in their own lives that an aspiring starship captain can be a part of. Being able to hail and talk to other ships and planets. You don't need to have dialogue trees for every one. But it'd be nice to be able to beg for mercy from a pirate and buy him off with credits, or just say hi to random ships and planets. In this vein, they'd also have a message for when you greet them, with each faction having a different way of talking to you. Perhaps even with a random pool of different types of responses from each faction that vary in tone depending on your standing with them? This is a bit small, but I think it would help with game immersion. The ships, planets, and space stations could use more flavor text.  Though it might seem like a huge hassle to write up descriptions for every space station/planet/starship, you can build an EXTREMELY immersive narrative with these and make the game feel alive. Again, the ""Escape Velocity"" game series (mostly Escape Velocity Override and Escape Velocity Nova) used flavor texts/descriptions to great effect.Why is this station in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by hostile space? Are they revolutionaries or sympathizers with another faction, or are they just badasses? Why is this Frigate cheaper than this other one? Oh, the company that manufactures this one wanted to push out a model to get an edge over their hated rival company who was taking their sweet time with their own model. Hey, this Corvette saved an entire company from the brink of bankruptcy! This Carrier design looks like a UFO because of a revolutionary new frame that allows for rapid fighter launching while providing overlapping fields of fire from all of its turret batteries? Cool. This Dreadnought looks like a eldritch abomination because their designers desperately welded a lot of spare parts together and accidentally created a ship that could challenge all previous starship design conventions? Neat! Planets and some space stations presently have short descriptions with a little flavor text. But it doesn't help that these blurbs are only accessible via starmap. When a player is on the starmap, their first instinct is not to click ""info"" and read; they want to get somewhere quick. I think it would have been better if you saw the write-up in an unobtrusive static text box on the bottom of the screen. This provides incentive for an exploration-oriented player to land/dock on every planet/station that they find so they can see the little blurb there. These descriptions can really flesh out the factions and gives you an idea of why they exist and how they conduct themselves (i.e. how they treat citizens, local planetary economic problems, policy problems, military actions, natural disasters, etc.). Overall, more flavor text would be nice so that the universe that the player travels in would feel more alive. Also, it would be nice to have an in-game chart of which ranks correspond to player level.			"

												I have been playing SG2 since EA (with many breaks in between...) and it is one of my favorite games in a long time. I've had a hard time getting into Elite, and SC is a long way out, but SG2 has filled the void admirably. I always loved space games and the WC/Privateer/Freespace trinity is pretty much my past.PROS:++ Best community on Steam. I own a lot of games and visit nearly all the forums - but this one is the best. Devs are active, the community is friendly and helpful, and some of it is satisfyingly weird (meep...) meep. MEEP.++ It's not overly complex. Which doesn't mean it's simple or dumbed down - it just means that you can jump right in and have a great time exploring space.++ Combat sequences can be exhilarating! I've been in many skirmishes that could have gone either way, frantically deploying sinks and coming around to line turrets up to open fire. Enemies coming in at all angles and PTE disrupted...++ With just a couple of mods (skyboxes and nebulas) the game can be breathtaking visually. I play with the lights off and the surround on and it is very easy to get lost in the moment.++ It's just fun. You can do a lot of different things with it and have a great time doing them. The voice acting is infamously fun bad, and the story is a kind of canned - but who cares, it's fun running through it all.++ Ultrawide!!! 3440x1440 - no problem and gorgeous!CONS:++ The economy is kind of not really there at all. I wanted to be a trader but the derelict mechanic made it more profitable and efficient to be a bad ♥♥♥ with scavenger bots. Which is kind of too bad, but it is what it is. ++ Playing the campaign like it is freeplay means you will be so OP that every enemy the campaign throws at you will be trivial to weak. Wish there was more scaling here, but it's not so bad to destroy waves of ships with out much thought because you outclass them by a mile.++ The UI is kind of crap and it's all raster so you can't mod it out to be better.++ Once you've played for a while, you start to realize that there isn't enough ship variance to keep it interesting. Some ships are clearly better than others, and you just sort of play the game out with that ship until the next tier - and its obvious captain, become available to you. I give this game an honest 10/10, even with the cons because it is a space game that you really can fall into. It really only asks for your time and patience - and doesn't require twitch muscles to play at a high level. The fire at will mechanic is great for it's tactical benefit, and for me I like to think about positioning in the large scale battles, rather than target/fire and positioning. To some it might seem like an ""easy button"" but for me it really makes the game. (i'm old... ;) )			"

												Overall the game is pretty awesome, but it could use some polish.PROS:Nice variety of skills and perks available.Great variety of factions and areas of control.Good selection of ships.Can capture enemy ships.Like the blueprints idea.Like the compare weapons and ships.CONS:Traveling over 10 units takes a couple minutes.There are four equipment slots to use and only about four that I found were actually useful, ie. shield recharge, strengthen attack, scavenger bots, hull repairs.  Even then, I rarely ever use them.Crew members do not have special abilities, but rather only bonuses.  A single slot for a special crew member.  Assuming only one special member exists in the game and is almost impossible to gain because the blueprint takes 20.Blueprints are super difficult to find, but very rewarding IF you ever complete them before becoming near god strength already.  I completed one for a nice fighter hangar jet, but the rest remain far out of reach while I am practically invincible with all the best enhancements and warship.The only truly useful weapons in the game are rail guns and maybe missiles.  I say maybe missiles because they are only really useful if the shields are already down and rail guns can usually take care of it anyway.  Lasers are useless.  Plasma is too slow to be useful except for mining.Level 70 bounties are easy kills for a level 50 that has a good battleship with maximum upgrades.  I think I may have beaten one with the next class down at a lower level too because you can stay behind them and they cannot fire back.Travelling outside the known universe area leads to infinite enemies and loss of whereabouts on the map.  Travelling too close to the sun does the same thing except enemies will start to randomly die from heat damage.Cannot see what is on a captured ship until it is transferred to the garage and crew is transferred as well.  Crew losses will occur if the captured ship has less.There are three kinds of heavy weapons, but I failed to see any real difference in shockwave damage.Exploding ships nearby do no damage.Has lag and slowdowns most of the time.SUGGESTIONS:Make traveling without gates a little faster when in full engine mode.Make some artifacts that last indefinitely / bonuses or useables that fit in equipment slots.Change the decimal enhancement descriptions, eg. 0.5, with percentage values, eg. 50%.Please fix weapon range.  Bonuses are not being counted.Add a barrier on the edge of the map to prevent getting lost in the void.Give a warning for pending heat damage when getting close to stars.Show radiation areas on the map.Show map sections that are partially visible on the edges of the map.Allow transfer of weapons and cargo from ships in the garage without transferring crew.Make plasma weapons hurt shields more, but damage hull less.Make lasers damage both shields and hull with shield punchthrough for damaging systems.Make railguns work best on hull, and less on shields.Do a similar rock paper scissors with heavy weapons.Fix the pathfinding.Improve AI for wanted bounties.

												My initial reaction to the game was ""Wow, this looks like a massive sandbox space sim! Just look at how big the area map is and how many factions there are. I'll be playing the game for tens of hours!""Well, after a while I started to realize the game had lots of problems with being a LOT more shallow than what it promises at first. Setting aside the optimization issues and how easily the game can be prone to crashing, It boasts and impressive ~50 factions with a reputation system that ended up being nothing more than a glorified Good / Evil alignment system. If you do missions given out by the good factions you get +rep and they will be friendly to you an the evil ones will be hostile. Vice versa you do missions given to you by the bad guys and your rep shifts to their side making them friendly to you. Unfortunately that is as deep as the faction system goes. Factions don't change opinions as they are completely static. The static factions leads me to the next problem. The whole world is static. There is absolutely NO sim element in this game to speak of. The game has NO economy, NO dynamic factions, NO dynamic world events. When we speak of sandbox you think of open worlds with things to do in them, but all it is here is the same map as the campaign, just without the campaign missions. Since the game lacks an economy and dynamic factions it makes trading all but a dull and soulless experience. Also, since the world isn't dynamic, there is no real territory control for the factions either. I mean they have their own territories, but they are completely set in stone. You cannot capture territories for the differenct factions. This leaves you with the same Assassination, Taxi, Cargo ferry and Repair missions to grind over and over and over again.How is the combat then if the other aspects are non-existant and hollow? Well, the combat is rather decent, but what kills it for me is how the game is level scaled. Each time you level up so do your enemies. After certain points their ships get upgraded. If you do like me and other people may have done and only grinded missions for money and XP you'll quickly find yourself in a situation where you don't have enough money to upgrade your ship but you are starting to be too weak to do missions and half the time you simply have to turn around and go away since the RNG pitted you against enemies that simply outclass you. This can be avoided if you salvage derelict ships for parts or capture them and sell them, but then it means that the level scaling system is balanced if you play in a certain way which is horrible, horrible balance in a game that claims to be a sandbox. Simply put if you aren't maximizing your money gains per level then you'll find yourself running into some issues.It just isn't a good game in the end of the day, and it certainly is no sim either, which is what I was lead to believe. There are no simulations happening behind the scenes, everything is static. The game is hardly an open world sandbox either. It seems to be a loose term that gets thrown around a lot these days. It's a sandbox world if all you had was the big open box without any of the sand in it to be shaped and sculpted by your hands. The game COULD be good, because the flying around, the skill system, the ships, the combat etc. feel good and are fun, but the content within the world is non-existant, unless you want to count repeating Kill X (Assassination and Rescue missions but both work the same. In rescue missions it means that you have to save an NPC ship, but so far they have served as reliable allies that help me take down the enemy ship faster rather than someone who needs help), Fetch Y (there is fetching and delivering cargo and serving as a taxi for VIP, but it works the same mechanically for either mission type so it's only different by name) and Repair Z (there's also Scanning anomalies as missions, but mechanically it works the exact same way as repairing so there is no real difference here either) missions as robustful content.

												This is from a post I did on the forum and decided to add it here following a suggestion to do so.SPG 2 The Good, the Bad, Oh God the InsanityIf you’re on the fence as to whether you should get this or not it will all come down to what you are looking for in a ‘space’ game.This is not Eve Online so get that out of your head. Seriously, if you want EO you’ll need to go log into EO. There is no online multiplayer, no gate camping players, no griefers and no gankers.That being said, this game offers something EO and many others, online or not, have simply forgotten or just don’t care about. Interactive Devs.Yep, you read that correctly. The Devs are extremely active in the forums. I’d hazard a guess and say 99% of all issues, questions, comments etc. are answered near instantly.They take concerns very seriously and look for ways to address them as quickly as possible, faster even it seems. While this isn’t to say other Devs aren’t around, personal experience has shown they just don’t answer, are too busy, don’t care and on more than one occasion… are downright obnoxious and rude.So +1 for Dev support seemingly 24hrs a day every day…Community… holy crap, where to begin…There are a lot of helpful people. One or two I have noticed try to step in when the Devs FINALLY get some sleep. This doesn’t mean there aren’t more filling in those roles, only that I can’t read, re-read, and re-re-read each and every post over and over to see who is filling those roles. Though, I will admit, sometimes the forum reading is an exercise in hilarity. Serious questions for the most part get serious answers. Once in a while they spiral out of control with loose jokes, odd references and such, though more or less after the issue has been handled.Remember the active Devs from earlier? Yeah… they contribute too.Don’t be surprised to find one or more of them plowing into your thread to partake of whatever silliness is afoot. Oh yes, my friend, they are characters indeed.On the whole, the community is developing into a large group of knowledgeable friendly people looking to help out any way they can. Yes, some can be offended easily, but I have yet to see an all-out flame war like everywhere else. In fact, most people just apologize if they upset someone and move on, including myself.So +1 for a truly friendly and helpful community.Graphics…Nothing that will stress your system too terribly. High end or low end, it seems everyone can find a setting that fits the bill and allows them to play. I have seen one or two instances where certain systems (read Laptops) refuse to allow the game to run, but I have yet to see more than those.Even then, the Devs are still trying to figure out how to get it working on those couple of problem machines. Interesting, since most would just tell you that your system doesn’t have what it takes and to go get something bigger.All in all, the graphics are very nice indeed. Nothing mottled, disjointed or misaligned. No missing pixels here and there or stand in objects for missing items.So +1 there for that…NPC’s…What do you expect? They are NPC’s. They shoot at you, they kill you and they keep doing it. Unless you kill them first, in which case, they die rather well and don’t whine about it. I seem to remember an account of griefing done by NPC’s, though I believe that was a one-off. Funny though.They get tougher as you progress through the game. Different levels, different types and different areas. They fight each other if they are opposing factions and will turn on you if you are low enough rep with one, or both. In which case, run.So I give a +1 for good NPC mechanics.Missions…Lots of them. They are everywhere in both aspects of the game. Free play or Story line there are tons. Decent rewards for the time invested as far as I can tell, probably a bit too decent considering some missions you just have to click a button and repair something.I’ll give a +1 here too.Storyline…For as much as I have done, it progresses well. Seems to have substance and a bit of plot for as far as I have gotten.But…It is buggy. Missions sometimes fail out. Sometimes you overshoot a zone and they get canceled, dropping you out of the storyline and into free play mode. Other times, you just crash out of the game.They are working on the bugs as fast as they are made aware of them and that helps out a lot. More often than not, you can just reload from a save point and try to continue.No points for this one, still needs work.Mods…There are more than a few. Something for everyone I suppose. Uber ship, got it. More money, got it. Star Trek themed ships, go those too.From Star Trek to vastly improve (overpowered) beginning station inventories, there is something to fit most everyone.The game has a mod community growing faster than the game itself. Even at least one mod I saw that will completely change the game to Mass Effect themed ships and even a new storyline that appears to be in the works.The Devs seem to support unlimited, no holds barred modding. So definitely +1 here.Oh, lest I forget...Community input...Look in the game. Look at achievements and improvements. You will see all the signs of active community involvement that has been taken seriously. (mostly) Yeah, +100 and some Oreos for all you community peoples that report bugs, request content changes and overall general improvements.All in all, for me, this has been one hell of a ride… and it’s just beginning. The game is only getting better and more is on the way.If you’re on the fence, get off it. Buy the game and join the fun in the community.And the insanity? Glad you asked...There are the elite few who can claim this. They watch you at home while you play. They see you in your boxers. They wear your boxers, like I am right now. The Devs are part of this group, I know one, whom I shall leave nameless, who has watched me in my boxers. Yes, some of us are insane... And that is the fun of it all.Sincerely,VirikasP.S. +1000 to the Devs for allowing us to be insane, taking us seriously when needed and for being on top of everything, everywhere, all at once, every day... always. Now... which one of you took my boxers, Meep.			"

												Well...the game looks nice but is actually quite boring. Here is why:1. Unengaging storyThe story consists of a lot of text (white on color, not very legible) and really really atrocious voice acting (which sometimes just cuts out). There are so many factions with text descriptions I did not bother to read all of them. Honestly I did not understand half of it because I have not played the predecessor. The game did not present its universe in an engaging way.2. Simple missionsThe free missions are all randomly generated but they consist  of either go to A and kill / capture or go to A and scan / repair (same menu button) or go to A and transport to B.The campaign missions are the same. Go to A and usually kill everything there...done. Sometimes you need to ferry stuff. But the whole involvement is detached. You arrive...the game cuts to sequence and some voice acting..suddenly to reappear with enemies around...you kill them...cut to the next short scene...done. There is no drama, no real action, no emotional involvment. I did not respond emotionally to the characters, who are just pictures with horrible accents.Trading and mining is a horrible grind if you like it. It is certainly helpful in the beginning but not worth your time later on. Just take the ""kill pirates"" mission and blast everything to hell.Once I got capturing ships down...I had so much money I could have bought ships that were not yet unlocked for my character level.3. Simple combatUsually you fly somewhere, click F for ""Fire at will"" and maneuver a bit around. There is not much strategy involved. Starfleet Command or Space Empires Starfury had more interesting combat. Manal aiming is cumbersome because you can't really see the ships at longer ranges and there is no help with aiming. Due to the turret placement your shots might not go where your reticle is...so automatic fire it is most of the time.Also medium difficulty is way to easy. I had a destroyer that could easily defeat a dreadnought without breaking a sweat (loosing shields).4. technical stuffAlthough the combat is in 3D the star sector is actually in 2D. The map is in 2D. You can fly ""up"" and ""down"" but it feels like all planets and stations are on the same plane. It is not a globe but rather a ""thick"" square.Flying around especially in the beginning is tedious because jumpdrives or jumpgates are way too expensive and when you have the money to buy jumps you can get a perk that allows you free use of the jump gate system.After about 10 hours the game just felt like a grind to get better ships and more weapons and do all the story missions (usually just killing enemies). It simply got boring.			"

												This game has come a long way since its beginning and it's still going strong. For me personally it went to overwhelmingly frustrating to awesomely enjoyable. The devs are super responsive and really care about the community. Keep in mind this is a tactical combat sim with trading aspects. There is a living economy, but personally I never paid any attention to it.Destroy enemy ships, capture enemy ships, loot enemy ships, grapple enemy ships, hack enemy ships. Do whatever it takes to defeat the enemy. Expansive map with plenty of variety to keep you exploring. Ships, officers, mercenaries, trading opportunities, weapons, weapon enhancements, system enhancements, equipment, etc. This game is an awesome space game in terms of what its selling point is: a tactical combat RPG space sim.

Early Access Review
								The next best thing if you want something similar to Eve and Freelancer. More arcade-ish Sci-Fi space shippy RPG. Start with a small gunship, make your way up to dreadnoughts and carriers by trading, doing freelancer missions like repairing a damaged space station, transporting a VIP from A to B, getting commodities to a planet or scanning anomalies, or just hunt criminals in hopes to get a huge bounty. The game is beautifully done, has a large selection of ships and weapons, the combat is fun although some say the camera is a bit slow, and there's a lot to do in it. Buy it! Throw money at the devs!!!! DOIT!			"

												I must preface this by saying, I don't write many reviews at all, but when I do though, it means I really enjoy the game.This game reminds me a lot of the X3 games, but the interface is a bit easier to get a grasp on.Pros:- Mod support- Great music, think Mass Effect & EVE Online style.- You can be anyone you want, and do whatever you want, there's a campaign mode, and freeform mode.- Nice interface.- Beautiful graphics.- Runs smooth, haven't experienced any crashes.  - Combat is fun.- Controller support.- There's a large selection of ships & weapons, and you can upgrade your ship.- All of the above points help with immersion, you really feel like you are in space driving your own ship.- The developers work hard and are engaged with the community.  They do have their own forums where they answer questions, etc.Cons:- Space can be a bit lonely at times, but, it is space after all.TL;DR - If you're looking for a game that is part X3, part Eve Offline that can also serve as a stopgap until Star Citizen & Elite Dangerous, you could do a lot worse than this game, especially when you consider the game is currently only $28.8/10			"

Early Access Review
								This is a very entertaining space game with a healthy side order of role playing and is pretty well polished even at this early access stage. The developers have a genuine rapport with the community and this is helping to shape a very enjoyable game. Until the final product release and all features and story campaign are implemented there is still a lot to enjoy in the sandbox mode. If you like beautiful ships, trading, chasing anomalies, blowing up asteroids and firing lasers at baddies there’s a lot to like. The music is awesome too.			"

												I like this game, I do, but 35$ I feel is too steep for what it offers. At first I thought this game was like Mount and Blade in space, with so many factions, different types of outposts, and skills oriented to being a leader. That however is not the case, the game is more or less a dungeon crawler RPG without the dungeons.The story is fairly bland, and frankly the voice acting of the main character is so outright awful I had to turn off dialogue volume, and I just quickly got bored with the story missions.Theres no real ""looting"" and going out of your way to be a merchant king through cargo hauling is a waste of time, the early portion of the game is farming money to get better ships, once you have better ships you just capture enemy ships for quick cash and farm levels. Looting ships for weapons is a waste of time, as all stations are static and theres no random element to their inventories, simply fly to the station selling the best weapon of your chosen class, and buy it, everything quickly becomes a monotony of going from X to Y and repeating.The biggest issue I have with the game is saving, the save system is abysmal. You can only save while anchored at a planet or base, if you arrive at a friendly base and find it swarming with enemies (in some sectors this happens constantly) you can find yourself trapped in a prolonged battle, or killed, when all you wanted to do was save the game and go have dinner.You cant side with factions, or take over stations, or influence anything, so dont expect any depth with the politics of the world, you are either ""good"" or ""bad"" and that determines who is friendly, nuetral, or hostile. Good being the vast majority of the galaxy. So the dozens of factions in the game, may as well be two factions.""Commanding a fleet"" isnt as exciting as I hoped either, its not so much a fleet, as you having two hirelings, hence part of my comparison to the game as a dungeon crawler.There is plenty of good though, the actual gameplay is fun, you are more captain than pilot, you configure power usage, set speed, battles arent about quick manuevering so much as overwhelming firepower and good positioning. In a star wars example, you are piloting a Star Destroyer, rather than a Tie Fighter. (fighter squadrons are in fact a system on later ships) Just be sure to go over the controls, I spent far too long without realizing you could activate automated fire.Bounties are probably my favorite aspect, unlike most games, bounty targets arent static, you start the game with a full list of bounties, and they move around the galaxy on their own, when you choose to hunt them you have to go by ""last spotted"" information and attempt to cut them off. These are also the most challenging fights available, and shouldnt be taken lightly.After a while though I begin questioning my goal, Its not difficult to get better equipment, at least not after a certain point, and the only thing you have to upgrade is your ship. A uninteresting campaign that I cant be bothered to finish? The bounty targets to award money I dont really need? Side missions that are much the same as the main missions?This game could be improved by aspects of strategy (something I think Warlords addresses, though the game is very very early access so I dare not bother with it yet.) and aspects of procedural generation. Non static stores, to put more of a emphasis on looting (Perhaps ships produced by that faction are much, much more expensive, but always available and the randomly generated ships are cheaper, like buying a new car vs. used car.) and procedurally generated weapons Diablo style. A star system you can purchase as a home base, to build your own colonies, defenses, shipyards to give you more to do than just upgrade your ship.The game has so, so, so much potential, and the team that worked on it seem dedicated and helpful to their community, the framework is here for a game unlike any other, and I am excited by where the team goes with warlords once its finished. If you can nab this for $20 or less, do it. But in the end, whats that phrase? A mile wide, a inch deep.			"

												** A gorgeous space game marred by painful lore elements.**      [[Recommendation comes with strong suggestion to play in sandbox mode only]]This game was an odd experience.  The longer I played it, the less I liked it.When it started, it took me back to the wonder of games like Privateer.  Sandbox, big galaxy, lots of options.  And it's really gorgeous, from the ships to the planets to the nebulous backgrounds.  Some of space stations look oddly low-res compared to everything else, but that's minor.However, things went downhill when I started to follow the main story campaign.  The voice acting is truly atrocious, and the writing isn't much better, from the minor (bad grammar) to the median (dialogue) to the major (an incoherent plot with characters whose motives don't seem to correspond to events).  And when you get to a more difficult mission that you have to try several times, the lack of any button to skip the dialogue becomes truly unforgivable.Speaking of retrying, there are several design decisions that make sense on their own, but quickly become annoying when you have to replay a mission because it's difficult or bugged (like the infamous mothership mission).  First, you can save only at stations or planets.  OK, there's a sort of 'realism' sense to that.  Second, there's a lot of empty space between points of interest.  That actually worked for me at first, because it added to the sense of scale and exploration.  But when you have to retry a mission and reload to find you are about a 5 minute cruise from the action -- and then remember that you'll have to sit through 3 more minutes of unskippable community theatre auditions when you get there -- it gets really difficult to stick with it for the next attempt.There were also a number of minor annoyances, like the fact that missions seem to get reset when you load a game (so if you pick up someone or something to deliver, you must do it before you end your current session or forever have that passenger or item in your non-cargo inventory), some inscrutable elements, several mechanics that seemed incomplete, and a handful of crash bugs.I think there are the ingredients of a good game here, with a good core and beautiful graphics, but the lore side of things really lets those elements down.  Perhaps the best strategy would be to ignore the story and play only in sandbox mode.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a space trading and combat game, think Elite or EVE. You fly around a vast galaxy, smaller than in EVE or Elite though, doing missions, trading, mining, bounty hunting, etc. Captain your ship and level your captain in a RPG-like fashion. I turned to SG2 for that EVE Online fix. I would call it a simplistic EVE, but it's still very good to scratch that EVE itch. You can forget about the RPG system, it's so simplistic, but the rest is a full fledged space game. The game's looks take a little getting used to, coming from sharp and shiny EVE or Elite gfx, but after a while it grows on you and flying around the galaxy is as fun as usual.Getting through the story and all dlcs can take about 50 hrs, then there's some additional hrs if you want to replay SG story in SG2 engine, and then there is freeroam. Freeroam will not be so fun after completing everything as your ship will obliterate everything that the game throws at you, but still, 50-70hrs of game time looks quite amazing considering you can get this on sale.I liked:* quite a large map* lots of different ships* large amount of weapons and enhancements* flying in space shooting / trading / uncovering stuff!I disliked:* capturing ships is the only way to go if you want to make big bucksGet this:* if you're looking for EVE Offline and don't mind simpler experience* if you want to fly in space and pew pew stuffDon't get this:* if you're looking for complex space sim			"

												I really wish I could recommend this game, but it's a buggy, unfinished mess.  I can't believe the state the developers left this in before abandoning it and moving onto their next project; Starpoint Warlords, which I would highly advise people to stay away from as well.  Aside from the persistent crashing, there are parts of the game the developer just didn't even bother to finish.  For instance, none of the equipment that was introduced with the expansions works.  None of it.  The developers are completely aware of it too, they just never bothered to finish it.  Simple things like being able to skip dialog doesn't work because of ""technical reasons"".  I kid you not, that's their excuse, but it supposedly works on xbox.  Many of the quests are bugged, including the final mission, and require hacking save files or reloading the mission numerous times until it works.  Voice dialog worked for maybe a third of the game, the rest of it you just have to read the dialog and then wait in silence until what should have been voiced over to finish since, again, you can't do something as simple as skip dialog.  Character/story progression is very poorly thought out.  It wasn't until I got about 10 hours in, when I was getting wrecked by even the lowliest of enemies, that I had to go to the forums to find out you shouldn't do any missions because you'll over level yourself but not have enough money to buy a new ship and essentially have to start all over or hack your save file to give yourself credits.  Nope, you're supposed to just go capture ships for money and not do any missions.  I'm not kidding, you aren't supposed to level up or do missions or you'll break your game.  I'm not even going to list out all of the other bugs the devs are aware of that they just never bothered to fix.  Stuff that was brought up back in 2014 during the beta that they said they would fix and just never bothered with.  I could probably go on for another three paragarphs listing all the issues with this game, but suffice it to say, it's a mess.  I'm hard pressed to recall any other game I've played that was left in such a sad state, it's like a beta release.  It's a huge shame too, because there is a really good game hiding underneath all the garbage, but having finished the game, the incredible amount of laziness and carelessness by the devs and the amount of frustration it causes just ruins it.  I have no tolerance for devs that abandon a game like they have here and then move on to their next cash in.  I will never purchase another game from Iceberg Interactive.			"

												Loved this game. Felt like Privateer 2 without the cutscenes and sadly missing Clive Owen with Christopher Walkins :-( Freelancer should've been more like this. SG2 is a lot more open world than Freelancer which has its advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I found it purely an advantage. Unlike Privateer 2 and Freelancer you can truly just be a merchant if you want and switch effortlessly to being a badass kill everything murder ship at any space station/planet. Sometimes it's just the little things that make you happy... The graphics are great, the music not annoying, the abundance/ease of quickly accepting missions is a serious plus, and most importantly the flexibility of the game to allow someone the ability to play  the game how they want w/out the need of trainers, cheat codes, or cheat engine. Just like in the real world there are easy ways to make a quick buck with minimal returns or riskier methods that garnish heavy monetary rewards. I love that this game isn't afraid to make the playing field drastically uneven when it comes to rewards. Harder, almost always (there are times you get lucky/learn to exploit advantageous situations), means greater rewards! Learning the in game market is very beneficial. But it gets better, should you disagree w/me all you have to do is download any of the many mods and change how the game mechanics work. This game is a literal win-win. Small minor bonus pluses that I think are worth mentioning are; 1.) Achievements actually give you in game bonuses 2.) Blueprints that give better stuff that can't be bought 3.) Bounty hunting ( this is a mixed bag. this system could better implemented but I'll be damned if i didn't end up hunting everyone down!) 4.) Buying of certificates/licenses (w/game money and not real money) that give-in game bonuses for no other reason but to make the game fun (personally, I think it could have been better implemented but I sure as ♥♥♥♥ was excited to find a new one!). 5.) A good array of ships to pick from (potentially unlimited if you count mods... Just saying...) 6.) Personally, I found the system upgrade gimmick confusing at 1st but once understood, it opens the door to a lot of options that becomes unlimited if you include modding (just saying...).No game is perfect and this one isn't either. This is the disadvantage section of SG2. SG2 has some pretty poor optimization problems. 4-5 years ago my PC was a champ so it's aged a bit meow. Still, w/the level of graphics/visuals/objects it should run better. Especially since the video/graphics adjustment is bugged/non-functional. It's only a moderate complaint because the game allows mods and several are designed to reduce the toll taken on your PC. The rest of the comaplaints are mild at best because all are easily adjusted w/mods or are drastically overshadowed by the game's massive, bulging, make you scream in your pillow as you take it awesomeness so here goes- 1.) The voicovers are almost all a joke. They're done w/the stalest emotion possible. 2.) The story is kinda flat. Open ended games are prone to this a lot so it obviousley shouldn't be a huge unseen problem here. The game brings up interesting things here and there so kudos for the Devs for trying but it is still kinda... ummm... blah most of the time (kudos for the DEVs for doing such a good job to make the game so fun I really didn't care!) In short, my complaints are minimal at best and I had countless hours of fun playing it. I found it quick and easy to learn and SG2 left a lot of options for me to explore for future play throughs. I can't ask a game to do more than that but w/mods this game could be literally different everytime I played. I got it on sale and felt like I stole something. I would have happily paid full price and been more than content. This game is awesome, WOOF!			"

Early Access Review
								As a long-time fan of the great grandfathers of space trading, exploration and combat games, (Elite, Wing Commander, Privateer). I am always on the lookout for a game of this genre that has the feel and enjoyment these classics gave.Starpoint Gemini 2 goes a long way to bringing back those days in a modern, eye pleasing, fun package that is not overly complex like some of the modern games ( later X Series, EVE Online) which although are great games and in many ways superior, probably due to much larger budgets, leave me feeling like I have just sat the final papers to a master’s degree.Starpoint Gemini 2 which is still in beta at time of writing this review, shows great promise and I eagerly look forward to the future updates and release of this enjoyably challenging game.I hope to add additional updates to this review as new releases come out and I explore the game further.

												Well-made hybrid of SG1 and Freelancer. with light RPG elements on top.Pros+Vast selection of ships from fighters to dreadnaughts and carriers+Engaging combat+diverse systemsCons-Lack of persistent objects. You won't see ships traveling from one system to another, because they are always generated when you enter a system.-There is like 30 factions, but reputation system is two-dimensional. So when you help one faction you improve/worsen relation with the rest of them.-Below average performance.7/10 (8 of 10 if the they fix bugs and improve optimization), worth buying if you are into space genre. If you are not, you can wait for Christmas sale, a lot of things should be fixed by then.			"

								The playstyle is an assorted combination of the Freelancer + tactical elements of Star Wolves + diversity of EV Nova + some good original ideas on top.Do you remember that feeling of excitement when you discover something, something that makes you feel more alive? I feel a deep immersion when playing this game which is so rare nowadays (even in alpha state atm (nov 2013), with only a basic features present). The devs put a part of their souls into creation of this, I feel it in all those small details here and there. I'm looking forward for a release, and quite positive that anyone who loves ""space sims"" won't be disappointed with this game, especially with such a good modding support.			"

												I wish I hadn't bought this game. I loved Freelancer and thought it would be something similar but boy was I wrong.This game lacks any atmosphere and feeling of a space-traveling universe. Docking at stations and visiting stations is one of the most disappointing events I ever encountered in a space game. There is no radio chatter, no clearance for docking; you never hear anybody over radio nor do you see more than one or two ships (even near well populated planets!). This game feels so incredibly dead and empty, that travelling and exploring just simply isn't any fun at all. It all feels so static. Add to that that planets and stations you visit are not animated but all just have a static, bland screensaver in the background of dull buying menues. There are no bars or other places that give you the feeling of really setting a foot on a place. Rather it all feels so incredibly generic and it doesn't get better if you add the boring ""go there and kill pirate x""-missions that we all have seen way too often now.This game is nowhere near Freelancer and if you look for something like that, you will most likely be as disappointed as I am. This is a sad and empty game and I would be careful to get carried away by the positive albeit misleading reviews here.			"

												TL;DR version - GET IT! Fun as heck! Some minor issues and bugs but devs are hard at work on fixing them!Ok as far as space games go, this is ""easy to get into"" and ""fun"" to me. Easy once you actually READ the tutorial tips and understand how it all works. And it's fun cuz I found myself needing to ""just go over to that next unexplored sector"" to see what's there.However, you can't compare this game to another game like X, or Star Citizen, or Elite Dangerous. It's like asking if Diablo 3 is like Skyrim - they simply can't be compared fairly. The only thing in common between this game and the game you want to compare to is just that the action takes place in ""space"". How it makes the gameplay fun is different from the one you want to compare to.If you want to ask ""Does it have <this feature> like <the other game you want to compare to>?"", don't. Go back and read my previous comment.What I can tell you is that this game feels like an RPG more than a Space Combat game. There is a story. You upgrade your weapons and armour. You kill your enemies and loot their corpses (derelict wrecks). You use what is better than yours and you sell what is not. See? Just like an RPG.You can do some trading, but I don't concentrate on it like I would have in X or Elite Dangerous. In the end, the question is - does it make you feel that you want to play this more? Does it make you want to see what happens next?The answer is YES for me.			"

Not much, just things I personally prefer.  Others might consider some of these to be ProsNo multi-player optionsNo empire to buildFreelance missions do not have much variety.The officer system is a little strange.  You can only hire them in their original location, they go home when you fire them, then you have to fly back there to hire them again.You can't equip ships unless you are piloting them.  This can cause you to lose crew or be forced to sell cargo.You might like Starpoint Gemini 2 if you like these games. Freelancer, X3-series, Eve Online, and space based games in general "

												A good game that could have been a great game.After several hour of play the missions quickly get repetitive. Trading and mining get boring even quicker. The real challenge of the game is capturing enemy ships (and it is the only way to make enough money to advance in the game).The faction system didn't much much sense to me, and didn't seem very important as it was just goodies vs badies in the end.Near the end game there was nothing to spend your cash on. The weapons at the end of the game really aren't much better than what you get 20% into the game.The game crashes from time to time, but not enough to ruin the game thanks to the auto-save feature. It is a 32bit only game and seems to run out of virtual RAM. The developers should have also included a 64bit executable in the install package.So, good fun for maybe 20 hours.Some suggestions as to what would have made this a great game.- Some ship customisation (and why can't I see the weapon arcs)- More variety in the  enemy ships (maybe some boss ships)- Some random system wide events. Not just random pirates- The hacking (and anti-hacking) features making some sense. I didn't get hacked ever, but had zero protection.- More high end weapons and gear- The galaxy having low and high level sections rather than being seemingly mostly uniform. At the moment sectors are either friendly or impossibly hard.  I never found any netural sectors.			"

												Most have taken to calling this EVE offline, but I find it to be more EVE Lite or Diet EVE. Think the core concepts of EVE in an open sandbox map rather than many separate systems, but with the waiting 5 months for a skill replaced by grinding for a few hours and all the player interaction removed.At the end of the day you're left with all the things that made EVE great, with none of the stuff that makes it only suitable for people with vast swaths of time available. You can jump in, do a quick mission, save and jump out. You don't have to worry about being dicknailed by a ship fifty levels higher than you at any given time, and you get an experience that's much more simple than EVE.I'll reccomend it. I've come across some bugs, and the voice acting is really, really bad at times, and just pretty bad at others. Personally I think the 20 bucks out of pocket I paid (had 6 bucks steam credit) was in the right area for the game, maybe a little high. I'd say buy at 5-15 for sure and 20+ only if you like the sounds of EVE Jr.			"

												(8/10) Pros: -Freelancer 2.0 -Capitol ships. -Ability to capture vessels and own them or sell them. -Ability to lead a small fleet -Simple control scheme, complex battle needs. -Runs perfectly smooth for my mid grade computer-Story line is not overly complex and compels you to keep upgrading your ship/fleet/character in order to surviveCons:  -Some dlc quests may get bugged if you load all DLC at start of a save.  Forums have workarounds to help solve issues though-Capturing ship to sell profit far out scales all other methods of profit (trade, mining, missions, etc) and after a playthrough of a character/ship tuned for this method, all other methods feel like roleplay, comparatively.Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game extremely like Microsoft's Freelancer however instead of a choice of around 10* fighter sized ships (in vanilla freelancer), you will be getting a plethora of capitol sized ships from transports, frigates, cruisers, destroyers, and so on up to carrier and dreadnaught.  Titan class if you get that dlc too.Gameplay wise the game features easy controls to help you manage power towards shields, weapon batteries, and thrust, and you will be required to fluctuate this power as the game progesses and the needs of battle and speed get more intense.I found the ui and gameplay to be very good.  This game has been the best open space trader sim that I've played on steam yet.Late game battles can be intense and even if you power through tens of ships at a time, you will need to be vigilant in your positioning, use of power, and abilites.

												Pros: + Beautiful game; very nice to look at!+ Lots of small interesting mechanics and ideas, such as boarding other ships, hacking their systems, etc.+ Mining and trading are well implemented, although it's very hard to get rich through either+ Plenty of unique ship designs and overall great attention to art+ Very decent music and sound effectsCons:- Boring story- Abysmal voice acting- No multiplayer- Excessively combat-focused (good luck getting rich as a merchant)- easter egg hunt (in a space sim? sigh, okay)- only one star system, seems limited for a space sim- the prices for using the jump gates are insane, get your podcast playlist ready and have fun trucking through space- lack of animations for entering or leaving stations/planets (yeah this one is a bit nitpicky)- placing stations and artifact containers right next to riftways is borderline sadistic- what REALLY pushed me away from this game:WELCOME TO USER INTERFACE HELL!oh my god, this game's interface makes me want to stick puppies in a blender! --> fifty thousand menus that don't give you all the information you need--> 'why can't I select this station? oh the waypoint marker is in the way, let me place it somewhere else for the 1000th time so I can move on with the docking procedure' (same thing applied to any static object in space you hope to interact with)--> 'does a green price mean it's a good sell, or does it mean the price is very low?'--> 'why can't I use the turret camera while in PTE mode?! oh, I can, but I need to press Mouse1 simultaneously. wtf?'--> 'time to compare some prices, now let me just find the item in this huge list which isn't alphabetically organized'--> I spent several hours having to remind myself that the BLUE bar under the red HP bar doesn't represent shield, but speed. Why do I need a speed bar? God only knows. And one that looks like a shield bar, on top of all.--> I could go on, but the point is: if this game's UI had been better conceived, SG2 wouldn't have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off so often. I'm not saying it's a bad game, just that... it's not great fun. I guess that's enough.			"

												TLDR: If you are looking for a Elite type game look elsewhere!  If you are looking for a casual game where you can capture ships, command a carrier, and be a rich badass. Then this is for you.  At first glance I wasn't impressed by this game. Found the controls/interface a bit clunky, voice acting cheesy to say the least.

												Updated review as of October 1st.First impressions: Broken. With a lot of potential.Secondary impressions: It's an acquired taste. It does grow on you. But it's lopsided. Strong gameplay props up a (very) weak campaign.Initial review:This game may be out of early access, but do not be fooled. This is NOT a finished product. Not even close. It is sorely lacking in decent voice acting, and the campaign hangs together by the thinnest of threads, and liberal deus ex machina. Frequently you will look at the screen in confusion and ask ""Who is that? What is happening? Why am I supposed to do this?"" The game approaches storytelling in a very basic, almost childish way. Even in my short time in the game, I have already encountered several borderline-gamebreaking bugs. Such as non-functional campaign triggers. And equally game-breaking, though no bug, is the games tendency to assume the player knows more that he does. This game needs a softer introduction, not to mechanics, but to world-building. As it is, it's a mess.I am giving the developer the benefit of doubt, and I will continue playing. I do believe there is a lot of enjoyable content to come. But ""it gets better later"" is not a defence that a genuinely good game would need.Let me put it like this: I am playing the game simply because it is the only game of its kind currently available. If it weren't for the fact that I have played Freelancer into the ground repeatedly, I would be playing that. It is a superior experience in every way.Currently, I still regret spending money on this game. Therefore I am choosing not to recommend this game.Update #1: After a few more hours, I can only confirm my first impressions: I have absolutely no idea what is going on in the game, and my enjoyment of it suffers as a result. Time and time again, I am told I need to go to some place I don't know of, to meet a person I've never heard of, to get a thing which I know nothing about, for reasons that are never made clear. To call it frustrating is an understatement. The game is seemingly an unending series of unanswered questions. Primary among them: ""Why am I doing this?""This is not intentional mystery, this is just really, really bad writing.Which is a damn, crying shame. Because the game itself, mechanics and graphics, are solid. Ish. A little shallow and clumsy, perhaps, but the closest I have come to Freelancer since Freelancer.I wish this game was better. But it isn't. I wish I could love this game. But I can't.I have given this game more than its fair share of chances. I have given it more than the benefit of doubt. I have acted on faith, on the belief and the hope, that this game ""gets better"". So far, this has proven to be wishful thinking.I'll research the Gemini universe, and see if that gives me enough points of reference to piece together just what the hell is going on in the game. Then I'll give the game one last chance to pull itself out of this confusing funk and make some damn sense.Update #2:That helped a lot. A now have a fair grasp of what the game was assuming I knew by heart all along. It made the campaign bearable, though still not good by any measure. But at least I'm no longer tearing my hair out (as much) over the lack of proper world-building, exposition and adherence to storytelling 101.I still can't recommend the game, despite that I am now beginning to enjoy it. Chances are that you won't be as patient as I have been, and I fail to muster any decent arguments as to why you would wish to be.			"

 Review - Starpoint Gemini 2 === Rating: 7.0 / 10 - To boldly grind as much as nobody grinded before === The Good - Good variety of pilotable vessels for various play styles: mining freighters, battleships, fighter carriers, it's all there- RPG elements and alignments system enable the player to take the path they wish in both terms of abilities, perks and behaivior- Fairly good, but not excellent mind you, number of different sectors to explore- Main quest, a load of secondary missions, contracts, bounties, random encounters, global events... really, there is a lot of stuff to actually do in the Gemini Sector...- Decent assortment of weaponry and modifications- Space anomalies, ion storms, radioactive nebulas, and all sorts of space disasters to endanger your ship- It takes really long to get to high levels, get all the good ships, weaponry, kill bounty targets and such things- Quite complex but rewarding enemy ship capture system, you can really do an awful lot of money if you get good at it...- Overall, more than good longevity, to complete everything the Gemini Sector has to offer, DLCs included, it will take you, say around... 100 hours (i played the beta version before release in the past and did so)=== The Bad - Trading / Mining / Gas collecting / Scrap salvaging are good for making money at low levels, game start and quite a bit after, but from say level 15/20 and above, they become very underwhelming: contracts, bounties and most of all ship boarding surpass the gains by FAR, so players that want to play a Trading type character will be severely penalized in mid/late game and will have to do epic amounts of grinding to get anything- You cannot destroy space structures if they are not part of a specified mission that involves their destruction. Solar arrays, gas collectors, bandit space stations, trading posts, all of them are completely indestructible: their structure will drop to 0 eventually but will still be perfectly fine. This MIGHT be a game design choice to avoid players break main quests and such, BUT doing so with all space structures is really unacceptable- You can board space structures, and plausibly get all the sweet loot inside them right? Wrong my friends. Board a mining station, a resarch center or such, and the troops will say it is captured and the loot is being ejected outside: this will not happen. Never, ever. This feature might be incomplete or never finished by developers.- You can only save your game while docked to a space station or a planet. Not a really big deal, just a poor game design choice- Ship's autopilot can bug and randomly fly you inside space stations, space debris, asteroids, and turn your ship in a fireball.- The ship's targeting computer is not able to target automatically asteroids or salvage piles, if you want to be a miner, be prepared to aim at every single little piece of asteroid manually and then collect its loot. This makes mining even more painful than it already is because of the problem i explained before- The ship's targeting computer (yes, AGAIN) is able to, thankfully, target enemies in automatic fire mode, and is pretty accurate at it, more so than you doing it manually in fact, but the big issue is: the computer will randomly fire at all enemies in its range, and will NOT stay and focus fire on the enemy you locked on. You should understand how this will do in a battle. Yes, really bad.=== The Ugly - When boarding a ship, ANY ally ship, be it random, hired mercenaries or quest companions, will STILL target the enemy ship you are trying to board, and there is NO WAY to tell them to do otherwise. This results in extreme frustration because maybe you are actually succeeding in the believe me really difficult task of capturing a ship (especially at high levels), but then some random ally blows it up making you lose time, your troopers inside it, and maybe also a mission involving the ship capture will fail. The developers said this WOULD be fixed many times on forums and steam hub, well it never was.- Ship capture is the ONLY feasible way of making good amounts of money from mid game and above: contracts will start giving you a pittance, trading will long be worthless and selling those nice ships for money will be your only chance of making money to get better stuff and ships to actually progress in the story or freeroam, because enemies scale with your level and get better everything, and so you must do the same. Yes you guessed it, the thing i said before about boarding, it happens a LOT, so you can choose between getting ulcer from boarding, or grinding 70 contracts in say 6 hours to get 1 tier III weapon for that slot you are missing, and then again and again and again.- There is a bug that can happen randomly, i presume it is uncommon: after completing a Main Story or DLC Main quest (Happened to me just after finishing Aethera DLC), and this is a really severe bug. What it does is simple: it RESETS the entire quest line of the main story to a random mission, so basically instead of progressing to the next quest, it says the actual active quest is one you ALREADY completed, and i found no fix for this, system cache check, restarting, even savegame editing, nothing. This has lead me to be unable to play Titans DLC because the quest is broken, and who knows what sorts of troubles will other players get from this bug.=== Conclusions Honestly, SG2 is a nice space game, nowhere near the depth of some other games like the X series, but positively much more accessible than those, but still being complex enough to not become casualized, and that is all good.Still, many problems as you read cripple the game and prevent it from becoming truly excellent.

												This is a good game for space adventurers. However, there should be an emphasis on the word ""adventure"" more than action on this one. There is story here, but I find the game play is slightly lacking. The idea of controlling a modify-able ship is awesome, especially with the ability to turn auto-firing and auto-pilot on and off - but I just find this game lacks a bit in depth. There is a lot to do, a lot of side missions, main missions are intriguing enough, but SG2 just fails to deliver amazing game play. Maybe it's because I'm playing with a controller, but I find from the stuff you can do in game to scanning or teleporting is not quite there. You cannot walk around space ports or your own ship which is really disappointing because what captain doesn't want to see what's going on - on his/her ship. I find myself always chasing new nav points and flying in circles and turning on auto-firing.I like the game, but enough to pass time or keep me busy. I do not think it's worth the stated price and recommended to buy on sale.RATING : 7/10 Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ "

There may be a bug here and there, but the Dev team is really on top of it. It's about all been flushed out. So if you have been on the fence, and want a feeling like playing Freelancer for the first time. You should give this a go. And, with a active Mod community, Im sure there will be years of fun in the future of Starpoint Gemini 2!!			"

												Finally out of Early Access, Starpoint Gemini 2 is a great entry point into the genre. While you're waiting for things like Elite and Star Citizen to come down in price (or release), this is an excellent stop gap game. While the science behind it isn't world-accurate like other games, the pure amount of things to do and systems in play is excellent. Workshop support is excellent and the modding API is well detailed on the developer website.			"

												This game gets compared to Freelancer a lot (particularly by forums users), but it's like a poor man's version of Freelancer without any of its artistry or high points like the lore backgrounding the game, and the great universe design. There are similar mechanics: do some basic trading, have a ship...TBH it is a bit of a disappointment after the hype you hear about it from fans. To be really blunt in its current state I think this is a $10 max game. It feels a bit like it would be a good iOS space game, but as yet isn't a good PC space game. It needs an additional layer of depth and polish to become anything more than average. I'm playing it a bit but it's mostly as a time filler and because its a pretty massive grind to get anywhere (which I assume covers for a lack of content).The forums seem to be an unadulterated love fest for this game and that was one of the main things that swayed me, but it's fairly average so far. I think it has something to do with the developers being active on the forums, big-upping anyone that says anything positive. Will update this review if my opinion changes, but I have a pretty good picture of the core dynamics: capture till you get a bigger ship, capture till you get a bigger ship until you get the biggest ship. Do really boring missions until you get your rank up. Otherwise you might do the really boring version of trading or mining (compared to other games).THE BAD Tutorial and the campaign to date are pretty bad and unengaging (I kinda know what I'm doing but just don't care). Visuals are mediocre, although the ship art is okay. Universe feels empty in a bad way. Voice acting in the plot is amateur. You can only save in certain places which is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ (there are some lackluster excuses about this) Combat seems fairly one dimensional RPG elements are lighter than I expected (4 skills that you level, and some perks) Crew are just stats bonuses Trading economy and mining seem extremely basicOverall I think a game like Starsector has far more RPG depth.THE GOOD...You can customise ship colours, decals, and names so we can all call our ship Stormbringer, however, I haven't tried naming one Mistake Not My Current State Of Joshing Gentle Peevishness For The Awesome And Terrible Majesty Of The Towering Seas Of Ire That Are Themselves The Milquetoast Shallows Fringing My Vast Oceans Of Wrath - it might be possible.The cosmetic stuff like naming the ships and changing colours seems to be my high point so far. It might end up being a good timewaster...here's hoping.			"

												Sorry for the negative review, but I found this game frustratingly boring...- The game is a real grind…. -Freighting cargo around doesn't pay well at all, and I installed a mod to try and solve that issue, but seemed to not help.-The story did not capture my interest. With sad voice acting, and the death of the characters farther on the “second” mission, I felt nothing for it, and was simply poorly laid out. -Not a fan of the combat, it's clunky, panning the turret cam is slowed in combat. (that could be due to my system but the graphics run fine in combat, I suspect it's something else) -A lot of the free roaming play is go here, go there... with not much inbetween. maybe some random combat…-No feedback on some systems, if you can't charge your engines in combat, no way to tell how long they will take to comeoneline, or I didn't find any readout to tell me… -not a fan of magical powerups/skills but that just my preference-The sell all button is poorly placed with no confirmation, will also fail you if you're smuggling. you can't buy it back to complete the mission… sigh...-Not a fan of the docking anchoring system. it makes the long or short trips that much more unsatisfying :( -missions seem to be straightforward but lack information… eg. where am I smuggling this to? You want help, what kind of help? Missions simply lack information that would give you the choice to make a educated decision. -Combat music sounds very VERY similar to Freelancer... just putting that out there...I have tried to get into the game twice, tried to give it a chance. I have put 13 hours into the game... I don't feel there is any need to put more.I strongly recommend anyone considering purchasing this title to thurellery research it on youtube or forums, as actual game footage it not supplied on steam, and is quite misleading...

												So here's the kind of stuff that happens in SG2:I'm flying in my cloaked Freya-class stealth carrier towards a small fleet of enemy vessels. I drop to cruising speed (drawing power from engines to weapons + shields) in the middle of the ship cluster and release 1 wing each of fighters + bombers, which wreak havoc in their ranks. I lock a grappling beam on the flagship, drop out of cloak and set weapons free. Turning the ship, I shoot missile salvos from my port, bow and starboard ports, crushing the flaship's shields and bringing hull integrity to critical levels. I then use transporters to launch a boarding party, which subdues the vessel's defenders in less than a minute. All the while my guns, bombers and fighters make short work of the supporting vessels and I leave with a prize ship worth millions of credits.That's the game in a nutshell. It's really, really, really cool and accomplishes what few games like it can... but has giant glaring holes in it. I recommend the game if you get it on sale or if you don't mind taking the good with the bad. I'm not one of those weird people who likes s***ty games and *I* played it for 55 hours and counting.Here are my gripes:* Capturing ships? Yeah, pretty much the only sensible thing to do towards the end game for cash.* The system is kind of arcane. Most of it becomes intuitive after you get a chance to tweak it (for instance, I've set my mouse page Back/Forward buttons to lock on the nearest target and mark it for fighters/fleet vessels). However... it wasn't until like 40-50 hours into the game that I realized that ""Power-To-Engines"" didn't actually put full power to engines and you boosted speed significantly if you used the power allocation tab to set Engines to 100% while in PTE mode.* AI is miserably weak. Boarding actions? They don't do 'em. Hacking your ship? Yeah they don't do that either. Grappling? Hahaha no. They seem to just go towards the nearest enemy and shoot. The most complicated thing they do is use items that drop mines or kill your fighters or knock out your engines. It leads to ridiculous situations like my Freya ship with 110 troopers destroying 6 Equinox-class carriers with 130 troopers each... when just two of them could almost guarantee taking my ship by boarding. Same goes when I'm wrecking a freighter with a small corvette-class fighter/bomber... and it could easily knock me out of commission by grappling me and pounding me to dust.* The dialogue killed my parents. Seriously... this stuff comes across as written by a middle-schooler, translated to Russian-and-back, and voiced in the dumbest, least engaging way possible. Worst of all.. it's unskippable! There's a command for ""skip dialogue"" but it DOESN'T WORK.			"

												Update : Now LIVE V1.400 (Internal Test build)I myself have been playing since Alpha (September 2013 release) and I have seen SPG2 come along in strides. Below is a basic list of what is in-game and can be done whilst playing. SPG2 brings back many memories of quite a few spaces games I have played since the mid 80's onwards.Star Point Gemini 2!DLC - Secrets of Aethera - Adds in new ships, new storyline arc, tweaks and updates to game systems.Riftways - Oh my, something to experience yourself! - Rollercoaster rides in Space.Fighter wings for ships with hanger bays are a blast to play with.70 ships to buy/capture/destroyEquipment/Weapons that can be modified with enhancementsCustomizable ship - Can re-color certain parts of your ship, add decals etc.Consumables - Shield boosters, damage boosters, repair nanobots, etcPower ups - Boost your Railgun damage, or Beam weapons etc for a few seconds to turn the tide in battle (Use them wisely though as they have a cool down for re-use)Ship cloaking (Ships that have cloak devices) - A lot of fun with this one :)Hero Characters to hunt down and kill for excellent credit reward. (You can kill a few of us Forum members now as Hero Characters! - Thanks to LGM's competition)Global events - More fun things to do outside of freelance missions etc.Junk yards - Cruise the junk yard like a junk yard dog looking for some possible cargo and or poor unsuspecting ships that might contain some nice cargo to liberate from them.Trade your wares in stations and planets that you either bought elsewhere or collected from combat or mining. (Price balancing to still be finalized)Board and capture ships - Hire troopers and grapple a ship, send in the troops and take over that ship for some extra credits or to take as your own new ship.Worm Holes appear around the galaxy and can whip you to somewhere else in no time (Be warned you might turn up somewhere ""You dont want to be"")AI Security forces scan you ship for contraband and give you an option to dump it or duke it out (Pirates life for me, damn the pollice hehe)T-drives work as personal T-Gates to quickly jump to other areas very quickly (Same as using T-Gate, but on the spot usage, instead of finding a T-Gate)Ability to hanger (Personal hanger accessed via stations and planets) upto 5 ships, which you can swap out when needed. Have a freighter parked in your hanger when you want to do those big commodity runs for the big bucks, or some large scale asteroid mining. Drag out your carrier to go out and take on fleets of enemies with your weapons and your fighter wings.Travel the Galaxy map by normal engine power (I have done this and it takes quite some time - grab a coffee and some food), Power to engines (faster travel speed) or by Fast travel ways (Real fast movement across the galaxy)Freelance missions, Combat, repair, scan, VIP Courier, Cargo courier the list goes on.Steam Workshop - Mods are coming along and many more to come as modders get busy!Did I mention how bloody good the galaxy looks, Nebula's are amazing, Asteroid fields are real special (I like to play a pirate, so I like to hide in the dust clouds of some asteroid fields and wait for passing freighters/mining ships for some easy kills and loots. Junk yards look great, and just a reminder again don't run into them they not hurt hehe :)Oh and Mod Tools, Want to add a new ship into game, can do!!Want to add new sectors into game, Can do!!Want to add anything virtually into game, can do!!! Probably the best thing of all about SPG2 is the Dev Team, These people are one of the best I have had the pleasure of enjoying an alpha/beta release with. They are always responding to members posts, questions, technical help, and ideas. The Dev Team have even taken ideas from members and have put into game those ideas, what more can you ask for in a Dev Team who cares just as much for the player base as their game, that is simply priceless and a quality lacking in many AAA title Dev Teams.All I can say is, ""If you enjoy space gaming, Buy SPG2 today. You wont be disappointed""And drop by the official forums and say hello as well :)http://www.starpointgemini.com/forumhttp://www.twitch.tv/webferret - My Stream of SPG2 most nights 8PM AEST (GMT +9:30)			"

												I love space sims. I don't even know how much time I sank into freelancer or the x3 games. Yet this one I am dropping after a bit more than 10 hours of playing.Let's start with what I like about this game: The graphics are good, the different ships with their various layouts are cool, you can customize your ship through enhancements and hiring officers, the energy transfer management (engine, weapons, shields) is interesting, and on the surface the game feels like it is trying to marry the best parts of freelancer with those from the x series (which means many things immediately make sense if you have played those games before).However. Somehow the game feels like a chore; something I am willing myself to play in the hope that if I continue a bit further it will finally become exciting and turn into the great game it has the potential to be.The story is inherently boring. Fly from A to B, listen to some terrible voice-overs, destroy a target (ambushes being optional), get an (uninteresting and unusable) item and no real information other than ""fly to XYZ to get more info"". But you need to grind a few side missions first to level up enough for that. Rinse and repeat. I have lost all interest in the main story and there is just nothing that compels me to continue playing it.The other sidequests and missions are okay, but also very repetitive. The difficulty rating of these is useless, as some missions (e.g. science, maintenance, taxi, ferry) are childishly easy, whereas others (e.g. assasination, station defence) become really hard quickly unless you sink all your money into your fighting capabilities. Importantly the missions don't pay enough in my eyes to make them worthwile. I found boarding other small ships much more lucrative. And flying through space feeling like you are a towing service is just not fun for long. These side missions quickly turn into mindless grinding.There are many other things that bug me (not even to mention the numerous bugs I encountered already) that make this game a ""no"" for me:The fighting is super boring; most of the time I just sit there with my turrents firing automatically and I don't do anything other than watch. Ships feel very small and their speed and maneuverability do not seem to decrease with size as far as I can tell (there is no ""speed"" property you could check when buying a ship). There is no good fast travel: gates are too expensive, wormholes regularly throw you out at the wrong location (and what is it with that terrible, terrible animation you are shown after you have flown into a wormhole?) and those ""green highways"" seem a bit pointless; most importantly while all of these move you long distances quickly they don't allow to quickly travel to something that is say halfway of that distance. Factions have no character and no individual story making them pointless really. The energy transfer management can only be used effectively by dragging it around with your mouse; there are no customizable settings to be activated through a button, e.g. a ""hit and run"" (50% engine, 50% weapons). Skills have no real impact: I have put all my skillpoints into one particular tree (beam weapons) and I still can't tell the difference before and after I activated the skill, with the promised increase in range definitely not working. The game cannot be played effectively with a joystick: some button commands cannot be changed (e.g. closing window, using skill, cycle through tabs in the store) while others simply are not recognized or don't work; also you can't use a mouse to quickly navigate say the store and star map.There are many more things that have added to me not liking this game, but those are probably too specific to me to be really useful for other players.Tl;DR: Repetive missions, bad main story, boring fights, lots of mindless grinding, terrible voice acting, the whole universe feels characterless and the joysticks can't be used effectively. While it is trying to combine the best things of previously succesful spacesims (freelance, x3) it does not get it right.			"

												So I thought I’d wait before writing this review until I got at least 10h+ gameplay and finished the “story”. So at the time I’m writing this I got 43h+, and just finished the game. My favorite space game of all time is probably Freelancer, and other games I’ve tried haven’t even come close to it. But when I heard about Starpoint Gemini 2 I got my hopes up a little. Started following the game, checked in-game videos and such, and I got very interested. So I decied to buy it a week before the release cause it was on sale. It’s a good game. If you, like me enjoyed freelancer then you will no doubt enjoy this aswell. It’s not as good,  but it’s definitely not a bad game. The RPG elements are an interesting addition to the game. You start of by choosing your “class” which are:  Commander, Gunner and Engineer all with different set of skills. Depending on your play style if you prefer being in a small group of ships or just pure loner/dogfighter etc, I think most players will find these classes interesting.Alright, now to the positive and negative aspects of the game: I really liked the “feel” of the ships, smaller ships are easier to maneuver while the bigger ones are heavier, and I like that “feeling” it really does feel like you are flying a ship. So the developers got that down quite well, spot on. I do wish they would have added like a secret ship(s) that could only be found and bought at a specific place that was hidden.   And continuing on the topic of ships, there are A LOT of them to buy. Allthough you will be very discouraged with the prices in the beginning, but don’t worry cash will eventually start flowing in. Just do side missions or if you prefer mining or trading etc. The map is huge, and you have a lot of exploring to do if you’re into that. Just wish there were more things to explore, more secrets and mysterious anomalies etc. There isn’t really any suprises or “wtf” moments in this game, which is sad. No mystery. The graphics are awesome, no complaints here it’s a living world and the designs are nice. The sounds and music are awesome. But…I really wish they would use at least more than just ONE battle tune, cause it gets reaaally tiring to be hearing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again. Specially since battle is a big part of the game. Would it have hurt to put in at least 2 more songs in? Other than that the rest of the songs are awesome, it really suits the mood and game.There are also enemy heroes in this game, which all have bounties on them. And they give you a lot of cash, I totally missed this feature when I started playing so it took forever for me to get cash in the beginning. So that’s a nice feature, but would have been even more interesting if they had like one final hero that was nearly impossible to beat, unless you were leveled up to the max with the best ship etc. Now to some of the negative aspects of the game: Map travel, when you press M or whatever button to bring up the map, the game pauses…so while you check your map and try to plan ahead for your future travels, the game is on pause and you don’t progress at all. So while I was travelling to this planet, and checking the map at the same time I noticed I was right where I left of. So that’s annoying.The autopilot fails a lot of the times. It only does this after you have docked with a starbase and you click on your next destination to go there autopilot, most of the times it just freaks out and takes you in circles.The voice acting in this game is a big joke. And not in a good way either, cause sometimes bad voice acting can at least make you laugh, but this was just…ugh.The storyline is nonexistent. Which is really sad cause of the big universe the developers built up they could have written such a better story for this game. So if you buy this thinking it will have a nice or at least mediocre story, rethink why you want this game. Im not saying not to buy it, beacuse the good things outweighs the bad in this game. So to end this I’d say it probably is the best new single player space game out right now.I’d give this game a 7/10+Many ships to buy+Huge map, a lot to explore+Pretty graphics+Music+Enemy Heroes+RPG elements-Maptravel-Music-Bad voice acting-♥♥♥♥ story-Autopilot fails			"

												I have mixed feelings for this game. I wish I could make the review neutral. It's a space sandbox where you roam Gemini system, complete easy single objective quests, get money and buy better ships and guns. The game is quite slow-paced, and you'll probably want an open book at your table, so you can read it while your ship travels to whatever waypoint you've set. The combat system is pretty simple, devs probably wanted this game to be chilling instead of intense. Positive moments:- Beautiful space vistas and ships.- You can destroy enemies, you can mine asteroids, you can buy things in one place to sell in another. It's a sandbox.- A free DLC with alternative campaign from the first game.Negative moments:- The story is mediochre, we've seen all this a thousand times before.- Voice acting in campaign is pretty bad.- My PC fits the requirements, and yet the performance is really bad. I experienced crashes in long sessions too.- Once you get yourself a carrier class vessel, you'll find out that there's like nothing else to do. You can bother yourself with achievements, but it isn't that fun.- Unrealistic game world. Nebulas within a solar system, asteroids gathered in clouds rather than in rings, tiny planets and stars, you only fly forward when your engines are on: your ship stops once you turned them off, like a car would. I understand that it all was done to make the game less boring and more saturated with content, but it fells just toyish.Starpoint Gemini 2 is still fun to play, even with the flaws I listed, but I can't recommend it for the full price. If you're into space, get it when on sale.			"

												When I was a young adult (28) I bought an Amstrad CPC 8-bit computer and a cassette with the game ""Elite"" on it. I played that religiously at least a year and after that again every now and then. The graphics were underwhelming (green wire graphic), the plot practically non-existent. There were only 8 ""missions"" I knew of and the grind to get to Elite level was enormous.I looked for such a game a long time after that. Freelancer was a good try. The direct Elite successors were overdone and technically underwhelming. After a while I gave up.Then I stumbled over SPG2. And here it is again. Nearly. The freedom to do what I want, the grind to get to the top and a vast universe. For such a game it is important that the combat is interesting, and it is. If you are level 20+ you will encounter more than one enemy at a time, and then you will have your hands full.Here a pro and con list:+ Graphics are good. Not brillant, but good.+ You are free! You may do what you want. You can safely ignore the main quest if you want.+ You can capture ships. That is not only very profitable but also fun and later on you have to be quite skillful to pull that off (with battleships and the like).+ The map is huge.+ Fighting feels great.+ Your character has levels, perks and skills. And they are surprisingly useful (I play an engineer). And fun.+ You have to learn the UI but after the initial learning process it is very functional.+ You can change all keys. And you should change at least some.+ There is a nice levelling curve. It could be even slower, to be honest...+ There are secrets in the game. A secret station I just discovered (named after an astronomer, won't spoil it too much), sectors with radioactivity, anomalies and so on.+ If you don't know what to do you can do an automatically generated mission. They are endless.+ You can save only on a station. I like that because it means you risk a bit if you venture outside. But only a bit. Just the right amount :)+ The developers are very active and really trying to please their customers.- Trading is not risk free (there are enemies out there) and not profitable. That is not well designed because either you avoid risk and gain or take risks and get profit, but the trading option means that you take the worst from both worlds.- While there is a reputation system it is not individual to each of the factions. You are evil or good (or something in between). If you are ""good"" you are liked by all lawful factions. If you are evil you are liked by all evil factions. That could be more individualized.- The main quest has quite a boring plot and is not written very well. The voiceovers are horrible. These accents!- The map is not endless. That is not a big disadvantage because it is huge as it is. But it would be nice to have an option to generate a new ""universe"" procedurally.- If you land at a station the graphics are disappointing. It is nothing more than a greyed-out picture of you in front of the station. You don't feel you are on the station, you feel you are in a system menu.- The full screen mode does not work every time. On Windows 8.1, NVidia 760, full screen mode is only achieved after I start the game the second time. That is a bit unprofessional...Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10Developers: 10/10Main Quest: 3/10Combat: 9/10Feeling of Progress: 9/10Overall: 9/10Good: if you like Elite or Freelancer.Not that good: if you like X, X2, X3.I bought it in a sale but it is worth its normal price and then some.

												Highly recommended! This game is similar to so many other games, yet so different in every aspect. These guys really offered something special.And if you have a question, devs are answering them on Steam forums 24/7. Something that is rarely seen. My boyfriend got me this game cause I liked Evochron Mercenary. I'm as happy as I can be with it. Highly addictive and fun!Thumbs up!Update: After so many hours, I still feel compelled to return to the game from time to time. I left my heart in Gemini, it would seem. :)			"

												I'm 60+ hours into the game as I write this review. I have to say that I haven't played space sims for a while but do have fond memories of Freespace 2, Wing Commander, Privateer, Freelancer and Darkstar 1. The good news is that SG2 has some interesting elements. Could it be better? Sure, but let's get to the nitty-gritty. There are 3 things I'll comment on: RPG elements, SIM elements, and GAMEPLAY elements.RPG:·	Not great -- voice acting is poor, and I don't really care much about the storylines (I have Origins, Aethera and Titans DLCs), which I feel could be better or more compelling.·	Not enough random events by NPCs, etc. The universe is constantly changing economically, politically but it doesn't feel ALIVE. The characters seem dead.·	There is a points/perk system where you can improve your character but that's about it.·	You get some credits and blueprints for completing campaign missions (no medals or other perks). The blueprint reward system is interesting but really tough to complete a whole set, so what's the point, really? ·	The NPCs you deal with are flat and uninteresting. Oh and the voice acting sucks. Or did I mention that already?SIM:·	This is supposed to be a space sim, but many controls are lacking. e.g. You can't coordinate attacks with wingmen or give them specific orders.·	Other sims even let you contact NPCs/wingmen over comms; not here.·	Combat is simplified -- which may or may not be a good thing. i.e. You have an auto-fire button for your light weapons, and a key for your heavy weapon. You have to be facing your opponent appropriately before other non-frontal weapons will fire. Sometimes the AI fires at other targets even when you're locked on the nearest one.·	There doesn't seem to be full support for my Thrustmaster -- I can't map the buttons, nor does it allow me to use a Joystick / keyboard combo. There is a turret cam view that can be useful, but without my joystick, it's pretty pointless.GAMEPLAY:·	Pretty graphics·	Fun sandbox (free play) mode. I actually spent more time here than on the campaigns.·	These are cool: Space stations, T-gates, T-drive travel, worm hole travel, boarding ships,          officers and mercs you can hire·	Lots to explore·	Faction/reputation tracking system·	Very useful star map with overlays and filters·	Game seems skewed towards battle; i.e. hard to get rich through the economic modelOverall:The game world is pretty. While the devs try to create a decent economic model, I'm not quite sure it succeeds. You can't really make much cash that way. The quickest way is to board and capture ships with your troopers, then sell the vessel, or through bounty-hunting. This skews the game towards a combat model -- not complaining, mind you, but if you want to have a robust economic model, well, then make it workable. Players should be able to make MORE money through mining, gas clouds, and trading. There's a fair bit of grinding involved if you want to play a merchant. This is a shame because there is an excellent transport infrastructure -- i.e. you can travel vast distances using T-gates, rifts, worm holes, etc.I like the fact that there's sandbox mode and campaign mode. Having hangars and your own fighters/bombers is a nice touch; and being able to beam your troopers to enemy vessels to try capturing them is fun. All in all, SG2 is an entertaining and pretty game, but it falls short of being great -- more RPG elements would help, and of course, proper joystick support... and yeah, the voice acting sucks! I would recommend getting it only if it's on sale. 6.5/10.0			"

												At a glance Starpoint Gemeni 2 is a sandbox space sim, nothing special and it has been done better before.I could live with it if the game features an interesting story, which the game does. The game also has a tendency to crash during or shortly after finishing a story mission which makes it a race to reach a save point before the game crashes and you need to redo the mission. So the redemption from story doesn't apply. If anything it just makes me more frustrated.Looking further into the game, you realize it is a single player MMORPG, ship upgrades are gated behind arbitrary level requirements. Ships handle basically the same except for the top speed, so your carrier is just as agile as the starting gunship.Weapon upgrades follow a similar MMORPG route, some weapons are poor and you go through the game trying to find better weapons. Weapons that are described in awkward and sometimes even incorrect ways, such as ""rate of fire"" being the delay between each shot. Once you get over the initial hump of how weapons operate you realize you need a calculator to figure out which weapon to use.Sure I can play this, but all the time doing so there is a thought in my head asking why I am playing this game when I have better games available.Edit: 2015-11-25I just wanted to add that this game isn't necessarily bad, if they fixed the weapon descriptions and the crashes I'd actually consider recommend it.I consider the X-series, especially X-3, to be more enjoyable. I do not want to advertise for other games in a review, which is why this was at first omnitted, but since so many replies have been about it I'll add it.			"

												This game will give you hours of fun, not a fast pace action packed in your face game but the strategic plan your every move with every action having consequences game. In saying that the combat is very rewarding with many battles containing the fast pace action (if you manuver your ship properly to avoid incoming damage and allow your weapons to target correctly while adjusting speed, shields and/or gunnery). Interface gets the job done but can take a few minutes to understand which isn't a negative with a great tutorial that can be accessed at any time if you forget something. There are not many camera angles which I look forward to an update on this to make a more fluid experience especially in combat (there is free move camera angle which can hinder while flying and looking around). I truly would enjoy a cockpit view from the captains chair to feel really immersed while mining or ship to ship combat. I also want to see more interactivity with planets and stations ( one suggestion would be allowing the player to approach an enemy planet to try a diplomatic or subversion mission to change the flow of power/status of that planet).  In a nutshell try this game it makes for a great space flying simulator.			"

												I see a lot of negative reviews for this game, and while it may be a bit repetative, I can't find any 3-D space RPGs that are as easy to control and not just pure spaceflight ""simulator"". The story and voice-overs are what you would expect from a space rpg, however that shouldn't really be the reason you play this game. In my opinion, I have had loads of fun warping all over the galaxy doing manuevers around large carries and owning pirates and rebels with my plasma cannons and missiles. The amount of customizibility with your ship is off the chart for this game, however once you find your playing style and the best gear for that style you are kind of set. You can also download other peoples mods and get fan made ships or docking hangers and other cool weapons not found in-game which is pretty sweet that the devs opened it up for modding.All in all, this is a quality game that I went back and purchased the DLC's for because I thought the price justified the entertainment. If you like space games like the original escape velocity, or games like the app galaxy on fire you will like this game a lot. 8/10			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 recently left Early Access, and it is now one of the few games of that honour to actually turn out well. If I was to compare it to anything, I'd say it's like Freelancer or an offline EVE, though not quite as complex as the latter. Complete sandbox freedom. Go wherever you want and be whatever you want, whether that be a trader, pirate, mercenary, miner, fighter, explorer etc. Though it is a space sim, it also plays a lot like an open world RPG. You pick from three different classes - COMMANDER: has a focus on buffing friendly units, GUNNER: all about maximising firepower and ENGINEER:  boosting your own power systems and hacking/debuffing the enemy - and go around doing freelance missions, mining, fighting or exploring, and it all gives you XP (and sometimes money) to level up your character. Levelling gives you the ability to spend points on improving your class skills, which can be used in battle, and attaining perks, which provide buffs to a number of things like increasing troop strength for boarding ships or improving trade prices.Besides the sandbox 'Freeroam' mode where you are able to freely explore, there is also a recently added Campaign mode. This provides you with story missions, but you lose the ability to pick your class, character portrait or choose from one of the three starter ships (it forces you into a Taurus ship, arguably the best of the three anyway). The story isn't great, and it's a little buggy, but you can still freely explore and do whatever you want while doing it. The story missions are not particularly interesting (go from point A to B, kill target, deliver package, meet NPC etc), but they give you something else to do. If you're feeling aimless and not sure what to do next, the campaign missions can be a good way to provide yourself with a sort of goal or objective. Each mission will advance in level and difficulty, and you will often find yourself needing to gain XP and a more powerful ship in order to advance. I found that It added to the feeling of progression, albeit in a not very interesting way. It's completely optional, but I personally had no interest in it.There are nearly a hundred ships to acquire by either buying them or grappling and boarding an enemy ship, killing the crew and towing it back to a nearby station to either sell ( for a very high price ;] ) or place in your garage for use, and they are all customisable. You can equip them with a variety of different weapons like railguns, plasma cannons, beam weapons and heavy weapons. You can enhance your systems by purchasing upgrades for things like your propulsion engines or shield generators. You can even give them a new paint job and add decals, though the colours don't stand out too well and the decals are just a short list of basic emblems. You do have the ability to add your own custom ones, but I didn't mess around with that feature. They're nice cosmetic touches, but nothing to rave about. The boarding is also fully automated and you don't actually get to see anything happening. It's nothing more than watching troop numbers rise and fall and choosing whether or not to send reinforcements. Quite unexciting to say the least, but stealing ships this way will be your main source of income, and managing to capture an expensive ship still gave me a lovely feeling of satisfaction despite the lack of a more involved system.Your ship is freely controlled, you can fly it yourself wherever you wish with the WASD keys and your mouse. You also must manage your power output. Do you divert all power to engines to give yourself a speed boost, to shields to make them hold out longer, to weapons so they fire for longer or do you try to balance between them all? It's very situational and you will find yourself having to tweak it back and forth very often when travelling and in combat. It's a system I quite enjoy as it keeps you occupied and helps with keeping the combat and travel feeling busy.Speaking of combat, it's very fun, though not too complex. You can aim and fire your weapons yourself or have it done for you with autofire (though it can be inaccurate at times) and positioning is key. You and your enemy have four directional shields, one for each side, and each decreases under fire accordingly, meaning you should focus fire on one side if you wish to do optimal damage. If any of you have played Star Trek Online, the shielding is pretty similar to what that game has. You also have a choice of four skills, which differ depending on your choice of class. Each provides some sort of combat buff and can be levelled to add more effects. On top of that, there are then a multitude of items you can purchase and use whenever you wish, such as temporary speed boosters, repair drones or T-Drives (these allow you to instantaneously jump great distances) and a variety of other things. If used right, they can really save you when in a tight spot.One issue with the combat however, is balance. I often found myself easily destroying ships marked as 'impossible' targets to beat due to having bought a reasonably expensive weapon or by managing to acquire a powerful ship. This can really mess with the early game and make it far too easy. It does begin to even out the further you level due to enemy scaling, but as long as you continue upgrading, it never gets difficult enough. This is tricky to do however and really only becomes a problem once you're comfortable and good at the game, which takes time.Overall, and despite some flaws, I believe this to be a good game with a lot of love and care put into it by the devs. It is just oozing with content and interesting, well polished mechanics. If the developer's words are anything to go by, a huge list of future content is still planned for Starpoint Gemini 2 and all of it will, supposedly, be completely free of charge. Hopefully a game to keep your eye on.I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of space sims, sandbox titles and even people who are awaiting Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen. It's not overly complex and it does lean a little more on the arcadey side of things, but despite that, it's still a deep enough experience to sink some enjoyable hours into.Score: 7/10			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a great space rpg.usually a statement like that needs clarification, so here we go. this game is basically if you took the most complicated parts out of games like x, opened up the game world like evochron mercenary and throw in a control system not unlike eve online. what im getting at is that its not as complicated to play as the aforementioned games but leaves the best parts of each and marries them into a system thats fresh and familiar.one of the things that irritated me about the x series and evochron for that matter is that missions had to be acquired at a station. my question has always been, why? no long range communications in either universe? in SPG2 that is a thing of the past, when you enter an area, you will be notified when missions are available and you can accept missions directly from the starmap which brings me to the next point. the starmap is one contigious area, like in evochron, there are no load screeens and while the actual area is smaller than evochron, its a lot more detailed visually. so yes its probably not 100% true to life because there are very few areas that just look like a black void in space, but the visuals are well done and give you more to look at than just black with white dots everywhere.controls are reminicent of eve online though i havent played it in years, it reminds me of that. not necessarily a terrible thing, but if you are looking to find yourself in the cockpit of the ship, these ships dont feature cockpits. if anything even the smallest class available would have a bridge. so in comparison to the ships in X or EM, youre piloting a capital ship right off the bat. in fact to give some comparison, the M5 through M3 classes of ships in X are basically bought as commodities to place in the hangar of carriers. you wont be flying anything that small and if you were, youd have reason to be very very afraid. it would seem that the gemini system doesnt build much of anything in small scale :)As of this writing there are a few technical issues that arent game breaking but considering the devlopment team is very active and even communicates with the players regularly i feel that this game will evolve into something even better. if you like rpgs and space games, this will be right up your alley. LGM has done a great job keeping the game fun and challenging without making it a nightmare to learn how to play.			"

												I wish there was a ""meh"" button along with thumbs up and thumbs down. Bought it after getting burned out on Elite Dangerous in hopes that it would scratch my space sim itch. One one hand, the scale just isn't there. You tool around a single smallish star system littered with stations, planets, teleportation gates and even a couple black holes and nebulae for some reason. The space is also dirty, dusty and littlered - no, really - there are chunks of rock and clouds of dust constantly whizzing by (fortunately there are mods that get rid of that). There's no hyperspacing to other systems or exploring the galaxy. I guess it's a little bit like the Expanse TV series.On the oher hand, during ship combat the scale is pretty faithful - you blast your cannons in the general direction of someone flying around you in the darkness, and all you see of the opposing ship is the big red target marker. Eventually, one of you blows up. The only way to take a closer look is to approach to boarding distance, which I have to admit is a nice touch. Between that and a rather obtuse camera, the space combat experience is underwhelming.The game isn't bad, it's just kind of lackluster. You can tell that it was made by a tiny studio on a limited budget. I know LGM tried hard, but neither the visuals nor the sound can hold a candle to the current-gen games. After seeing the visuals delivered by Elite and even the unfinished mess that is Star Citizen, you soon notice the janky-looking engine exhaust, low-budget pewpew effects and simplistic ships.It also has some issues outside of the weird camera, the most glaring being a graphics crash (blank screen) in full-screen mode. Since you can only save in stations, this can wipe out a lot of progress.Let me put it this way: this is a chill spaceflight game (not a sim) in the similar vein as Rogue Galaxy, and it was worth the purchase price of $6.50 with all DLCs during the sale. I wouldn't pay more than that.			"

								SPG2 is a great game. It's in another league compared to the original. The graphics are spot on, and for an alpha game, it has the signs of being a classic.More importantly, it has a great  community. The devs are always around and quick to answer any questions, and they actually listen and support their player base. This is what gaming is missing these days from the ""AAA"" developers.

												Starpoint Gemini feels like a PC game I played when I was younger. It's relatively rough around the edges and there is nothing groundbreaking about the graphics--but it represents a kind of space exploration game in a very cohesive package. The soundtrack is filled with ambient electronica and is a real highlight for me; scanning pulsars and exploring unknown reaches of space feels extremely gratifying and peaceful at the same time.The game itself lets you explore space however you choose: you can become a merchant flying cargo through sectors, a bounty hunter going after pirates, an explorer of the universe and scanning anomalies and space oddities etc, etc. It's a game with great potential that doesn't hold you hand from start to finish. If you have any interest in Sci-fi/space exploration games (Freelancer/Star Trek: Bridge Commander/Eve Online) this game does a great job filling that role.			"

												Starpoing Gemini 2 is a humbling game.  It isn't on the scale of some star exploration games, being in only one star system.  But where it lacks in size to its competition, it makes up for it with sheer density and diversity in play.  You can be a star trader, pirate, a security operative, or... yes, even a mere space station mechanic -- only accepting missions to repair other space stations to earn your money.  The combat is intelligent and engaging, but not too challenging.  The only drawback is I cannot bring my friends in.  But with a list of objectives like I have in this, who has time for them?  time to go kill some pirates and steal whatever they've stolen, and sell it!  BETTER SHIPS ♥♥♥♥♥ES "

												I would not recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore fans of the genre, and that provided the price comes down. While I do acknowledge some might enjoy the tedium and vaccum, neither I, nor any of my friends did. Core mechanics are grind, fetch&kill 'quests' and exploration. You also pick up things and sell them off at the nearest friendly station, or buy things at one point and sell them to a trader across the map for profit. The game world is huge and fun to explore at first, but given the lack of variety (it is space, after all) it will get boring afer a while. Combat is nothing like a proper space sim - you either get projectile weapons and miss, or directed energy (beam) weapons and hit 100% of the time via automatic turrets. These make the whole combat thing ridiculous - all the fun is outsourced to your onboard computer. The game seems to be balanced with this in mind - you can either turn on the auto tracking and let the computer do the fighting or die. Fun parts:-exploration. the playing environment is huge! Volumetric shadows, nebulas, asteroid and debris fields and planets are stunning. It does get old after a while given the game's shortcomings -visuals as per above. Nothing you haven't seen in X3 already though-ship designs & varietyThe not-so-fun parts:-tedious, fetch&kill tasks that pass for quests here; gets old in about 10 minutes -the game is vacuous. think mmo without quests or other players. -as of now the game is bugged and some options are greyed out. No, despite what the industry standard for indie games seems to have become lately, it is not okay to release an unfinished game with greyed out options and scenarios that 'will be added later on'. That's what early access is for!-repetitive, unaccomplished space combat-the 'RPG' portion of the game comes down to several global stat boosts and 4 active skills, which I've not seen to have any serious impact on the game			"

												I am a SUCKER for space exploration games (I even played Darkstar One, and it was mediocre at best). An yet I did not like this one. This has mainly three reasons:* The story (what little I have played before giving up on the game) is not riveting and seems to follow already trodden paths (trodden by games far superior). The whole ""The system is riven with conflict and there is some hidden threat only YOU can uncover"" is nice and dandy, but again, done better by previous games. The voice acting is .. unethusiastic. I know, I have been spoiled by world-class actin as in Mass Effect, but still...There is a lot of grinding - trading, mining, doing freelance missions, to get a ship that you need to NOT be blasted to smithereens by the next main mission,. There ALWAYS is. It is a core principle of the game, and usually, one that I like. In this game, it feels like a chore. This has again to do with the story, which just does nothing to make me want to reach the next mission.* The steering. This is a MAYOR point. I did not think one could botch follow-the-mouse-steering. Sadly, one can. The point you fly to is somewhere in the upper third of the monitor. Which KINDA makes sense given the perspective and the axis of the ship and all. BUT the neutral zone of the mouse-steering is in the center of the screen. Which means that when you point at an object an try to fly towards it, you will pass OVER it (for given values of ""OVER"" in 3D space).This is annoying, to say the least. It is also unintuitive. I remember when Freelancer made me use the mouse (for me, it was the first time then) to steer the ship. I took to it in seconds, because it was so intuitive. Well, this one is NOT.* The mission system is bugged, if not broken. ""Yes, you can take this mission with level 6"" Great. They WHY is there a friggin' CRUISER waiting for my gunship at the mission point, blasting the living hell out of me? This happens regularly, and it is annoying. ""Nooo, THIS science mission is WAY to dangerous, it requires you to be level 11."" Ah-ha. So floating in space, with NO enemies to pop up (I have yet to meet one on science missions) and waiting for the scanner is something only my higher-level self can handle.. All those points make me kinda regret the purchase. Oh, and one final note: it may be okay with copyright law to use the theme from the mining minigame of Mass Effect 2 and use in the score, for me, it was just an INSULT to the ME franchise, because this game is not even doing the same sport, not not mention playing in the same league.

												A worthy addition to your steam space strategy titles. It starts off a little grindy but once you get over the initial credit problems the fun really begins. Over 70 ships to buy and fly from gunships all the way up to carriers and dreadnoughts. You can trade and fight across a large area with many many different factions.Customize your ship how you like with different officers, weapons and equipment and choose from a large amount of skills and perks to further compliment your ship.There are two modes to play, campaign for a single player story and sandbox. The effort has obviously been put into the sandbox over the campaign.One really annoying problem and probably the only major one for me is the abyssmal camera control. Something that should be bread and butter for a game of this type. you have to use something called turret mode to get anywhere near the type of camera your used to in just about every other game of this type. Unfortunately even turret mode is a floodlight type chase cam.Despite the camera problem I heartily recommend this game for anyone who is missing a fix of space goodness.Here is a taste of cruiser gameplay:

												Very good Freelancer-like spaceships game. Very nice graphics, playability and effects. A lot of ships which are actually different one from one to another. There's not just the boring small-big-bigger-huge mechanics mixed with the Light-Heavy-Trader axis. With different stats (cargo load, soldiers, weapon spots etc) the choice between one model and the other seems to have some meaning. Trading is a bit basic, although the map is very large and there are a lot different goods with different degrees of ""rareness"". Main campaign not so exciting but with some twists and cutplay more than decent. Big plus: the company is still supporting the game with fixes, adds and patches. Without asking you for more money. Much wows, so honest, many pleasant.			"

												It took nearly 20 hours to finally come to a conclusion on this game.Despite all efforts made to make the combat complex - energy management, 4 different active abilities (with a kinda silly feeling levelups with them),  and up to 4 consumable items (of a selection of around a dozen) useful for combat - it just isn't all that fun. I believe the biggest culprit is turrets. While it is possible to partially blindside a less maneuverable ship than yours in 1v1, ultimately maneuvering and dodging in combat is best done by spinning around in circles. When you're spinning around in circles, you can't effectively target and attack targets manually, and so you rely on fire-at-will auto targetting to do that job for you. This is boring.The economy is workable, but not that interesting - different stations have a set low-mid-high value for all of the commodities. Buy and sell appropriately.The storyline is workable. The Gemini universe is interesting, and is worth reading about if you're into that sort of thing. The storyline does an almost adequate job of immersing you in that universe. The voice acting/writing is awwwwwwful.The good: All around, this is a workable game that will scratch your spacefaring itch, though will likely not leave you satisfied. The graphics are beautiful, each region of space is very well stylized in the coloring, asteroids, and various anomalies. Plenty of the starbases and ships have pretty unique detailed models. Music and sound are good, although the short soundtrack for the music is a mild disappointment there.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a complete turn-around from the quality of the first game. It's prettier, it's satisfyingly complex and most of all, it's a lot of fun. It's blend of RPG elements, freeroaming gameplay and atmosphere is great, and pretty well refined. While the voice acting isn't anything to write home about, the simple joy of adjusting the loadout for your ships, hiring officers, mercs and troopers, and leveling up can be downright intoxicating. A couple small issues nag at me, however. At the time of this review, the ability to adjust shadow quality or post-processing in the video options menu is still locked. There are some balancing issues that make themselves painfully apparent within the first hour or so of gameplay, namely the rate at which you accrue money. Tackling big number bounties might seem like a great idea, but they're prohibitively difficult (as of level 7, all the available bounties were way way out of my level range) and grinding freelance missions can sometimes feel monotonous. Additionally, the lack of communications chatter between ships can make space feel somewhat sterile. When rescuing a ship from pirates, it would be great to hear a panicked captain's voice pleading for assistance, or thanking me for the help. These are minor gripes about what amounts to an overall great experience.Granted, I haven't played through a ton of the story campaign content, and my time with the game might be small compared to others, but having seen such a triumphant turn-around from the first entry, I felt compelled to gush a little bit, and congratulate the developers. Well done, guys! I tend to not be one to jump on the early access titles very often, but it was honestly really cool watching the development of this game, seeing community input being utilized, and watching something grow from nothing. I can say truthfully that I don't regret purchasing this game during early access in the least.4 out of 5 stars.			"

												I love space sim, Freelancer, Freespace, etc. and I hoped for this game to be another like them. But unfortunately no. Graphis is good, ships nice, weapons too. But..Why have only turrets? And camera binded to them?Why such dumb camera controls? Even with joystick it's not like space sim.Why so slow travelling without time acceleration?I've tried it for a few hours, but no, I am dissapointed, I was looking forward to this game. Maybe I will try to play it another year if those issues would be solved.			"

												With only 3 hours play this is only first thoughts.A worthy title. If you have played any of the X series of games this is it's younger and not so complicated brother. In some ways it is more like Freelancer but either way it has nods to all these games whilst keeping it light on the learning curve. You can jump right in and start blasting asteroids for early bucks and the early missions (freeplay) are doable with the starting ship.I have several mods that give me Star Trek ships and a Star Wars universe to roam in which are both from the Steam Workshop.In short (in earlry play) this is an instantly playable space trading/shooter that looks and feels great but don't expect the depth that the X series has (which for some people will be perfect ;) )7/10 Go give an asteroid a new bumhole.

												This game was a big surprise for me. I was never much into heavy stuff like Star Citizen with their real physics and hardcore gaming. SPG2 is fun, entertaining, tense, interesting, relaxing, I cannot describe it in a few words. I found this by accident and decided to give it a try. It blew me away. Please, give it a shot. I doubt you'll regret it. Can't wait to see what will they come up with next! 11 out of 10!Update Jun 2016. Seeing and playing Warlords, you can tell how deeply these devs care about their players. Warlords is so much bigger and with so many stuff people wanted in SPG2, that I can recommend it over SPG2. But if you're relatively new to the genre, this gem is currently on massive 80% off and it's worth every cent.			"

								Fun game.  Beta is smooth and enjoyable.  I hope for more depth of play in storyline missions and random missions.  I hope for a HUD feature that shows stats on targets even when they aren't in front of you ""on-screen"".  Good for a beta.  4/5.			"

Early Access Review
								Overall, it's a very, very good game. I've split this review into a few categories, so maybe that'll help you find what matters most.- GameplayLet's be honest here. This game is about space combat, not about mining or scavenging or being a space taxi man. That's where the ""meat and potatoes"" of this game is. So this is the most important thing for this game to get right. If it fails at this, it fails as a game.And to its credit... gameplay is superb. Combat is fun, if a bit monotonous once you get a really powerful ship. It only keeps you on the edge of your seat when you're in real danger of losing your ship, such as when facing a really strong enemy while you're flying a much weaker ship, or a large fleet of enemies on your own.Capturing an enemy ship is very satisfying. Unfortunately, towing ships takes a very long time and can be quite boring, especially if you're being attacked by enemies the whole way there. This game is still in early access, so balancing will still happen, so we'll have to see where it goes. But for now, its an amazing game and I can't wait for more!There are a few immersion-breaking issues, though, such as the large delay, stutters and pauses when starting up the game, when entering a new area, when receiving new missions, or when auto-saving. However, since this is early access and not full release, we'll have to see what will become of these bugs.Score: 9/10- StorylineNone. At least none that I could find. While the game is tremendous fun on its own, with farming resources, capturing enemy ships and destroying enemy outposts, there doesn't seem to be any real purpose to it. At least not until the game is finished.The story is still being developed, as this is still an unfinished product. But if this turns out to be a game where the war between factions can have the tide of the war turned either way depending on the player's success or failure in certain missions, it could be very cool, especially if areas become owned by different factions thereafter.Score: Unknown (Not yet finished)- ControlsThe controls are nice and solid, with ships feeling very responsive (small ones) or sluggish (large ones) depending on size. The way a ship accelerates and breaks is also much more believable and immersive than you might believe from early footage. Trying to get a carrier to stop within 100m of a target feels like a feat of piloting at times.3D space combat has been perfect by this game. I've played many space combat games like Homeworld, Star Trek Online and several others. But this game nails it and then some. At first I didn't understand why all the buttons and controls were needed for. But after enough time playing, I get it. And the position of the keys and what they do really helps give you a great feeling of control in the game.Score: 10/10- Graphics and SoundLet's face it, as time marches forwards nobody wants to see ugly-looking games (unless they like Indie or retro games). And this game has some of the finest looking graphics one could hope for. They look beautiful, and even at 1440p on my GTX 650 Ti Boost 2GB it still performs smoothly (except when there are a lot of ships).Considering that this is on the low side of a mid-tier graphics card, I'm impressed. With more graphics settings I should be able to increase framerate, and coding optimizations should also help make the game run smoother in the long term.Sound wasn't much of a focus on this game, but the chatter and computer voice are really nice, and remind me a lot of the voice of the Enterprise-D in Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was a heart-warming surprise, and I can't wait until we get a total conversion mod for Starpoint Gemini 2.The lack of a large variety of background music did feel a bit annoying and lackluster, but time will fix that. I'd love to have this game include beautiful symphonic and orchestral music, like Star Wars, Star Trek, and other great SciFi series. Music could really help take this game to the next level.Score: 7/10- ChallengeThe game felt off-balance at several points during my dozens of hours playing so far. Capturing a large ship early on and using it felt almost like cheating on Normal difficulty. I'd like to see more balancing, such as not being able to use more than X amount of turrets on a ship depending on how many ranks below its minimum requirement you are. (So, if you're level 25 and trying to use a level 35 ship, you wouldn't be able to use 2 turrets in each direction.)The long-term replay-ability right now is hindered because the game hasn't really given players much of an end-game challenge or reward system. Once you have earned 50M credits, and have several Dreadnoughts in your garage, the game just doesn't feel challenging anymore.I'd like to see something to give the players the ability to hire commanders and bridge officers to command the ships in their garage, to they can join the player in large scale battles. This way it helps the player build his very own Armada to wipe out large (and challenging) enemy structures.Right now all the fun is at the first 30 levels of the game. Once you reach that, it gets monotonous. But given the early development of this game, I think we can expect great things from it, especially with modding support.Score: 6/10- FunWhat can I say? I had a blast (no pun intended)! It was exciting and challenging for a long while, and it's consumed me for the past few days. I've lost sleep planning what my next ship upgrade should be, or where to lurk around under cloak waiting to capture the ship I wanted (but couldn't afford). Few games drag you in and hold your attention like that. All I can say is that I'm beyond impressed!Score: 9/10- ConclusionI guess here's what I've got to say. For a game on Early Access on Steam, this is as much promise as I could dream of. (Unless you count Star Citizen, but that isn't fair.) It's fun, exciting, supports modding... it just isn't finished.If you're looking to buy a whole package that's neatly wrapped up, ready to go, this game isn't for you. When you play an Early Access game, you're getting a sneak preview, you're beta-testing a game that will (of course) be filled with bugs (and your job is to report them), and your feedback this early on will also help shape where the game goes. You get to be involved in the creation of the game, and if it succeeds you get the satisfaction of knowing you helped a little.This is a sneak preview. It's a taste of what's to come. And so far, I like what I see. They've got the game where it counts. Now it's just a matter of the final touches like faction warfare, dynamic economy, trade blockade, storyline, and so on. But given how far this game has progressed, that shouldn't take too much longer. I haven't seen many bugs, and for 25$ right now this game is a steal!I give this game a wholehearted approval, and my recommendation to buy it. I can't wait to see what kind of amazing mods we'll see. Here's hoping the team that did the Star Trek Armada III mod for Sins of a Solar Empire can start working ASAP on Starpoint Gemini 2.			"

												Overall, I think this is a pretty fun game...just not worth the $40 they want for the game + DLC.  Given that it's been released for several years now, and apparently, is still full of bugs/missing mechanics that the dev's were promising would be fixed years ago, I don't think I'll be buying anything else by this company.  The Titan DLC was rather dissapointing, it was more of a God mode than additional content...once you're in a Titan, just hit fire at will, and a few seconds later, even fleets of carriers are goners...and there's only 2 enemy titans as opponents, once you've captured/destroyed them, you're pretty much invincible. Also, voiceovers frequently failed, the game would occasionally crash for no apparent reason, and planets/bases only stocking 1-3 of consumables is frankly annoying and ridiculous, particularly when it comes to those used for salvaging/mining.One thing I found particularly annoying, is that on the context menu, there is a button labled Follow.  None of the in-game tutorials mention this button, and as far I can tell, it remains greyed out no matter what you have selected...and does not work to let you follow any of your escort targets, or enemies, or anything else.  Nor does it work to tell hired mercs to ""follow"" you...apparently, it is one more vestige of over-ambitious devs that gave up on the game to move on to something else.I will mention that I have not tried any of the mods for the game, but as it stands by itself, it is definitely a product that did not live up to its potential....and the reputation system? Really? 1 kind of good vs. evil rep with all those factions? and if you go outlaw...its hilarious...once you can land on an outlaw planet, failing to smuggle on that planet moves your rep more towards outlaw(just like failing to smuggle on ""good"" planets), making outlaw factions(including that planet) more friendly...lol.I mean, how hard would it REALLY have been to include a reputation number for each faction?Don't get me wrong, I did find that game enjoyable overall...but there was so many constant things that made me feel like I was playing a beta instead of a game that had been released more than 3 years ago...

Early Access Review
								I had this game gifted to me by a friend(Thank you, Thune!), and it's easily one of the best space games I've played in awhile.  If you enjoyed the freedom that the X series gave you, but absolutely hated the UI(or lack there-of), this is a game to rectify that.Flying your ship is quite easy and fun, combat is rather fluid and in-line with the class of ship you're currently flying.  Combat is definitely part of the game, but certainly not the only aspect.  You can shoot asteroids for resources, scan anomalies, salvage wrecked vessels(of your own making via combat, or derelicts you find), send troops onto enemy ships in attempts to capture and then tow them to a station(strip them of fittings, sell them, or keep them for yourself), there's also trading between stations and planets.Everything you do awards some experience points(running missions, scanning anomalies, killing things, etc), which is then used to upgrade your character's abilities(weapon skills for railguns, lasers, plasma and heavy weapons; want your railgun shots to have a chance to fire twice with one volley?  A chance to penetrate shields and hit hull?  Longer bursts for your lasers?  Put points into the appropriate skills.)The devs are very active on the forums and always listen to the community, even adding community ideas into the game regularly.  They also really want the modding community to have as much control as possible to expand the game; as evidenced by the Steamworkshop support.I expect great things to be afoot for this game in the future, and even in early access it's fun to tinker around and see what you can get into.  The engine is solid and the dev team is very much hard at work, the community following the game is strong.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world space games with no loading screens.

								Starpoint Gemini 2 is not your ""typical"" Space Fighter game. When playing this game you need to treat your ships more as a ""crewed"" ship then a standard fighter ship. First mistake I made was trying to use my ship as a fighter, this reduced the amount of fire power and abilities of my ship greatly. Every ship in the game is a manned ship meaning turrets are controled by you or you can assign crew to operate them for you, leaving you the ability to keep them in line with the target. Its an extremely in depth game, and extremely fun. I'd highly recommend it to any one who is tired of the same old ""fighter craft in space"" game.			"

								I've been looking for a game like this for a long time. There are a lot of space games out there (and quite literally more coming by the day) but most focus on either small scale fighter combat (Freelancer / Freespace style), or large scale rts fleet combat (Sins of a Solar Empire / Home World). There isnt much of a selection when it comes to piloting your own larger class of ship from the helm. For those of you who enjoy the likes of Eve and Startrek Online i believe there will be much here you will enjoy. First impressions show a lot of potential and a fun RPG / progression system in place. The graphics are nice and the combat is enjoyable. I look forward to seeing more of what this game has to offer.			"

												Having just played through Rebel Galaxy, maybe I was expecting too much, but couldn't get into this.  It lacks cohesive vision, just feels like a bunch of different game systems tacked on, and thrown together, with nothing in particular being well done.  It's not terrible, just dull.  Combat is dull, trading is dull, the progression system is dull, weapon and ship variants, factions, characters, various ways of adding percentage bonuses to basic abilities, ship enhancement items, crew members you can hire, but nothing does anything interesting.  The story is barely more than a distraction.  The gameworld is just a bunch of planets and stations clumped together in a cubic space, with a binary star painted in the background, like the scenery behind a fishtank.  It's a space sim which seems to be created by people who have no interest in basic astronomy whatsoever.  Disappointing.			"

												As someone who loves space games, including strategy, simulation, sandbox, RPG, and almost any genre in space, I love this game.  Im an avid fan of X3: Terran Conflict and the X series in general.  Starpoint Gemini 2 has so many things right and is fun, simple, and rather elegant.  I highly recommend it.  However, as with all games, it does have drawbacks and a few not so great things. First off, Voice Acting-You will likely notice it straight away when you start the campaign.  The voice acting is certainly better than that in the original, however it is still poor.  Most characters have strange accents or inflections, strange pronunciations which are inconsitent between characters (specifically the word ""stasis"") and no emotional connection.  The main character, Adrian Faulkner, is basically monotone with no depth nor feeling thruout. As a man who just lost his father and is out for revenge, he is VERY boring.   So do not expect the story to be compelling on that count. Story/missions-The story in SPG2 is better that is was in the original, and seems more streamlined, however it still remains quite boring after a short while.  I understand the game is mostly freeroam/sandbox, so take this as you will.  However, the missions are a bit more diverse than the original with some capture stuff added in as well as some scanning and transporting.  But it still remains the standard ""Go Here, Kill/capture/scan/transport, Return, Listen to more dialogue""    So dont expect alot of diversity in missions.  Its pretty much the same with side missions and freelance. Gameplay-The gameplay is terrific. Its nice, simple, and easy to use.  Its easy to jump into the game and not have to learn 1000 controls or things to do.   However I personally miss some of the depth of controls and other minor things for the sake of immersion. (Thinking of X3) Ship models / aesthetic -The overall design, and texture of all ships and stations were fantastic and very intricate.  I might have to say they are some ofmy favorite ship designs in a long time.   Planets are ok, but lack proper scale.  Vigo at the start is almost the same size as planet trinity or at least pretty close.  Go look at planets in X3 and see proper scale.  However I understand such an accurate massive scale wouldnt work in an sandbox single system. Its something that many space games (mostly strategy games) do. In the end I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a nice, simple space sim with a bit of RPG elements thrown in.  You will get a good 40 or so hours out of it, then will lack anything to do. There are freelance missions that will repeat forever.			"

												The game keeps telling me to use things on the menu that simply don't exist at my level. Lack of ammo for the main weapon, 1990's looking HUD. When you land on a Planet, it's a photo. No attemp to feel like your on a far away civilization. Took 1/2 hour to figure out how to land on the planet w/o blowing up and having to do the ENTIRE mission over. SPOILER ALERT: Space travel is very slow. But for $8 what the heck. Someday I'll have time to get as high as the designers and figure out this frustration fubar.It's just seems to be more frustrating than what it's worth. Wormholes where none are being displayed, supposed upgrades are just terrible downgrades. Losing interest real fast. You're told to ""Follow"" a ship, yet the ""Follow button in the HuD is grey'd out; no way to match speed of ship you're following... It'll take hundreds, if not a thousand missions to afford a ship, worthy of making this game fun. Excuse me while I gladly step out of this air-lock.			"

												A game that surpass expectations and delivers countless hours of fun and excitement to any space Sim fan.I came across Starpoint Gemini 2 when the lack of time made me stop playing X3 Terran conflict/AP. I'm a huge fan of X series but the amount of options you have are so vast that consequently increases the complexity of the game and therefore the time you have to invest to progress. Unfortunately with work and all, I just stopped playing those majestic games.SPG2 is not that complex and therefore its perfect if you want most features that a space Sim should offer but in a simple and easy way. You still have it all... Trading, Mining, Piracy, Boarding and countless more things to do, just way more accessible.Recommend 100% "

								I see some potential, but it is a bit of a letdown if you're expecting something like Freelancer. The visuals are nice and there are lots of options for cargo and things like that, but the whole place just feels desolate. There is no signs of life anywhere. I mean, you see ships, but they seem like drones. There is zero com chatter or anything resembling conversation. The only one who talks to you is your ship. You never see any people when docked on space stations or planets. That really brought Freelancer to life, where you could talk to people in the station bars and get tips.

												Unfortunatly although the game has good reviews i found it mediocre to bad at some points. it has lousy ai (both pathfinding in space the ai keeps on bumping into stations or planets trying to go to the location you have picked) and with the ""fleet"" (2 ships as far as i saw max). You cant actually give them commands so a lot of times they will conflict with what you are trying to do (like board a ship and they will fire destroying it).The story is also mediocre and the VO is down right bad. There are too few side missions at least in the story mode (basically go destroy or capture target, repair or scan anomaly and move cargo/vip from station to station). The game is pretty at times ( i liked the varied ship art) and the music is quite good also at times. Would not recommend it unless really cheap 5 or less or you are bored with nothing else to play.			"

								This game is an excellent mix of the openness found in Freelancer and the tactical combat found in the Starfleet Command series. Even in its early phase, it's excellent. Wanna know more? Check out my videos!https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6K1_LepsaN8xYBV0AiMKna7qIvs2F74W "

								The old nerd in me wanted to get a space game.  Spent a week or to reseaching space games and decided i wanted an action\dogfighting style gameplay NOT a turned based one.  Im very fruggle with my $ and this game is a sold purchase.  The graphic, music/sound and gameplay seem to be spot on.			"

												When I first got this game, I played for about 10 minutes and was disinterested.  I really don't know why, perhaps I was a bit impatient that day.  About a week later I came back and really got pulled in.  I'm 29 hours in now and loving it.  The graphics are good, I'm enjoying the story, and I'm also free-roaming all over.  There are some quirky mechanics such as ship-boarding that make it a bit easier than it should be, but other than that I truely enjoy this game.  I've already purchased Warlords and I am looking forward to how that game progresses as well.  Alot of enjoyment here, just spend the time to learn the mechanics and have fun!  The developer and the community are great so this has been a good experience for me, well worth the purchase price.			"

								If you have ever played Eve or any space game for that matter and are looking for a really decent game then you really need to spend a little cash and support this great and supportive groups of developers.  Just check out the forums they respond to almost every thread.  They are very understanding and listen to ""YOU"" about everything you have to say about this game as it's in alpha status even though it seem like a full release game without a story at the moment.   Fantastic investment.  I really enjoy it.  If you got burned on X rebirth like I did and have any experience with Eve I think that you will really enjoy this game!!!Kudos to the developers for such a great job!!!!!!!			"

												The 35 hours i have spend on it were several play throughs because of content missing from early access, bugs during early access and my last playthrough: This game made such an incredible impression on me that i forgot i finished it. Yep, the game is that short and uninspiring that i actually forgot ever ending it and started to play it again. And during these few minutes of finishing this game for the second time i kept asking myself: When does this get interesting? Why is the voice acting so horrible? Why is every mission the same?So i backed a game that didn't live up to its promise of being worth my memories, it can happen. They dare to sell DLC that only adds a few ships for a game thats been finished 2 times in less than 35 hours? *sigh*			"

												A solid effort for those who enjoyed Freelancer.  Early impressions 7/10.  The fact I've been pretty non stop should bump it up more, but there are a few nagging things I'd like to see improved over time.1) When I'm shooting at a target many of the rounds appear to pass through and not impact on the targets shield or ship body.  I'm still doing damage, but that sense of kinetic/energy contact would help the immersion.2) AI tactics are in the early game underwhelming.  I'd like to see enemies do more drastic evasive manouevers to look like they're concerned about you as a threat a bit,			"

												Short Version: If you like space tactical combat, exploration, a bit of trading and if you're not just looking for another stupid space dogfighting simulator, this might just be the game for you. At a decent price and with DLC at a very low price, this game is totally worth a shot. It's not without it's flaws though. The devs, apparently, take player input seriously and are constantly looking for ways to further improve the game, which is rare nowadays.The long version:The Good:- You actually feel like you're in command of your ship. You're flying tripulated ships with several guns and missiles to fire on your enemies and sometimes even fighters and bombers to assist you! This is not another stupid ""dogfighting style camera view"". It's more tactical and I love the devs for making that choice.- Combat is very interesting and you can decide how you want your engine/shields/weapons focus in the middle of the fight.- Graphics are very good and the design is ""colorful"".- You actually feel like you're evolving as you advance in the game and have access to new ships. There are many options to suit your playstyle.- You can fly Capital ships (dreadnoughts and carriers) and they're not useless sitting ducks like they're in EVE online. In Starpoint Gemini 2, you can actually destroy smaller ships in the blink of an eye flying one of those, as it's supposed to be when you're flying a freaking Battlestar with fighters and tons of guns at your disposal.- Devs are constantly looking from feedback from the playerbase and they're very active on forums, taking players advices and questions and participating on the debates in a polite and helpful manner.- You can send your troops to board enemy ships and try to steal them in a very interesting and original mechanic. Nothing like trying different strategies and escaping with a nick of health from a battle after taking your former enemy's ship with you in tow back to a station.- Capital ships!- DLC at a very low price that offered some new content.- Did I mention Capital ships?!The Bad:- Several things are not clear on the tooltips and there are no manuals inside the game. There is no ""ship encyclopedia"" as you'd expect on a title like this.- The difference between weapon types, bombers, fighters and interceptors is not clear.- There are not too many weapon types in the game. It seems like it lacks some variety.- There is no clear DPS indication. There's an ""average"" indicator on weapons, but you have to calculate the firing rate manually to figure that out, apparently, so it's hard, at a glance, to know which weapon to use as an upgrade.- The management of your shields could improve and be something more like Star Trek Online, where you have to define what side gets the bonuses.- The way ""Fire at will"" works should be improved on. You could mark targets (as you do with fighters) and your tripulation would shoot them, instead of firing on everything and everyone around randomly as it is right now.The Ugly:- A few bugs still annoy me, such as not being able to launch the game if I have Teamviewer service running on the background or not being able to run the game in window mode simulating full screen. If I alt tab while in fullscreen, the game will switch to a window mode, and I have to close and reopen the game to load the fullscreen again. Another bug happens when you take a mission and you're unable to complete that, such as the missions that tell you to patrol and when you get to the place you're supposed to go, nothing happens.- Voice acting is TERRIBLE.- Missions get repetitive quickly, so you'll be unwilling to play after the grind for the big ships is over.- Strongest ship unlocks at level 40, so nothing to look forward to after that level.- Story is poor.

												I can not believe how much fun I am having with SPG2.   I have played the X games and enjoyed them, however, I always found them obtuse and very difficult to learn.  SPG2 is simple by comparison but this in no way a bad thing.  They have found all the elements I found fun and pulled them out and made an awesome game.   Combat is fun, I feel like I am in control of a mighty star ship, not some egg with guns.   However, if your not careful you can be over run and taken down.  The ballance is great, I have died but never have I said ""but why"" or ""that wasn't fair"" .   There is Traiding in the game but its simple, again not a bad thing.  If I wanted Stock market sim 2015 I'd have gone and bought that.   This is a nice system to make money with that I don't have to spend weeks reserching prices and locations.    Mining and salvage as well, but again, I don't have to spend a week trying to find a station that sells mining or salvage mod for my ship.   Weapons are again Simple.  havinge 300 different items that all do basicly the same thing isn't a plus in my books.  3 weapon types with several items for each class and clear choices which is better.  Ships are again simple with up to 10 systems to worry about.   I find no fun in the need to have 100 different system for a ship.... simple is better.I Now have 35 hours in this game,  one of my top single player game in my libray now.  I find it difficult to find any con's for this game that the DEV's seem to be very involed in.   My only thought is More Ships, but again keep it simple.Awesme game all around.			"

												Didn't expect much and got a masterpiece. I thought this was some 2D tower defense game and I was wrong. This is a brilliant 3D space game with tactical combat, fantastic soundtrack and the devs have a beautiful sense of humor. You are transporting Annoying Guy to the next station, pirates attack you while you have your cargo hold full of adult magazines and things like that. Modding community is very active and there are so many mods here that everyone can find something for themselves. Star Wars, Star Trek, you name it. Highly recommended!			"

												Since all the other recent reviews were so negative I avoided this until it was 80%-off.If you can get it at that price then I certainly recommend it but that doesn't make liars of the other reviewers - at full price it is too buggy, limited and awkward (when you start) to recommend.Bugs (under Win 10) - rare crashes to desktop after 10+ hours continuous play, not-at-all-rare and repeatable loss of accepted (but not completed) missions on loading a game.Limited - like most space games it's deliver this there, do this there, kill that there.  Get money and experience for a bigger ship so you can do the same missions against bigger enemies.Awkward - the context-menu takes a bit of getting used to and there can be a LOT going on at some points so you need to practice to keep up with everything.  This is especially true when boarding ships in the middle of an ongoing battle, but then capturing three or four ships in a single engagement is unusual and earns mega-credits.  Seriously, play it right and you can buy a ship, use it to capture enemies in a battle and immediately afford the next bigger ship.  Practice does pay off though and after a few hours it all feels pretty straightforward.Bigger, longer battles really bring out the awesome in this game.  It might not be Eve level but it has Elite beaten!  I have seen groups of 4 factions fighting each other (with me generally mixing it in the middle ^^) with reinforcements spawing/arriving for battles of 20-30 or so ships at a time, lasting 20 minutes and leaving more 'derelict's than I cared to name.  That's nice, because you can drift around after the battles and loot all those dead ships for all sorts of goodies.  Naturally,  you have to be in a pretty substantial ship yourself if you're going to survive such an event.Broadly, it starts grindy and confusing, quickly gets interesting and gets better the longer you play.  Until 'been there, done that' sets in (in free roam).			"

												Do I recommend it? Of course I do! It's a bloody masterpiece! And the fact that a team so small made a game this big is something I deepply respect. And that they are giving us free content updates regulary. And that they are actively talking to us on forums. And that they implement most of community suggestions. And that they made the game highly moddable and with Workshop support. Yes I deeply respect that and I wholeheartedly recommend this game. Even if you leave it after the campaign, you will still have more than 20 hours in it which alone makes it worth its price.Their newest game, Warlords is still in alpha but I can see how bigger and better it might become until release. If you want to participate in Early Access, go with Warlords, and if you want a finished game, go with SPG2.			"

Heck, I play Football Manager non-stop and to most that game is tear jerkingly boring. But alas! I have found a game that really does not grab me at all.I get it, many say after more hours you will get into it, and then many say after many hours it becomes repetitive.

Early Access Review
								Finally a game that has the potential to be even better than Freelancer - and that says something.Took me about 2-3 hours to get familiar with everything and to be able to play the game properly, even after playing years with space sims and space, so allow yourself a bit of time when first playing. Still in beta at the time of writing, so if something not works as it supposed to, for example crashes, or missions cannot be completed, strange enemy behaviour, do not get annoyed, the devs are constant fixing bugs and writing the game, developing. It is in a playable state already; you get a fairly powerful ship at the start, you can fly around, explore, get missions like repairing space bases, destroying pirates and playing taxi between distant bases. There is a good(ish) tutorial on the start to which you can go back any time, so you are not left alone to find out what is where. My biggest problem was having the ship not powerful enough, not fast enough and not having strong enough shileds until I found out about the quick and very handy power distribution feat - this is in the tutorial, but the information was so overwhelming that my attention slipped by the end and learned as I went along with the missions. I think (hope) there will be a smoother tutorial in the final version, perhaps like the one we get in Eve.  Everything I have seen in the game so far makes me think it was a good buy and worth every penny. I'm looking forward to see the final version and what other goodies will the devs come up. Recommendation: BUY IT !!!!			"

												So here we go. First of all, I found this because of it's Star Wars mod. As a huge SW fan, the option to fly Star Destroyer and wreak havoc across the galaxy was too tempting to resist. That said, I have to say that this game shines everywhere. It's just that good.PROS:+ Ship design+ Mods (Workshop)+ Music+ Combat+ Funny moments+ Developer support+ Community+ Free content updatesCONS:- Size (it's not really a game problem, but m Internet availability in Ethiopia)- Average voice-oversI would buy this over and over again. Do not hesitate. And if you catch it on a discount, it's definately worth your time.			"

												This game takes a bit to get used to. Also theres not too many guides to tell you the smaller information. Like if selling or buying the colors change. (Green good -red bad) between selling and buying.  So if your buying an item that is green its a better deal and if your selling an item  that is green its a profit.  Also they don't address the fact that after you take over a ship through boarding you need to grapple with the ship to take it back to a base to sell.  I left 1 ship out in space on accident that way.  Also there is a huge curve when it comes to getting new ships.  The first zone only carries 3 ships so your forced to go to different spaces and bases to find the one thats right for you. 9/10 gameplay (Its fun to play in space thats open ended)6/10 support (even manual doesn't answer all the questions)7/10 controls (especially in fights its hard to steer unless you stay still by cuttng all engines.)6/10 Missions ( The missions are almost all the same)8/10  Graphics (The graphics are good quality)9/10 Customization (Would be 10 but they really don't explain why certain weapons don't go on ship)Overall I give this game a solid 8/10.

								I must say that i'm very impressed! I had low expectations about this game, but after seeing some video playthroughs and reading some reviews, I gave it a chance. And, I'm glad I did! This game really reminds me of the classic and much-loved space sim, FREELANCER.The only bad thing I notice until now is the lag that happens time to time when I switch from normal game view to the map chart or game options screen. My rig is not very powerfull (I3, 4 GB of RAM, HD 7770), but I can play all my game library without lag, with good performance. But since the game is still an ALPHA version, I'M sure the developers will fine-tune it to be more compatible with older systems.If you like spce sims, trading in space and flying beautifully detailed ships, this game is for you.

												I kind of hoped this game would be an open world sandbox RPG like Mount and Blade but in space, however I was disappointed. It's suprisingly very shallow, overpriced, falls short in many aspects, missions are dull and repetitive, the game feels too grindy and the world is fairly lifeless despite being beautiful. With more depth the game could have been monumental.It is certainly not a terrible game and it has some merits, but it did disappoint me. If I could give it a neutral or maybe rating I would as I don't think it deserves a thumbs down, hence my recommendation.			"

												I rarely write reviews so for me to post this you know it has to be bad. I got this at 80% off for like 8 bucks and I still think I was ripped off. Lets start:First you may see 15 hours played but that's really less than half that. Between all the random crashes and not being able to save... Oh yeah You can only save at a space dock or planet. Problem is they are so spread out and you travel so slowly(no hyperdrive mode just full impulse) you have to spend 20 minutes getting back to a save spot just so you can save your mission before it maybe crashes again. Forget trying to accomplish multipule objectives or missions in a row before a crash thats not possible. Before you ask its not my rig. They have bugs and issues all around, just do research. For such a new game to have this many issues is jarring. Speaking of bugs my second complaint: Lack of proper controller support. This nearly killed the experience for me. Sure you can theroretically use a controller but dont expect the game UI or even the menus to give a flying #$%. It says you can use a mouse and keybord with the controller but you cant, its locked at one or the other. Then all the games UI and in game menues and tutorials dont reconize the controller so good luck trying to figure out what to do. Also forget trying to use the controller to even land as there inane system wont reconize the contextual presses.  Even in 2014 this is inexcuseable, but they had multipule patches and its still terribleThat brings me to my final points, one leads into the other. This game was released in 2014 and in my opinion it was rushed for early access and beta's and all that nonsense. They made constant updates but largely all the bugs remain. Its like great you added a few things here and there but would you please fix the bugs? Nope. They made their money on this game so now they've stopped updating it compleletly to focus on Starpoint Gemini Warlords. Excuse me you release a buggy game, dont fix it, and then move on to a new one? What are you an EA wannabe? Which leads me to my last point, because of their constant pointless updates, not a single mod works. That was the last straw. I can deal with forced to use a mouse and keyboard, I was going to give the crashes a pass for the moment to see if it got better, but the *Total*  lack of mod support for only a 2,3 yo game is straight up insane and nonsense. If you know your game is moddable, you include a freakin mod manager, why would you release updates that ruin mods? And of course nobody wants to keep trying to make the mods work everytime they update. Sure theyve finally stopped but that still leaves every mod incompatable. I know what your going to say ""Dont buy games for mods"" Well honestly I do, some games I wouldnt play without them and this is one of them. Let me give you an example: The first space station you visit ""Vigo Station"" has most of the ships in the game, but you cant access the shipyard. Instead you can maybe find some research station way out in the void that maybe has a ship for a million credits thats slightly better than your starting ship. The only way to access the station is to increase your repuation but you only get 20 rep per mission. You'll out level your ship before you get enough rep to access the space port with the actual useable ships. Which you dont want to do tat because to more you level the stronger enemies become. So a simple mod that unlocks that station, and gives me access to powerful and yet affordable ships would save so much time you'd think.  Well I bought a ship and then the game crashes when I go to a planet. Then I load up the game and the screen  is blue and wiped out when I exit to space.   The developer even told me that mods no longer work for the game so there you go.  I almost feel bad, as I talked to some of the devs, and they tried to assess my problems and seemed nice. However I cant ignore these glaring issues. I only hope this review will save the moeny and time of those interested in this. I hope to get a refund for this but its my duty to warn others. I wish I never bought this game and instead bought Rebel Galaxy.			"

												Ever since I played Starpoint Gemini, I have been a big fan. The original game was very easy ot use and not too overly complicated to use. The game was in 3D, but only flew in 2D, so it wasn't hard to get form point ""A"" to point ""B"" with little effort.Starpoint Gemini 2 takes the original game several steps fruther. The concept is sitll the same. You are a space pilot looking to make a name for yourself in the age of space trader. You can either play in campiagn or in freemode.Some of the things that have improved since the first game are as follows...1.) Flight is now in 3D instead of 2D2.) You no longer have to use jump gates to get to your destination3.) A lot more ships to choose from4.) Ships have a lot more upgrades to choose from5.) Some ships offer a ""Flight Deck"" where you can send small fighters out while you battle6.) Not only can you have a flight deck, but you can also choose which kind of fighters you want7.) This time, you can also land on planets as well as star bases8.) Combat is lot more ""tactical"" than before9.) You can now make friends and enemies, this determines if you are able to land on stations or planets10.) There are now factions, each with their own likes and dislikes about you and other factions11.) More items to buy and trade12.) Major improvementts on comba, flight, and trading system13.) There is now a fully viewable starchart you can use to determine where you are versus where you goOverall a much more enjoyable game with added features that allow a lot mroe to do as well as a lot more offer. The added bonus of flight decks is also very helpful for when you need that added help durig combat. If you are into the Space Trader system that has true 3D concept of space flight, this is a good game to get. If you loved Starpoint Gemini, you will love this second part. The added benefit of landing on planets is a major bonus from the original game.			"

Many years later, I found Freelancer and went through the same thing again, but after that nothing I played ever felt so close and so great as Starpoint Gemini 2. It has everything I loved about those games but also so much more, so many details and options and features added so well you can tell how much the developers care and love the game. I finished the storyline and all DLC and of course, I'm playing it again. And for sure won't be the last time.			"

												With all the recent updates, this game is finally playable. I think their biggest issue was releasing this so half finished originally. If you enjoyed old school games like privateer, you'll find some neat similarities, mixed with freelancer style controls. Its got a lot of good structural things going for it, but still feels light on content, which is understandable given that its a small dev team working on it. Never the less those guys managed to put together a fun space sim that doesnt take itself too seriously. If you are looking for a hardcore space sim, this isnt it, but if you are looking to fly around blowing things up and occasionally have an interesting battle, then you are in the right place. I continue coming back to this game to see new updates, and if the dev guys continue to produce content, I think this will flesh out quite nicely, so that the universe doesnt feel so barren with the same 3 mission types everywhere.

												Such a great game, we need moar space games like this.- a bit grindy for most the beginning in both money and exp.- lots of nice ships, but you'll be spending most of your time in the starting ship.- camera can be awkward but you'll get use to it, same with the controls.- capture enemy ships as much as possible and sell for credits.

												If you liked Freelancer, you will love this. Though, so far, the story hasn't been as engaging as Freelancers but there is a freeroam mode that basically cuts that aspect out of it and just throws into this really well designed and nice looking universe, for you to do in as you please.The combat is awesome, the UI is nicely layed out and easy to understand and the game isnt overly complex for the sake of being complex (I'm looking at you X series). The soundtrack is pretty cool too.Its quite fun and addictive for now, but I can see it becoming quite repetitive. I'm sure later on in the game things become a bit more interesting with bigger ships and fleet battles, but the early game requires a lot of grind it seems.I recommend buying this on sale, as it is at the time of writing this review. I can't say, yet anyway, if its worth the full asking price. Though I am having a lot of fun with it at the moment.  "

												I've seen a lot of comparisons for this game to other popular titles and I think that is a disservice to this game, because then you start looking at what this game doesn't have.Here is what the game DOES have.Great graphics at low hardware cost.  The game looks good, it looks clean, the ships are detailed and the environment is gripping, and you don't have to sell your soul to play it.Great music.  It's the type of music you'd expect to hear if there were an intergalactic space composer.Lots of ship options:  There are enough choices to make your personal mark on the universe.Space:  Everything is better in space.Combat:  Everything is better with combat, especially in space.Great development team:  They are VERY involved with the community and the community is VERY involved with development, in the best ways I have ever seen, ever.It is a good game, at a low cost, that will provide many hours of enjoyment.

												I don't often write reviews, but when I do, it's for a product I love. Starpoint Gemini is probably one of the most fun space games I've played. It feels reminiscent of the X series in a much-welcomed third person perspective(Though you have the option of using a mounted cam perspective instead if you prefer), with the noticeable lack of any empire-building elements to speak of; likewise controlling a fleet is very limited by comparison, and as far as I'm aware you have to be pretty far into the game to even start a fleet.The game, much like X, has a campaign option(Which I haven't played and therefore cannot comment on) and a sandbox mode. In the sandbox mode, you pick a starting ship and get thrown out into the universe with the usual obnoxious tutorial screens, and then it's pretty much straight into the action. Your prime objective for most of if not the entirety of the game will be to make more money, which you have several options for obtaining, such as mining, hunting criminals, trading goods, or pirating goods. It's all quite fun, but the payouts are generally small in comparison to the price of ships and equipment upgrades, meaning you're definitely going to have to spend several hours chauffeuring sales reps and diplomats through hostile territory and mining asteroids by the hundreds to ever afford that ship upgrade, but this is balanced out by the fact that the starting ships are pretty powerful generally speaking, and should last you as long as you'll use them... Though that doesn't mean that the money grind is any less monotonous.I'm not saying it isn't fun. It's just not as rewarding as it could've been. You grind money for the sake of getting a bigger ship, for the sake of grinding more money more easily, for the sake of getting a bigger ship. Perhaps the campaign provides more variety, but the sandbox is in desperate need of some more money-sinks.Graphically, the game is a joy to look at, though the fact that I rarely dabble into anything this modern could be skewing my opinion here a little. The art style is reminiscent of a cartoon or an anime, and colours are very vibrant, making literally everything stand out dramatically. The only thing worth complaining about in terms of graphics is the little debris particles that fly past your ship during movement, as they're practically the size of my tiny gunship's cockpit, but thankfully there's already a mod to remove them.All in all... It's definitely not a bad game. There are better games out there for the price, but I'd still recommend picking this up if you have money to blow, especially if you're a fan of space games. And if it's on sale right now, slap yourself for even giving it a second thought and then buy it. Just a forewarning however, it will definitely annihilate your social life.			"

												Purchased on recommendation from a friend and loved it.Didn't have any of the technical issues that others have posted, and the comment about missions outleveling yourself is silly because each mission has a recommended level.  Not at that level? Do some sidequests or freelancing to level up - just like any open world game!The storyline is interesting but not essential, although I would recommend playing through at least a few hours of the story before jumping into a purely-freelance game because the early quests train you quite well.

												This game was exactly what I had hoped; a mix of EVE online (minus the spreadsheets) and more action orientated space games like Freespace.I played through the storyline which served it's purpose of driving things forward but beyond that is rather forgettable. It also featured some of the worst voice acting / writing I have heard in a long time. Thankfully the sandbox of different mission types, trading and exploring more than makes up for it. One of the more enjoyable scenarios is ship capture where you have to whittle the targets shields and hull down to the limit and then board the ship with your troopers with the aim to capture it. This has big pay off's and lets you bank huge sums of money to buy new ships and gear.The ships are the main stay of SG2, they are nicely varied and do not fall into the EVE trap where every ship has to have its trade off's, in SG2, a Dreadnought can kick serious ♥♥♥ against all sized ships as you would expect and is a blast to play with.This game is a solid 8/10 and had me hooked all the way up until I had the best Dreadnought and Carrier available and could just mop up. Definitely looking forward to SG3 with hopefully some more budget thrown at it to get some writers / voice actors in to bring the lore to life.			"

												I am really enjoying Starpoint Gemini 2!  Having never played the original, I was a little nervous about buying the sequel, but that isn't a problem at all!  Free roam mode gives you a blank canvas and you can do pretty much whatever you want.  The option is also available during the campaign, but I always feel compelled to stick with the story rather than go off and do my own thing for a little while.  Due to this, I have not spent much time at all on the campaign.  Doing random missions, trading, capturing enemy ships, and exploring have all distracted me from that.  However, the five minutes or so I have spent on the campaign were not all that impressive (shoddy voice acting, uninteresting writing). So, do I recommend this game?  Absolutely, just not for the story.  Get this game if you want to get lost in a space sim for hours, not for some kind of an epic drama.			"

												I'm a fan of space games. The problem with them has been for years that there's no depth to trading or interesting story to delve into. Quests in this one are all either mail carrier types or combat based. The fighting is fairly uninteresting as well.On the plus side, the graphics are very good and I loved the scenery. The game does have a very large area to explore if that is yoru thing, but as I mentioned above, it gets very monotonous quickly due to lack of depth.The other big flaw is that the only real way in this game to make money is by capturing ships. You can trade or just do missions, but it would take an awful grind to get enough money to change ships which seems like a balance flaw to me.Even on sale, I'm going to actually suggest you skip this one. No, there doesn't seem to be much better out there, but I would say you are better off never playing than to waste time on such a shallow game.			"

												Ok this is my edited review. I'll try and be semi-objective as I have interacted with the dev's, their moderator and the community for some time. But please read on and judge for yourself.Spg2 is a tactical space combat sim. I joined in EA and didn't play it for long due to hardware limitations on my account but liked the idea of a big massive universe where the player doesn't end up being the ""King of the Hill"" but just a small piece of a bigger universe. And Spg2 filled that need for me. This is not the most epic game I've ever played and I didn't expect it to be. But from a small ~10-ish Croation developer team I've been surprised. Not only have these guys made their own engine which shows beatiful graphical capability but they also constantly updated the game for almost a year after release with steady patching and a nice and cheap DLC while being constantly (I can't express how crazy these dev's are when it comes to listen to player feedback and troubleshooting with the community, it's unheard of) active on forums and responding to any bug report they received and fixing it with each new update. This is more than half the reason I'd buy any game they'd ever release.Well about the game; There are more in-depth Space Games out there, more epic stories to be told. But this game doesn't pretend to be any of that. It knows it's limitations as a huge space universe where the player is just a small piece of the puzzle. And it does that extremely well. Imagine being in a single-player MMO ( yeah kind of contradictory) but that's how this game treats you. You're nothing more special than the next dude around. You won't change the Universe all by yourself but you're just a small part in a bigger scheme. I love that sense of relating to your own existence in the world. How many games dares that anymore? In an age where we all feel we're the turning point and center of the Universe this game is a fresh breath teaching us the Universe doesn't resolve around us but we're just here to try to survive and do the best we can. There's no classic story arch to this game. You don't end up feeling like you're the king of the world. You're just a captain in the void trying to fend for him or herself. That's it. And from a philosophical perspective I love that notion. Too many games rub your need for being the ""one and only"". Not this game. This is reality expressed through a game. You're not gonna matter more than others but still need to claim your place in the world. That's beautiful and invigorating and  ... well poetic in some sense. There's a story (campaign) in the game that lends itself to the lore created in Spg1. But former knowledge of that is not required. I am still on the last mission of that storyline but that's not the reason I play Spg2. I don't relate that much to the story as such but enjoy the stories I can make with my own captains more.The game lets you choose between story and freeroam missions at a whim. You can always wander off to do randomly generated missions even when playing the campaign (campaign has a fixed character while freeroam lets you generate your own male/female character) and explore as you see fit. My preference and love for space was to be more of a ""freelancer"" doing randomly generated missions for different factions making friends and enemies along the way depending on my choice of the missions I'd carry out for different factions (help one faction=lose reputation with another faction and vice versa). The game can be a grind for some, other cherish that type of neverending possibilities and in Spg2 the ever-changing possibilities for changing your reputation and the constant randomly generated missions can keep you playing this for hours on end.Some days I just log in, cloak my ship and enjoy the scenery. Other days I just log in to take my temper out on whatever faction I'm currently in bad standing with and make them suffer. For a better description of the game check some videos on Youtube or other reviews. I'm still sold on this thing and the constant updates, a very nice and cheap DLC plus the upcoming FREE DLC makes me wanna recommend this game to everybody. Best and coolest development team I've ever meet and a hell of a positive and friendly community.This game is Steam History for the books. The reason I still get into EA from time to time is because of these guys right here. This is a game made by gamers to gamers. And a hella lot of respect for their interaction, back-and-forth, constant updates and pleasent attitude. If you're in doubt visit the forum. These guys are the future of gaming and a pinnacle of how developers can make gamers trust and cherish them again (yeah plenty of jaded gamers out there seeing bigger companies ♥♥♥♥ all over their customers or make highly dubious decisions).Edit: It should be noted that this game twists a few familiar concepts of games and how to progress the best possible way. There's not much ""hand-holding"" here but the forum is pretty active to anyone needing a tip or two on how to get the most of it and learn those ""different"" mechanics/understanding from what other games usually bring. So remember to pitch in with questions if there are any or you don't understand something. The early game in particular can be a bit rough for new players but once they get a hang of it it's really not that hard to understand. over 9000 / 10			"

								*WOW*Space sims have almost disappeared as a genre over the last 15 years or so, but this is the most promising one I've play since X-3.  Having been disappointed by the original Starpoint Gemini, this mere Alpha of Starpoint Gemini 2 really blew me away.  The dev comment ""hugely improved sequel"" is very much an understatement.  I barely got my feet wet, but this game is literally a decade ahead of its amateurish predecessor.Forget all the wrongs of the original Starpoint Gemini (or just forget that game entirely), SG2 fixes all the terrible compromises it made:1. No longer locked a 2-D plane, you have full six degrees of freedom.  As the developer blurb says ""everything now is in 3D!""  *shock, horror* 2. No wierd incremental steering. (I guess you have to play the original to understand this one.)  As I said earlier, full six degrees of freedom.  Pitch, yaw, and roll to your heart's delight.  There's even a toggle to steer with you mouse for more precision dogfighting.3. No amateur voice actors reading non-native English scripts.  Not a lot of voice acting in the alpha, but what it did have was professionally polished.4. No hideous 2002-era low poly character renders.  Hand-drawn 2D portraits FTW!In general, the production values are up to what you'd expect from a modern game.  Those screeenshots don't lie, it really does look that good in-game.  The soundtrack and sound design is also very well done.  The UI is beautiful, handles well, and very user friendly.It's still alpha, so there some key content missing (mainly the campaign, and the the trade system is very under-developed), but so far this looks like the first promising successor to the Elite/Privateer/Freelancer legacy in years.

												Trader, Warrior, Pirate, Explorer, Bounty Hunter, Miner, Smuggler - a few of the things you can be in the Gemini Sector.  This game puts you in the boots of a newbie starship captain in one of the most volitile areas of human colonization, and it's your choice as to what you will do with your newfound freedom.  Will you avenge your father and find out why he was killed in the storyline?  Will you go off and discard your past in the free-roam sandbox mode?  The choice is yours.You start out with a very basic gunship, but the game doesn't limit you to one ship like some others (Darkstar One, X-Rebirth), but instead gives you the option to upgrade and upgun in one of several ship classes.  Do you like the thought of zipping around in a fast, maneuverable stealth corvette?  You've got several to choose from.  Maybe you'd prefer to roll into a hostile area in one of the mighty dreadnaughts or carriers and outgun everything in the zone (except perhaps another dreadnaught or carrier)?  You can do that, too.  Or you'd like to be a trader, working your way from your starter ship to a freighter, and then a freightliner, ferrying cargo, buying cheap and selling high.  Again, your choice, but remember to pack guns to keep the pirates off your back, as they have the same choice in ships as you do!  You'll do all of this in a *very* good-looking setting that has NPC ships doing their own thing according to their own agendas.  My personal favorite example of this was the time I was attacked by a group of pirates.  I was in a destroyer, which is fairly middle-of-the-pack in speed-to-guns/armor, and flying with a group of trader ships.  The pirates jumped us, I engaged...and the traders *bolted!*  Left me there and ran, as they weren't going to stick around and slug it out with pirates that outgunned them (being businessmen in freighters rather than naval officers in warships, it seemed their AI told them to GTFO).  Just as I was swearing to hunt them down (if I survived this and didn't have to reload halfway across the map), security forces from the nearby station arrived with battleships and cruisers and what was a brutal last stand became a lopsided pirate turkey shoot.  Brilliant!Starpoint Gemini does a lot of things right, and the devs have shown a lot of interest and support in the community.  There were a few bugs on first release, but continual support has polished this into a real gem most space-sim fans will enjoy greatly.  9/10			"

												A very good game. Don't expect it to last longer than 2 weeks though. You can do a lot of things like: 1. Upgrading your ship. 2. Commanding a carrier type ship with 4 turret slots and 4 missile slots. 3. You can board another ship. 4. Station defense / Station assault type of missions. 5. Launch fighters/interceptors/bombers from your ships.The thing is that it's a very short game with a ton of good gameplay that'll keep you hooked. Unfortunately, you find yourself doing repetitive things (like boarding, mining, etc.). You'll eventually find yourself with more money than you can count and you've basically done everything there is to do in the game. Compared to other gaming simulators, this one is a junior. Great to get back into space sims, but not your ""goto"" space sim. For your ""goto"" space sim, I would actually recommend the following games: 1. Elite Dangerous (Once it's released. It might already be I don't know). 2. Star Citizen (This game promises a lot and has a lot of potential. Wait for it to be released)3. X: Rebirth 3.0 (I know some of you space sims fans HATE this game, but in reality, this game had a very shaky start with bugs that would render the game useless, but in version 3.0, almost all of these bugs have been fleshed out, there's a ton of new features, and it's a GRAND game). I've been playing X: Rebirth 3.0 for a month now and I have yet to do everything it offers. It's beautiful!			"

Early Access Review
								This game caught my eye a few months ago, but at the time it did not really seem like a good buy since everyone was anticipating that Xrebirth would be a super awesome game. Then Xrebirth came out. Luckily i did not jump on the hype wagon (learned my lesson) and when the first videos came out i was stunned by how terrible the whole game was.Yesterday I saw this game on Humble bundle for a few bucks, so I took a look at some videos on YouTube and found that it looked pretty decent. Then I read a few reviews, and found that this could totally be the one game that can fill the X's place.I was not disappointed!!! THIS is how X3 should be done. Everything is done right, even though many features are still missing, like the ability to create fleet, owning stations/player faction, more ways of modifying weapons (custom mods maybe). There is not really much content in the game right now, but the promise of it shines on the horizon like a new day's sun (especially story mode) and i can only hope, that the devs continue to be as awesome as they have been so far in communicating with players and using their feedback to make the game better.

								This is an absolutely cracking game. For an early-access alpha version, it is incredibly polished and looks beautiful. No bugs that I have run across yet, and it runs so smoothly. Kind of a cross between Eve and X3.Highly recommended			"

Early Access Review
								The game is about to enter Beta.  As it stands, the game is not only playable, it's stable and fun!Everyone compares the game to Freelancer, which makes a lot of sense.  The input for flying is similiar with mouse and keyboard.  But I like the fact that you captain a capital ship instead of flying a starfighter.  Even smaller ships (like the Destroyer you start out with in the Alpha) have a sense of weight and inertia in their movements.It's a fun game, with a slower, more deliberate pacing than a starfighter game.  There's time to decide your own fate while being pounded on by your opponents.  You end up feeling like the captain of a tall ship at sea.  Which means they must have done something right.There's no campaign yet, but sandbox offers a complete game in and of itself.  It's a career mode, so there is persistent progression, kind of like a campaign might have.  There are tons of ships to buy, and plenty of missions to run.  Or you can run around getting into trouble, and you'll progress just as fast.So far, I haven't needed anything that isn't implemented yet.  In fact, the only things I've actually missed up till now are the jumpdrive (T-drive) and cloak.  Other than that, nothing feels like it's missing.It's well polished at this stage, which makes sense since it's one week from Beta.  The graphics and UI look slick.  Anything that's actually implemented at this stage is almost always bug-free.  The game is very stable, too.  I don't think it's crashed once on me.This is March of 2014, and as it stands the game provides a satisfying experience to play repeatedly.  It is on sale till the 17th, but will have a price hike immediately afterwards as it goes into Beta.  Also, buying it before Beta will give you 1 free copy of the original game.  A fun tide-me-over till this game is complete.			"

												This game has a lot of good stuff in it, but also some weak spots.Brief description of the game:You are commanding a capital class ship in either a sandbox experience or a campaign with main missions. You will be flying around undertaking side missions and smaller assignments, upgrading your ship size and firepower.First I will start with good things:+ Proper 3D movement, your ship rotates in all directions+ Huge map full of objects in space, except planets and spacestations space is full of ships of various factions and other space objects like solar power plants, gas collectors, prisons, etc. All of those obejcts come with few designs so the feeling is that most of them are unique. In addition there are clouds of radiotion of electric storms.+ In dept ship command. In addition to guns your ship also has tractor beam (you can pull enemy ships), teleport and marines (you can board enemy ships and pull them to nearest station to sell them), launch bays for fighters, slots for various consumable items (bombs, AI turrest, boosters, repair bots etc)+ Power management. You can direct power between 3 main areas of your ship - engines, weapons and shieldsm by default power if directed 1/3 to each, but you can channel it to one of them in order to receive +100% bonuss to speed, reload, recharge etc, at a cost of -% to others. (PRO TIP: always channel power to engines when you fast travel for +100% boost, since you cannot shoot in this state anyway)+ Large selection of ships and weapons as well as system upgrades to treak your ship as you like it, weapon types are really different (plasma are slow firing, slow flying, hight damage, hight power consumption; laser are 100% acurate, quick firing, low damage; projectile are quick firing, medium damage, fast flying) as for missles you can get some with huge area of effect or long distance small area of effect etc.+ Campaign is not so bad, but lack of options, alternative solutions etc makes it a less fun.Now to negatives:- Bad voice acting- Poor mission reward system - if you wanna by new ships and top weapons you better learn to board enemy ships, do it for few hours at start then start campaign fully equipped. (for example: low level assassination task will give you 4-10k credits, while if you board enemy craft, kill the crew and pull it to space station you will get 80-120k plus you will complete the mission), just doing missions for money is mindless grind and gets boring really fast.- Not involving space combat, this will require some longer explanation.Your ship has turrests, shields and missile weapons in 4 sectors (front, aft, port and starport). You can manually aim turrets, but odds of you hitting a tiny little black dot on black space around you are virtually none, the only thing you can hid manually are destroyed ship husks and space station with are not moving. So in order for your turrest to do anything you set them to auto-fire then they will randomly pick a target and shoot few bursts at it, then change target and go on. In the end during combat you can only select target and manually fire guided missles at it and rotate your ship so that more turrets and fresh shields are facing the enemy. After 10h of playing this is damn boring !!!- Not interesting PTE (power to engines, which is a form of quick flying), as to why it doesnt set power distribution to engines for 100% and has to be done manually for a nice speed boost is a wild guess. And you dont get this fancy visuals of super fast travel like we know from movies, it is just that, your ship flies faster.Conclusion:I recommend this game as it is quite fun to play for space exploration for 10-20h of fun, therefor I advice get it on discount because it is not worth 40€.Then I advice you to learn how to board enemy ships quickly so you can make some good credits and try out weapons and ships.

												This game is totally worth every penny.  Not only do I have a passion for space/sci-fi genres (as well as a few others) but the fact that they give you both a campaign and free roam mode only games it better since free roam basically lets you do what you wish.  You command a ship and can do whatever you want. Become a pirate and capture other ships and their cargo, become a trader and buy/sell goods between planets and space stations, become a bountry hunter, and much more... It also helps that the Gemini system (map) is pretty damned big with constant activity.  My favorite moments involve coming upon large battles between factions, or simple skirmishes between myself and a couple other ships turn into a huge battle when other nearby factions decide to intervene to either help or harm me. Best part about the space battles is that it feels so real... ships are all on the same plane as if on an ocean/sea, they're everywhere at all angles. Another huge point in favor of the game is how amazing the graphics are without reducing performance (that I have noticed and have a pretty good gaming computer) though there is a lag whenever you move to another sector, but that barely effects me.The games doesn't restrict you to certain areas... you can go anywhere and everywhere they do limit you in other ways... depending on you reputation, different sectors will be hostile to you and some sectors have high level enemies in them. One major problem (in my opinion) is the repetative nature of the side missions and very few secondary missions (those give to you by factions depending on your reputation and level.  Antoher problem is how long it takes to level up and to get to the higher level so as to be able to fly around in a dreadnought or carrier.Overall, I'd have to give this game 9/10.			"

												Possibly one of the best games I have ever played and it isn't even finished! People litterally write to the devs wanting to pay more just to get more content. The devs unlike most care more about their legacy then making money. This is the perfect freelancer 2 which sadly never happened. You can explore, trade, raid ships, and despite forcing your progression, you can't fly ships you level isn't high enough for. The game battles are balanced, and even when you are flying mega ships, you can quickly find your self getting swarmed by many many smaller vessles. There has to be a balance between devs and profits. Unlike Payday 2, this game NEEDS to sell updates to keep it going.			"

								even for its beta state, game is very promising. i expect it to become a new modern X3 for space sim/shooter/rts fans.game gets updated very frequently, i only think that s because due to positive outcome product of sale amount. i mean steam playerbase support should be good enough to make the devs work hard like this.i want to point some unique points about this game.-enhancement system for ship parts, not only you can change your offensive,defensive,special outputs but you can also further tweak the bonuses with part enhancement, offers you very high amount of combinations.- high amount of factions, each faction's missions gets randomly generated depending on your current faction standings.thats nice. that means your actions have consquences.-you can actively own a fleet, and make them support you in battles or transport/hauling/smuggling.-crew salaries really a good money sink, something to think about.-game supports modding. enuf said. ^^now a bit of negatives :- currently since game is beta, the main storyline is not out yet and freelance game mode(sandbox) offers  a bit repeatitive missions.- traveling might take some time, there s no time acceleration/deacceleration- using map, pauses your game. you cant watch your ship moves while on starchart. that makes creating waypoints make game stop and cost you time.- current number of pilot classes only 3 and each has 4 different active abilities, these 4 abilities each has 5 sub categories changing characteristics of active skills, this s a bit few, could have been more.-after accepting each mission, you have to find objective area/station etc manually via starchart. you gotta click each marker and see which one lets you create waypoint/jump etc.- accepted and offered quests have same color markers on starchart. again no visual clue for finding your active missions' waypoint.- there s a quest log but not really helpful , doesnt fully work atm. therefore if you serious about completing your missions, you gotta take and complete 1 by 1. unlike other rpgs you cannot hoard multiple missions and do it with a spree.not at the moment. Doesnt apply to people with super memory- you cannot purchase spacestations or other type of stationary npc controlled objects. not yet.TLDR, summary : the game runs smooth and not many bugs for its state, gameplay wise there re many things to add. lack of variety atm might be boring but combat is fun and makes up for it. im pretty sure as it develops, many new features gonna be added and this game has potential to beat X3 in future in open beta. only if devs keep the game updated just like now.

								[Review based on Early Access beta, v.0.7015]A fantastic action-oriented space sim (with some RPG-like elements added in), with beautiful visuals (and smooth framerates), a fairly big universe to explore (with hints from the developer that it's going to get bigger), lots of ships to fly and loads of weapons, equipment and upgrades to fit to them to tune them for any task.Currently only ""free play"" is available, but there's still lots to see and plenty to do. The game is already very fun and entertaining, and shows great promise. I look forward to the full release, and recommend this game for any fan of the space sim genre.			"

								This is going to be short and sweet.I like this game. Its a single player 'EVE' without the ridiculous complexity. Obviously its not without issues, personally i have to keep all of the settings low to get a decent frame rate but that might just be my machine and im sure it wont be a problem once optimisation is introduced.My only major gripe is the lack of fuller content. So far the freelance missions are pretty much the same few objectives in varying difficulty but they are quick enough that its not too much of a trouble to level. I think once the proper campaign is introduced it will make the game a lot more enjoyable.			"

												This game looks beautiful, even on the lowest graphics settings. The music is wonderful and sound effects are great. Voice acting is... well, pretty terrible in all honesty, but I'm really impressed that a pretty small indie developer managed to get as much voice acting in this game in the first place! That tends to be an enormous expense in any game, and it's still better than the voice acting in Just Cause 2 or Strike Suit Zero.However, even with two years of steady work, the game still suffers of performance issues and frequent crashes. I can accept a lot of problems but I really hate having to restart the game so many times in one evening. Last I heard, the devs are still actively working on the game - I hope they'll find these last crash and lag sources and fix them someday soon, because until then I won't be able to play this thing more than maybe half a hour a day. If the crashes are finally fixed, I'll be more than happy to recommend this game.			"

												I wish there was a neutral button, or I could give a 10 star review. I would give this game a ""5"". In my continued quest to find a game of equal or greater quality to old WIndows game ""Freelancer"", I was hoping I had found it with this one. I was NOT sorely dissapointed, but it's kinda a rather bland game...It's like getting a coffee but no cream and sugar, or a turkey dinner with no mashed potatoes. The core concept is there....just they didn't cook it long enough.Mechanics are good, the idea is great, beautiful graphics and awesome full 3D flying, and I love the slip-stream ""Surfing"" idea, but I just can't get my attention to be held. For my limited playing, I felt the story dragged, I could not afford to be a trader and spent most of my time jacking pirate ships, looting them, dragging them back to a nearby base to sell. (FYI: Your crews DO NOT take over the ship and fly along with you as an escourt - At least from what I experienced during my limited gameplay. It took me about 3 lost ships before I realized you had to tractor the ship back to a station :P )I am hoping either these guys do a MASSIVE update on this game, or maybe they will get it right in the next game they are making. I'm certainly willing to give their next one a chance. However until then, my ""Freelancer"" parody search continues.			"

								The developers for SG2 really set the bar into the stratosphere for early access. There are more renowned titles that aren't this polished at release. While they've been busy building this game, we, the players have been exploring the vast systems of SG2 in it's already space worthy assortment of vessels.The graphics are silky and the models imaginative. The game play is smooth and intuituve. And being fully supported by the Steam Workshop allows the players uninhibited creativity. Many have paid twice as much for a ""finished"" product that promised the galaxy but couldn't deliver the moon. SG2 delivers the solar system, the galaxy and the cosmos for half the price.The responsive developer team never let's too much time pass before they're reassuring the community that they're forging ahead to a quality release. Lord Have Mercy! When they add the remaining content and features, this game, if not overlooked should be considered top in it's class for 2014.			"

The artwork for Starpoint Gemini 2 is very good. They have an intro video for the game story that will be added later. Really glad to have bought this game, it's worth the money.

												I`ve put quite a few hours into this one and whilst there is alot to like, it is ultimatley a very detached and empty experience. I found it hard to care about the games universe and different factions. The battles were just too arcade like and not much fun. Ships close into engagement range quickly and from then its usually a case of putting on auto turret fire and carrying out some random evasive manourvres. There didn`t seem much in the way of strategy or tension.  And reaching higher level ships just seems to up the stats- there just isn`t that satisfying feeling of pwer from owning a battleship or Dreadnought. This could have been so much more.			"

Early Access Review
								It is indeed a great game in the making, but the only think I would love to see that great games such as skyrim didn't do is have a multiplayer option. Goto friends or bring friends and have adventures with each other, a game as good as this is better with a friend! I get there is other games like this one like EVE, but I hate playing with people I don't know very well and backstabbers. A multiplayer option like borderlands 2 that lets your game be ether wide open or closed only for many or few of your closest friends to share the experience with. Thats all I will complain about this game, other than that it something to play. Takes a bit to learn but it's worth it!!			"

												Flying around in space, blowing stuff up. Although there are many games of this type out there Starpoint Gemini 2 manages to hooked me. Frankly I have no idea why. It's just relaxing - flying in your Titan, warping out in hostile a zone and watching as everything around your ship turns into space dust. 9/10 Because destroying asteroids by colliding with them is called creative mining.

								It takes a bit to get into the controlling your ship, but once you realize you’re not flying a fighter but a large ship it gets easier. Zig-zagging around to evade hostile fire, turning around to get your full weapon batteries within firing range and arc, transferring power between systems, sending out troopers to other ships, capturing them, mining asteroids, salvaging stuff from derelicts… it’s all in here.An awesome buy! I definitely RECOMMEND it to everyone who’s into space games. And with the first game offered in the bundle AND at a discount, this is a steal!			"

												Tried it again after a few months and boy has it changed! Now a fully working Main campaign is in place, the money system makes much better sense, the fleet system is fully operational and many, many other positive changes.I have really enjoyed playing the first few campaign missions, taking some time to earn some experience hunting pirates, patrolling areas or ferrying people around. It is overall a good experience and it has a lot to keep you on your toes, enemies to attack of run from, and interesting mechanics. Specially there are many possibilities to travel around the map, which is big and ould take ""forever"" to get from one corner of the Gemini Sector to another....you have T-Gates, wormholes, ""Space currents"" (which you actually surf, damned fun!), and even your own (expensive) T-Drive to hop around.Thumbs up and best thing is this is not finished yet! They keep adding and polishing things!			"

												Has some warts, I won't deny it.  This coming from a WC2/Privateer/Freespace player, I like this game overall but there are some negatives that might steer people away from it.  The voice acting IS pretty meh, and the UI/menu interface leaves something to be desired (buying/selling goods isnt exactly clear at first glance); the complaint about expensive T-gates I get, though I went out and sought the license for this immediately (making it available nearby to the starting area honestly makes more sense rather than halfway across the galaxy).Still, the game is fun and interesting, exploring the different regions of space was especially enjoyable if a bit hazardous if I wandered too far into hostile territory.  If one can see past the negatives the game is extremely fun.			"

												Very good space game, I'm so pleased this genre is making a comeback!I've not played a huge amount yet, but enough to get the feel for it and I'm really enjoying it so far.In this game you are flyng a large ship with a crew, not a one-man fighter, so it feels more like Freelancer, ST Bridge Commander, or Independence War, but it has it's own feel. The ship handling reflects this and the control scheme works really well. I tried it with a flight stick, but it's not really that kind of game, the mouse controls just feel right for the pace as you seem to spend more time targeting, selecting systems and activating powers and perks, rather than 'hands-on' flying. There is a strong RPG element in terms of building up your character and ship with equipment, skills and perks to develop. There is a lot going on and I'm sure I barely scratced the surface.Technically it's excellent, great graphics and effects, and not a massive system hog either. The soundtrack is very nicely ambient and helps to immerse rather then distracting. There is great community around this game, and the developers are obviously very keen to make improvements so I can see that there is a lot of potential for future enhancements, but the game that is on sale now is a totally complete and functional productMy only criticisms would be that the universe seems a bit impersonal, and the setting poorly explained, being a sequel to a game few have played, and the script a bit weak and generic. The English voice acting is very flat, and it might have been better to stick to text to be honest, but it's farily sparsely used and doesn't spoil the game.Overall, great game, well worth the price which is very reasonable for the amount of content and the mod support and supplied tools mean that it will have plenty of new content  to come.

												Probably the best next gen space sim availible. I have been looking for a while for a good space sim, and I love this. Esspeacially with the availibilty of Steam Workshop, really makes it have a lot of potential and feeds my space needs. X series is horrible. EVE only will pay itself off in time played during tutorials alone. The fact of the Steam Workshop sells this game itself. Just takes time, time people don't want to put in becuase they are not immersed enough. Trading starts slow and hard.. Realistically... Takes time to make 40,000,000.. relistically.. Killing off the bounty board and Salvaging derelects with swarms pays out great.. Doing trade and side missions in between. Save often. It just crashed on me. :( I only get one frame hangs durning New Sectors, or loading side missions.. I havn't gone under a steady 45fps with maxed out graphics and custom textures.I modded all the textures and the music. Added ships and changed voices. I'm immersed and won't stop till I got a fleet with some mercs and launch fighters out of my carrier, unleashing hell.			"

There's a huge map which always has things to do wether you're playing on campaign or freeroam, throughout which there are friends and enemies to trade and fight with. You can mine asteroids for diamonds, you can hijack enemy ships and either sell it or keep it in your garage! You can also upgrade your ship with various weapons and boosters you can even hire ships to follow and defend you.The devs are still updating and ironing out any issues which is nice to hear, but i haven't had a problem with it yet.I'm gunna smash this game once i'm done with divinity.8/10 "

												Amusing and pretty game.  I had fun.  Once I got the hang of capturing ships, the difficulty level dropped.  To be fair, I haven't tried tackling any of the veteran bounties, yet.  I understand that those are considerably more difficult since they will actually put up a fight and deploy counter-measures.The reputation system in this game is very simple: you gain +20 reputation for completing tasks for law-abiding factions and -20 reputation for completing missions for pirate factions.  I would expect reputation gain to drop more significantly and gain more slowly as it does in many other space sim games (e.g. Eve, X3, ...).  As it is, if you're low on cash, simply cap a ship and you'll be back in black.Pro:- Pretty- Lots of ships- Large mapCon:- Not a whole lot of variety or depth.- Different ships don't seem different enough (i.e. play style remains largely the same)- Voice acting is terrible; would have been better without.- Overly simplistic reputation system (see above).

												When I picked up the first Starpoint Gemini years ago I wasn't impressed. Ugly visuals, awful voice work, uninspired gameplay, I just couldn't stick with it. Imagine my surprise when it got a sequel. A really, really good one.I've been playing since Early Access and, though a little messy at first even then it had put right all the wrongs of it's predecessor and was blowing away the other Early Access space-sim I had my eye on at the time (yeah I'm looking at you Kinetic Void!)What we have here is:Graphics on par with the X3 series. Actually abit better - there is some fantastic lighting happening here, stormy nebulae to make FSopen jealous. My god it's full of stars! The ship models are wonderfully textured  down to turret details and the little holographic projector on the Ageba frigate.  I was particularly impressed  that you can name your ships and see the name decaled across the hull, little things like that are awesome. Also the tactical overlay was a really nice touch!Full 3D plane movement (and and handy key to reset planar orientation)A much improved interface with hotkeys for all the important stuff and nice RPG-style perk system for your captain. The skills need a little balancing but the devs seem to be on the path.Reliable camera control - stick it in Turret mode and make judisicous use of the Space and K keys and it feels just like EVE Online!A well fleshed-out free-roam setting with enough side-missions, customisation, exploration and combat to keep fans of Freelancer and Edge of Chaos happy.And a much improved campaign with some okay-but not-great voice acting and dialogue that I'm more than happy to overlook because......The combat is fantastic. The UI is a little clunky but when you find the right set up it's truly a joy to play. Wether weaving a speedy corvette through a torpedo run on a convoy of freighters, weapons blazing like a battlescene from DS9 or cruising a small flotilla through a gas cloud to scan a subspace anomoly, this as close you'll get to EVE Online offline. It plays somewhere between EVE and Freelancer  with more than a bit of old Star Fleet Academy.Active devs and built-in mod support. The devs have been really active and communicative all through Early Access and look committed to tweaking and balancing Starpoint Gemini 2. The whole game feels like a true labour of love for them. Steam Workshop already has some mods available and a a Mass Effect ship mod is in the works, as well as Star Trek ships and some small UI and balance tweaks from the community. Starpoint Gemini 2 is a space cadet's dream, in a time when genre is still only tentativly coming back from the grave. It's focus on capital-size craft instead of the more common starfigther cockpit is most welcome and fills oft an over-looked niche in the genre. I would've like to see a subsysem targeting mechanic more in line with Nexus: The Jupiter Incident where I can tactically pick apart my target but that's really small potatoes and the damage model here works just fine with critical hits offlining ship systems.In the end as a sequel SPG2 far surpasses, and on it's own it's a triumph, capturing everything you love about epic space operas in a wonderfully realised package. Trade, fight, mine, command and enjoy!Highlights:Engaging in a battleship dual in the middle of a lightning wracked nebula, desperatley jockeying for fireing arcs as our ships burn. KHAAAAN!!!!!Joining the defense of a besieged battlestation leading a rag-tag squadron of gunned-freighters to back up small armada of warships as beam weapons cut the night.The first time you're pirate away-team boards and captures a faction frigate and you tow it back to the shipyard as prize. Take what you can, give nothing back.Drifting gently through the corona of a blue giant as a gentle acoustic guitar track plays you ponder the best place to peddle small arms and battle mechs and what the odds are you'll get spotted sneaking planet side.

												If you like open world games, and you like open world games in space, then Starpoint Gemini is absolutely worth picking up.There's some reviews out there that are comparing this to Freelancer, and I'll say so far I definitely get that same vibe. Is it ""as good"" as Freelancer? I'd say it is a little early to tell, but I feel like this is going to be a huge time sink like Freelancer in a good way.Other reviews say this is Eve ""Offline"" and I definitely see where that is coming from, and in a good way. Trading so far does take some thought, there's random pirates that you can mostly evade if you want, and there's local defense forces around that will jump in to help (even if you don't want them too). Right from the start you can start doing whatever it is you feel like doing without feeling too ""new"" for lack of a better term.I started with the Campaign, and I'd say I'm not overwhelmingly enjoying the story, but it's still early so I can't fairly judge it.As far as free roaming, which I've spent more time on, I can tell I'll be spending most of my time doing just that. I managed to capture a ship I was planning to buy when a pirate attacked me, and so the mechanic for that is interesting. I've done some repair missions, bounty hunting, salvage work, and some trading. You can mine both gas and asteroids, but I haven't gotten around to that yet. No idea if there is any exploration to be had other than wandering around.It would appear there will also be a huge variety of ships in the game, as different areas have offered different ships for sale. So far, I've seen perhaps 4 or 5 factions of ships and the faction list is pretty long. Also, these are only the small ships which your skill will correspond to purchase ability. How hard it will be to obtain the bigger ships I cannot say, but given how many credits I have versus what the prices are on them, it does not appear to be a grindfest.The map feels pretty large, and it takes some time to get around each sector. At first, the map did not look all that large fully zoomed out, until I started panning around. Then I realized there was a LOT more and I've barely scratched the surface. 3 hours in, and doing a fair amount of travelling, and I have only made a small dent in the map BEFORE you pan anywhere!Combat takes a little getting used to, but I was also learning the controls, and I'm pretty competent now which was why I tried boarding a ship. The boarding mechanic is more or less getting close enough to grapple the target ship, then send boarding parties aboard to kill their defenders. Larger ships have more troops, so don't expect to successfully board a battleship with a gunship. You can also go into a ""turret mode"" to keep your guns trained on an enemy ship. While you might have some turrets blocked depending on ship design, you might also be able to deliver a nasty broadside!Speaking of those troops, you can replenish those troops at stations, and you can hire officers for your own ship to automate some things and make it more efficient. You can also hire mercenaries to fly alongside you, each with their own ships. So, as long as you can pay the salaries of the officers and mercs you hire, you can have a good leg up on some encounters. This also means traders and miners can have escorts, while the combat pilots can have some wingmen, and the fleet leaders can lead the way if they so choose.Trading is pretty straightforward, with each station having commodities in various states of supply and demand, which change from time to time. You can check what's in your cargohold against the last known prices of stations you've visited to gauge if it's worth making the trip. I should also note smuggling is an option, as different sectors have outlawed one thing or another, and you can ""sneak"" illegal goods if you have the right conditions.Overall, I am really happy to have picked this up, and I definitely look forward to exploring everything this game has to offer.

								If you're looking for your EVE Online fix, this is the game for you.  Best of all, it's Single-Player (for now, at least.  Not sure if MP is going to be a thing or not).  No pirate players to come rain on your parade.  No constant worry of whether or not you'll be blown to smithereens when you come out of a gate.  Scan anomalies!  Mine asteroids!  Hunt down the bad guys!  You can do it all.  Had there been a demo for this game for me to try out beforehand, I would have easily paid double its asking price for it.

Hire officers and also mercenaries.4)You have missions available at different places where you can accept or reject to earn money and experiences.5) Mods availble for this game.6) You have traits and specials skills as you level.Cons1) Tutorials wordings are too small!!!2) I find it not very user friendly even though the tutorials are there for you. It seems that I struggle for quite some time to get used to it and also the mission chart map seems nto well constructed. To me its not user friendly.3)Something is missing in this game I am not too sure.I will still recommend this game because of the things you can do in the game. Its the freedom to roam. This game is a hit and miss , If you are not sure I will suggest you get it on Sale or bundle. Its much more worth it.			"

												6 out of 10 Starpoint Gemini 2 is a space exploration and combat game.  In short, I expected somewhat more.   In the end I just could not finish it as it just dragged on and on. The good: 1. Great platform.  Space, ships, weapons etc. 2. Capturing enemy vessels. The bad: 3. I always seemed to die at the most inopportune times.  Then need to reload and re-traverse the same bits over and over. 4. Storyline is not very exciting.  No animation or something else to give it some life. The ugly: 5. Very repetitive.  The game needed more unique locations and content.			"

												Graphics are good, action is nice, the gameplay smooth and mostly bug free.  In many ways this game does things exactly right.  So why the thumbs down?Because it does one thing wrong and that one thing is enough to drag the rest down with it: It tries to use MMO logic in a single player game.  Which is to say that the grind is the whole of the content.  Do this mission to get credits to get a bigger ship with bigger guns so that you can do a mission with a bigger enemy to get more credits to get an even bigger ship etc etc ad hoc infinitum.  Once you hit max level and get the best ship there really isn't anything left to do except mindlessly blow things up at random.  It gets old really, really quick.Yes there is a story option but the missions in that story are hardly any different than the randomly generated ones from freeroam.  They just add voiceovers to some rather poorly written dialog.Still, the price is cheap and they game is entirely without it's virtues.  It just doesn't have anything to really hold a person's attention for very long.			"

Early Access Review
								Very fun space sim, very much in the ""Freelancer"" vein.  You get a ship, fly from port to port, buy and sell commodities, mine asteroids or take on freelance missions for fun and profit.  Your ship is upgradeable with an assortment of weapons and buffs available at any port with a drydock; there seems to be a pretty decent variety in the different planetary sytems.  Hiring officers (up to 3, at least on my frigate class) will give you additional buffs; each officer has different strengths, and no two are exacly alike in my gameplay so far. You can add to your fleet by capturing enemy ships after boarding them with your troopers, or do it the old fashioned way, and save up your credits.   Kind of reminds me of ""Eve:Online"", without all the annoying other people! ;)			"

								Even for an early access this game is well put together with minor (graphical/low frame rate issues around certain stations (phoenix)) issues. Once more content becomes available (missions, ships, storyline) i can see this game being pretty damn awesome. If you're still on the fence, get it. It's worth the money and the workshop only makes it that much more fun.			"

Great Space Opera game with amazing graphics-> Smuggling, fighting, mining, trading, bounty hunting, capturing ship, escorting convoy or attacking space base. -> Nice ship design.-> When you gain lots of credit, you can build a full fleet.-> You can create your own challenge = Being a pirate for exemple and try to be friend with the evil faction is an interesting challenge and a different gameplayThis is not a a space flying simulation as the game is optimized for mouse and keyboard, giving the game a nice tactical touch. It take a bit of time to get used of all the control but once you get them, you can get into amazing space battle : Surviving the  assault of an ennemy fleet on an allied Space station is just so rewarding.Cons :. Voice acting is not great but after sometime you get use to it.. A bit repetitif after a while/lots of grinding needed to buy better ship. . The auto aim make the game to easy in the end while you get a op battle ship.Anyway got lots of hours of fun with it.PS : Something extra to make the planet more lively would be great imo			"

												If, in your gaming memory you remember the classics like ""Freespace"" and ""Privateer"", and loved them, this is the game for you.  The interface is slick, operative and easy to use an understand.  There is a campaign, but my limited time with it just made me hungry for the freeroam mode, as I wanted to be a smuggler or pirate.  What's more the team at LGM is going to keep improving this title in the coming months, and it is likely to become not only a stopgap for ELITE: Dangerous and StarCitizen, but a competitor; and a great one.  I can't recommend this game enough.  You are really in for a treat if you take the time to take the tutorials and just be ready to forge your destiny.			"

												*Gnome Seal of Approval*Don't let the boring tutorial text scare you off if you're new to the genre. It's not as complex of a game as they would have you think. In fact, it's quite easy to learn once you know the basics. I'm new to the genre myself and read comments saying this game is too simple and dumbed down. So if that's true then this game is a good place to start, because I had fun playing the free roam sandbox mode.Lots of stuff to explore. Good controls. Nice visuals. Cool soundtrack.The negative:Earning money is slow until you're strong enough to take on heroes. You'll have a hard time earing enough to buy a new and better ship (which is important). However, once you start killing those heroes for rewards, you will quickly earn more than you need (which in turn feels a little imbalanced).Sandbox mode was a little repetitive. Short framrate drops when the game loads a new area in front of you (which in turn have lead to a crash here and there).If I was to play again, I'd start the story mode instead of the free roam.Cool game!

												so ive never been one for grind games. ive never fully enjoyed the objective of having to do lots of tiny bits to achieve the end goal, but i have to say i thoroughly enjoyed this game. I got the gold pack and have completed both the main story line, soa and of course titans. I find myself actually enjoying the aspect of flying around and stealing ships, taking on fleets and planning my moves. I feel the whole grinding aspect actually pays off when you go from ship to ship and i have to say, personale faves are the baeldor ships. or if you manage to find it the echelon, which is a beast of a ship. overall i love the designs of the ships,  yes the voice acting may be a bit iffy at times but i think it adds to the overall feel of the game, and even though there is a huge grind for ships, the rewards are well worth it. from a novice gamer who never really played these kinds of games i can well and truly say it is money well spent, and i am more than looking forward to warlords.

												To me it's like an arcade X3. Lot earier to get action and jump right into the game, but the trade means nothing in this game and your ""fleet"" is your one ship (and you only can have 1) and a merc you hire. Still fun for a time killer, but I prefer actually doing something that means something to the game like X3 does every second your in.So while there are freighters capable to carrying a good chunk of cargo and yea you do trade, it means nothing. The prices are random so you're selling high and buying low but it doesn't mean anything to the universe around you like X3's chained trade.			"

												KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK HERE GUYS BECAUSE JUST LIKE THAT I HAVE LOST MOST OF MY ATTENTION WITH SWTOR THIS IS A VERY RICH DEEP GAME HERE The flow is nice & you are not that timed on missions or at least not at the point where I am in the game. I have much experience with games of this nature. However, this right here is just nice. The music, the planets, the gear and ships. You definitely got my attention. I'll be honest that I bought the game & never opened it that much because another game here that will go unmentioned really destroyed it for me with games of this format. I recommend this to all who have been disappointed with sandbox/open-world games lately. You will not be disappointed because looks like they actually listened to the players. Hint: if you like the X3 Trilogy with a little of EVE ONLINE then go with this ONE HERE FOLKS. It's no pay to win or confusing irrevelant aspects such as if you run into a friendly target you get penalized in rank. RIGHT ON! FINALLY! Someone actually thinking!			"

												Althought the campaign game was uninteresting, I put 22 hours into the free roam, cruising around to different planets and engaging in space combat. The singleplayer campaign leaves a lot to desired, as the RPG elements are limited, and it is essentially a ""fly here-destroy"" ""fly there"" destory game. I did not get the impression of a complex game, but merely a simplistic space simulator, with very little depth. Worth it for a bargain, and only if you are interested in space sim games that are not too complex or fascinating. Factions only differ in name and equipment, and the presentation is shallow overall.Overall, this does not feel complex and finished enough to reccommend for a full price, but I would recommend buying for  a bargain.

												Since my life is so busy I cant play games much, I come from the angle of a almost n00b to the space sim, free open world games. I always wanted to see space but since our kind is more content sitting on this planet beating each other with sticks I suspect I wont achieve this dream.... So I bought most of the X series and I loved the idea but got so frustrated with the controlls and other nuancses that I probably spent about 4 hours in the last one I bought which was X3. I spent some time on X2 but due to lack of time I just never got into it.If only there was decent space sim that is not so complex I need to study a 1000 page manual to get into it and this certainly proved to be the one I was looking for. Easy to get in but I suspect fiendishly hard to master.Considering this is a brand new games studio I must give them a big 4 little thumbs up(I only have 4 thumbs). The interface is simple and clean. Objectives are forward and to the point. Graphics are great and I spend my time on the mindless train trip between Gordon and Blacktown with my laptop keeping me nice and warm as I just muddle around in the universe.It is a bit grindy at the start as you try and figure how to get to bigger things but overall a very enjoyable experience if you want something really deep but not obscure.Great effort and I am looking forward to what LGM studios brings out next.

												27-Jul-2016 : Finished main story + extrasEquipment : MSI GT80-2QE NotebookREVIEW :First thing first, this is not arcade space sim combat like Elite Dangerous, this is RPG game with space sim combat. You start with a small ship and you can play it like arcade space sim combat since the RPG elements seems irrelevant at the beginning. But as your rank get higher and you get access to bigger ships, you find yourself constantly outnumbered and outgunned. Tactical combat and RPG elements (properly developed character and ship) becomes essential to win a combat.The game is open world. To be powerful enough to progress through the main quest, you can do faction side quests, freelance quests, mining. trading, bounty hunting, pirating and capturing ships. The graphics and soundtrack is great, the story is mediocre with really bad voice acting. This game is not a high budget A-List game, so there's no fancy 3D cutscenes with motion tracking and real voice actors.  The game also really mod-friendly. You can edit stats and even your savegames using a simple text editor. This mod-friendly approach is more handy that it seems. For example, my favorite Carrier-class ship doesn't come with a cloaking device. Easy, edit the ship stats file using Notepad and add the cloaking device myself. There's also Mod Tools to build your own contents. If you're a Trekkie, make sure you try the Star Trek Ship Mods in the Steam Workshop.The developer also generous enough to give a free DLC titled ""Origins"". This free DLC offers 30 storyline missions of the original Starpoint Gemini, re-envisioned and ported to SPG2 engine. So if you never play the 1st one, you can play it now without extra cost. Basically you get 2 games for the price of one.CONCLUSION :Recommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.			"

												I received a press key during the early stages and have had the pleasure of watching the game take shape into what it is today.  The tutorials could still use a bit more work, though the game is a lot of fun once you get a handle on what you're doing.  It's a bit like Freelancer and other like-games in that you can explore different sections of the galaxy, do missions, mine for resource, buy/trade commodities, and so on.  The middle mouse radial menu, coupled with the starchart, makes interacting  with objects a cakewalk.  I still find combat to be a little tough because I have trouble figuring out and observing the available weapon arcs, though you can set the ship on ""fire at will"" and fly around while the computer does all the shooting.  All in all, worth the asking price.

												A decent capital ship combat game, but somewhat shallow.Pros:+ A wide variety of ships and equipment+ Combat is a little simplistic but fun nonetheless. Reminds of Rebel Galaxy but offers more control.+ Capturing enemy ships feels satisfying+ Looks good enough. I somehow love the battle hud(blue ring thingie around your ship, appears on some of the screenshots) and miss it in other similar games.Cons:- Probably the worst voice acting in game history. Some voices are really irritiating, especially protagonist's.- Even though all ships are capital ships, you don't feel their scale. For example if you play X3/X:Rebirth, you do feel that your massive capital ship is a massive capital ship. Here all ships are basically the same size and you don't have anything to compare them to.- RPG elements are pretty lame- Story progression is sometimes very confusing. Like you won't have enough crew on your starter ship to capture any other ship (and start earning significant amount of money) or you'll simetimes find that you need 10 more levels to actually pilot a ship you've just earned. Or later in the game I kept getting way more levels than I actually needed.- Limited ship customization options. You can arbitrarily choose any weapons for your ship which's good, but its subsystems are predefined for any given hull and you can just upgrade them slightly via enhancements.- Even though I did rush the game in the end, I have completed it(without DLC stuff) in 32 hours on the hardest difficulty which's a little underwhelming for this kind of games.Grab this game if:You want a little arcadish broadside-style capital ship combat driven by a campaign scenario. Avoid this game if:If you're looking for a very in-depth experience similar to X3/EVE or physically plausible ship controlling similar to Elite. This game has a strong indie feeling to it, don't expect anything of AAA-like scale.My overall rating is 7/10, I did enjoy this game and I'm really looking forward to its successor Starpoing Gemini : Warlords.

Short Version: Grand Space Sim that puts you in command of a space ship to fly, shoot, trade, save the universe, blow up stuff, do the laundry, collect files hidden in floating junk, level up, hire recruits, upgrade your ship, and do pretty much anything else your starfaring heart desires.  The game looks nice, plays well (albeit at a slowish pace), has enjoyably 'space-y' ambient music, and offers a ton of different content that may not always 'wow', but will definitely satisfy.Starpoint Gemini 2 reminds me of a giant, sword-wielding turtle.  No, really! Just let me explain...Waaaay-back-when, in those wonderful 8-32 bit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle video games, you could play as one of four characters, each with different strengths and weaknesses: Raphael, who had tiny, short-range, but superfast attacks; Donatello who was really slow but could whack-a-ninja from half a screen away with his staff; Michelangelo who specialized in... I don't know, making pizza with nunchucks? Or something?  And then there was Leonardo, who didn't attack quite as fast as Raphael, and didn't have quite the reach of Donatello, and didn't (pizza?) quite as well as Michelangelo - but hey, he was a very close second-best at *everything* and pretty dang awesome as a result.Sooo... if space games were mutant turtles, then Starpoint Gemini would definitely be Leonardo.  Sure, some dedicated RPGs have better character development in stats and story (and DEFINITELY voice-acting), and some starfighters have more intuitive controls without the need for a gazillion tuturial screens and HUD informational windows, and some trading/exploration games have a more lifelike economy that can fully support your character as a pacifist (read: cowardly) trader... but Starpoint 2 offers ALL those types of gameplay and more, and all done extremely well - just not quite on par with the best. This enormous range of solid, enjoyable space-sim content is the essence of Starpoint Gemini 2.All-in-all, SG2 is a huge Space-Based-RPG/Combat/Trading/Strategy/ShipBuilding/Sandbox-Simulator mashup that may be slightly flawed and a bit slow-moving compared to games that 'specialize', however the astonishingly vast scope of gameplay content is all well-done, nicely polished, and most importantly... fun!   With a large campaign and moddable freeplay mode spanning half a dozen genres, Starship Gemini 2 is second-to-none in being second-to-all - but hey, so was Leonardo, and he became the leader of the Ninja Turtles for a reason!(*SIDENOTE:  Despite evidence to the contrary in this review, Raphael was actually the best turtle.  Of course, comparing Starpoint Gemini 2 to a giant mutant *sai*-wielding turtle would have been utterly nonsensical, so I went with Leonardo.) Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

												It's a very *loose* yes as a recommendation to play this game. If you can get it on a good sale, then it can be a fairly fun experience running around a small system of planets, doing odd jobs, buying new ships, and upgrading weapons. There's some decent stories involved and the devs have made some nice DLC's available for pretty cheap/free.Downside: this game is buggy as hell when it comes to the control scheme, especially if you want to use a controller with the game. I happen to like using a controller; I feel like it's very relaxing and I can kick back in a chair. Using an Xbox One controller with this game, (or any controller) is going to lead to a hell of a lot of mapping issues that don't get resolved easily. Also, loading up the DLC's can be kind of weird, since you're selectively activating them. Unlike games like Skyrim, where you can just roll up and jump into a DLC once you add it to your game with whatever save file you're using, this game like to cordon off the DLC's and have you jump sandbox to sandbox. They can be fun, but it's not always ideal. That all being said... there's a ton of ships in this game and ways to arm them out. Whatever your playstyle, you'll eventually captain a ship that meets your needs, whether that be overwhelming destructive force, a carrier that houses a fleet, or a ship that can drop out of stealth and put the hurt on. It can be pretty addictive. It can ALSO be extrememly repetitive. You mileage may vary!Final Verdict: yes, I'd recommend this game, but it really will appeal only to a specific type of gamer.			"

								Wow, I was not expecting this. This is a quality single player ship RPG. Much like EVE Online, but less boring and, well, MMO-ish. There are some things that could use some polish and the UI could use a little love, but nothing that's gamebreaking and certainly nothing that makes the game overly difficult. I never played the first one, but this is a series I will forever be excited about now.			"

												This game is great if you want a single player RPG and to run around in space.  The free roam is cool but gets old, and the story gives you purpose but it is limited.  This GAME WOULD BE EPIC if it had multiplayer support.  If you could build a fleet with real humans and maybe go raid someone that might be able to apply a little bit of strategy.  The biggest drawback is that it is linear, you want to beat someone get some better guns... or a bigger ship, thats it.  Buy a long range weapon and you can literally just tease the AI until they are dead waiting out of there auto combat range, attacking them and backing off when they chase so they start all over.

												A qualified ""Buy.""This game is basically Freelancer. The variety is a bit lacking, but the gameplay is pretty solid.A few caveats: (2 Days after Release) - In it's current form, balance is an issue, some activities are far more profitable than others. - Enemies scale in difficulty based on your level, it's possible to earn too much experience and not enough money to prevent yourself from being anihillated by everything. - Some technical issues remain (Framerate is locked at 30FPS, Some graphics options are disabled. Crashes are rare but occur.)TLDR: If you loved freelancer, and want more of the same, you'll probably enjoy this. Don't expect anything revolutionary, however.			"

												Some intial problems with the game almost made me eat my own scowling face with rage. For serious, it took four tries just to make it launch and once it did launch it took two restarts to make it launch without messing its big boy pants. Finally, I got into the game, started playing, and immidiately strangled myself with my own mouse cable. This will happen, don't panic. Just unwrap yourself or, if you have to, find an adult to help. At first the controls feel as stable as a drunken donkey with the skurvy, at least with a mouse. I flopped around for quite a while, but eventually not only was I flying circles around the bad guys, I was...no, I was just flying circle cause that's how I dodge enemy fire while keeping my guns trained on them. The point is the flopping became on purpose, cause stragedy; now the controls seem alright to me. The map is roughly six times bigger than something really, really big (a house, a small country, yo momma, etc.). It's big, like hugemongous. Think of something really big, and then know that this is much bigger. The game has two modes: Campaign and Freeroam, although a Campaign save can abandon the story to go chase space squirrels once you realize that space rodents are much more interesting. I played the Campaign for about an hour, then made a new character in Freeroam who is a morbidly obese, one-eyed robot smuggler with a ship so fast that no one has thus far been able to catch it and I regret absolutely nothing. Freeroam is why you buy this game. Freeroam will consume you. I have accepted that this game is my new family, and you must too. Don't fight it. Let Space Daddy carry you away in his big, strong hands. Shhhhhh..... 8/10			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 makes for a pretty enjoyable space sim experience, but it is very lacking in depth.  It tries so hard to give you the complexity one desires in a space sim with features like capturing ships using marines, scanning anomalies, and coming across derelicts just waiting to be scavenged, but in the end, these activities are very superficial.  They eventually become very routine and the rewards are often limited to money or experience.  Levelling up your character doesn't grant much satisfaction, except for when a perk point is given.Not much is required before you'll be rocking around Gemini in the biggest ship the game has to offer, decked out with the biggest guns, with all the best upgrades.  Luckily, this doesn't make you the ultimate end-all-be-all combat god of the universe.  Combat appears to be balanced in such a way that you will always be vulnerable and dealing with this turns out to require very different strategies depending on the size of your ship.Combat is one of the things this game does very well, and a challenge always awaits you as the game throws squadrons of enemies at you routinely, even the periodic Legendary or Hero ship, which offers an even greater challenge and huge money rewards for the latter.Otherwise, this game seems like a pretty casual space sim.  You will get plenty of enjoyment out of it, but you won't get invested in it like you'd like, which makes the sub-40 dollar price tag perfect for the experience it offers.			"

												Bought this game not that long ago and i have had a blast. Simple yet hard and fun combat, the focus of the game is on large capital ships instead of fighters something i like very much, it makes you feel like a proper captain. Awesome ships designs and graphics. The game gives you tons of freedom to to what you want to do, you want to be a pirate go ahead, trader sure, miner or a bounty hunter have at it. The game has one of the best and most active dev team i have seen, they activly talk with their gamerbase and activly put in new features and ideas in the game. This game is going to evolve alot and they are planing many more awesome features.

												This game is a TRUE open world space RPG. I really love this game, despite is few shortcomings.Freedom: Full freedom to do whatever you want, wherever you want, whenever you want is why this game is great. You can become a full time miner and collect minerals, you can ferry goods from station to station and trade for money, you can capture enemy ships and DRAG them back to your base to sell. Combat: Perhaps the best part of this game is the combat system. It is really like a 3d dogfight in space ships. Do not expect a true space physics, but the combat system is one of the most fun I have played. You actually fly the ship yourself and shoot the weps yourself. Direct full energy to shields to survive, weps to destroy, or engines to run like hell!RPG: You gain levels as you go. You can kill ships for small XP or do missions for more XP. You can level up each of your 4 special skills, get bonuses to your ""profession"", and buy new ships at higher levels, each with their own special traits.Glitches: I have had about 10 full crashes in 24 hours of playtime. I have many out of memory errors when I still have lots in task manager, although the game still runs, for a while... In game glitches are more frequent but less noteworthy.			"

												4/5I´ve been looking for a game that resembles one of my old favorites, Freelancer so when I found this I got very excited.Sat down, launched the campaign and boy did I smile once I had it all set up and flew through space on my way to my first mission. Gonna try to list some of the pros and cons belowPros+ Nice graphics+ Awesome soundtrack (seriously, I leave the game running when I go to bed)+ Lots of ships+ Select between campaign and Freeroam and choosing the first won´t stop you from doing the roaming freely.+ Many different factions+ Huge map+ Really nice controls once you get the hang of them+ Active devs, seen them post in the steam forums many times+ Many different ways to make money in-game+ Rare drop blueprints+ Achievements+ Many difficulties (only tried normal)Cons- The voice acting in the campaign lacks feeling- Sometimes it´s impossible to target things by clicking on them (think it might be a bug cause if you click on something else and then try again, it works). No real problem though since it´s uncommon and you can always use quickbinds for targeting stuff.- I´ve had a few crashes since I bought it but since the game is being actively patched (and I haven´t crashed for a few days) it might have already been fixed or I feel confident they'll fix it.- Might get a little repetitive after a whileHaving played it quite a lot the past weeks I'd say it's one of my best purchases in a long time and it deffinitly deserves a strong 4!1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game but not my taste4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played			"

												Very enjoyable, a bit rough around the edges.Even with a few issues (voiceover audio not playing, no docking animations, navigation issues when you hit go-to when you're next to a station you've docked at, etc.) this game is very, very fun.Unlike the space sims before it (Freelancer) and the modern ones coming out (Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen) which focus on the mechanics of a more agile fighter, Starpoint Gemini 2 focuses much more on a capitol ship feel. You're not a lone pilot darting through space in a dogfight, you're sitting at the helm of a Carrier, deploying fighters, and watching your crew unload your ship's payload. Power management is stressed, as is the use of powers and items that bolster shields, shut down enemy systems, etc. One thing I love about this game which I have not yet seen in another space sim is the ability to send your troops over to capture another ship. This happens to be one of the best ways to make money, and is extremely fun.Unfortunately it doesn't give you any experience (which seems a little peculiar, considering it's an integral part of many people's strategies), but the payout is fantastic.All in all, worth buying, though I haven't played it since Elite: Dangerous came out lol			"

												I gotta say ever since the Star Trek Star Fleet Command series of games I was always looking for something close.I found Starport Gemini and it quickly grew on me. It has many of the elements the former Star Trek games had, Ship command, 360 degree views, power management, repair, officers, ability to go anywhere in the galaxy, trading. The great thing aboiut Starport Gemini 2 is it improves on all that with 360 degree freedom of the camera and space maneuvering. Its no longer 2d in that regard. Even in beta it feels polished compared to the earlier game. I can't wait for the campaign to come and I do hope someone makes a mod so us girls can play as female in it. I give the Game 4 stars out of 5 as is.Big thuumbs up.			"

Early Access Review
								Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game I've been following for a long time, hoping for a game that would dethrone Freelancer from its rightfull place. So far things look good and this might even be the case in the future, but as of now there's still plenty of work to be done. That doesn't mean SG2 wouldn't feel good to play. Does it?The game features a rather large open area The Gemini Star System. It's filled with stations, shipyards, bases, asteroid fields, junkyards, enemy ships, friendly ships, planets, anomalities, practically everything you would expect from a sandbox-type space game. It feels like there's a lot to do out there but at least for me that's not the case. This is because the game features very few different types of missions for the moment. There are freelance missions which you'll accept over the map view and then start them by docking with the correct facility, ship or planet. These missions usually involve hauling passangers or goods from the dock point to another. There are also scanning, repairing, patrolling and I think I even saw an assassination mission. These might keep you busy for a while but the samey repeating content of each mission type quickly lose their charm.The game's main emphasis is on space combat which for the most parts feels good. Ships fly in space and trade fire with missiles, beam weapons, plasma and railguns. Fighters fly out from the bigger ships and engage the enemies and boarding parties can devastate the enemy ships from within. You can fire manually or tell the game to target and fire on the target for you. I find this helpful since handling the ship in combat can be a real pain. You control your ship through two different control mechanics. The default one uses WASD to steer the ship while the mouse is used to target, shoot and activate buttons on the GUI. The second method is using the mouse to steer the ship. The ship turns along your mouse movement much the same way the default steering in Freelancer was handled. I prefer the former method in this game since using the mouse flight feels overly sensitive and I can't seem to make the ship fly straight or stay on target. In combat you also have to keep your ship from taking damage and face the stronger shield at your enemy while also focusing on distributing fire from your weapons evenly enough so you can have a sustained stream of fire at the target. I'm not sure if this is the intended way to fight but I've found it effective. You can also enter the turret view to move the camera and aim targets around your ship freely, this helps you to shoot targets your ships is not directly facing at. The combat is fairly entertaining, although like I mentioned above, steering the ship can be difficult and the default camera angle isn't helping much. When you need to fly on target it seems you have to place the target somewhere above your ship, close to the top edge of your screen. This is the actual direction the ship is moving towards to and it might take a while to get used to that. Also because of the odd camera angle I often had to keep the enemy ""above"" my ship to be able to fire the majority of my weapons at it. This just feels wrong, at least to me.The GUI is what really bothers me the most. It's overly colourfull, oddly clunky and the sound effects are horrendous. I have a tendency to go for a ""minimalist"" kind of look when it comes to user interfaces and such. In this game the UI makes me think of children toys, the large plastic kind with full of teeth marks and bright flashy colours. Actually, now that I think of it, the overall design and look of the game is overly shiny and gleamy. The ship designs could also be a tad more imaginative. Even the large battleships just look and feel like one-man fighter crafts even though they are supposed to be much larger than that.Overall the game has potential to be extremely entertaining. I like it so far even if the things I mentioned above might feel a little harsh. I've got great expectations for this game, although experience has taught me not to, but I can't help it. I'm longing for a good space combat/sim/whatever that has the feel and openness of Freelancer.			"

												Edit: This was a review of the EARLY ACCESS! This does not reflect the new content added in the update, but once I play the retail version enough, I will be sure to update!For a while I have been looking for a good open-world space game, with nothing really looking like a decent game. For me, spore is the most experience with a space-style game, which I really loved, but I wanted to move on to better things. Then I saw Starpoint Gemini 2 in development. After watching some videos and seeing how fantastic the game looked, I decided to buy it, which was an excellent decision and one that I recommend anyone reading this review to follow.Little more needs to be said about the visuals. They are fantastic. Combat is also really well done, and content is surprising since it is still in development and only has one gamemode so far. The most disappointing thing about this game for me was that there is no option to actually explore planets. This is purely a space exploration game, which of course is why the price is not rediculously high and is very reasonably priced especially for a game so modern that it is still in development. That limitation is really the one thing which is keeping this from being my dream game, but it is definitely fantastic for what it was designed for. Just make sure to dock whenever possible so that you can save and not lose a ton of progress!Overall, I definitely recommend this game whether you are new to the space scene or a veteran. Especially at this price point, it is an excellent buy!			"

												A very good space game, enjoyable in freeroam and the story mode seem pretty interesting. The only thing bugging me about the game is the frequent pauses and stutters whilst flying through zones - the game will literally stop for a second, at first it didn't bother me but since starting the story mode the pausing seems to stand out more and has become a pet hate. Going to wait for a few updates and hopefully this will get cured, not sure I can finish the game whilst this is an issue.I'm going to recommend the game because it is a really fun game, if these pauses get cured it will be really enjoyable, and I do think it will be cured because the devs have been doing a great job.(And before anyone blames my spec for the pauses - I'm using a i7 4770K, 16GB ram, GTX 770 and the game is running from a 3TB WD black.)

												This game can be summed up as a modern day Freelancer, but with capital ships instead of fighters. It shares many similarities with the aforementioned game, as well as some enjoyable improvements, and will probably be the best single player Freelancer-style space sim available for a good while. With Star Citizen focused on multiplayer, look no further than Starpoint Gemini 2 to fill the gap between the two.Like Freelancer, you can play with keyboard and mouse, with a rather familiar flight control style to Freelancer players. But although SG2 offers support for other gaming controllers, it's far from polished right now - it's near-enough unplayable with the popular Saitek X52 HOTAS, given the rediculous deadzone on all axes. However, if anything, the keyboard and mouse feels more natural to use in this game anyway, given you're playing the role as a ship (and later, fleet) commander.Comparing this game to the failure that was X-Rebirth, SG2 comes out on top. Although more arcady, SG2 is significantly more enjoyable from the getgo.			"

For the complaint, and it may be something on my end, I'm experiencing a lot of crashes, still worth it to reload every hour or so though. As for a suggestion, I love the open world sandbox feel, however a more effective fast travel would be nice. My second suggestion would be to work in some speaking graphics of an alien or human pirates or whoever is talking when I recieve a message from somebody in the upper left cornet within the exploration game.

This game reminds me of that, hours and hours pf play time......Also love the fact you can play this game at any pace you like, big plus for an oldtimer like me....Marc 10/10			"

												One of the most fun games I have ever played...Got a half decent ship by smuggling some weed between 2 planets, actually made a killing of that until the cops caught me and I lost reputation in the area which basically put me on the line between ""friendly"" and ""enemy""  so they almost killed me...I came back though...Upgraded my ship with a cloaking system..now the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can't see this weed smuggler..I skipped the campaign and I am just playing as a Trader Currently and it is quite a bit of fun..only had the game for a little while and its starting to become my go to chillaxing game...the mod support/Workshop support is amazing...hopefully more people catch on and develop some mods =)We have StarTrek and some OP ship mods but thats about it.Picked mine up for $10 on ♥♥♥, I would say this game in its current state is worth $15 maximum....$10-5 when StarCitizen Releases.

												Very enjoyable, a bit rough around the edges.Even with a few issues (voiceover audio not playing, no docking animations, navigation issues when you hit go-to when you're next to a station you've docked at, etc.) this game is very, very fun.Unlike the space sims before it (Freelancer) and the modern ones coming out (Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen) which focus on the mechanics of a more agile fighter, Starpoint Gemini 2 focuses much more on a capitol ship feel. You're not a lone pilot darting through space in a dogfight, you're sitting at the helm of a Carrier, deploying fighters, and watching your crew unload your ship's payload. Power management is stressed, as is the use of powers and items that bolster shields, shut down enemy systems, etc. One thing I love about this game which I have not yet seen in another space sim is the ability to send your troops over to capture another ship. This happens to be one of the best ways to make money, and is extremely fun.Unfortunately it doesn't give you any experience (which seems a little peculiar, considering it's an integral part of many people's strategies), but the payout is fantastic.All in all, worth buying, though I haven't played it since Elite: Dangerous came out lol			"

												I gotta say ever since the Star Trek Star Fleet Command series of games I was always looking for something close.I found Starport Gemini and it quickly grew on me. It has many of the elements the former Star Trek games had, Ship command, 360 degree views, power management, repair, officers, ability to go anywhere in the galaxy, trading. The great thing aboiut Starport Gemini 2 is it improves on all that with 360 degree freedom of the camera and space maneuvering. Its no longer 2d in that regard. Even in beta it feels polished compared to the earlier game. I can't wait for the campaign to come and I do hope someone makes a mod so us girls can play as female in it. I give the Game 4 stars out of 5 as is.Big thuumbs up.			"

								This game is basically the dream game I have been looking for since I started playing video/computer games. It totally captures the essence of space games and fictions like Star Trek with a level of polish unheard of for an alpha. Constantly updated, and with a developer community unlike any I've seen; go to the community hub and find any conversation and I'll bet the developers have listened and participated at least once.

								This is a great game. Like all space sim/action/whatever, it takes a little to get comfortable with all the controls. There is so far only one real thing I'd change. There is a sense of ""I'm never ever gonna be able to afford that..."". The experience gained from freelancer missions is way too freaking small, and the upgrades to weapons are insanely expensive, not to mention I have no real idea how much of a boost they are giving me, because the data doesn't have % signs or adjustments shown.So really, it's a great game. Period. It seems like it would never end really, which is great. But I still have no sense of how long it will take to get to higher levels, because right now I'm level 3 (so like 6300/9000 points to next level) and each of these freelancer missions gets me like 50 freaking points! So I'm asuming never.I know I am just griping about that over and over, but that's it, that's the only drawback. Other than that, it has everything you want in a space RPG. Exploring, mining, upgrading, fighting (which is pretty hard, but really fun), assassinations, etc.			"

								Only clocked in around 7 hours so far but woa... i am blown away.. even in alpha stage this game just shows an great potential and already nicely working elements such as capturing ships. You earn you money the way you want! nothing is forced as of now you can even flee or just ignore enemy ships... to be honest i think and hope that i found what i am looking for in a space game... but enough of me talking here is what i love and hate in it:Pro: Gorgeous graphics,       Random Events       lots and lots of different ships to fight/fly       large map to explorecons: occasional frame drops (dusty asteroid field on the first spawn point... for me thats a brute videocard killer :D)         Controls might be tricky (i use gunner view all the time while flying with keyboard its fine this way for me)         alpha... i ignore the small bugs and stuff that are a usual visitor to ALL alpha stage games so ... yup         occasional small lock ups (1-2 sec) when an event/area is loading (but i kinda think this is only for me and my rather                        weak pc)Buy: If you want a very good space Single Player RPG and if you have the patience and nerves for an alpha (meself i did not encounter any huge bug and only had game crash one times so far)Dont Buy: if you are afraid of Alpha's (there is nothing wrong with that its totally acceptable) and if you are inpatient for them.9/10 for me (-1 is due to some lag issues I encounter)			"

								After playing EVE Online (Non-Steam) I've been really looking for a space-sim similar to it but an offline version. X3 (Non-Steam) was the best one I've played so far, and Rebirth I've never touched because it looked pretty disappointing.Music: The tracks so far are good and fit the game well but there's only 4 tracks I've heard so far but hopefully more will come.Gameplay: Depending on the class you pick, you'll have a set of skills that you can utilize in combat or other purposes, there's a leveling system as well which you progress by doing missions, mining, exploring new sectors, repairing ships/stations, scanning anomalies and blowing other ships up, with this in mind the game felt like it was a Space Sim/RPG mix to me. Combat is good, I have freedom of movement and aim. It's also cool how you have troopers on your ship and you can get them to board other ships, unfortunately I never succeded.Graphics: Ship/Station models, anomalies look decent, the background looks excellent, planets look ok but overall the game looks great.Single Player: So far there's only a Sandbox mode where you can do whatever you want, there's no story mode at the moment but they have said that they are working on it and we'll probably end up seeing it sooner or later.Summary: Starpoint Gemini 2 has alot of potential and It's pretty good for an early access title, so far I've enjoyed my time with and will continue playing it. One thing I would love to see is the ability to actually fly into the planets and explore the landscapes, not just dock on the planets with a menu and what not. "

I almost wish it was like ""Mount and Blade"", with you joining a faction and assisting that faction capture enemy territory.Though besides it lack of depth in places, I still enjoyed the game for the time I spent in it.

								You can pilot anything from a gunship to a carrier (you can NOT pilot fighters, they are launched from carrier class vessels), do freelance missions like assassinations (destroying marked ships), assistance (Fight off attackers and protect a ship). However the ships you have to destroy are not necessarily your enemy, in fact they could be allies!The game might be in alpha (going in to beta very soon), and there are bugs/missing features (Alpha is alpha after all). But in it's current state it is highly playable and very fun for anyone interested in piloting their own spacecraft, and the developers interaction with their playerbase is very commendable. I see them answering questions in almost every quistion topic here on steam, and they are active on their own forumes as well.I have heard the original Starpoint Gemini was not that good (I have not played it myself), and if that is so: do not fear, this game, even in alpha, is very enjoyable. Any spacesim enthusiast will get their moneys worth, and then some!			"

								This game is like what others have said, lacking in entertaining content for the moment, story, challenge on demand, and does have you with little to do after a certain amount of time.However, i still recomend this as a purchase for early access and most definitly recomend feature complete status on-ward.The game runs smoothly and brilliantly, and how many early access games can you say has a games workshop up n running at this stage? there are 3 ships available right now in the workshop from star trek, one of the three is one im unfamiliar with, so perhaps an original model idea. new content will steadily flow into this game that has had me checking every other day for new workshop mods or new patches that allows for entertainment in of itself. I recomend early access to people who would actually want to see a game develop into something new and unique, you can help using the workshop, and even if you dont have the skills, they do not kid around when they say they are using OUR idea's. Suggest something in the forums, however simple or elaborate as you like and they WILL consider it.There are compenies we've seen who have had amazing communities launching suggestion barrages at them just ignore every single one and watched as the game died off (i have one in mind specifically for this =p) yet here, just take a look at the forums, at how often you get responses from the dev's in regards to suggestions. I've heard of a wish list that includes a unicorn! This is a game to keep an eye on at the very least, i feel we'll see great things from this gem in future.			"

												Alright. So...Downsides:1. There's a Commander class that benefits fleet and the best you can do for a ""fleet"" is hire 2 mercenaries later in the game.2. The map is THE BIGGEST FREE ROAM I'VE EVER SEEN. And it takes forever to get anywhere even with the PTE speed.3. First 4 campaign missions are travels (you kill like 2 ships) that take 5mins of travel time each if you don't get sidetracked. (Haven't gotten further yet)4. When mining, debris containing your precious loots flys everywhere faster than your ship moves, slowing the process.Upsides:1. The map is THE BIGGEST FREE ROAM I'VE EVER SEEN. I've spent almost 6 hours trying to open 10% of the map up. I've explored basically none of it, but now I know where the faction structures are for a little bit of a corner of a section of the map.2. Auto-aim from Open Fire actually leads the target instead of dicking around with straight shots based on current location. Awesome job.3. The ship types are easy enough to learn and yet there are enough of them to still have a good enough variety.4. Graphics are decent.5. You mine the same way you fight. By blowing ♥♥♥♥ up with your weapon systems.6. The ship you start with is more than enough to ♥♥♥♥ around and get work done for a while (so far all I had to replace was the weapon system).7. Enemies spawn/warp in often enough you don't have to explore to find cargo to sell. And they won't persue you fast enough that you can get away fairly quickly without much worry. 8. The radar/scanner/mini-map is easy to understand as long as you're not a brick.9. Middle Mouse Button is your friend.10. Controls take a minute to get used to during combat, but you'll pick it up pretty quick since you just have to worry about positioning/dodging instead of aiming your light weapons.11. There's still a challenge when you're fighting in big fights.10/10 worth my money and time so far. Haven't played far into the campaign but I'll see how that goes, also. Awesome first empression and I definitely suggest dicking around in freeroam instead of starting with the campaing to figure stuff out, then turning off tutorials in campaign for a smoother ride.

												I'm not sure how to review this one. There are some issues that I have with it that are just hallmarks of past space sims. So if you hate typical downsides of space sims, then this game doesn't really break that barrier. If you're not a fan of classic space sims, then this game doesn't deliver much outside of that. But first off, I got this game when it was 80% off 2 years after it released. I got it primarily to scratch that never-ending itch of playing a worthwile space sim while waiting for Star Citizen to be a more complete game. My review is about the base game with its base story missions and content.The main campaign is a revenge story of a son wanting justice for his dad's murder, but like past sci-fi games it quickly evolves into you saving the whole world or in this case a solar system. Cliched, I know, but I won't spoil it. The story likely took me about 8 hours to complete which I expected for a game like this. Like previous space sims before it, it allows you to do whatever you want and start any mission you want after the initial mission without an artificial lock like you need to be level X to do mission Y. Personally, I like that in open world games. There are supposedly 13 non-story mission types that are randomly generated on the map, but depending on your ship these missions can range anywhere from super easy or downright impossible. That was my first problem with this game. The randomly-created missions support the grindiness aspect of the game, and the rewards often feel lackluster even after progressing so far into the game. When you've done one ferry mission or security mission, you've done them all. There's no variation in each mission type. Just a difference in NPC ship difficulty. That's where problem 2 comes in.You can mine asteroids, crystals, and pockets of gas in certain sectors of the map that will reward you depending on the market value and how big your cargo hold can take. After getting the ship with the most cargo capacity and mining said sectors, the tediusness and grindiness settles in quick. If you like that aspect of space sims, where grinding = bigger and better ship then this is right up your alley. If not, then look elsewhere. Personally, after ~50 some hours of mining, salvaging, bounty hunting, raiding commercial ships and stations, escorting/protecting/rescuing NPCs and scanning space anomalies, I feel like this game scratched that itch. I can't say I enjoyed the whole grind experience, but I did feel satisfaction upon earning one of the best ships in the game. Once you get past the tedium and set up a ship goal, hours did fly for me by working up the reputation and credits to earn it. If you expect not to grind for a better ship, then expect to mod the game or not get the game at all.The leveling system is typical with missions giving you x amount of credits and experience points. You use these points to level up different abilities for one of three chosen classes (commander, gunner, engineer) that activate in-game to give your ship better stats momentarily like faster speed, more weapon damage, faster shield regeneration, etc. The reputation system is binary where doing missions for X faction will yield Y rep points and -Y rep for the opposing faction. You can side with ""bad"" factions, stay lawful/chaotic neutral, or side with ""good"" factions. I chose to be lawful good throughout the game, like a good boy scout that I try to be irl. Siding with either faction will either open or close certain planets and stations which will lock you out of a certain achievement if you're not neutral. It's a lot harder to stay neutral because the story doesn't let you choose outcomes and there aren't enough non-story missions that will help keep you neutral. So what's my problem with this? The leveling system on top of the grindy non-story missions really does show how tedius this game can get. It doesn't really get better once you reach your ship goal. I'm still left with the same missions and rewards that don't scale as much as I wanted it to.You'd think that once you're Commander Badass with a Dreadnought, fighter ships you can deploy and merc ships you can hire, that you'd be making bank by melting everything in sight with your plasma cannons. Nope. I still have to mine/salvage/scan/trade ad infinitum to make serious money. Having a bigger ship does help with not dying every 10 minutes or so from seemingly random incursions with other giant ships, often multiple giant ships to contend with. That's another problem I have with this game. NPC ships that scale from a trivial threat to impossible come out of nowhere at random times. Even when you're technically in safe sectors of space, NPCs that are against your faction (which to me is every bad guy in the game) will spawn or decloak out of nowhere and proceed to tear you a new one very early in the game, until you have one of the best ships then you can go toe to toe with one of them. If dying repeatedly due to random incursions regardless of where you are in the map isn't your thing, then that's a big problem. I get it, space is dangerous and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can be anywhere in the vast emptiness of space. But if I'm 10 seconds away from the good guys Navy fleet, you'd think that pirates and marauders wouldn't go that close and tear you a new one. If/when I create a chaotic evil character save, I will update this review to reflect my experience being on the other side of the law.One aspect I failed to use in this game before this review are mods from the Steam workshop. They range from quality of life mods (better loot, more damage, faster speed) to custom assets in game (ships, stations, missions, etc.) to total conversions, so fellow Star Trek fans will be able to scratch that itch.I'd like to say that after ~60 hours of playing this game, I will recommend it to fans of classic space sims with the caveat that there is a space sim grind to it and that it doesn't hold your hand. If you're looking for a revolutionary game that breaks the typical downsides of space sims, then please look elsewhere. If you know that you want to scratch that classic space sim itch with the understanding of the problems that I've explained above, then I do recommend this game to you.			"

												Starpoint Gemini is worth buying if you like sandbox space games where you can mine, be a pirate, or just do missions. However, 35 dollars just seems too high for what you get so you may want to wait for a sale of some kind first.Video showing what the gameplay is like(even though old video, gameplay is still 99% the same... campaign just didnt exist yet):

								Being a SCI-Fi fan, it brings me much joy to review SPG2. This is an awesome space sim/ fighter game in which you command one of many space worthy vessels against pirates, factions and even natural elements like radiation which will wreak havok on your ship and crew. There are missions, faction missions, mining and salvage operations, and if your more about chaos and destruction then you can go around hijacking other ships to add to your own collection or sell, its all up to you. Currently the game is still in Beta and the game has its bugs and balancing issues but the Devs are always hard at work bringing constant updates and answering questions from the community, which is a major plus these days. The game at is current state is beautiful to look at with many various galaxies, planets and space stations, this game easily surpasses other sims that have already had time to mature. Future updates include strory lines, more complex missions, and ships, also the list as the devs have called it is always growing from ideas of players and the community as a whole. So if you love space, ships, fighting, customization, looting, selling and RPG elements then this is the game for you, trust me when I say you wont regret it.			"

												Da. Best. And that is an exact measurement.  Starpoint Gemini 2 successfully brings the open world 3D single player RPG to space.  Some may say that sprpg is past its prime but SG2 didn't get that memo because this game doesn't feel dated at all and includes all the modern accessories like side quests, an engaging story, lots of skills and ranks and points to customize your character, hireable mercenaries, customizable ships (oh yea), and some awesome new stuff to make you feel like you are not only piloting, but commanding a fleet.  I played this game a lot during early access and I said then that this game had the potential to be awesome if executed correctly and man was it ever!  On top of all that your ship is a whole character of its own with everything from frail gunships to massive carriers that can cloak themselves and launch entire fighter wings from their carrier bays! I would recommend this game to anyone who has suffering in the drought of good space games and anyone who enjoys rpgs.  Oh and [name redacted] this isn't Eve, you get to shoot the guns and do stuff.			"

								It's a good space RPG, that has a few bugs, still but only minor ones. the ship customizing is, good idea,  and the ships are a fair size, with combat skills, the turning rate, still needs some work.  combat pretty basic, missle weapons and beam, weapons, just need to upgrade, them.  For the overall of the game, u get more, from hunting down emenies, but still can make  some pretty good, coin, in the trading system, just have to find a trade. route, that will pay more, for ur buying items. at the stations.  Missions are good, since u need them to build ur rep, with the sector's  and regions of the game.  But don't do any missions that take u into a hostile, Base. really bad idea.  As for Rateing this game, would be 8/10.  Not a bad game to have.			"

												Well for $35 I have enjoyed this game. There are aspects of this game that are in need of improvements. Specifically: the point of view difficulties with turret mode, fixing balancing issues with mission level and mission difficulty, sudden explosion of ship which occurs randomly for no apparent reason either in combat or not, and a revamping of the money making process as capturing ships is the only effective way to progress due to missions and mining not being profitable enough to support ship progression. I have only played the freeroam with a starting zero reputation mod. I have played Rebel Galaxy before purchasing this game and found this game to be different and not necessarily better than Rebel Galaxy. There is more that is different than the same between the two games.			"

												Alreet peeps, so this is my experience shot and review. So first things first id like to recommend this title and hope you enjoy it as much as i did.  This however will just be a general impression not a rating or in depth review.Reasons : I'm coming from the original Starpoint Gemini and really enjoyed it for its single player freelancer style of gameplay. I picked it up in early access which i dont usualy go for but due to my experience with the original i toke a chance, this was not a mistake though as the title has come along way since i originaly purchased this.Graphical: not cutting edge but still a really good looking game. fx to physics all of which are well made and are still being refined even after full release.Sound assets : I have no ear for sound effects but they where up to standard, no odd sounds that ruined the experience.Performance : Runs great. I dont have a uber rig, i run a very avarge system and this game runs great even in larger battles.Content: A good solid campaign backed up with a freeroam mode that allows you to strip away the main story and play the universe in the way you want to. So many ships that you wont get to fly them all in one play through i reckon even with a few play throughs you will find some new ship to fly, some new mission and or enemy to beat up on. Also the ability to play as a peace keeper or as a bandit.faults : no borderless window mode and lack of a multiplayer.Overhall: Solid singleplayer title that if you like freelancer / startrek online / x3 then your gonna be at home with this title. Defo pick this up and i pretty sure you will enjoy whats here and whats coming in the future as the team behind this is great and im sure this game can only get better.Update- the original games campaign reto fitted into this game for free!, why cant all develpers do this. Perfect actualy prefect.Stay Frosty			"

												I haven't played this game for too long but it has proven to be very fun and challenging.  I am currently playing through the campaign but I am also conducting side missions.  The side missions include (from what I have seen so far): assassination of trouble makers, repairing installations, bounty hunting, and transporting VIPs. I mine asteriods and trade at stations frequently to balance my finances.  Capturing and selling enemy starships have proven to be the most lucrative transaction.  Combat is somewhat confusing at first but the games excellent tutorial guide and fully customizable control menu is very helpful.  Pros:-Good graphics.-Intense space combat.-Can easily change viewing settings - Rudder control""bridge"" view, Rudder control third person view, and turret third person view.-Ability to purchase and upgrade several starships.-Can hire mercs and form a fleet. -Large open world to explore.-Many unique ways to ""jump""around the map e.g. rifts and wormholes.-Story is ok.-Background music is pretty good and varied.Cons:-No NPCs to interact with at space stations.-No first person perspective.-No ship interior perspective. Mixed:-Fairly steep learning curve to become proficient with all of the games functions.Overall a great indie title!

												Basically Freelancer.Similar to Sid Meier's Pirates but in space. Huge space.Ship customization similar to Mechwarrior's mech customization.Mine asteroids, hunt bounties, play with the market, buy better ships, better equipment, etc.Streamlined user interface.Combat is good. There's several weapon types for you to try out. Rockets, laser beams and plasma cannons to name a few, each with their own properties and upgrades. Get on your gunship and chase enemies by their tail or line up your battleship and bombard them mercilessly. Your choice.Exploration is good. The game gives the player a huge world to explore. Planets, space stations and shipyards that offer different products depending on their region. Planets and space stations act as hubs, you can't set foot on them and explore. Not as huge as Elite Dangerous but huge nonetheless. Music is good. Too bad there's not much to go around. If you have a space exploration playlist then add this game's music to that playlist and play that instead.Economy is there. Trade clean goods or contraband. You can take advantage of rising and falling prices of materials but the economy isn't deep enough to make it an engaging enterprise. You can mine asteroids or scavenge space junk while going about your trade route, I guess.CAN'T FORM A FLEET. You can capture enemy ships. You either sell them, keep them or scrap them. Keeping them puts them in your garage. You can switch between ships YOU CAN ONLY USE ONE SHIP AT ANY TIME. The closest to a fleet you'll get is by hiring mercenaries to fly with you for a price. Even then you can't command them. This is probably the worst negative point of the game in my opinion.Light RPG elements.A good space game overall but if you're into trading, playing with the economy or empire building then this game won't satisfy you. I bought this on sale at 80% off so it's more than worth the money.			"

												As many reviews state, this game starts out amazingly. Once you figure out the 3 things to do though, you are done. There is no taking over rival factions or expanding faction space. In fact, the factions may as well not exist other than to proivde you with dynamic enemies.The appearance and interface in this game is great. I just want more guts. The core is so flacid I simply stopped playing due to boredom. Stories and missions are mostly a joke. Go assassinate this guy. Go do this. Go do that. Fly for hours between. It just ends up being grind for the sake of grind.Get it on sale. Play for a bit. I got 8 hours out of it and will probably spin it up again in the future for another hour or two. "

												havinghad this game from the alhpa release it has been constantly improved with each patch that has been applied and if there are any problems then you can alqays email andlet them know, oneof the thing i love about this game.  having palyed other games like the x series this one doesnt seem to have as steep lerning curves as the x series does for example, only thing is i wish you culd explore planets and stations when landing, but maybe that will comeout in one of the future pathches, asl well as the key to cut the talk between characters doesnt seem to quiet workm but again will probably be addressed in a future patch. i love this game for me it has a trek feel to it, and i have spent many hoiurs happily wasting my life on it, and will continue to do so			"

												I gave this 15 hours as at first it seems like lots of upgrades and stuff that make it seem technical which I like.But this game has no substance and no depth.I'm so bored I am watching a movie at the same time and still bored with it.I could go into detail but whats the point when no one will ever read this.Think of this as a boring point and click mobile phone game that requires grinding the same hand full of missions over and over to level up and get new ships.  But then you realise its all the same.And you will come to a point where you need to fly to a space station to save every single time you pass anyting as instant death is just around the corner.  Do this boring save crap or replay the last 30min before you died.Yawn.....			"

												I remember getting this game when it was still in its alpha/beta form with only a few things to do besides blowing up ships, blowing up asteroids, taking their goods, and then selling them at a market for a few dollars (which seemed weird back then because ships cost a ♥♥♥♥ TON and still do, but there are ways to get more money now.) So playing now, seeing that it is full release form, welllllll....it's still empty. I mean, there is absolutely almost nothing going on except for an occasional enemy ship flying in to a friendly territory that gets obliterated in a second. Other than that, nope, nothing. People that hate you, hate you and people that like you, like you, not much else. I thought it'd be awesome to be the revered space pirate captain who steals from all and gets in the way of people to scavenge as much money as possible, even between factions. Which is another huge problem, factions do not feel like they have bad ties between each other, it's as if they are both completely isolated with their borders set in place without anything in between. And there aren't even any huge battles as well, the closest one I got was between myself and 30 other enemy ships. So you might ask, ""What is there to do?"" Well, exactly what I explained at the beginning, you do missions, kill enemies, blow up debris and turn it into a station for some money, like, a little amount of money. And the most money you get is from ship debris -floating ship debris and destroyed ships- which on maximum with the stock ship which can only hold 45 units is about $30,000 maximum give or take. So how much does an upgraded ship minus weapons cost? Depending on your preference from the different types, a direct upgrade would be from 2-5 mil even though it can go higher to prices of 30 million. So with mining and missions ranging in price from 10-20 thousand, you're looking at doing this 66 times to afford a new ship and that's at the maximum you'll get from mining and missions just for a 2 mil ship. Yes, there are hero ships that give you about 5 mil if you destroy them, but so far I've found no real way to track them other than hearing the news saying they are in so-and-so region, and even if you do find them, they are at impossible difficulty and usually have other ships around them so good luck. Did I have fun though? Yes, I had fun in some parts when I tried to dodge enemy ships while firing, but after your first few things to do it gets incredibly boring.			"

												This game is awesome. If you ever played the amaizing FTP Mobil game ""Galaxy on Fire 2"" and wanted more, this game delivers on all fronts.  It is almost a disservice to compare this game to it but it has everything that I love and more. Tons of ships to buy, loads of equipment to compare and upgrade, factions to ally or make enemies with, complex trading system, large variety of side missions, and an engaging story. The combat is engaging, I love capturing ships and selling them, the mining the dozens of different types of asteroids is eye candy, and there are tons of secerets to find and explore. I love this game and would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open world space games.  "

One last thing is it does get annoying travelling from point a to b but then again it's space, space is huge !That aside, I do enjoy the game, plus they're always updating.( I take the dialogue thing back, the game is easy to hack, remove dialogue timer and add a continue button, done =) )			"

												There are ultra realistic space sims,  there are slow paced datasheet space sims,  and on and on and on you can go down the laundry list of space games.   What Starpoint Gemini 2 seeks to accomplish is finding a healthy balance of it's predecessors without leaning too far in any particular direction.   Make no mistake,  SG2 will take you hours to accomplish anything substantial,  but it won't take you hours to start doing something fun.  Want to be a trader?  You can do that.   Want to mine for rare materials?  You can do that.  Want to be a pirate?  You'll eventually be able to do that.  Want to be the force of good bringing bad guys to justice while getting paid for your bounty kills?  You can do that to.    My 7 hours have been mostly spent divided between the three classes that you can choose from in the freeform game.  There is the Leader,  Gunner and Engineer.   Each class provides a fairly substantial difference on terms of feel however the common objective between most of these skills is all the same...   kill your enemy.   I was a bit disappointed to see that many of these skills are not overly helpful for more mundane tasks like mining,  trading,  or exploration.  Seeing as how the game puts heavy emphasis on providing you options - this particular part said to me ""We're only truly designing this game with combat in mind"".   While the other things to do are definitely not afterthoughts,  they're not quite as fleshed out and as robust as I would have liked.There is a story mode but unfortunately the voice acting is horrible.  Normally I can manage some bad voice acting but found this to be a bit too much.  This turned out to be alright in the end as the sandbox aspects of this game are fun and easy to get into.  The tutorial or lack there of was at least filled with a pop-up tips menu which got me rolling quickly enough.  I had to spend some time rummaging through the keybind menu but after that I was off and racing.  This game still feels very young with a lot of possiblities.  My 7 hours is definitely not enough time to even have a completely firm grasp of what the late game or even middle game will be like but I have a hunch it's going to just be more of the same but with higher stakes involved.  Instead of combat with 3-6 ships,  it'll be more along the lines of 10-20 ships if the trailers and other various videos are telling a truthful tale.   Scaling of this nature is not altogether a bad thing if you're having fun with everything you're doing at the start of the game.  Essentially,  it's not going to mix up the formula a whole lot as you get deeper into the game.  Sure you'll be able to use more skills due to having higher energy and more points to place down extra turrets and systems...  but most of those tools could be used at the start of the game as well,  just within limitations.   If I could pick one thing I wish this game had, it would be co-op support.  Sharing a universe with 2-16 friends could serve for some amazing lan or house hold family fun.  Luckily the mod community seems to be getting behind this game so at the very least the variety of things to do will be getting mixed up a lot.  If you're still on the fence of this game I'd say just keep checking back.  Look at what the devs and the mod community are up to.  There is already a decent amount to do here and it's just done well.   If I had to give it a 1-10 rating I'd say we have ourselves an 8.2 with the clear opportunity to become a 9-9.5 if they continue to add features.   If you're someone who enjoys smelling the flowers and doing assorted tasks with some grinding mechancis involved due to large credit costs to purchase anything substantial,  then this game is the game for you!Give me a thumbs up if you found this review useful.

												One of the first Space-sim type of games I have found fun in quite a while. The controls/UI wont scare you away and are very functional, and the game feels pretty polished for a new release. While combat only missions are getting slightly repetitive I find the combat itself is very fun if you use manual aim and avoid just getting into a rythym of auto-fire on locked targets. It adds more challenge to the combat and keeps it fresh every encounter trying to dodge incoming fire while positioning yourself correctly to fire your batteries and having to stay on your toes while aiming. I have been seeing a lot of threads calling combat ""lackluster"" or boring, but every one of them have been people using auto-aim and most likely just flying circles around the enemy ships haha. Of course that would become boring quickly, and the manual aiming is what makes me like this game more than a lot of other space sims that do not even have that option.On top of the combat there is trading(though not really worth it right now, but patches will surely improve it), mining, and boarding enemy ships to capture and haul back for good cash or to use it yourself. Mercenaries have been fixed in the latest patch as well which I have yet to try so cannot comment on that(allies that fly with you and help in combat which you can control to an extent). The campaign is pretty basic, but it has a decent story going on and gives you something else to do on the side when you get bored of freelance missions, mining, or trading to get into better ships and better upgrades for each ship. All in all I am enjoying the game and can't wait to see what else is added down the line(devs have already confirmed they want to add more endgame with station ownership and faction warfare). And to top it all off you can already mod the game and there a few complete revamps already even though the game has just released. Highly recommended if you liked any older space-sims like Freelancer or the like.			"

												Very similar to Freelancer but with focus on capital ships instead of fighters. Graphics, audio and atmosphere excellent. The UI has a great ""future-tech"" feel especially when Tactical Overlay is used. Levelling speed, money-making, difficulty and weapon balancing is still a work in progress afaik but it's still a great game as it is now. Ship designs are hit-and-miss, some ships look incredible while others look kinda horrid, but that's a subjective thing.Highly recommended if you like Freelancer.			"

												A  Very solid buyI would recommend old school fans of Escape Velocity, Freespace and the X series.In its current state the game currently falls well short of being a master works, it lacks a level of immersion, complexity and feels like needs fair bit more spit and polish to be called finished. That being said it’s the best addition the genre in years. i may be speaking too soon as the developers seem to have fair bit of steam left for adding and fixing things up too.The game plays like a more arcade version of the X series it reminds me a lot of X rebirth without all the complete fail. It’s simple and fast paced space action that falls between somewhere between dog fighting and EVE online ship management and thankfully nothing like the orginal starpoint gemini.ProsBest, fight, trade and explore game in years.Solid graphicsDecent universe to exploreReasonably fast and action packedOngoing development ConsSeems 90% FinishedNo empire building Shipload equipment and loadout overly simple.Campaign worth avoiding – just don’t			"

												I can't believe how awesome this game is. I just roam around and upgrade my (Weapons, shields, etc). Doing random mission trying to save up enough money to buy a new ship. There are so many ships with different stats, so its nice to find a ship that fits to your game-play. Like one that has great guns and shield for dogfights. Or huge freighters used for trading and mining. Also as you do more missions you began to improve your rank, What that basically means is you can control bigger and badder ships. Eventually you will feel the awesome power of Dreadnoughts or Carriers. These ships have more slots for weapons and diffrent weapons, just to customize it the way you like it. Also be careful there are high level ships out there. Some with bounties of 5mill, it's a gamble but if you can defeat them, you get paid bank! I personally love seeing an amazing ship and attacking it, bring it down to it knees. Weakening their defense and killing some of their troops in the process but before I kill them I latch the tractor beam and order my troops to board. If you have more troops (stats) then them you can capture their ship and tow it to the next star base to put in your garage or to sell for good $. I been having a blast.			"

												I would definately recommend this game... but with some notes of caution.  I consider my self a supporter of 'Little Green Men', because I've always enjoyed their games ( at least the few I have).  However... I feel this one is falling a bit short, and I'm unsure if these are problems they are having issues resolving... or have just given up.  However... the problems that I've seen thus far, are more inconvenient than Game Stopping.There's a serious issue with early game over powering of the enemy.  While I've heard a claim by the developers that this was a Development decision, I personally believe this is a Bug that they haven't been able to resolve.  Basically, when taking a mission which is marked at a specific level, the mission turns out to be impossible to complete even though your level made be higher than the recommended level.  Option:  Run and find another mission and hope this doesn't happen too often... but it will.Another issue deals with Enhancements which can be added to ship's equipment and weapons, but the Enhancements do not actually enhance the item.  Note:  some... not all.Licenses, also, which should provide specific bonus do not work.  Note:  some... not all.Other than the above I have no other negative issues with this game.  It has all of the elements of a Good Space Sim, with many choices on how one wishes to play... Fighter... Merchant... Miner... Salvager... or even pirate.  I usually don't play pirate until I get bored with a game, but don't want to stop and need a new challenge.  however, the problem with being a pirate in many space sims is the limited choices you get; often being more of a headache than anything else.  But with this game I've seen the pirates (or more correctly, the Hostile Factions) have as much territory to operate in as the 'So-Called' Good Guys.  I'm actually looking forward to trying my hand as a pirate.The merchant side of the game is IMHO as well done as it seems to be possible based on the many games I've played, and wanted to be a Merchant.  In short... I don't feel like it's Great... but it does seem Very Good; just haven't got a decent size Cargo Ship for really trying it out.  However... for the little trading I've seen and done... it looks like it has ""Very Good"" Potential.  Mining for both Ores and Gases was done in a very fun and unique way... which I've been enjoying for the most part.  It doesn't really seem to make as much money as Combat... but then again, this is a Combat Game; I just like mining; with a touch of combat to give me a reason to wake up in the morning.  But you'll still need to focus on combat fairly early just to get a decent ship for mining.Combat was a bit disappointing at first because of the mechanics used to control the ship.  I found it was best to turn on Auto-Fire on all turrets... which seemed a bit Impersonal to me.  However... as I got better with all that you can do to Protect and Enhance you ship in battle...

I'm current level 43, and still find myself occasionally trying to scrap together a few Bit Coins to buy that Blaster with the Extra Kick.  I find that once a game's currency loses any real value (or more directly; Need) the game heads down hill from there.  At the time of this writing I have roughly $17mil, and trying to get to $29mil for the next for the next ship I want; but not the last ship I'll fly.All in all; while I got this game on sale, I would not have been disappointed if I had paid full price (assuming full price was under $40).  I definately would recommend this game; with hopes of certain issues being resolved.. but with confidence it's still a Fun and Addictive Game.Enjoy!!!			"

												This game is fun, but to be honest I have run bored of it.I capped and pulled the best ship and went berserk on enemy factions.I love how you can grapple into an enemy craft, send your troops and if good enough you can pull the empty craft to a hanger, either to store it and use it, sell it or scrap it! Cons:- too much farmingBuy it and try it, its one of the good space games out there. "

												I would definately recommend this game... but with some notes of caution.  I consider my self a supporter of 'Little Green Men', because I've always enjoyed their games ( at least the few I have).  However... I feel this one is falling a bit short, and I'm unsure if these are problems they are having issues resolving... or have just given up.  However... the problems that I've seen thus far, are more inconvenient than Game Stopping.There's a serious issue with early game over powering of the enemy.  While I've heard a claim by the developers that this was a Development decision, I personally believe this is a Bug that they haven't been able to resolve.  Basically, when taking a mission which is marked at a specific level, the mission turns out to be impossible to complete even though your level made be higher than the recommended level.  Option:  Run and find another mission and hope this doesn't happen too often... but it will.Another issue deals with Enhancements which can be added to ship's equipment and weapons, but the Enhancements do not actually enhance the item.  Note:  some... not all.Licenses, also, which should provide specific bonus do not work.  Note:  some... not all.Other than the above I have no other negative issues with this game.  It has all of the elements of a Good Space Sim, with many choices on how one wishes to play... Fighter... Merchant... Miner... Salvager... or even pirate.  I usually don't play pirate until I get bored with a game, but don't want to stop and need a new challenge.  however, the problem with being a pirate in many space sims is the limited choices you get; often being more of a headache than anything else.  But with this game I've seen the pirates (or more correctly, the Hostile Factions) have as much territory to operate in as the 'So-Called' Good Guys.  I'm actually looking forward to trying my hand as a pirate.The merchant side of the game is IMHO as well done as it seems to be possible based on the many games I've played, and wanted to be a Merchant.  In short... I don't feel like it's Great... but it does seem Very Good; just haven't got a decent size Cargo Ship for really trying it out.  However... for the little trading I've seen and done... it looks like it has ""Very Good"" Potential.  Mining for both Ores and Gases was done in a very fun and unique way... which I've been enjoying for the most part.  It doesn't really seem to make as much money as Combat... but then again, this is a Combat Game; I just like mining; with a touch of combat to give me a reason to wake up in the morning.  But you'll still need to focus on combat fairly early just to get a decent ship for mining.Combat was a bit disappointing at first because of the mechanics used to control the ship.  I found it was best to turn on Auto-Fire on all turrets... which seemed a bit Impersonal to me.  However... as I got better with all that you can do to Protect and Enhance you ship in battle... Aiming my Laser became the least of my problems, and I was rather happy I didn't have to worry about that anymore.  But that is a matter of Personal Preference.Also... the Skill and Perk system is fun; I like the fact that you can ""Sort Of"" custom build yourself for the type of Player and Character you choose.

												The latest update has elevated this to the most satisfying trading simulation I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Not only can you see what various commodities are trading for at the stations you have visited, you also see the distance you currently are from each of those stations. This adds another level of decision making – is the extra distance you might have to travel for a ‘best’ price worth the time it will take to get there, or is a slightly lower price actually the better deal? A small thing, perhaps, but it does make you approach your cargo manifest a bit more critically when deciding on what and when to trade.The second thing this encourages is exploration. You only see the prices for the stations and planets you have discovered. I find myself compelled to push into unknown territory on that never ending quest for the ultimate trade route. And the commodity information screen itself is wonderfully easy to use. The filters are a tremendous help, eliminating the need to scroll through every item available. Are you a miner? Click on ores. Love to hunt down pirates? Quickly discover who is offering the best price for those contraband items.As you may have guessed, I’m a merchant at heart, not a fighter. But I’ve found the battles to be well-balanced and a simple click will tell you if that tantalizing enemy ship you have your eye on has the capability to turn you into so much space dust. Not that the knowledge will necessarily stop you, but at least you’ll know what you’re up against. And for those times when you do take on just a bit more than you can chew and yet somehow manage to pull it off by the skin of your shields, well – you know the feeling.The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay is addicting, and personalizing your ship is as much fun as creating a new character in most RPGs. At this point the only thing I’m hoping for is that we may eventually see a larger collection of avatar portraits. The new group was a nice addition, but as a female gamer I find the two current offerings lack some of the personality that the male portraits possess. And that something so minor is the only flaw I can find says a lot about how truly innovative and honestly fun this game is. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a trade empire to build. "

												One of the best Space games I have played. The Developer made the game with only 10 people but It feels like a Triple A title, not an Indie game.

												It brings back that good feeling of having the galaxy at your fingertips, like in Freelancer and Elite, without the insane complexity of X3 etc. I still feel like I'm just starting out and I've put in some hours allready. It is not the new & perfect game. Some mechanics need some tweaking or better explanation (Turrets, all power to engines, etc.) but you can generally customize your ship to do exactly what you want it to. In particular the open world / sandbox play works nicely.In general I'd recommend the game, but be mindful of what the game is and isn't. It is not the hugely ambitious world of X, but then again, it is much easier to pick up and play; it is relatively approachable, but complex enough that you'll spend the first half hour at least going 'Now what? How do I do this?'. It is worth muddling through, though, if you're interested in this type of game.			"

												Didnt think too much of this when it was mentioned to me.  I was burned on X-Rebirth, played eve online, and mostly disappointed by anything space-wise that has not been eve.  X:3 was a decent game as well.  I picked this up for ~$20 and was instantly impressed with the game.  It has a huge map, really great fights, and things arent handed to you.  It does feel like it needs some touchup with certain aspects, but they are VERY minor and the devs are constantly looking for opinions on how to improve it.  Its an excellent game in its current form and with the addition of Workshop, its going to be huge when the mods start rolling out.  I highly recommend this game.			"

								Tracked one of the most notorious pirates through out several star systems. Cloaked my ship, and carefully positioned myself right behind his engines. Then all at once I unleashed a volley of plasma, beams, and fusion torpedos. After crippling his ship, and his crew members, I launched a viral torpedo to further reduce his fighting force. I next beamed over my superior marine forces and collected the bounty on his head. With his ship a drift, I tractored it to the closest friendly base where I added his battleship to my garage. Now I fly around fighting these pirates in his old ship. Big thumps up for this beta game.			"

								Starpoint Gemini 2 maybe an early access game right now but the game feels a lot more complete than a number of new releases. The game is best described as a tactical space simulator in an open universe. The game in early access has no story mission i have found yet but a lot of small missions, exploration,mining and combat. The combat is a joy once you get used to the tactical use of gun turrets and weapon usage. The game has some really interesting ship to ship combat that is easy to get the hang of. Graphics at this stage are  excellant. Ship models are good and the effects are nice and are a lot more polished than what you would think for a game not completed yet. Sound and music are good with a nice musical track (although limited just now but will be increased when ame is finished)Would i recommend this game. Hell yes even at this stage and i look forward to seeing the end product.One other interesting note is the developers are always on the forums answering our questions and listining to our input and shows how dedicated they are to both the project and to their customers.

								Amazing game. As close to Freelancer 2 as I think we've gotten or will get with next gen sims like Elite and Star Citizen coming out. There's a huge amount of depth here and free play mode is seriously awesome. So far I have...Missions / Trade / Exploration ( the universe is pretty huge and there are no jumpgates, you want to go somewhere be prepared to have a tea and fly it )Boarded and pirate who attacked me while mining. Stole their ship, towed it back to station, 60k profit w/ a hold full of ore as well. Enough to purchase some weapon and power grid upgrades & repair my own hull.Still mining, happily shooting rocks in a deep and immersive asteroid belt miles from any station ( the graphics are fantastic ) again unaffiliated scumbag smuggler drops my shield and attempts to hack my power grid. Fire a grappler, boost shields, send feedback up his signal to shut down his shields instead, steal everything on board, destroy his engines and leave him to die in the darkness.Ships are hugely expensive. Hatched a plan... equip a gunship w/ a cloak and heavy shielding. Observe trade routes and traffic to a wormhole. Wait for lost lamb transport indy with no escorts ( they are tough as nails and heavily armored ) ... decloak, target, fire a grappler, boost shields and tear their ship apart until they surrender, kill everyone on board, towed it to station under a salvage license since it was an independent, now it's mine. All repaired and with a new coat of paint & trade license ( my main job, trading is awesome and dynamic, you need smarts and a good memory of hundreds of stations / planets )Right now I'm flying across the universe in a heavily armored trade / transport ship carrying passengers, 2 vips and sipping a tea on autopilot. 100 thousand K to go, it's going to be a long flight. If anyone needs me I'll be in my cabin.All is quiet... for now.And this is alpha. Srsly.			"

								Starpoint Gemini 2 a sequel with lots of improvements, while keeping to the free form of the predecessor.This game feels as motivating as Freelancer with its extensive Universe to explore, dozens of ships, different ship classes and moddable loadouts.I did enjoy this game very much, it plays like a cross-over between freelancer (free to explore universe, dozens o ships) and the Star Trek Fleet Command titles (tactical fights, commanding capships).Whether you want to relax mining and trading, or engage in combat missions and piracy, this game will be worth its money.Did i mention you can capture enemy ships by boarding combat? You can!If it flies, it is there for the taking!As a captain your first and foremost crucial choice will be your class.You can either be a Commander, featuring buffs for your fleet, empowered strike craft, retaliatory attacks and defensive boosts.Or you can try to outgun the enemy by becoming a Gunner, who can specialize his offensive power by adding effects like disabling hits to his beam weapons, firing more shells with railguns, adding a higher refire rate to his high damaging plasma canons or boosting his heavy weaponry (schockwave cannons, missiles and torpedos).Last but not least the Engineer, a very versatile class with a lot of debuffs.Ever got tired of fast moving corvettes and gunboats dodging your railgun shots?Just place a Rift-Anomaly and slow them down, then hit 'em hard!Your second decision might be to specialize in a ship-category, as you can boost the efficiency of your ship by spending perk-points granted every 5 levels.What will be your choice? A fast and mobile light ship(gunboat/corvette)A merchantship, to rule the market with your cunning? (transport/freighter/freight-liner)A medium class mobile Warship? (Frigate/Destroyer/Cruiser)A vessel of personified dread? (Battleship/Dreadnought/Carrier)The Choice is yours to make, though it is not final,for you can reset your spent skill- and perk-points while being docked to a station or planet and try anew.Currently this game is in Beta Version 0.7, so there are still some issues and lacks:- ingame descriptions of skills and mechanics lack some love and proper english translation - the weapons need some diversity, e.g. faster firing weapons need a higher projectile speed to use them against fast moving targets (railguns and plasma weapons)- boarding combat is currently a numbers game, lacking the predecessors ingame videos and feedback- the missions currently are restricted to Assassination (search and destroy), delivery, repair of beacons and rescue missions- they need to put in some ships from the predecessors (prokhorov for example) to add even more diversity to the allready well modeled and animated ships- ship special abilities are not included yet (like a full frontal arc auto-canon for baeldor frigates or high-energy blasts for dreadnoughts)			"

								UPDATE: After lots and lots of play time, I've lost very little enthusiam and this has become my favorite game.If you find yourself missing Freelancer but wishing it was more robust in just about every measure (barring an in-cockpit view), this game is for you. There is a vast universe, seamlessy connected* so that you can fly between them without having to load at a ""waygate"" like almost every other space game out there. Sure there are gates and wormholes and all the other staples, but they're not necessary. The starter ship is gorgeous, and you can customize the look of your ship in small ways. Combat uses a lot of showy glowy beams that seem to trade off well against each other balance wise, short-ranged instabeams, blaster/plasma-beam-ish projectiles, glowy-trails-having missiles and so on. Your turrets don't just magically fire through your ships, so firing arcs are a concern, and multiple turrets with mismatched areas of defense are possible. You can enlist specialists in your crew who cost you extra expense but provide bonuses, in addition to an amazing range of customizations. You can reassign power between guns-engines-shields on the fly.It's currently an open-world, with promises of guided story plots to come. At the moment you can mine and take run-of-the-mill and short missions, kill this scan that ferry those. You can buy hunting licenses for different groups froim their enemies. The game needs longer more immersive plots, but the dev has already stated there's more to come int hat regard.There's the controls. There is a wide range of things you can do in this game, giving somewhat detailed commands to your fleet and crew, cloaking, grappling (best to shoot the enemies' guns off first), instructing your crew which guns to shoot off first. It is... daunting... looking at your control customization options. I recommend playthrough with the control defaults at first until you find which controls you will actually use best in your personal play style. You will be using just about every key on your keyboard make no mistake.That takes me to the tutorials. Just suffer through them they are awful annoying popups but informative. *this is beta and there's a slight hiccup when moving from grid to grid			"

												This is a fun, engaging ""light"" strategy / action game. It draws inspiration from both Starfleet Command and EVE online without being nearly as complex as either one. Think of it as StarEVE Offline Command - the Animated Series - and you will get the idea.If you are an experienced gamer in this particular genre you will probably pick up the basics in an hour or so, get a feel for the extent of the content in about 4 to 6 hours playtime - and feel sufficiently masterful after about 10-12 hours.To enjoy this game you have to patient, enjoy slower paced exploration coupled with quick bursts of fairly asymetrical combat (both in your favor and otherwise) - and be ready to allow for a certain quirkiness that comes from game devs whose native language is not English. On that point the devs are super nice peeps who love to get feedback and talk about how to improve the game on their forums.Like most games these days, SG2 is evolving. I think what we have now is a solid foundation for many expansions yet to come and I, for one, am looking forward to seeing where it goes from here.This is definitely a great game for people who, like me, enjoy playing for long stretches at night with groovy techno / trance music in the headphones while watching the beautiful space scenery slip by... without the constant combat of SFC or the massive timesink (and perpetual 2nd class citizen status) of EVE.

								So far so good, I was really looking forward to getting X Rebirth but having read the reviews about how bad that game was I decided to give this one a go. So glad that I did!!Not only are the graphics for space very beautiful (due the the expense of fast travel I spend a lot of time with all power to engines on just watching space), the one main problem I have with any RPG games is grind, but this feels hardly like a grind to play.Early access things surely can only get better. I can't wait to see what happens. Smoke me a kipper I'll be back for breakfast!			"

								As a long-standing fan of the sci-fi genre, I can say that this is the kind of game I've been looking for. It has everything that any space-fan would enjoy! Anomalies, planets, asteroids, nebulas, and tons more! You can trade, customize your starship, upgrade, and fight against pirates as well as enemy factions. The gameplay is unlike anything I've played before, in a good way, and makes it feel like it's ship-on-ship combat. Fighting in space is dynamic, involved, and intricate so it can be challenging at times but never too difficult. The variety of weapons you can add to your starship also helps to give the game a unique feel in combat. The game has the look and expanse of Eve while remaining a single-player only game. Finally, it is workshop/mod friendly! Personally, I like to cross-over different franchises into my games so it's really cool to see a Federation Starship flying around space and using weapons from Star Trek as a way to create a personalized and awesome experience. Definitely would recommend to any sci-fi fan. Better than a lot of AAA titles I've bought. Keep up the good work!			"

								This is a ""first (actually second) impression""It's shaping up.I bought this game a while back, in my seemingly neverending search for a satisfactory Space game.There is a text-only tutorial that I never bothered with, so I can't comment on that. You can skip ahead without worries since you can reread it later on if you need to. Graphics are pretty decent, the ship designs I've seen so far are varied and cool for the most part.The biggest plus part so far, is that this game seems to focus more on capital ship warfare, rather than on fighters and small corvettes like many of its rivals.The interface is also good, albeit a bit unintuitive and at some times utterly unresponsive. Some keybinds don't seem to work and it still needs some visual or audio queues as to what you just did, there is no indication anywhere on your screen whether your weapons are set to free fire or not (at least none I can spot). It seems sandboxy enough so far, with content appearantly procedurally generated and catered to your ship and level.It's a diamond in the rough and clearly unfinished, but already playable enough for me, I will surely be spending some more time in this game than before.So if you have the money and can live with the flaws listed above, give this game a try.

								I love it I love it I love it.I've been playing this for some good hours straight. I have encoutered minimal bugs like when I'm on the starmap, my cursor has to be a little bit off of what I'm actually trying to click on... sure it's annoying but this is only in alpha, and that is my main concern?? Very well done game I'm extremely excited to see this game evolve! Although I am glad I got it on sale, 15$ maybe 20$ would be a better price than what it is. I'm getting tired of seeing alphas and early access games near full price. It's an alpha for a reason. Aside from the high price this game is definitely on my recommendations list.Cheers!			"

Early Access Review
								Think StarTrek meets Cowboy Bebop. Yes, that good. At this stage in development only two things can be suitably inferred from this game. Its tone and core mechanics. And I am exceptionally pleased with both. Even as an early alpha it is successfully scratching a difficuly itch to reach.I wanted a game where I could zoom around the solar system getting into fights with phasers and torpedos, having to jockey for position all the while balancing my shields, engines, and weapons. SG2 gave me exactly that. The combat is very nice. In its current state the missions are randomly generated, MMO style, filler quests, but this does not prevent the encounters from being very fulfilling, if for no other reason then the solid underlying mechanics. This game will really cause you to think strategically. Will you perform the risky gambit of dumping all power to the shields and weapons to try and pick off a weakened enemy in one pass or will I shift that power into the engines and hope for a second chance to strike at that exposed hole in their shields. As the game progresses you will be making that decision and others as you have to contend with swarms of fighters and imposing warships. It requires just enough of the player to be extremely fulfilling when a risky maneuver works without being unduely frustrating when it fails. And you will fail alot. But the game is at its best when it is challenging. That is when the flexibile thinking and fast micromanagment that characterizes its combat will bring out your inner Jean-Luc Picard. And when it does you will feel great. The tone is harder to express then the mechanics, but is a perfect compliment to them. If you have ever watched Cowboy Bebop then this game will be like putting on a pair of comfortable shoes. Two things drive this feeling. First, the music distinctly reminds me of some of the tracks from the show. There are no jazzy interludes, but the background music reminds me of some prog songs accompanying the space scenes. The music is seamlessly woven into the background noise of your lasers, phasers, engines, and missles. Most of the time it is barely noticeable above the ruckus but it is a soothing distraction during a long sprint across the map. It simply suits the game, perfectly conveying the mystery and the solitude of space. The more obvious callout to the tone of Bebop is the types of missions available so far. Most are bounty type missions and trading runs. All taking place in fantasitic locals with cool space stations. The game has a very awesome setting. And the scale of which really makes you feel like a plucky captain trying to scrape by in a much larger universe. All in all I was looking for a game that would let me feel like I was flying a spaces ship. This did that and more! Not only did it have the gameplay I desired but it did so in a very cool way. As such SG2 has exceeded my expectations. It is perfectly filling a niche in my gaming library which I have been searching to fill. I would highly recomend the game to anyone who has got the space captain itch. Star Citizen is a far way away. But even in Alpha SG2 rocks! And its future looks so promising. All things considered, 9/10. The only downside is a slightly difficult camera. You will get used to it but I feel like it doesn't need to be something that we should have to get used to. An autolock feature which would keep the camera centered on a target and  making the turret mode more responsive with less 'momentum' would be sufficient. But this is just nitpicking. SG2 looks to be a great niche game. And if you are interested it deserves your money and attention. -rm			"

												This is a fun, engaging ""light"" strategy / action game. It draws inspiration from both Starfleet Command and EVE online without being nearly as complex as either one. Think of it as StarEVE Offline Command - the Animated Series - and you will get the idea.If you are an experienced gamer in this particular genre you will probably pick up the basics in an hour or so, get a feel for the extent of the content in about 4 to 6 hours playtime - and feel sufficiently masterful after about 10-12 hours.To enjoy this game you have to patient, enjoy slower paced exploration coupled with quick bursts of fairly asymetrical combat (both in your favor and otherwise) - and be ready to allow for a certain quirkiness that comes from game devs whose native language is not English. On that point the devs are super nice peeps who love to get feedback and talk about how to improve the game on their forums.Like most games these days, SG2 is evolving. I think what we have now is a solid foundation for many expansions yet to come and I, for one, am looking forward to seeing where it goes from here.This is definitely a great game for people who, like me, enjoy playing for long stretches at night with groovy techno / trance music in the headphones while watching the beautiful space scenery slip by... without the constant combat of SFC or the massive timesink (and perpetual 2nd class citizen status) of EVE.

												The game is fun, it's sort of a mix between X3(ship control, selling items) and Darkstar One(upgrading weapons, equipment and such). This game has some potential but right now it is still a bit lacking. Fun factor: You will have fun fighting and dodging enemy fire. Having troops board enemy ships and take them over. Looting dead ships. Seeing how different ships are and act. The joy of dragging a captured ship to a dock.Unfun factor: You are very much alone, yes you can hire mercs, up to two, but the only person you can talk to is the ship computer who in fact will only say anything to you do an action (move command, fire at will) or when an enemy teleports right to you. The world is pretty empty, NPC's are just sitting there really, and they tend not to do anything else unless an enemy happens to be around.The makers have stated they plan to add expansions which will lighten things up, but those things are in the future.  They also stated they have plans to change things up, shields will matter later on for boarding and such. Time will tell.I have put in 13 hours and so far feel a little worried. I ran most of my time in a Frigate capturing ships to sell. I even in fact captured a battleship by running back and forth between two stations to fill my troops and relaunch new boarding attacks.  It took very little time to level, and as well I fear I may never enjoy all the ships this game has to offer in the long run.So is it worth it?Positives: Somewhat fun, feels semi-polished, the devs are hard at work fixing bugs very fast, what seems like a bright future for a game.Negatives: World is full of things, but they might as well be boxes floating in space. No life really. It seems like the same type of AI as Minecraft. Seems a bit short so far even with Freeroam (world is open, no story).  I feel the game's price is sort of almost right at 25 bucks.

If not, but you like traveling the universe, trading and selling (and smuggling) goods, blasting space pirates trying to steal your booty, or even mining asteroids on your downtime; then SG2 is also for you!Controls can be interesting (a bit wonky) at times, and I read there may be some joystick issues, but mouse and keyboard are my choice anyway so I've had no issues. Presentation and graphics look great, and there are some truly amazing views around the galaxy. Combat is fun and ship styles range from giant transports, to carriers with multiple fighter wings. I've got 20+ hours in at this point and while I started the campagin, I'm having more fun just roaming around, trading and upgrading my ship. If you've been looking for a game to scratch the space sim itch, this is a good game for it.			"

								While i am at the early starting stages of the game i can say that it is thoroughly addictive and easily simplistic to pick up with the added availability of many tips.   I can see a comparison with ""SPORE"" with the aim to evolve by in this case feeding on rocks,asteroids and other ships. There are various mods to download from the STEAM workshop, including many ships from the star trek catalogue .... In short, while this game may not have the more realistic depth of the X series it has a charm and addictiveness that is rarely seen in games nowadays. "

												I'm enjoying my first few sessions of Starpoint Gemini 2. Very nice atmosphere - graphics, music and sound have all had some close attention paid to them. It seems nicely polished and generates a really good backdrop and environment to play in.There are some frustrating elements for me - the battles have me circling round and round trying to get the enemy in view and I'm not sure which of my weapons are firing, there doesn't seem to be a way to select weapons. maybe they're all firing, who knows :-) to be able to interact more with the weapons would be nice, i'm looking forward to uprgading mine but i want to see the difference that makes  - I don't know if the battle system is going to show that nicely? I think these games all struggle with the combat elements - this ons is still probably better than most.  another frustrating is the ships automatic pilot to waypoints seems a bit weird, it heads in the wrong direction sometimes.  thats not a biggie really.All in all, at this early stage I would give this an 8/10 and I recommend it to anyone looking for this type of game - a mix of exploring, upgrading, with some combat thrown in - a quieter game to have a session on when needing a break from the fps shooters etc...  its good!

								This game is fantastic, especially for an Alpha release.  Several things are still in the works, but it is a fine game as is.  Right now it is essentially a space sandbox.  I tend to play the role of pirate, or privateer, rather (I only attack the bad guys, but I'm always trying to board them and steal their ships so I can tow them back to a planet or space station and sell off their guns, then the ships themselves... seems to be pretty lucrative).  You'll love it when you get a big carrier with a bunch of fighter wings or bombers... it's awesome having a swarm of firepower surrounding you.  The game is massive and consists largely of traveling between planets and space stations (press B to boost your engines to full and enjoy the ride and the amazing scenery), doing sidequests, mining asteroids, or being a merchant or pirate or whatever suits your fancy.  There is currently no storyline or any story missions (but plenty of sidequests are available and constantly appearing), and a lot of things are currently non-functional (like the useable items... thankfully they are super valuable so I just sell them for lots of money), but with that being said, this game is amazing... I'm really looking forward to years of fun with this thing.			"

								So far so good, I was really looking forward to getting X Rebirth but having read the reviews about how bad that game was I decided to give this one a go. So glad that I did!!Not only are the graphics for space very beautiful (due the the expense of fast travel I spend a lot of time with all power to engines on just watching space), the one main problem I have with any RPG games is grind, but this feels hardly like a grind to play.Early access things surely can only get better. I can't wait to see what happens. Smoke me a kipper I'll be back for breakfast!			"

								A really interesting looking game. I like the controls, highly customisable, flying star-fighter style seems equally as easy turret-based capital ship combat( depends only on the style of ship, which can be better suited to either, which is exactly what it should be). HUD and contextual control panel pack a LOT of options and info into a simple, streamlined system. Graphically it's easy on the eye, won't praise it, but there's nothing I can think of that would need pointing out.The thing that would need tweaking is a detail, but impacts the game heavily, since it does with navigation: The waypoints do not say WHAT they point to on the map. Can't tell whether it's my active mission, accepted but not active or a completely new one. To be fixed ASAP, as going from point to point IS the game.The only other minor thing doesn't impact gameplay, but would make it a bit more interesting:*Refine the weapon mounting system. Grouping them together for ship sides is a good idea, but it would be good to have access to all single individual mounts anyway, also showing where they are on the ship, Star Wolves style (since they avoid fireing THROUGH the ship, which is as unexpected as it is brilliant), for enabling a more tactical loadout.*Connecting to the former, make the whole drydock/store/exchange window bigger and clearer. As it is now is not very intuitive and requires spending at least a few minutes just studying it to finally grasp what half the options actually are, much less taking advantage of them.In general, a good game even at this stage, just needs tweak and a good plot implemented. The latter would make a good game a great game.			"

								UPDATE: After lots and lots of play time, I've lost very little enthusiam and this has become my favorite game.If you find yourself missing Freelancer but wishing it was more robust in just about every measure (barring an in-cockpit view), this game is for you. There is a vast universe, seamlessy connected* so that you can fly between them without having to load at a ""waygate"" like almost every other space game out there. Sure there are gates and wormholes and all the other staples, but they're not necessary. The starter ship is gorgeous, and you can customize the look of your ship in small ways. Combat uses a lot of showy glowy beams that seem to trade off well against each other balance wise, short-ranged instabeams, blaster/plasma-beam-ish projectiles, glowy-trails-having missiles and so on. Your turrets don't just magically fire through your ships, so firing arcs are a concern, and multiple turrets with mismatched areas of defense are possible. You can enlist specialists in your crew who cost you extra expense but provide bonuses, in addition to an amazing range of customizations. You can reassign power between guns-engines-shields on the fly.It's currently an open-world, with promises of guided story plots to come. At the moment you can mine and take run-of-the-mill and short missions, kill this scan that ferry those. You can buy hunting licenses for different groups froim their enemies. The game needs longer more immersive plots, but the dev has already stated there's more to come int hat regard.There's the controls. There is a wide range of things you can do in this game, giving somewhat detailed commands to your fleet and crew, cloaking, grappling (best to shoot the enemies' guns off first), instructing your crew which guns to shoot off first. It is... daunting... looking at your control customization options. I recommend playthrough with the control defaults at first until you find which controls you will actually use best in your personal play style. You will be using just about every key on your keyboard make no mistake.That takes me to the tutorials. Just suffer through them they are awful annoying popups but informative. *this is beta and there's a slight hiccup when moving from grid to grid			"

Early Access Review
								There are a lot of really good space sims out there, this is one of them.  But one thing that sets this game apart from those other games is this:  Noob friendliness.  This games UI and setup is so easy/simple that even someone who has never played any space sims before can get the hang of within an hour or so, and that's FAST.  The UI may be simple, but it's still got the same flexibility to let you do what you want.  Every time I start a new space sim, I always think 'oh god, i gotta relearn the whole system again.'  but not for this one.  Also, that map UI reminds me soo much of google chrome.  Currently, the gameplay is extremely fun even for not being complete.  One could hardly tell, except for the fact that skill, equipment, and fighter keybinds don't work--but that's okay, they're all just a mouseclick away via the easy to use UI.  I haven't played long enough though to figure out how deep this game is, whether or not the trading system is static or dynamic, or whether or not what you do affects prices.  I haven't played long enough to see whether or not the universe is 'alive' like in other games, but this is good enough for someone who wants to pick up their first space sim and not be overwhelmed.

								This game is fantastic, especially for an Alpha release.  Several things are still in the works, but it is a fine game as is.  Right now it is essentially a space sandbox.  I tend to play the role of pirate, or privateer, rather (I only attack the bad guys, but I'm always trying to board them and steal their ships so I can tow them back to a planet or space station and sell off their guns, then the ships themselves... seems to be pretty lucrative).  You'll love it when you get a big carrier with a bunch of fighter wings or bombers... it's awesome having a swarm of firepower surrounding you.  The game is massive and consists largely of traveling between planets and space stations (press B to boost your engines to full and enjoy the ride and the amazing scenery), doing sidequests, mining asteroids, or being a merchant or pirate or whatever suits your fancy.  There is currently no storyline or any story missions (but plenty of sidequests are available and constantly appearing), and a lot of things are currently non-functional (like the useable items... thankfully they are super valuable so I just sell them for lots of money), but with that being said, this game is amazing... I'm really looking forward to years of fun with this thing.			"

								I have been wanting a space game that feels chill, but has lots to explore. But I don't want to spend much time flying, and I don't want to spend much time looking at menus nor trading data. I wanna fly around a do ♥♥♥♥. I wouldn't say it's much of a sim, but it's enough micro management to make me feel in charge of my ship. I would call it a space adventure. I have much more to play of course, and I am excited. There's plenty to explore and learn. Also the game has a great team behind it that communicates with it's player and fans.

								About 4 hours in.  I'm liking it enough to spend 4 hours, that says something.   Still playing around, still exploring, and still enjoying.   Very reminisent of Starfleet Command.   For the price, I would say if you enjoyed any time with Starfleet, and being as fun as it is in early stage, it's well worth the $$ spent for the time I've already mined.I've not yet played the first iteration, but don't let it's low Metascore impact your opinion of the sequel.   I'm installing and trying it (prequel) now, though I've heard most of the issues were address post release, making for a very enjoyable game.			"

								Ok, first I want to say that overall, this is a fun game.  Even though it is in it's alpha phase, it still has a lot of fine points to keep me playing for the time being.  There is one point about this game that is going to kill it for me, but I'll get to that later.The graphics are well done.  I have several hours into it, and have yet to experience a graphical glitch.  The ship models are well done and the stations aren't bad to look at.The flight controls are a bit weird at first, but it really doesn't take much to get used to them.  The biggest gripe I have is that there is no first person view so you can't fly directly at something.  If you try, you actually fly over it.  Not that big of a deal and after you get used to it, it works out.  If you are flying mouse mode, there isn't enough dead space for level flight.  Your ship is always changing direction.  I ended up not utilizing the mouse mode and stuck with WASD.As it is still in Alpha phase there are only a few different types of missions to work on.  These are called Freelances.  They are usually quick and easy.  It looks like there will be several different types of missions put in later on, so this isn't a slight, just an observation.  Also, the money doesn't keep up with your pilot level.  I'm currently level 25 and still can't afford to buy another version of the same ship I'm currently in.  I should have been able to upgrade ships a while ago.  I'm sure with the advent of other missions, the money thing will probably work itself out.There needs to be more tutorials.  There needs to be something on Grappling and taking over ships.  Might be offered farther down the road.  Also on derelicts.  Try as I might, I can't figure them out.  I don't seem to get anything off of them.  I might not understand their mechanics, but since there is no tutorial on them, I don't know.Now for the part that breaks this game for me personally.  I do enjoy combat and exploration.  I've never been huge into trading or diplomacy.  However, I love games where I can create things.  Crafting is huge for me.  Starpoint Gemini 2 has these huge asteroid fields that if I spent years playing, I wouldn't be able to empty them out.  However, all you can do with them is shoot them for ore and then vendor it...for a very small price I might add.  There is nothing else to do with all of this ore.  Now, your saying...wait, it is still alpha, they might add it in later.  Well, I've read up in their forums and one of the developers has already stated that they don't plan on adding in any kind of crafting utility to the game.If I could put a station out in the fields, and have them manufacturing ship equipment, weapons & and ships themselves, this game would be one that I kept and played for years to come.  As it is, I'm going to get tired of shooting random encounters pretty quick.As a single player game, I need something that is going on in the background while I'm out exploring and building for the economy would be great.  Without this ability, the game gets stale, at least for me.For most people, this game will be great.  I know that a good majority of people don't care to craft anything.  For me, without it, it is a game breaker.			"

												One of the best space simulation games I've seen to date. EVE Online was too complicated, BS Galactica too dated, ect.., but this game struck a special chord. It's devs are very active, taking player considerations seriously. The mods are pretty dang fun, it's cheaper than most other games of its type, you can fill a variety of roles in game, ect.. The only real con I can see with the game so far is it's single player exclusive. If multiplayer's eventually implemented, I can easily see this being the next big thing for online MMORPG space simulators.			"

												This game is actually pretty damn sweet. If you enjoyed games like Freelancer or the X series, you will enjoy this without a doubt. It looks amazing, plays smoothly, has a big universe to explore and conquer, has staggering ship customization and upgrades, great trading, easy interface and decent tutorial so you feel comfortable playing it within 10 minutes. It's also surprisingly bug free, for a game that's still in beta, it doesn't crash, nothing. It misses a campaign (I think it will be added in a couple of weeks just in time for release), but even just the free roam mode is great fun. I also loved the idea of having different classes that you can choose with different abilities, some make your ship stronger while others buff your (future) fleet, along with a ton of perks that you can customize as you level up. Gives it a lot of replayability as you try different styles and approaches. Even the music's great. I honestly can't find anything to complain about, and that's pretty rare for m			"

Well, I've read up in their forums and one of the developers has already stated that they don't plan on adding in any kind of crafting utility to the game.If I could put a station out in the fields, and have them manufacturing ship equipment, weapons & and ships themselves, this game would be one that I kept and played for years to come.  As it is, I'm going to get tired of shooting random encounters pretty quick.As a single player game, I need something that is going on in the background while I'm out exploring and building for the economy would be great.  Without this ability, the game gets stale, at least for me.For most people, this game will be great.  I know that a good majority of people don't care to craft anything.  For me, without it, it is a game breaker.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 + Secrets of Aethera DLC:Excellent sandbox space game, campaign missions are quite easy at first and then they aren't, you need a bigger ship. Which means credits.  Trading, pop-up missions, side missions, capturing ships and mining are your friends now.Once you get you fingers trained on flying it's a lot more fun...fly in hard and fast and then slow down to stay on the tail pipe of your target, watch out for the explosive radius of your own missiles.Trading/Mining could use some TLC. The small cargo space and low margins on items makes for a lot of trips for those playstyles to make a lot of credits. A dedicated mining ship would be a good idea, with maybe a compressor item or mining laser enhancement or something so that you can fit more than 1 ore in 1 cargo slot.The trading screens in the map could really use a mode to show best to/from, rather than a per-item best buy/sell, also remote buy/sell ala Eve would be great.But trading and mining isn't what this game is about. The real fun comes with capturing ships and running the various types of missions. Capturing takes a while to figure out, I suggest youtube and practise.  Basically, grapple, burn the hull down 2/3rds of the way, transport your troops and keep transporting them as long as you have troops. After you get the hang of it, you take every mission around your level just to try and capture another ship.The pop-up missions are rather generic, about 10 or so different types that I've found and they differ only in the difficulty of the enemies. Some are out-right free credits and XP (science, repair).The Side Missions are quite variable from the few I've done, more credits and XP and more difficult than the pop-ups.The Campaign Missions are similar to the Side Missions in reward and difficulty but advance the story-line.Exploring the map is a lot of fun, it's huge...also more areas to find capturable ships and missions. One downside, when you play windowed, if you focus off the game, it will pause. This is non-condusive to setting a long waypoint, maxing your engine power and doing something else on the other monitor. Very fast save/loads. The fights can be quite intense, the AI seems to be aggressive, but not stupid, it'll gang-tackle you quite happily. The auto-firing works great, but I'm not a fan of the way it keeps shifting targets to closest enemy as opposed to the target you've selected. I guess I have to learn manual firing.I suggest staying with the Tauris starter boat, pick a weapon type, level that type up  and stay with it for the first 20 levels or so. The gunboat is a paper-tiger, so you learn a lot about dodging, firing, and your equipment needs. Lot's of save and reloads figuring it out. ++Shield Boosters, Repair Nanobots, Hull Plates.66hrs, 8.5/10 and am still playing. It's not solo-Eve, but darn close.			"

												I love this game, I used to play EVE Online and other space sims like the X series, Elite dangerous etc this is a real gem. I have no idea why I did not buy it sooner even though not many campaigns are out (you only have the option of free roam or campaign with out mods I assume) the game has so much to do in it. I thought EVE had a ton of factions and corps but this game I swear theres at least like 40 factions and the idea of having a small fleet is amazing. Its a must buy for eve players.			"

It may take a little while to get into but there's plenty plenty of exploring, missions, ships, weapons and upgrades and also Workshop support.I haven't looked into the campaign much since the freeroam mode interested me more, but it seems to just be freeroam with story missions.The freeroam missions are a little samey after a while but there's enough variety of mission types for you to choose to be a pacifist or a full on fighter.Would recommend this if you like open world space sims, with factions and a good variety of ship classes and ships.

								pros:great ship designs, backgrounds and tunes. no really, the work put into the lighting etc is excellent and for a graphics junkie like me its was stunning.the variation in weapons and system additions is quite impressive for an alpha game as theres plenty to try out (if you can earn the credits)....the controls were easy to get to grips with and the learning curve isnt all that steep, more like a shallow bowl then the eiffel tower.i liked the ability to select missions from the system map as it saved soooo much time with reagrds to the: fly here > dock > mission select > fly there > kill whatever > done.  a novel and great idea and adds more of a flow to the game.mining is ok if thats your thing, point shoot collect as normal, however i couldnt find any indication of whether the rocks i were shooting were full of good stuff or crap...cons:couldnt work out if the shield was full coverage or sectional as in the previous gemini game as angling different sides of the ship would stop hull depletion, well sometimes not everytime. got quite confused.some enemies get stuck in space and dont move apart from shooting back, for some reason this makes them invulnerable too, so you die.currently no save feature in the game options, limited auto save though.combat, and this is my main gripe as its a space combat sim, theres no strafe or reverse!!  if you get to close to an object you have to bounce off it to turn around. increasing distance from targets means flying away from them all the while theyre pounding your ship. avoiding enemy fire is also very hard to do, spinning in a circle helps but only at range as the AI will fire at your current location almost without fail. however up close it just becomes a brawl between either who has the most energy or shield power...the main thing lacking is the fact theres no strafe (moving on the same access from left to right, up and down) the ability to dodge fire is essential in any fight but sadly gemini 2 does not provide this ability. in essence the fighter fights become nothing more then lancing, flying at each other trying to hit the enemy until you are in close, see above as to why this is bad... i suppose constantly changing the power distribution from shields to weapons to speed could help and some peeps will like that but i prefer flying by the seat of my pants and dodging for that true dogfighter feeling.furthermore, i loved the beam weapons, very powerful with exceptional rangedownsides, very power hungry and can empty your charge in seconds plus theres no zoom feature so no way of knowing if your shots are hitting the target until the enemies hull depletes and as previously stated power to the weapons depletes fast!!the only bug ive encountered so far was when the game freezes mid flight, not annoying yet as reminisent to PS1 games and their ""loading next area"" moments.overall for an alpha its quite enjoyable, very straight forward missions and great visuals.

												Campaign done, here's *thoughts*.Good:  To start off with, the music in SG2 is pretty great.  That's the first thing that hits me, and it's always good whenever I've booted the game.  A bit more variety would be nice too, after a while of free-roaming, it might get a little stale, but that goes for most games, really.Bad:  The dialog and cutscenes are terrible.  No, really REALLY terrible.  The dialog is cliche, and *hideously* over-acted.  And those accents?  AND NO SKIP??  And the game doesn't really pause during these tedious, cliche, dragging, unskippable cutscenes.  I've seen better cutscenes in pretty much any other game.Good:  Ships.  Mostly.  They're all quite recognizable, and have a lot of variety.  Once you know the ships, you can see a silhouette of most of them from most angles, and be able to ID the specific ship, or at least class.  Nexus ships a couple others in particular are EASY to spot.  Transports less so, but their class is obvious, so no matter.Bad:  Firing arcs.  These are SPACE ships, they should have minimal blind spots.  They are not floating in an ocean, they need coverage above and below.Bad:  There is a single ""best"" weapon, DPS-wise?  The stats show that, anyway.  Beams tickle, the only NPC weapons that seem to DO anything are rails and plasma.  This balance state made it out of early access?Bad:  Map and space design.  Freelancer got this right, and they had space with ""too much"" stuff in it.  The SG2 single solar system is both incredibly too small and insanely crowded.  It would be fine for say, underwater on an ocean planet, but for ""outer space"" it's just crowded.  And the ""movement"" field for dust floating past makes it feel like a fish tank with a broken filter and a bunch of pooping fish.Space Engineers and EVE and to a lesser extent Freelancer made the game FEEL spacious.  SG2 is a lot of LARGE factions crammed into a small fish tank with a bunch of stuff floating in the water.Bad:  I finally managed to get a ST-drive, yay!  ...Only to find that it doesn't actually work?  *All* the things should be working before the EA tag comes off.  At least implemented in some state.			"

								Edit: So here we are after full release.In all honesty, the story is not presented in a manner I really find easily accessable, which is too bad but survivable. Besides that, everything I was told would be in this game is here, and all the fun I saw coming back in EA is also here. This is early access done right.In case you haven't read any other reviews, the game is very similar to EVE or X3 in sandbox mode. In story mode it feels quite a bit more linear, but as I said, this is simply because the method of presentation is just not my style, and you may find it's exactly what you like.Still, lots of fun, lots of freedom, and lots of beautiful, beautiful space in which to make your own story. Good use of your money if you like spaceship combat/trader/adventure sims.Original reviews:Even in beta, this is a good game. Not only is the game very playable, but the graphics are good and I personally find even the beta to be more stable and friendly to my recommended-spec rig than many full releases of other games I've played. Great forum community too and the devs are very open to feedback. There is not quite enough to do yet for freeroam to be worth $30,  but if you are reading this after the full release, then you should buy this!EDIT:Worth noting that the devs are so active on this that right now, only a few weeks after writing the initial review, enough stuff has been finalized or added to the current beta to probably make it worth your $30.

I guess the replayability and scope of what you could do got a tad monotonous in the end.For those who want to fly around shooting up ships, defend stations from attack, upgrade to increasingly better ships which you can customize, it's a good game to have. Graphically it was average to above average for me. At the end of the day, I think there were just many other games out there which drew my interest away from this. 5.5/10			"

								It's been ages since we've had an excellent free roam space roleplaying game.  While in the current early alpha stage gameplay focuses more on ""make stuff asplode"" rather than ""trade for all the things"", the action gameplay that's already there is right at home with such greats as Starfleet Command paired with the frenetic nature of Freelancer.  Even if you aren't a sci-fi geek (EXCELSIOR!), I'm willing to bet that once you get past the learning curve you'll absolutely love this.Where Starpoint Gemini 1 was rough around the edges and everyone talked in broken English that would make even the European Union cringe, this is a finely-polished brilliant-cut gemstone with actual English-as-a-first-language voice actors -- so if you're expecting your ears to bleed, then you're wrong.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.Also, power-to-engines.  Power-to-engines, omigod, power-to-engines.  Exclam, like, wow, hashtag awesome.  Or whatever the kids are saying these days.			"

Really, there's probably a few ways you could play this game. for me, it was joystick (logitech extreme 3d pro) and mouse (Razer Taipan, extra buttons on mouse are a nice thing to have for this game), combat is fast and fun and visually spectacular if you can get over needing a somewhat powerful gaming peripheral setup to enjoy fully, at least in my experience and opinion.

Space combat ranges from you being overwhelmingly powerful and slaughtering a weaker enemy convoy, to suddenly being completely outmatched as hordes of enemy fleets warp in. You'll go from shifting your power-flow to fully charge your weapons; unleashing torrents of weapon-fire and watching enemy ships violently explode, to frantically diverting power to your shields and engines, cutting power from your weapon-batteries to overcharge your engines and jettison yourself free from the firestorm. The space combat, environment, and ships are all wonderful and deserve high praise. The only downfall is the narrative in the story mode. My only noted negative is that the plot dialogue is very poorly written: conversations are written with very simplistic wording, adding unnecessary filler dialogue in the middle of a conversation. The characters have no expression and sitting through the dialogue moments are frustrating to even hear the characters speak. All the character interactions are not written as real conversations, monologues occur at inappropriate times. A complete re-writing of the entire game's plot narrative (by someone with writing experience) would make the game perfect. 8.5/10			"

												I love this game but I am tired of games that have ""many ways to make money"" but only one that is effective.Ship that can hold 100 cargo:   Try being a trader at about a 20% return. What this means is if you buy something at 80 and sell at 100 you make 20. You can hold 100 things so you make a total of $2,000   Go mining. Best thing I found to mine sells for 900, get 100. 900x100=$90,000. This takes a lot of time   Go kill guys and loot them for random amounts so lets just say you only save the items worth 2,000+ so call it $100,000 but this takes a lot of time OR   Start the game and as soon as you have control of your ship hang out around a space station and board the weakest ship you can find. Then sell that ship at the space station for $400,000+ depending on the ship.... takes 5-10 minutes or less..... Late game is even worse as you will be selling ships for millions.			"

												9/10 This game is a total an amazing space simulator. You start off with a tiny little gunship and move up to commanding Dreadnaughts and Carriers. You can command a mini fleet of 2 other warships. The AI is decent, storyline is phenomenal, gameplay is great! I did not feel like there was any grind at all in this game, making money and moving on to the next level and ship was fast and easy. Game was very intuitive with a very helpful UI, biggest complaint is the blech voiceacting and the horrific accents. Other then that the devs are super responsive and made a great game. I own almost 200 games and rarely give out reviews, when I do I either loved the game or hated the heck out of it. I loved this game and if you enjoyed playing Freelancer, Wing Commander Series including Privateer, this is like those games except on crack.			"

												Good time killer but there are a lot of little bugs that blow it for me. Like mission triggers that don't always work so you can get stuck on missions and need customer support to tweak them. That and the combat is relatively bland, they put a lot of thought into boarding actions and such but its not easy to learn unless you stumble upon a youtube guide, theres no tutorial really for it. Beyond that the enemy AI always hangs out in your blind spot and the dogfighting is very ""meh"" - point and click stuff, doesn't feel like it's skill based you know? Just tell your turrets to go HAM and wait a few seconds for things to explode. Scan anomalies for EXP that you'd otherwise ignore so their ""side effects"" aren't very underplayed.			"

												Its a decent game. You will probably lose a few hours of your life on it.The good:The history. The controls, very similar to Elite: Dangerous. Lot of ships.Lot of modules.Big space, lot of places to visit...lot of enemies =))Yet to see -> TITANS!!!The bad:The interface isn't intuitive. I'm still trying to find the rank xp bar...The ship loadout interface is a bit o confusing too.Aside from the main history, every mission is the same...Go there and kill someone...We should be able to save it whenever we want, not only inside stations.The worse:For some reason the game freeze at some dialogues and at random points while flying. The only solution is alt+F4.I've looked in the forums but not seems to solve it.If you are looking for something which resemble EVE without the complexe learning curve and a decent gameplay, this is the one. Just be prepared for redo some missions if the game crashes.			"

												i love flying around in space with no loads, but why cant we be in a solar system with a star in the middle and planets going around it, as far as we know thats how all solar systems work, this seems like just random rogue planets totally static in space. minor complaint tho its a great game already and its not even got main missions or even side missions but freelancing is what i wanna do anyway so im loving it, flying between planets and space stations, i just wish the map was the size of the actual universe... is that too much to ask? :)   for me its been a hit amongst a series of bad purchases, its really all im playing right now. i got it for 33% off and it was def worth that for me.

												A ""Must have"" for any Space Sim fan, SPG2 manage to deliver that ""freelanceresque"" feeling I've been looking for since... well FL itself. The game still have some things to be ironed out, like ship and weapon balance, trade and mining, and some minor bugs, but the devs are very active and truly listening to the community feedback. With some tweaks here and there this game could be a true successor to FL.You'll get sucked in by the wonderful surroundings, the ambient music, and the attention and love the small team of devs is putting into the game.If you loved Freelancer, you'll love Starpoint Gemini 2.

												I'm going to start this review by being negative. This is not to savage the work that Little Green Men did on this game, but rather to emphasize the positive bits later.""Starpoint Gemini 2"" has some pretty rough areas. The campaign, framed through (sometimes yawn-inducing) text boxes and uneven voice-acting, didn't connect with me very well. There's an interesting twist here and there, but I just couldn't manage to care that much about what was going on. The necessary ""gloss-n-polish"" doesn't exist, especially with the game dialogue writers having a strange aversion to using the word ""the.""The game's difficulty curve is lumpy and strange, with the procedural mission generation apparently taking into account your level, but not what ship you have. This is also aggravated by a lack of mission information. Especially with the campaign, you don't know that much about what you're heading into. It's possible to get to a point where you just ""hit a wall,"" and get thrown into an engagment that you simply can't win without (at least) having gotten into the next class of ship. There's nothing wrong with this if you have some sort of warning, but for it to happen suddenly and with no advance notice is a kind of ""fake difficulty"" that I dislike.(I can appreciate a game that's not interested in hand-holding, but there's also a point where it all turns into sloppy experience design. ""Freelancer"" got this right by walling you off from taking the next campaign mission if you didn't have the prerequisites. ""SG2"" gets it wrong by basically telling you nothing aside from the story's flavortext. I simply don't equate legitimate game challenge with failing to communicate effectively.)I finally got to the point where seeing what happened next in the story was insufficient incentive to work my way up to a more durable spacecraft.But here's the thing - the above happened more than once. This is where things go positive; That I got pulled back into the experience is a testimony to just how well the basic gameplay loop was crafted.What the developers really managed to do beautifully is to create an addicting ""travel, do, upgrade, repeat"" cycle that keeps dragging you back in. The space you fly through is nicely crafted, with a sense of scale that is large without having interminable length between interesting features. The combat is generally satisfying (as long as you're not in a situation where it's overwhelming), and the other game mechanics manage to be pretty deep without being clunky or hard to get your mind around. Other free-roaming space games give you all kinds of controls, and then those controls don't behave consistently (or at all) as you expect. This title, on the other hand, is very solid in terms of behaving intelligently when you give commands.If Little Green Men Games built a sequel that was basically the same core mechanics, but with a far more refined mission (both campaign and procedural) experience, they would be in the same league as ""Freelancer."" The foundation is there - it just needs to be built upon. "

After trying the X series, Eve, and countless others I must say this one has been my favorite.  Its clean and easy to play but with enough complexity to keep things interesting for a while.I am looking forward to the game perhaps expanding in the future and going away from some of the predictability that i've noticed at 20+ hours of play.  Its nice and satisfying to have a game that i've purchased and feel like I got my money's worth.			"

												I bought this game during a Steam sale not expecting too much of it, but it's had me hooked for weeks now. It's fun to play and offers you a lot of things to do and ways to play. For instance, you can focus on the story, pirating, freelancing or trade goods that you either buy legally or gain by looting other ships. You can even specialize in mining asteroids and gasclouds and sell the gains. Or do all of the above!The game gets updated regularly and now has a very extensive tutorial library to help new players get started. You're able to customize your ship's weapon loadout and, to a certain level, it's color and decals.The only things I've noticed so far that could be improved is the voice acting in the storyline (which is pretty hilarious at times) and weapon impact effects. The latter look really poorly done compared to the sleek and smooth ship designs, explosions and absolutely beautiful galaxy you travel through.Oh, and the main menu music alone could have made me buy this game, just thought I'd mention that too.

												Bought this game in Early Access ~3 years ago.  Been playing it off an on.  I doubt I'll ever get over 200 hours but that doesn't mean I don't like the game.  It's amazing seeing how barebones it was back then come to life - as in, freelance missions gave you like 1000 credits and a few dozen XP. Half of the interface was useless and many things were still placeholders.  It's neat to come across a large battle and swoop in to help or to loot.Quick list of pros/cons+Beautiful environment+Living world+SPACESHIPS!+SPACESTATIONS!+Many ways to get money/XP-I have zero interest in the Campaign (don't let that sway you; just a personal preference)-In sandbox mode, it doesn't feel as though you're a big part of the solar system, which makes sense. I guess what I was looking for in this game won't be realized until Starpoint Gemini: Warlords.-Damn PTE disrupting pirates.-A few things are underexplained.-Ship size difference is not noticeable enough and was a complaint since Early Access.

												Finally, a game that scratches my decade-long Freelancer itch.But first, a disclaimer. While no longer an Early Access title, Starpoint Gemini 2 - as of October 2014 - is not quite the finished article. The game still has a number of items turned off in the options menu. Certain gameplay features seem to be half-finished, and the AI does not seem to be taking advantage of all the tools available in combat. In fact, many newcomers are bound to be turned off by the obtuse UI design and the text-heavy, non-interactive tutorials that spit out seemingly unending streams of text on things they have no idea about.Get past the initial frustrations, however, and you will find an absolute gem of a timesink. SG2 nails the three key elements of a good space sim: simple controls, a massive universe full of activities, and a million paths to success on your own terms. Starting off in a tiny gunship and a poorly-voiced campaign mission, you are quickly set loose and given freedom to roam the absolutely gigantic map to mine, trade, explore and fight to your heart's content. Veteran X players may be disappointed by the comparatively static world, limited fleet building options and inability to set up your own industrial empire in the stars, but everyone else should be more than satisfied with the wealth of choices at hand. This is more than worth it at full price, and absolutely unmissable in a sale.			"

												This game is fun for a little while but there's so little variation it gets very tedious, which is a shame becuase the game mechanics are good.Cons:There are three quests you can do: 1)Go here and kill these guys.2)Go here and scan this anomaly.3)Go here and take stuff over there.In order to make money you can either grind for days ferrying junk around, or buy a few upgrades for your crew and start hijacking enemy ships.  The former will take hours before you can buy your next ship, the latter will take minutes.  Rinse and repeat and winthin one afternoon you have the biggest, baddest ship with all the best hardware.There's no variation across the map: each sector feels identical.  I guess in real life the universe is very homogenous but you probably shouldn't use WMAP as your basis for a space RPG.The voice acting is pretty dull.  You can tell the actors aren't at all enthused by the story and nor was I.Pros:You can adjust the power balance of your shelds, weapons and engines, giving you a more hands on approach to aggresion, defence and running away.Each weapon and shield module has its own power and can be drained if over taxed during a fight, forcing you to keep manouvering to keep your better charged side towards the enemy.  This makes the big lumbering ships more interesting to play.You can take your unstoppable death machine, paint it shiny pink and name it ""Winnie the Pooh"".Summary:The game world is too big and too bland.  If the devs had put the effort into writing a better story and varying the world rather than inflating it, this game could be great.  Otherwise it feels more like work than fun.			"

												The simplicity of the game is great, not over complicated. Having a fairly good tech tree and upgradability makes it truly fun.

												What i liked:- Multiple options for combat (capture, shoot them up, cloaked assisn)- Vast universe with multiple factions- Many interesting travel options (jumpgates, gravity anomalies, wormholes, speed boosters and jumpdrive)What i disliked:- Poor storyline and terrible voiceacting- Horrid combat balance based on owned ship (if you have a tiny gunship and upgrade to a corvette or a frigate, suddenly all the enemies upgrade equally and you get blasted to smitherines in a matter of seconds)- Enemy difficulty based on player level (why on earth would i take a +xp perk - if i want increased difficulty i just do so in the option menu)- Due to scaling enemies almost instantly have many more troops in their ship than you can hope to send, which makes the troop capture option obsolete- Sinle use boost.. make them cost more (-> multiuse with cooldown) and dont make me run around half the universe looking for the ones i use- Class based skills - useless at best, let me at least replace them with usable items (boosts)SummaryI might give this game a thumbs up once balancing issues have been adressed and class skills make a difference.

												Had to write a review because I looked and saw that this game was getting really negative reviews. I think that most of these come from skewed expectations. The game, is fantastic, but not for everyone. If you are expecting an Eve style game: turn around and walk away. If you are expecting an Elite: Dangerous style of game: turn around and walk the other way. If you are expecting a Freelancer style game: then come right on in and enjoy the ride. I'm a pretty big space junkie, even bleeding into the mobile area *gag reflex*, I know. But when I'm not playing some space game on my PC, I'm playing Galaxy on Fire on my phone. As far as the game goes don't expect much ""dogfight"" type flying and combat. While there is a small amount of that in the early game, very quickly it turns into a game with battleships and cruisers, where the tactic is to broadside your adversary rather than run at him head on. Being that it is in space, that type of combat is amplified tenfold. Think of a great conflict with you in your dreadnought vs 3 other battleships. You launch fighters and prepare for combat. Being that this is space one of the battleships flys above you, so you rotate your ship so that your port side is now facing the underside of his ship, leaving you with a perfect angle of attack. If that doesn't sound awesome to you than this game is now for you.			"

They also took away the seperate sectors and merged them into 1, with sometimes undesirable lag but no more loading screens and the feel of a huge area to play around in. Big plus there.The gameplay has suffered greatly though, as you can no longer buy/sell individual ship systems as would in the previous game, since a somewhat different system has been employed, but worse yet, there no longer is a significant subsystem targeting system, but from what I understand that is yet to be implemented.Bare in mind though that this is still in Beta when this was written, but it should give a general idea about what happened. With Starpoint Gemini in mind, I am a little bit more optimistic compared to my last edit. I did love that interface, but that's gone...			"

												[Disclosure: Game copy purchased with own money]Quick update for my review.The game has continued to be supported with cheep DLC (with a free one on its way soon) and continued bug fixes and updates for controller support etc form the team. If your still on the fence (somehow) When I got this, I didn't buy a game... I just lent 10 new friends some money. Best wishes LGM teamFull launch review:1 Year in E/A It doesn't feel like it at all. Its went so fast and so smoothly I hardly noticed it, though looking back you could be forgiven for thinking the alpha/beta releases are a different monster from the full, and you'd be right. Shortly after typing this I shall be making a brand new ""from the start"" video and stick the link here. Check it out whydontcha?Also if it wasn't obvious already I whole heartedly 100% recommend this game. It oozes polish and shines as bright as Gemini's twin suns thanks to everyone's (with a special thanks to the early access-ors without whom this probably wouldn't have been half as good as a game that it is) hard work and dedication. Excellent Job Team SG2 (LGM, Iceberg Interactive, Steam and of course the Early Access-ors)Early Access Review begins: Despite this game being in alpha, it plays very well and is extremely fun. There is lots of work still to be done to it for sure but with and active community and devs that engage with their customers this is sure to be one of the best space sims around.Defos worth the price, was worth it back when it was in alpha, doubly so nowIf your still not sure feel free to check out my lets play on the game here:

												""Full PTE ahead! Oh wait, Captain there's something wrong..""Honestly, I like it. It's a decent game, it has a strong core and does have entertaining values inside of it. It's pretty, runs well on my AMD machine, and keeps you at least somewhat busy. However, there are some very odd issues and difficulties I have with the game, I'll list them below.Game is too light; When I say this, I mean that the game is not that deep. The statistics for ships is relegated to a few simple stats (such as hull, cargo and crew). I feel that if I'm going to be driving around a big ship, I'd wanna know more about what's going on with it's internal systems. What makes ship A better than ship B? Well look at hull, cargo and troop capacity. That's it. Where's my statistics? Scaling for ship size; This is actually a big complaint. The ships don't look..big. They don't have imposing statures or good camera angles. They don't refelct how big (or small) they actually are. I have a small gunship and I'll go past ships marked as frigates or destroyer and I can't tell a size difference. That makes no sense to me. Sure, if I get within ""I'll melt you with point blank lasers range"" I'll notice a very small difference, but otherwise it's hard to tell. Reminds me of Star Trek (the show).Lots of loot, nothing to do with it; There's a plethora of loot in the game. Computers, drugs, minerals and ores. ALL YOU CAN DO IS SELL THEM. You can't craft, you can't allocate them for energy on the ship, they are just fluff. They don't have any real impact on the game other than that they can be sold (and what's worse, caputring enemy ships is far more benificial). I wish there was an in depth crafting system, something. Notifications; The game does not notify you when you pick up loot, meaning, that when I loot a ship with the ""auto loot"" function, it does not tell me what I got! I have to go into my menues and see what was put in. A prime example of how this is bad. I looted a big ship once, got an AMAZING missle system. I didn't know I had it, it never notified me. So I spent 250,000 credits on a missle system (worse by the way) and then, while equping it, realized I had the other one. Bye bye money! Camera angles; Not dynamic, not good. No cockpit view. Sadface.No real interaction with the universe; I will have to state, this is one of my biggest issues. Doing freelance quests gives you no satisfaction. When I'm picking up a VIP to transport, no chat initiates. It's a simple grab and go. Even the quest text is shallow. ""Pick up A, drop off at B."" There's no context as to what I'm doing this for. When I have a mission to go kill some pirate, there's nothing to it. It's just ""We of the Such-and-such want Pirate dead"". That's it! There's no interaction with the universe around you, it's all text and empty requests. You can't even interact with the ships system officers!! There's never a point where I feel truly a part of a living organism, I feel like the ONLY living organism in the game.Difficulty; Thus far, it makes no sense. I'll take on a quest to kill a pirate that's my level. Then I'll go to said zone and find that the pirate has two or more friends and he himself is listed as ""Impossible"" for my skill level. WHY? The game never notified me on what gear I should have when. The ships I'm going up against are a cool 2-10 MILLION credits, where as in my entire game play, dedicating time to making credits, I've made roughtly 800,000 at most, at one time. I read a forum post stating that some people ran into a sinkhole of difficulty, they leveled up too fast and the game scaled their enemies up too high, too quick. My point is, leveling should be more fluid and less wreckless. Don't allow me to level up to level 20 when I can't afford/fight level 20 ranked ships. EXP needs to be reworked, slow down leveling. Class ""System""; It's strait forward and dull. No real custiomization other than ""Put point here, see marginal benifits"". It's like old school WoW. Funny enough above I listed the games not deep, but it has a +% based level system. That's okay, I get it. But my skills don't feel impact, even against trivial ranked enemies, they still melt through my shield and kill me.I could go on, there's a lot to complain about with this game. However, give it a shot. If you really like space-sandbox-adventure action, you can't go wrong here. But there's better out there. ""General Statement. These are my thoughts on the game. Any opposing or likeminded feelings are welcome to be directed and discussed at me, however, don't be an idiot about it.""			"

												Had to write a review because I looked and saw that this game was getting really negative reviews. I think that most of these come from skewed expectations. The game, is fantastic, but not for everyone. If you are expecting an Eve style game: turn around and walk away. If you are expecting an Elite: Dangerous style of game: turn around and walk the other way. If you are expecting a Freelancer style game: then come right on in and enjoy the ride. I'm a pretty big space junkie, even bleeding into the mobile area *gag reflex*, I know. But when I'm not playing some space game on my PC, I'm playing Galaxy on Fire on my phone. As far as the game goes don't expect much ""dogfight"" type flying and combat. While there is a small amount of that in the early game, very quickly it turns into a game with battleships and cruisers, where the tactic is to broadside your adversary rather than run at him head on. Being that it is in space, that type of combat is amplified tenfold. Think of a great conflict with you in your dreadnought vs 3 other battleships. You launch fighters and prepare for combat. Being that this is space one of the battleships flys above you, so you rotate your ship so that your port side is now facing the underside of his ship, leaving you with a perfect angle of attack. If that doesn't sound awesome to you than this game is now for you.			"

												I played Elite: Dangerous, then X3AP, then X:Rebirth, went back to X3AP and finally I stumbled on Starpoint Gemini 2. How I came to this game? In elite, I was fascinated by the cool-looking fighters, the dog-fighting with HOTAS controller and hype of Horizon. I soon realised the game was time-consuming and i was unable to accomplish as much as I would expected. I loaded up X3 (I bought during a steam sale) and started playing. This game also had dog-fighting, tons of ship classes but the main draw was the scope and depth of the game. At the midpoint, I coud lead a wing of fighters, setup space stations and managed a fleet of trading freighters. It was really cool but I spent way too much time and the graphics were not as cool. I hopped over to X: Rebirth and got a headache navigating in the engine. I hopped back to X3 for a short while and finally got to SPG2.SPG2 is a Space-Theme ARPG. In free-roam, you control a ship and navigate through a gigantic starchart map. You can pick up alot space-thremed missions, mine asteroids, trade between space stations and planets, be a pirate or police. It cover much of everything you can think of in a space sim game but to a limited depth. I won't not say it is a shallow game because you have a pretty good idea of what a space sim would be like after playing this game.+ Tons of playable ships + Beautiful ship designs+ Space combat is flashy and exciting. + Tons of things to do, you won't get bored of things to do - Limited functionality in several aspect of a typical space sim game - Reputation system, licences and bulletin news interface seems like a mere after-thought - Shield system is surprisingly 2 dimensional - No real space dogfighting - It is definitely not SPG1 or starfleet command - I had this feeling it is designed to be played on consoles since it is evidently simplified, not a good thing for PC players.This game shines when you play at it as a ARPG in a space theme setting and not as a typical space sim. Its greatness comes from the sum of all the parts it has to offer. For its vast contents and production value, I disagree it is a poor man's Free Space.			"

												Pardon the format of my review, I am not formatting it very well.I bought Starpoint Gemini a couple of years back and just could not get into it.  I had put Starpoint Gemini 2 on my wishlist, hoping for a sale.  So I recently bought it on sale and I am find the freeroam mode very satisfying.I started out mining asteroids, then doing missions and all the while figuring out the different mechanisms for the game.  I had googled some ""Getting started"" guides and found out that boarding and selling ships was where most money could be made.  I had changed the game mode to easy, I wanted to check out all the different ships the game has to offer without too much of a struggle.   There is a clear progression with the choice of ships and going from your beginner Gunship and ending up with a Dreadnought is very satisfying.   The controls are a lot like Freelancer. Selling ships and taking out the most wanted from the Bounty board is a sure way to get rich fast.  There are different ""zones"" near friendly space stations that offer baddies from the different factions that are ideal for getting xp and capturing ships and dragging them to the spacestation.   Troopers are the currency that allow you to capture ships, space stations run out of them and then you have to go look for them somewhere else or wait until the space station has a new shipment of them.  I love the map with all the different factions and things to discover, there are structures called artefact vaults where you can collect an artefact, the objective is to collect all 50.  Some special kills (usually baddies from the most wanted board) yield unique weapons with better than average stats and some missions/kills yield   blueprint for unique equipment.  Most subsystems of  your ship can changed with upgrades that give bonuses.  You also can hire different officers that give bonuses. Furthermore once you reach a certain level,  you can hire mercs that join you so you end up with a little fleet.The combination of different ships (70 apparently), different officers, skills, perks, mercs and equipment and the huge map makes this game a great experience for me. I enjoy the grind of doing missions and capturing ships.   Overall a great Elite clone.  The story is a little thin and the game could use some world-lore detailing the history of the various factions beyond the news bulletins, something like the books in the Elder Scroll games would be nice. Also, the capture/trooper mechanic could be reworked a little, I never understand why some of my troopers still have to die when they are capturing an empty enemy ship.			"

												This is my impression of the game after about 39 hours of play. This game is mostly fun, as a game like this can be “fun”. This is a space simulation and as such, there is a lot of “space”. Moving from one place to another is a test of patience. It is very nice to look at and the music background/atmosphere is gorgeous; I can just listen to this game for hours. Unfortunately, the main story is not very interesting (after having done a few missions, I don’t even know what it is about). I am currently at level 17 but haven’t advanced much in the story because I don’t have any incentive to do so, or I don’t care for the story.I am mostly having fun exploring, mining, capturing ships and selling them to make money, because the game doesn’t give you much of that and selling ships is the best and the fastest way to make money. There doesn’t seem to any real purpose in this game; you just go around doing stuff that, ultimately, has no purpose. This is a nice game to play if you know what you are getting into. But I should point out that this is not a fast game to play so you need to have lots of time and patience on your hands. "

IMHO it needs 3 things..1.) balancing: - railgun weapons are far better than all weapon types (beam, plasma)- some red (high-lvl) missions are easy, got killed on some easy ones (low-lvl)2.) more deep mechanics- trading very stupid (although very effective to earn money till ~lvl10)3.) removing first ?LGM? screen when launching game! - it's very loud forcing me to throw my headpones from my ears in instanceI recommend this game for all space-sim-explorer-lovers not for common player looking for something new..

												Okay, I loved this game.  The ship models are fantastic and deeply customizable.  The ""Heroes"" that can optionally be hunted down have curiously ordinary names and faces - I think I've been killing the developers inside their own game.  The sandbox is massive, and while most of the missions really boil down to ""go here and kill this guy"" and ""go here without getting killed"", the enemies scale well enough that you're never really assured a victory.  Until you get a titan.  I didn't play the first game, but I get the feeling that the Levithan was the final battle.  Building your own ship off of that design, then, really skews the odds in your favor.  Fortunately, this is only an option at the very end, so look forward to scurrying away from enemy reinforcements.  Long story short, this will probably devour almost a hundred hours of your life and you won't resent it for that.			"

												So I bought this on sale and it was one of those impulse buys, I did not get this game at all when I first tried it, but when I was in a more patient mood to learn the confusing interface I have now started playing it more and actually understand it as I read the tutorials carefully and just got used to everything, there is a learning curve with this game, but considering it's singleplayer so you don't have to worry about player population and it's a really massive space sim it is definitely worth it.Do you remember the days of Freelancer? Well I do and I played that game to death, one of the most fun aspects for me was the huge amounts of factions, the hidden bases, the exploration and the rather limited sandbox experience when it came to trading this game has decided to focus on all of that.I may actually even check out mining properly now, because I remember wanting to do it in Freelancer but because that game was primarily about combat it was all very limited oh and just like freelancer it looks like you mine by shooting stuff rather than having any sort of specialised ship, which, while is a bit silly I do wonder if that's a good mechanic because it means you don't have to worry so much about how to defend yourself in space sims.So to sum this game up, it very much has a learning curve, think of it as Freelancer on steroids because even the steering of your ship is very similar, but once you get into it you'll have no problem getting through the map and the various interfaces loaded with information.If anyone wants a possible tip on getting into the game quicker, I recommend just getting used to using the context menu which you access with the middle mouse button or clicking your scroll wheel. Unlike most context sensitive stuff on games this menu actually seems to work decently and you can use it to quickly navigate around space.			"

												This is my methadone to keep me going until Star Citizen is out.TLDR: It's very relaxing and enjoyable to roam around popping pirate ships, and scooping up their loot while exploring each hex.Theres some nice progression with levels earning you skills and perks to your character.  Meanwhile spend that ill gotten cash to upgrade ship systems, buy fancier guns, and stock up on consumables to give your ship an edge in a fight, or i suppose help miners in their tedious rock popping. Hire troops for the wetwork, bridge officers for passive bonuses, and later on mercenary captains to back you up in a fight. Remember, it's OK to leave them to die.  Ultimately earn enough (or take over!) that fancy new ship you've been eying. There are also purchasable licenses for financial perks like earning extra credits when killing certain factions or cheaper goods from a certain corporation, even passive credits per month so you can sit around and do squat and still earn money just like the one percenter you are.Exploration stays enjoyable by providing several modes of travel.  Pay to use an established warp gate (there's a way to make a one time license purchase to make them free though), or risk some damage and redshirt lives by using wormholes.  There's also these odd green bands of gravitational anomolies than can pull you in and whip you across several sectors very quickly, and finally the convenience of a consumable that will jump you a limited distance but can go from anywhere to any place you've already explored (and have enough drives to reach). It's also financially useful as the more stations you find, the better options you'll have to buy low and sell high with a decent variety of trade goods, some of them illicit in certain regions.I wish the different parts of space were more varied, but at least it's all uniformly pretty with nebulas, asteroid fields, ice asteroids, and clouds of floating junk (all mineable if you're into that sort of thing) to add some variety. There are scannable anomolies, though only a few types and they all just do some sort of passive thing to surrounding space like scramble sensors or block teleporters. Scanning them down will get rid of the field, and earn some xp and credits if its a mission, otherwise they are ignorable.  Some of the more unique stations are very beautiful, like the Spire, but most of the space stuff is pretty samey.Combat is  pretty simplistic you can even (and its recommended) set your turrets to autofire and concentrate on turning your best shields towards the light show. I wish the different guns and damage types were a little more varied. Heavy weapons have limted ammo but help speed things up, and there are some other consumables that can be deployed to help increase offense or survivability.  Spice things up by locking your grappling array on a wounded ship and teleporting over boarding parties of expendable no name grunts who throw their lives away so you can get a big payday.  If you're lucky and manage to successfully take over a ship you get to loot it far more effectively that picking through its wreckage, then tow it to the nearest dock to either add to your stable or sell off. Remember to keep the redshirts stocked every time you come back to port. Out in the stars are a bunch of named elites with bounty's on their heads and suprisingly deadly offensive capabilities to test your mettle. Currently theres no real story, and a very limited number of missions that just help earn credits while doing the things you're already doing, but the foundation that is there is solid and fun, and surprisingly well polished for an early access title.

												This space simulation starts off a little slow but is a lot of fun once you get up and running. Think of it as a simplified version of the X series.  There seems to be a lot of things that aren't quite finished or shallow, but the developers have been quite activate in adding new content so far.  At this time, theres enough content to get about 25-35 hours worth out of this title at a minimum. Its very sandbox-y with an average story thrown on top.  The storyline itself was interesting, but the voice acting was pretty awful.  All in all, I'd recommend it only if you are into space sim games.			"

								I've only got about an hour into this game, but so far it seems really well done for an alpha. There are still some bugs with this game still, like trying to send marines over to a ship that's blowing up xD, but what alpha doesn't?

												I originally purchased this game during Early Access and have not been disappointed with the released product.  This title is a fine choice for those who enjoy an RPG in which one can be a starship captain.  With a wide variety of ships and missions, as well as Steam Workshop integration, there is a great deal of replayability.Having stated that, I recommend purchasing this game on sale, as the retail price is a bit steep.  I have noticed some minor graphical bugs, but nothing I would consider a ""show stopper"".  If you enjoy space captain RPG's with replayability, I recommend considering this particular title.			"

								Starpoint Gemini 2 is what all space adventure games should strive to be. Highly replayable adaptive and immersive ,S♥♥♥♥llows the player to take on the universe as the captain of one of a large number of customizeable ships. Enjoy sailing through the stars as a trader, Battle as a bountyhunting captain collecting your bounties or many other play styles. This game allows you to delve deeply into the story and feel like you are your character. I reccomend this game the devs are active and little time goes by without some fix being implimented. I have played many finished games that are less complete than this Alpha. Give it a try .			"

												Pros: Plays like Freelancer, in that you trade, kill, or quest to buy better ships and weapons - except if you are patient enough, you can get from one end to the other on engines alone.That is, of course, assuming that you do not encounter any enemies or anomalies along the way that will screw you over.Cons: The voice acting is laughably horrible and the lines themselves are poorly written. It's like a B-/C+ grade movie. Not to mention the typos, the faulty delete button which doesn't work, and the ""Active Only"" filter which, again, doesn't work.Bottom Line: Get it anyway. The dialogue and voice acting is, ultimately, a minor issue.			"

												At first I thought this game sucked but the more I play it the more fun it is. It reminds me a lot of freespace 2 which is a great thing because that game rocked! However if your looking for a dogfight space sim then this isnt it. You get to fly huge ships which are more like gigantic gun boats. The voice acting is terible but dont let that put you off as the core gameplay is solid. I wish these guys had more money to spend on the game and add better social comms like the old wing commander 4. The game does feel lifeless sometimes as you do't really commincate with anyone, be it friendlies enemies or neutrals. So far this game has sucked up 11 hours of my life and I'm sure many hours to follow.  Hint: Leave your joystick unplugged, you won't need it. This games designed for mouse and keyboard and works well with it.Overall 7/10			"

								 I'm new to Steam and one of the first games I searched for was Freelancer, no luck there unfortunatly. So I was keeping an eye out for a similar, if not even better after ten years, replacment for my space combat kicks. The vids on the Store page for Starpoint Gemini 2 look amazing, it seemed to tick all the boxes.  Regardless of your Class you start with an awesome ship, it reminded me of B5s WhiteStar. It's a beast, easily crushing the initial waves of pirate scum who think they're hard enough. As you progress slightly you come up against larger foes and more drawn out battles that require a little more thought. You can upgrade your weapons or change them out, improve your crew to improve your boarding party and the idea of having a Merc fleet to command sounds great. There is a very solid foundation for an epic game here.Combat is on the whole more tactical than Freelancers wild dog-fights, although in fairness I'm not expecting a Cruiser or Frigate Class ship to turn on a dime like a Fighter. A bit more pace wouldn't hurt though. There is currently no story mode and I didn't think I would miss it so much untill it wasn't there. The good news is that it's yet to come, so that's really something to look forward to. For the the time being however, I'm done flying about on other faceless peoples errands as it really has no impact on the greater Galactic Goings-On. The Devs have done a superb job so far but they've a real task ahead to fill out Gemini and the players role in the galaxy.			"

								 I'm new to Steam and one of the first games I searched for was Freelancer, no luck there unfortunatly. So I was keeping an eye out for a similar, if not even better after ten years, replacment for my space combat kicks. The vids on the Store page for Starpoint Gemini 2 look amazing, it seemed to tick all the boxes.  Regardless of your Class you start with an awesome ship, it reminded me of B5s WhiteStar. It's a beast, easily crushing the initial waves of pirate scum who think they're hard enough. As you progress slightly you come up against larger foes and more drawn out battles that require a little more thought. You can upgrade your weapons or change them out, improve your crew to improve your boarding party and the idea of having a Merc fleet to command sounds great. There is a very solid foundation for an epic game here.Combat is on the whole more tactical than Freelancers wild dog-fights, although in fairness I'm not expecting a Cruiser or Frigate Class ship to turn on a dime like a Fighter. A bit more pace wouldn't hurt though. There is currently no story mode and I didn't think I would miss it so much untill it wasn't there. The good news is that it's yet to come, so that's really something to look forward to. For the the time being however, I'm done flying about on other faceless peoples errands as it really has no impact on the greater Galactic Goings-On. The Devs have done a superb job so far but they've a real task ahead to fill out Gemini and the players role in the galaxy.			"

								 Roughly two weeks ago, I bought this game, played it a bit, and loved the idea, but since it was an Alpha, it was incomplete, confuse, and buggy.  Now, two weeks later... what a surprise! The game already entered Beta phase, is much better, even playable and enjoyable! I really didn't expect such progress in so little time! There's much to be done still, but now I have faith in this project!			"

								Well, it is a beta, but it does not really feel like a beta. Aside from a couple of mistakes/wrong textures applied, I have so far not had a problem.At first, the mix between joystick and mouse + keyboard was a bit hard to get hold of, but you can get the turrets to automatic, which works perfectly fine.Im not sure how the threat is assigned however, as I had no issues bringing down deadly ships, without my shields going down.So far the game is very repetitive, which is the only bad thing about it, however, being in beta still, I'm hoping more missions will be added over time, less repetitive.I like how the bounty system works, and it is very rewarding to get a bounty.I'd recommend the game, as it seems quite polished, and seems to work just fine :)			"

								I have yet to try any other space sims. But At the time, Starpoint Gemini, just seemed to be the exact kind of game to fill the game drought currently occuring in my life. I love RPGS and Space. Seeing that it was on sale I decided to take the plunge and purchase it.... It was at that point I discovered I had already owned this game for quite some time,( which happens more often that I should admit). Anywho, I installed and was immediately overwhelmed with the tutorial making me memorize a million different commands and interactions that seemed to be mostly Jibberish. Being my first step into the Space-sim genre as well as one of the only 4X strategy games  i've ever played, I gave no fault to the game or it's design. This was strictly me being a dummy.3 hours later I'm a bonafide Space pirate. THIS GAME IS GOOD! Like stay up until 3 in the morning on a work night kinds of good.			"

								So I used to play EVE online a lot, and when I say alot I mean a social life endagering amount. Dont get me wrong, its an awesome game, but I always felt underpressure from my corperation and the fact it was a pay monthy subscription to play as much as I possibly/physically could. Due to this I eventually stopped playing and have ever since been on the lookout for something that comes even remotley close to EVE visually, mechanically and diversly. Starpoint Gemini 2 is the best I have found yet, and (as at the time of writing this) is still only in BETA!! Really looking forward to where they are going to take this, and no pay monthly fee so I can pick up and put down as I wish without feeling like I'm losing money. Ok so its not as complex as EVE but EVE was (imho) massivley complex and this game does just enough without frying your brain. Diversity is there, the amount of stuff you can do already without the campain is huge, visuals are breathtaking and the playable area is massive, not EVE massive but I ve been playing now for about 20 hours with 1 character and I've only explored about 1/8 of the map. Very well done on this guys and a big thumbs up on how much feedback you take from the forums. Its so nice to see deleopvers actually listening to us gamers and implementing changes directly off the back of feedback/critisims/ideas that come straight from the community. If you used to (or still do) play EVE, love space sims (or not) or are just looking for something to fill the gap between now and Star Citizen, look no further.All in all I give Starpoint Gemini 2 9/10 and watch this space, its only gonna get better			"

								I'm quite impressed with this game so far. There is only one playable mode at the moment and that is the free roam sandbox mode. However, there are plenty of missions and other activities to keep you busy. I'm really impressed by some of the mechanics in this game that I have not seen in other space RPGs. The interface is sleek and functional without being too complicated and everything is easily accessible with the push of a button. Also, this is one beautiful game. The environments are detailed and really make you feel like you are a small piece of a very large universe.Summed up, I recommend this game to lovers of space RPGs as this is one of the best that I have seen and it is not even complete yet. It is definitely worth it in this beta stage, which assures me that once this is released, it will be a major player in the space RPG market.			"

								Got alot of promise... probably needs a streamlined getting started intro, as the included tutorial reading is vague.  The getting started basics youtube vid I found helped alot.  ship fights are enjoyable.  haven't ships are almost priced out of reach, and the game isn't real clear on the best ways to earn money.  selling cargo captured from enemy ships is kinda slow as your first ship has limited cargo... I wish they just gave you a starting balance and let you decide how to start you game.  I haven't tried capping a ship.  but i would figure turning off ""Fire-at-will"" would be a critical portion.  I would recommend this game if you liked the first one and also if you like open ended space games. I Haven't gotten into the storyline if there is oe or if it just hasn't been implemented yet.  so far my storylne i made is getting another ship in my flight or upgrading my curent ship to a larger model.

								So far, I'm impressed enough with the game to keep my eye on it.  It has some nice ""widgets"" implemented (I especially dig the animation of the tactical display starting up), and it is definitely pretty.  I am particularly enjoying having traded my beam weapons for longer-ranged railguns, especially since the beam weapons didn't have the ""oomph"" factor for me.  Now I just need to find some enemies that give me a challenge (but don't just blast me out of the stars with their first volley).One thing I'd love to see is the ability to add/remove various mount types.  For instance:  I would rather have two railgun mounts up front and ditch my heavy weapon (since I tend to go ""no ammo"" on anything where I can build my own loadout).  Having a little more control over ""ship engineering"" would be grand.  For all I know, this is planned; it just doesn't exist at the moment (as of 2014.04.29).The only real downside I've experienced so far is a few seemingly-random CTDs.   While not entirely a ""downside,"" there can be a ""boredom factor"" (which is not unique to S♥♥♥♥t all - I have the same issue with the X-universe games):  not enough mission variety, so it feels like a click-fest instead of a space game at times.  It IS early-access, though, so this could be an instance of ""it's not in yet.""  Regardless, a little more attempted piracy or some events that feel like they have meaning (anomalies that actually affect you rather than just ""drain shields/sap engines/etc,"" or other such challenges might help).All told, I'm glad I got in on early access for SG2, and I'm excited to see where they take it!

												I'm loving Starpoint Gemini 2: probably the best space game in year. It's transitioned out of beta nicely, with minimal bugs, and improved optimization. The game has two modes, story and sandbox, and both are quite enjoyable. The control scheme feels a little like Nexus the Jupiter (but not exactly), in the sense that you're the commander of a large ship with various systems (and not just a fighter). Much better than the X series imo.The game excells at allowing you to create the kind of space captain you want to be, and the kind of ship you want to fly. There are three classes, commander, gunner, and engineer, and each excells at different specializations. Commanders are great pilots, and augment their fleets; while, gunners excell at blowing things up; the engineer can create space anomalies like vortexes that suck enemy ships in, deal radiation damage to crews, or they can hack and shut down ship systems.The ships are fantastic. Nearly a hundred different ships of varying classes that you can customize and taylor to your play style. You can control frigates and battleships - and command squadrons of fighters (but there are no fighters you can fly). Place different systems, weapons, and then tweak those systems and weapons with different modules. So, for example, you can tweak your teleporter to improve its capacity, or give it a defensive characteristic, and use it to block enemy teleports. (your ships have troops which can defend against and invade and take over other ships which you can later keep or sell.) Do you install a module with better accuracy, damage, or, for a little more money, both?Finally, there are a variety of things to do. You can be a trader, a smuggler, a pirate (raid and steal ships), or a fleet commander of some sorts. There are anomalies in space that you can simply go out, explore, scan, and document, and gain experience from this. You can ferry VIP or desparately needed supplies between stations. As much variety to the missions as in any space game.My only real complaints, and by no means are these game breaking, is the lack of documentation (there's very little information available on what different game mechanics do, exactly. Which is frustrating, since they obviously took the time to put different mechanics into the game. For example, some guns do ""emp"" damages, or ""radiation"" damage, and no where does it say exactly what it means by this, one is just left to assume that radiation hurts crews and emp drains batteries or shields. My second complaint is that there's just too much clutter. Don't get me wrong, the game is beautiful, but everywhere you look there's some beautiful nebulae, star, or simply space debry all around you. Your eyes get overwhelmed by the clutter, never are you allowed to enjoy the simplicity of being amongst the stars. You never get the sense that you're exploring unchartered territory, as there are ships and stations everywhere you go.All in all, excellent game. 8/10.			"

								Let me start by saying that if you have any interest at all in the Space/RPG genre you simply have to grab this game. Anyone who liked Freelancer, Freespace 1/2, Elite, I-War or any of the X games (apart from reunion) will be right at home here.Now for full disclosure I grabbed S♥♥♥♥ couple of months ago while it was still in Alpha stage and initially I wasn't too impressed. While issues are to be expected when you are playing an Alpha version, on my low-mid system, frame rate and stability issues kept me from playing for more than a couple of hours and I left the game alone for a while until some of these things were worked out.Boy! What a difference a couple of months makes. I figured since it finally got it's nice new ""Beta"" tag that I'd fire it up again and I'm really glad that I did, over 12 hours in the last 3 days can attest to how much fun I've been having with it.The basic premise of the game is your a star ship captain dropped into a dynamic living game world and your free to do pretty much whatever you want in a sandbox environment. (As of this writing the more linear campaign option has not been added yet, but is coming down the pipe shortly) : Feel like transporting VIPs or cargo from one sector to another, while enjoying the scenery? Check.Want to make your fortune by mining asteroids and junk yards? Check.Indescriminately want to blow up (Or at least try) any ship that comes near you? Check.Pros:Mind blowing number of ships to choose from (If you have the cash of course!)Plenty of factions to work with or against.3 unique classes with choices on which enhancements and perks to put into different skills when you level up.Galactic news and events that actually happen in the gameworld rather than being just Lore or Fluff.Excellent ship to ship tactical combat.Player driven goals, shall I save my money for a new ship or shall i upgrade my weapons and components?Cons:UI needs to provide more feedback. (Not being able to see the target summary unless your looking right at it, is a bit of a pain)Easy for a new player to be a little lost when first starting out, text tutorials are not ideal, but they do the job.Still a few performance and stability issues at times, which is to be expected with the game still being in BETA stage.Still some balancing issues with certain weapon types that need to be fleshed out, Beams being the prime example.Suggestions:Trading - Someway of knowing where to buy low and sell high would be nice, right now it's a bit of a crapshoot.Mission markers - How about different markers for each mission type? Would also be nice in the case of a point A to point B mission if the point B marker was a different color on the map screen.Event markers - After reading galactic news it would be nice to be able to at least select a few of them and have location specific news appear on the galactic map. (Bob spotted in the smith sector, should be able to mark the smith sector on the map so you don't have to go hunting around)Overall SG2 is shaping up very nicely and I highly recommend it, with a great DEV team who constantly provide feedback to player comments, it's only going to get better and better.

								A space shooter that is good fun. You should definately RTFM because it is not a jump in and play sort of game. You can do that,  but you will miss out on many features . I keep wanting to play a little longer instead of doing important things,  like eating & sleeping! I got it on a sale or a bundle, I don't remember which. The price is a little high if it isn't on sale, but I am really cheap when it comes to games, since I do get them where I got this one. I'm glad I own it because it does have decent play value.If you like space shooters, trading, & mining. this is becoming quite polished. I like & recommend it if this type of game is your cup of tea. It doesn't seem to have all of the micromanagement like a lot of games in this genre but they might be there & I haven't investigated the game far enough to find that yet. Not bad at all.			"

												This game really scratches the Freelancer itch.  It's fairly easy to pick up, although I wish it had a better tutorial.  One of the early main campaign missions tells you to do something, but did not explain how to actually do it.  After stumbling my way through that it's been fairly smooth sailing. It's fairly easy to make cash, and the missions are fairly fun.  I did have a couple of crashes, but they were few and far between.  The autosave system when you land somewhere works well, and ensures that even if you do crash, you don't lose much progress.Overall, I'm really enjoying this game, and it was worth picking up.			"

												Pros: Plays like Freelancer, in that you trade, kill, or quest to buy better ships and weapons - except if you are patient enough, you can get from one end to the other on engines alone.That is, of course, assuming that you do not encounter any enemies or anomalies along the way that will screw you over.Cons: The voice acting is laughably horrible and the lines themselves are poorly written. It's like a B-/C+ grade movie. Not to mention the typos, the faulty delete button which doesn't work, and the ""Active Only"" filter which, again, doesn't work.Bottom Line: Get it anyway. The dialogue and voice acting is, ultimately, a minor issue.			"

At the moment includes only one scenario - free roam- but that has a ton of stuff to do in its own right. freelance missions as areas of the gemini sector are opened(though these could pay better), mining, bounty hunting, trading and combat. healthy traffic all round means you dont quite feel alone as in most space sims of this scope. Brilliant ship design, all round good graphics and effects and nice sound which does a greta job of immersing the player.

At the moment includes only one scenario - free roam- but that has a ton of stuff to do in its own right. freelance missions as areas of the gemini sector are opened(though these could pay better), mining, bounty hunting, trading and combat. healthy traffic all round means you dont quite feel alone as in most space sims of this scope. Brilliant ship design, all round good graphics and effects and nice sound which does a greta job of immersing the player. To cut as long story short, i havent been able to put it down since i started playing :)			"

								I just purchased this game and havn't played much. However, all the positive reviews sold me on the game. I am new to the space sandbox genre, but I have to say this game is designed really well. I am impressed with how nice the game is for a Beta.So far here are a few cons that I noticed:1. Tutorials are too indepth and kind of annoying, but also give so much info at one time it is overwhelming.2. It take a little bit to get used to the controls and menu's3. You are a little lost when you first open the game because the games systems are new, if they have a more detailed tutorial that would help.Over all, I am very happy I purchased this game and look forward to further patches and changes.Highly recommend this game. And What a GREAT DEAL FOR $18! It should cost at least $50			"

								I have been looking for a mission/take your time/no poxy scenario game for a while now and this delivers.  It does, however, take a bit of time to get into the game and used to the control system (I kept shooting at friendlies by clicking the wrong mouse button).  But if you persevere its defintaely worth the wait.  Although still in Beta and without a campaign mode it is worth the money.  This is the first game I've played where you actually feel like other people are aboard your ship helping you - normally its do everything yourself, from steer, to fire to damage control - whereas with SG2 you can do as much or as little as you wish.

								I find this game very impressive, even in the pre-beta phase you could get addicted to SG2. It gives you the opportunity to explore the SG2 universe which is quite vast.  What I expect in the next phase are a good storyline, side quests which do not repeat themselves and better ship designs. If the developers could achieve overcoming these drawbacks, this game may even compete with Eve online.			"

								It took me some time to decide to buy this, after watching recent youtube videos.I have not been dissapointed. The Game mechanics are rock solid. I have not come across gamestopper bugs and the Graphics are running smoth and look very good.Currently there only is freeroam, think privateer/elite, but its already very entertaining to just fly around, get missions, shoot people and do trading. I like it very much already. Also you can customize your ships paintjob.This game gets a thumbs up from me.EDIT 21.07.2014:New stuff was added, raising visual appeal by alot. Also, the modding scene has already started to bring over ships from other franchises, and the game seems to be quite mod friendly.This game will be host to just about any sci fi ship that someone, somewhere, likes.Double thumbs up.

								Great game!  In the tradition of Wing Commander, Starlancer, and Freelancer.  Bought the game since I was stuck at home, sick anyway, and was waiting for Star Citizen to come out.  I'm not going to review this in depth, because most of the existing reviews already cover it.  I'm just agreeing with them.Of course, for the purpose of testing, I cheated and gave myself $999 million credits, but hey... had to test the ships.  It's a great game so far for the price (bought it on sale).  Can't wait to see what the full story game plays out as.  Minor bugs here and there.  Not a real deal breaker.  Would definitely recommend for any space flight sim and RPG fan.			"

								OK, so the game is great. Looks great, sounds great, fun to play, everything about it is awesome.EXCEPT that it's Beta, like really Beta. While it's a fun as hell game to play it crashes pretty consistently every 30 minutes or so. It has done this to me so many times that while I have 11 hours on record with steam I have only actually progressed through the game for 6.5, so just over half. The main reason for this huge loss of time has to do with the save system. It's pretty stupid: you can only save while docked, and (right now at least) you loose those missions (not failed, you loose access to those missions as if they never existed) so every time the game crahes before I can save I loose whatever time I invested into the game.So consider this game in an update or two. Or play at your own risk. Granted right now there is no story so you're really loosing free play, which is no real big deal.			"

								Right now the only thing implemented is a free roam sandbox. Plenty of missions to run, things to see, and fun to be had. Flying and controling your ship takes 10-15 min to get fully used to - but once you do the game really opens up and grabs you. If your wondering if you should buy the game I would tell you to go for it - if you like space games. I have not run into any bugs yet and am really happy with how the game plays right now. Early Access can be a bit of a minefield sometimes, thankfully SG2 is pretty damn solid as it currently stands. I am happy with my purchase.			"

								Takes a little getting used to in the very early stages and it is a pre-release game. The devs seem to be very involved however and what's in the game right now is very fun. I love being able to fly around a giant galaxy taking little side missions (only missions in the game right now) and blasting enemy ships out of the sky. I ended up moding the save file to give myself some more money to buy a better ship and some weapons but only did so to see how the game progression was. Lots of ships to collect and fly around in and the gameplay is actually kind of addicting.			"

												At first I thought this game sucked but the more I play it the more fun it is. It reminds me a lot of freespace 2 which is a great thing because that game rocked! However if your looking for a dogfight space sim then this isnt it. You get to fly huge ships which are more like gigantic gun boats. The voice acting is terible but dont let that put you off as the core gameplay is solid. I wish these guys had more money to spend on the game and add better social comms like the old wing commander 4. The game does feel lifeless sometimes as you do't really commincate with anyone, be it friendlies enemies or neutrals. So far this game has sucked up 11 hours of my life and I'm sure many hours to follow.  Hint: Leave your joystick unplugged, you won't need it. This games designed for mouse and keyboard and works well with it.Overall 7/10			"

												This game really scratches the Freelancer itch.  It's fairly easy to pick up, although I wish it had a better tutorial.  One of the early main campaign missions tells you to do something, but did not explain how to actually do it.  After stumbling my way through that it's been fairly smooth sailing. It's fairly easy to make cash, and the missions are fairly fun.  I did have a couple of crashes, but they were few and far between.  The autosave system when you land somewhere works well, and ensures that even if you do crash, you don't lose much progress.Overall, I'm really enjoying this game, and it was worth picking up.			"

												Pros: Plays like Freelancer, in that you trade, kill, or quest to buy better ships and weapons - except if you are patient enough, you can get from one end to the other on engines alone.That is, of course, assuming that you do not encounter any enemies or anomalies along the way that will screw you over.Cons: The voice acting is laughably horrible and the lines themselves are poorly written. It's like a B-/C+ grade movie. Not to mention the typos, the faulty delete button which doesn't work, and the ""Active Only"" filter which, again, doesn't work.Bottom Line: Get it anyway. The dialogue and voice acting is, ultimately, a minor issue.			"

												Game is very good for awhile, nice amount of things to do. Great controls, upgrades, options and visuals.But eventually, it's not the repetition of missions that grows old, it's the feeling that nothing around you changes, you can't own anything, build anything, destroy anything, push enemies back. So eventually becomes very stagnant. I totally get the dynamic stuff would be hard to implement, but then perhaps an easier way to liven things up is to throw in some random stuff like starports getting blown up (then coming back online after repairs), or certain races getting push back into the fringes or something. You can basically just settle into trading and fighting between two starports and essentially, aside from the background visuals not being different than another area... that.. is all the game becomes.  It's too bad because it has great potential and I admitedltly spent hours upon hours playing this game (65 I think). But I hit a point where the after reaching the 4 edges of the map, there was simply nothing else to do but even that is not bad, it's the feeling that nothing you do has any effect. Even trading seems to have no effect on prices or anything from what I can tell. I totally recommend it. But with the caveat that you too may hit this point where it just stops being interesting.

												This space simulation starts off a little slow but is a lot of fun once you get up and running. Think of it as a simplified version of the X series.  There seems to be a lot of things that aren't quite finished or shallow, but the developers have been quite activate in adding new content so far.  At this time, theres enough content to get about 25-35 hours worth out of this title at a minimum. Its very sandbox-y with an average story thrown on top.  The storyline itself was interesting, but the voice acting was pretty awful.  All in all, I'd recommend it only if you are into space sim games.			"

												I'll cover the game, but first I need to talk about the developers.This game is helmed by the best company/team I've ever encountered in a long time. They work & worked very hard on this SG2 which was even a joy to play incomplete in the earlier betas - constantly (like to the point of how do you get any work done?) reading, replying, and participating in forum discussions. They entertain ideas for how to approach planned features & possiblities of integrating new ones. This game is far from done in their eyes, and we are all excited to see how SG2 evolves over the long run.Oh yeah, the game: The graphics are awesome. The difficulty is varied enough to appeal to everyone (I'm in the extreme club, and find it quite challenging at times). You feel the constant itch to explore as available ship components, slot enhancements, crew officers, mercenaries, and new ship models differ between areas - and buying a ship direct from the manufacturer is cheaper than buying 3rd party from a different faction.Don't want to or can't buy a ship (because that faction hates you)? Grind rep and switch sides, or just board and capture the ship for yourself. Want to mine asteroid fields? You can do that. Want to capture ships and sell them for millions? You can do that too. Want to hunt down obsure achievements? They're here.And this game is only going to get better.Positive+ Awesome community+ Gameplay rewarding proper piloting+ Mod support (check out sound, graphics, and UI mods)+ Craftable rare drops (blueprints) that feel as good in use as they are frustrating to get+ Power management+ Huge map+ Wormholes!+ Great music+ Interesting campaign storylineNeutral+/- Slow start - it's very hard to begin classing up in ships, especially for new players. There are guides, but there is a bit of a grind. I like the payoff feeling from earning your way. Others will just go get a mod that gives them 1 billion credits. I suggest learning.Negative- Voice acting (there is a mod that improves a bit).- Illegal goods priced roughly equivalent to expensive legal goods.- Trade market prices could be more varied for better profits.- Few factors past pool numbers for shields and hulls.- Unrealistic aggro (2 gunships will ""think"" they can take on your dreadnought and rip you out of cruise speed).

												This game is super fun; I like Star Trek, Firefly, Cowboy Bebop, etc. and when I'm in that mood SG2 in perfect. Every time I resume my game the first thought I have is that this is a great, immersive game. It's really frustrating to see negative reviews because I love this game so much. The developers continue working on it and it keeps getting better which is really saying something since I loved it at early access. recommend for any sci-fi fan that wants a single player open world experience with a ton of ways to play. It's viable to be a miner and buy ships and outfit them just for that. I personally spent several fun hours just doing that, it was great. You can buy and upgrade ships just for smuggle or escort or freelancing. People complain about the expense of ships versus reward of missions; these people simply don't get it. There are lots of ways to build your bank roll and the time and effort it takes make the game more rewarding and immersive. The balance makes it so much better as you progress, you can't just jump from the first ship to the most powerful ship or even the most powerful weapons right away, and that is good. You actually get to enjoy and explore each level of progress , as you get a new ship, or a new upgrade and you slowly work toward that next purchase. All the while playing however you want, avoiding combat in favor of mining and trade which is super fun, figuring out how to avoid destruction or detection while making the kesel run in under 3 parsecs. Or you can be a pirate, good or bad, hijacking ships with a ship optimized just for that sort of activity. So good. So highly recommended.			"

												When i first tryed this game it didn't have a story mode it just had the sandbox mode, now i have been playing the story mode and i like the game, there isn't a lot of games i will play for hours on end without a story mode. The story in the game isn't the best but it gives you the out line and everything and you can do the story mission on your own time and do other things you want to do like trading of killing or capturing ships and than selling the ships or put them in your port, Mining or gas mining or side missions or a lot of little missions from different companys. The controls are supper easy for me at less i use the mouse 90% of the time. i have taking some pictures of the game. When you start off save your money for your first few ships is hard to do but its fun to do. As it sits at 32.4 hours in the game i have almost 50mil saved.

												This is a great although somewhat simple game at times, if u like space games and flying in spacecraft, this is really worth a try, and seeing as they are still expanding the game i think it will become more fun. the downside to it is, i have no idea how iam gonna get 24 million together for that awesome carrier ship without getting bored by freelance missions, but then again, i havent trying capturing ships yet or finished all the story missions or side missions, as they give big money rewards. and iam only still flying my second ship, the myrmidon frigate. not to go off the topic, i give this game an 8/10 its really worth its cash and ill be playing it for alot more, probably gonna get the dlc aswell.happy spacefaring y'all!

												If you enjoyed Freelancer, you'll love this. Many similar mechanics, with great ship customization. Maneuvering in space to get the best angles during a fight are fantastic, and managing your troops and ship's abilities and shields make every fight unique and fun.The story mode has bad writing and worse voice acting as well as being quite linear, so I'm mostly using it just for the experience to get bigger and better ships.The most frustrating bit of the game are the crashes. I've yet to have a single play session which didn't crash on me aty least 3 times. You'll be in the middle of a huge fight, and the game will suddenly die. The best thing the Devs did was implement auto save whenever you visit a space station or planet. But if you get in a middle of a big fight out in space and suddenly the game locks up, God help you.-- Edit: I wrote this mini-review/opinion piece a while ago, and the game is far, far, far more stable. Over the time since it was written, the Development team have been awesome in their implementation of not only new features, but bug fixes. The aforementioned random crashes are gone. Thoroughly enjoy this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Holy ♥♥♥♥.  Ok this game is going to be very good when it's done but at the moment it is completely unplayable.  I have a very good P.C with 12gb of RAM that runs everything else I have at maximum settings with no problem.  When I first downloaded and started the game it was working reasonably well with only the slightest lag when I approached different bases and planets.  As soon as I started getting into battles with other ships the frame rate dropped down to what I swear must have been 2fps!  Frequently it would just freeze for 5 or 10 seconds straight before moving again!  I of course decided to reduce all of my graphic settings down to minimum in the hopes of speeding up the frames.  It made no difference at all!  Maybe not everyone is having this same problem but trust me my P.C should be more than adequate to run this!Besides this though the game is visually very cool and the combat is enjoyable.  They're doing a lot of things right I just wish I was able to actually play it properly right now.(update): After starting the game again today it has been working much better for the time being.  Something strange did happen however.  I suddenly had an extra 5 million credits when I had only had about $9000 when I had quit previously.  Furthermore I didn't even make 5 million credits in my first 2 hours of gameplay.  It was certainly a welcome glitch but I don't think that was intentional.  I have changed my review to a thumbs up as the only problem I previously had with the game at all was the performance issue and hopefully that only occured because it was my first time playing the game after installation.

												Game is very good for awhile, nice amount of things to do. Great controls, upgrades, options and visuals.But eventually, it's not the repetition of missions that grows old, it's the feeling that nothing around you changes, you can't own anything, build anything, destroy anything, push enemies back. So eventually becomes very stagnant. I totally get the dynamic stuff would be hard to implement, but then perhaps an easier way to liven things up is to throw in some random stuff like starports getting blown up (then coming back online after repairs), or certain races getting push back into the fringes or something. You can basically just settle into trading and fighting between two starports and essentially, aside from the background visuals not being different than another area... that.. is all the game becomes.  It's too bad because it has great potential and I admitedltly spent hours upon hours playing this game (65 I think). But I hit a point where the after reaching the 4 edges of the map, there was simply nothing else to do but even that is not bad, it's the feeling that nothing you do has any effect. Even trading seems to have no effect on prices or anything from what I can tell. I totally recommend it. But with the caveat that you too may hit this point where it just stops being interesting.

												If you are into sims (as in simulating [duh] or role playing) this is a great space game. It is - as far as I can tell at this point - single player only and it reminds me of EVE from CCP but more beginner-friendly, although still not easy.If you dislike grinding, abort immediately. You'll grind A LOT. I find it worth, the ambiente is amazing, the somewhat small storyline is interesting (if you read and listen) but the action you take is repetitive. I read a lot about bugs, but have not encountered any yet (~29h). Every item has a nice description that is not generic, for example for the solar panels it says that they ""are an important part in Gemini due to the dual star system"" or similar.Workshop is available, you can get your Star Wars or StarTrek sounds, ships etc.__e.: My savegame was corrupted (after loading into the save a mission I wanted to accept was invisible), I do not know what happened, but the guys at LGM looked at the savegame and repaired it! That is some awesome dedication. Great game by great people!			"

												I had fun tooling in this game.  It's got a good sense of progression, and it's not exactly lacking in depth or scope. One complaint is that it's not as polished as it could be.  Released in 2014, you can tell a lot of great art and design work was put into this game but it's already starting to show it's age.  I personally compare it to a game like Elite Dangerous, which has a high amount of finish and looks great, but is ultimately a very boring game which lacks depth and has a very frustratingingly long grinding progression. Starpoint Gemini on the other hand, has better pacing.  While it may not be as technically complex or broad in scale, it's a good break as a single player game.			"

												The game has come a LONG way since my initital review, so time to update the thing. 1. The developers are awesome. 2. This game, in early days, was a fun amusement. With their improvements as time has gone on, it has lived up to its potential. This game is now king of the hill in its genre, as far as I'm concerned.3. At the time of this writing, developers are still improving and enhancing the game. 4. A number of game files (such as savegames) are in human-readable formats, making fixes (like if you screwed up a mod) or various changes suprrisngly doable if you want to go beyond the game's core gameplay.5. The game is beautifully made, graphically speaking. Voice acting is still getting all the lines filled out as far as I can tell, and some characters have better voices than others, and not all are voiced, but it's good for the most part.6. Why are you still reading this review, BUY THE GAME ALREADY!			"

												Great space exploration game, the storyline is enjoyable but not extremely content packed and not very interesting. The best part of the game is really exploring the very large map and choosing your own path, you can be whoever you want to be in a vast variety of ships and missions in different regions on the map.I have also had a lot of fun customizing my ship, whether that be the colors of the ship, or the weaponry on board, to the name of the ship (The SwagginWaggin)... I have also enjoyed aligning myself with the various factions, there seem to be at least 30-40 of them.Pro's --> Great space exploration game, complex enough to make it enjoyable for more experienced gamers but also doesn't have a huge learning curve.Con's --> Storyline is pretty weak and the quests and farming for gold can get a little repetitive if you don't enjoy the exploration aspect too much.7/10			"

												This is a really good space game.The game offers various control methods to let you fly your ship like a pilot/dogfighter or play more of a commander role using turret view. At first it takes a while to get used to the controls and fight effectively with a style you like but once you play out a few battles out you will find a control style that suits you and probably end up switching between them depending on the situation and the ship you are using.The graphics and interface are really nice and the game runs very well on my medium system which is an AMD APU with integrated graphics.The sound effects are good but some cool warp like sound effect for the t-drive would be nice. The music is very good although perhaps some more variety would be nice especially for the battle music. The story and voice acting is probably the weakest part of the game but the game offers plenty of freedom to explore space and play how you want to. So you can play like a pirate or a trader, mine or do missions etc. There's plenty to do and it's all fun.The game has a nice rpg element which means you can upgrade your skills for when you are in battle and upgrade perks for various different effects like trading bonuses or ship capture bonuses etc. You can customise your ships weapons and buy bigger and better guns and ships as you progress through the ranks and acquire more credits. Overall I would recommend getting this game, especially if you are into space games.			"

												This is a great space combat game, with RPG elements.  Cruising through space, capturing ships, looting and upgrading is a lot of fun.  There are not too many games in this genre. They all seeml to be too old, too complex or they require subscriptions.  Starpoint Gemini 2 is a winner. Short comments on the game:- It is more arcade than simualtion. - The story is not bad, but the presentation is very weak. - At times the voice acting is rediculously bad-  Dont worry about the story becuase the gameplay is engaging and addictive- The graphics are great, minus a few hiccups here and there- Would take about 30-40 hours to play through campaign- Lots to do in this game. DLC is also available and the devs love to support this game- Stop and take a screen capture! F11 will hide all the HUDs so your screen capture comes out like a Carl Sagan wet dream. - The trading and mining is weak, but the value and money making is in capturing enemy ships and selling them and their cargo. Its 5x better than running materials from one side of the map to the other to make money.- There are some great video tutorials on youtube that can jumpstart your ship capturing / pirating skils .  Search: ""Tensiaka"" on youtube for valuable ship cap[turing and combat tutorials,. They helped me a lot. Make a few million in your first couple hrs ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Despite a few flaws, the gameplay, ship options and open world win out.

												I am loving this game - it feels like a mashup of X3, Elite and  a couple of other games.Your starter ship is good mix of everything, good size cargo bay, two weapon points (light - railguns, heavy missiles).  upgrading it is expensive so take care of it.You earn money by trading, completing missions, mining.  You can also try pirating, though this doesn't suit my game play.The universe is a series of hex's that you fly across normally.  Alternatively, their are gateways between locations that require jump drives, worm holes that require increased health (haven't managed to get through one yet) and rift lines, which accelerate your speed whilst you are in the rift.  The subtle difference between worm hole and rift - I think - is that you are exposed to enemy fire in the rift, but not in the wormhole.There is a story (and with the DLC, a second one), but often you will find yourself doing ""things"".  I targeted a level 2 pirate and thought it would be easy, but he called for help, deciding to avoid the agro, I pushed the engines to max, turned and flew through a rift and ended up in the middle of an uncharted system, alive, but with a battered ship.It is a slow paced game - so far at least - but you have to learn that your ship is NOT a fighter, but a small frigate with a crew and gimballed turrets which you can either fire, or have the crew fire.  Later you can buy carrier vessels or cloaked vessels.  You can also command some sort of fleet (hiring mercenaries to accompany you).Like I say, I am loving this.			"

												This game could be so great. A real worthy successor for the likes of Freelancer and Privateer but it has so many flaws that it is very close to not being recommendable...I still recommend it though for those in urgent need of a space sim who don’t like Elite: Dangerous and can’t wait for Star Citizen since chances are good that you still will get lost in the vicious circle of just one more mission to be one step closer to the next upgrade/weapon/ship.Let’s start with the good things:I really like the music…ok… that’s not all, there is so much to see and do in this game, too. The galaxy is huge and there are many (unique) space stations and planets to visit, missions to do, artifacts/blueprints to track down and especially ships to destroy, buy or capture. Yes, you can capture enemy ships – in theory – that is one part where the design just doesn’t work out so well, more on that later. You also gain experience and level up which will give you skill points and every 5 level a point for perks. Skills feel rather cheap and bad for me. There are 4 active skills (temporary boosts) you can invest your points in, each skill for one of the available weapon systems (railgun, plasma, beam and heavy (missiles)). So you basically decide which is your favorite weapon system and put your skill points into that skill. Perks are passive but also don’t feel that well thought out. Again you can increase the effectiveness of your favorite weapon system up to 3 times and then there are a lot of semi useful perks to invest in. Additionally you get permanent bonuses by getting (steam) achievements (never seen that before in a game...)The actual space simulation needs to get used to, too. I was expecting a feeling like in the old games and even bought a joystick to get the good old times back, but that just doesn’t work out (for me). The shooting is turret based (you have chase cam and no cockpit view anyway), meaning you can see around your ship and you just move the camera freely and aim with your mouse (depending on the turret placement on the ship). Furthermore the hit feedback is so bad that I quickly decided to switch to beam weapons that are instant hit so I know where I aim is what I hit. Railgun and plasma are projectiles flying somewhere in the direction of the enemy and unless you are not fighting a huge freighter close combat you barely see if you hit or not and especially if not why not (ok, it might just need to get used to but beam seems the better solution). Also you can just tell the system to auto fire (that's why there are acurracy stats you can influence, but I want to play the game as space shooter and not strategy game like star wolves so I don't want to use autoaim...)What is really bad and I don’t understand how the design can fail so hard is that you can’t see your enemy information in the hud. Instead the hud is clustered with stupid, bad looking buttons I barely use (which I could easily access by keys). You only see the enemy information when the enemy is in sight and when he is close it is so fast moving that you can barely read it. So what is happening all the time is: There is a bunch of enemies closing in, you see them in the radar, you can target them (via hotkey) but you have either to start flying into their direction (which is a great idea when it turns out that they are deadly) or switch to turret and target mode and move your camera wildly to get them into focus and be able to identify their threat level. Both very inconvenient since you should be able to quickly cycle through all targets and identify them with one glance. Well perhaps I’m missing something, there even is an info hotkey but it won’t work for enemy ships, only for special objects.The other really bad design issue is the character level system. You level up quite fast and the missions you can get (you don’t have to visit stations to get missions, you will get them while in space, which is good) show the suggested level you should have to take that mission. The problem is: the character level does tell ♥♥♥♥ about your actual strength. That only depends on your ship and weaponry. So this indicator is useless in the first place. Coincidentally it is also useless in the second place because there are types of missions that are just no brainers – regardless of which level they show. If you have maintenance or science missions you just fly to the target, repair or inspect it aaand… it’s done. On the other hand, good luck with rescue or capture missions, which are often impossible even on low level. So the balancing is very bad in general but luckily you can cheat your way out most of the time: Early game you just start your engine boosters and outrun every enemy, mid game they sometimes start blocking your boost mode but you can have a ship with cloaking device by then and just turn that on. Later this doesn't work and thats when you get in real trouble…Talking about capturing… first you can’t capture 90% of the enemies because they have a larger crew than you have (capturing works this way: grapple the enemy with a tractor beam, send troops via teleporter to his ship, if you have more than him you possibly take over the ship). You can focus on capturing by searching for a cheap ship which allows a large army of troopers on board and you can get perks or officers (you can hire 3 officers for your ship, by the way, you can also hire merc ships that follow you and certain ships allow to take fighters on board you can launch during combat so you end up having your own fleet) that give a bonus on the capturing chances.Second most of the time there are other ships around. So even when you manage to find a capturable ship chances are high that it will get blown apart by some other ship nearby. So it is a great feature in theory that just is no real fun most of the time but satisfying when it finally works.Other weaknesses I like to mention:The presentation is really bad. The main story has a ridiculous voice over most of the time, sometimes just dialog (not sure if it is a bug that voiceover is not playing because the music gets muted anyway) and sometimes just a text popup – atmosphere = 0.The balancing of the main and some side missions is also a bad joke. You will be stuck for hours until you have enough money for a capable ship and after you finally progress you often get much easier missions afterwards.The menus are confusing and tedious to use. E.g. you can either sell all cargo or one good at the merchant, but if you have more than 1 of a good you always have to go to the next screen to select how much of the good you want to sell (well everything!). And you will do that a lot because the screen shows if you are having good, mediocre or bad prices so you most likely don’t want to sell the goods with bad prices and rather fly to the next station. I think the ship loadout menu is simply bugged. edit: it is not bugged, turret handling is just another unintuive feature. Also when I unmount a rocket launcher I lose my missiles. The good thing is that I can store my ships with their loadout in my garage and can swap them easily depending on the situation (cargo space/troop count/gun power).But the weapon/ship prices balancing could be much better. The next better systems are so expensive that it takes hours until you can afford something new that actually feels more powerful. The upgrade flow was much better/faster in Freelancer.Last but not least there are that most annoying situations where a cutscene triggers in the middle of a fight, you can’t do anything but the fight continues in the background usually resulting in your death or at least a great headstart for your enemies.So there are many occasions in the game where I ask myself: Did the developers actually play what they created?And then I go back to the game desperately hunting for the next better ship…			"

												Pretty good game that has lots of potiental...but...they are moving to a new game altogether.  Not sure if they will add more depth to this game, but if they do, they have a winner.  Easy to get into...nice graphics, and the opening music is outstanding.   Interface is a little odd while docked, but still. Not too bad.I paid full price for it and I regret this...should have been patient and waited for a Steam sale.  If you can get for 50 percent off, recommended...otherwise, I would pass.			"

												If you enjoyed freelancer, you'll enjoy SPG2. It's not Xsomething were you can build an empire, but it's a very awesome space sim, were you fly capital ships and pewpew bad guys. Or 'roids.Pro :-very beautiful-nice music-open world (open space ?)-lots of stuff to do-big ships. Like carriers. I like carriers.-very nice devs, that listen to the community, is very, very active on the steam forum/official forum, and overall nice guys-a free DLC (a very large one). The other DLC is for a fee, but add lots of stuff, and they had a free large free patch alongside it. It's more than fair.-a very nice and helpful community.-may sound stupid, but I don't think I've seen 2 station that looks the same. Everything is unique, and it's awesome. -technically, that's not the game itself (beside planets background), but the artworks are gorgeous.Con :-story is meh-voice acting vary a lot, from good to terrible-RPG part is limited, no hero customization for story mode, no choice and impact in the story whatsoever...-no cockpit view. I don't care much, but for some it's an issue. But then, we are flying capital ship, so I guess the cockpit view would look like star trek or battlestar galactica, IE a bridge.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is an enjoyable Space Sim, and still looks good for its age, but I wouldn't grab it for the $35 price. It's definitely a game to buy on sale though. Some key points:1. This is a combat focused game. Don't bother trying to be a trader; it won't work, and you can't automate the process like in X3.2. Along 1 above, the primary way you can make money in this game is capturing ships. Unless you want to end up outclassed, learn how to use your troopers and grappling beam. 3. The progression through the classes of ships is well balanced; each feels like an improvement, without any of them feeling redundant.4. Each class of ship does feel unique, and the methodology of flying and fighting in a corvette is distinctly different than in a dreadnought.5. The different models of ships in each class are also rather distinct from one another, and will play well with different tactics. For instance, one ship may have great overlapping fire arcs between the side and front turrets, but have hardly any coverage on the top bottom and the back, while another will offer ballanced coverage over the whole ship, but can't offer the same forward punch.5. Ye gods, the voice acting is TERRIBLE, and the plot is a throw away at best. This wasn't a big issue for me, as the game is mostly free-roam.			"

Early Access Review
								IN GAME THE MOUSE WILL NOT MOVE ONTO THE LOWER PORTION OF THE SCREEN. Then I restarted the game, and it looks, like the active-x and direct-x files had to syncronise correctly, which they did, after the second startup. Now it works pretty good, but this is a beta game, and that is why some of the graphics enhancements do not detect as usable, like reflections and shadows, could not be used, but my 2 gig NVIDIA 660 definately has those abilities.Ok that said... Listen up. This game has real potential, because its very open to modding, so it could getvery incredible. There are allready a good number of mods on steam for it, and it's just in BETA...Plus you can use HOTAS joystick to control things. I'm guessing that everything may just end up with beautiful cockpits too for every type of ship.  So get in there and mod and use wordpad !			"

One of the best space games that I've played so far. I have to recommend it also because of the Devs support they are very helpful and will try everything to make your game work properly. I could only run the game because of their patience and support. Very cool game!			"

												This is a great game with only some minor annoyances here and there. The freeroam aspect is awesome and the ability to break away from whatever you are doing to pursue an enemy, deliver some goods, or just mess around compares to games like the X series. Every ship in the game is flyable and upgradable, and the gameplay is heavily impacted by an RPG skillset and perks that you earn by leveling up. Between the great DLC (both free and paid) and the countless workshop mods, Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game you can easily sink many hours into. Definiately recommended.			"

												I would reccomend this alot. Its not X3 before people start to compare, i would actually compare it to Freelancer for those that have played that gem back in the day. Alot of different ships, combat can be quite hard at times if you havent prepared first.Devs are also more active than most, creating more and more different storylines for free. One of few developers going from early access to release that actually fullfill their promises although StarDrive is a different story for many.I would reccomend it for those of you that need a game to pass time with or just have a blast.

The things to do in this game are many, there is a good story, expanded recently, and there are lots of missions generated automatically, there are lots of ships to purchase all upgradeable.

												Amazingly fun early game.Decent middle game.Slow endgame.And I mean slow. Literally. The final ships are next to stationary in combat, and the lack of variety of options in combat makes this quite boring.  As you can only aim a fraction of your turrets at once you're left to turn on auto turrets with large ships which automatically takes care of firing all turrets so you have all your guns firing and just kind of sit there and occasionally use an ability if you need to kill a bit faster.I can still happily recommend this game based on the great early and midgame that's highly reminiscent of Freelancer, but the endgame is poorly balanced and not particularly fun.

												This game a is a tough one to decide. It really isn't a game that I can sit and dump 8 hours into daily like some of the other games I've played, but it is fun to come back to it every once in a while and get my ""freelancer"" fix for the week. I personally found this game to be pretty fun when in sandbox/exploration mode. Story mode on the other hand.. was poorly completed, I believe I spent about 20 minutes in, and dumped it due to the appalling voice acting and poorly scripted story.  Now for sandbox I loved flying around blasting and capturing ships to sell at the local stations. I loved upgrading my ship from the inventories of captured  ships. I'm always looking for the shield or weapon improvment. I loved exploring the map and seeing all the cool spacial anomalies. UnfortunateIy, though I did find some general weaknesses in the way content is utilized in the game, there are only a handful of side mission types such as capture ship A, Destroy ship B, or Haul element C these side missions do get old pretty quickly and is a main reason why I cannot dump countless hours into the game in one sitting. Sometimes I also receive missions I have no way in hell of completing, the AI levels way faster than I do... I'll be level 4 with missions that are level 12 around the beginning area. It's ok as you can just drop the mission, but is kinda annoying all the same. Overall, I find the game to be pretty engaging when played casually, but any longer than a couple of hours and I'm ready for something else. I've been looking at Elite: Dangerous but it looks like a tremendous amount of tedious work to play, just from peoples reviews, that and it's much more expensive.To the developer: I really hope you guys haven't given up on this game now that it's considered ""Complete"" there is still a tremendous amount of possibilities with it, and I would love to see more content(More engaging space stations, etc.) Thanks a ton for creating a game that allows me to get my space sim fix when I feel the urge.

												Bad game! Horribly frustrating, has some good points, but overall its a very bad game.The main thing, the fighting - it sucks, 99% of the time you have to turn on auto shooting, because you can't find on the screen enemies, they just keep flying outside of your view all the time, and it doesnt matter if it is a destroyer and you are flying with corvette it still jumps around you like if it was a small fly.   As for different ship types, they all behave the same way, you don't feel any difference between piloting small ship or huge one, it looks almost the same and moves the same way.As for trade, colors of prices are cool, but otherwise trade is tedious and just a waste of time, especially that you start a game with a tiny ship, you could get better cash form mining, but it still is insignificant.You can get huge rewards for capturng ships and doing it is the most fun feature of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game... the storyline is also interesting, it kept me into the game for some time, until finally i had enought of other flaws and deleted it.You shouldn't go into long travels/explorations, save as often as you can because game like to punish you for no reason... you fly, fly, fly, die... just like that, no attack, no hazard, you just suddenly see your ship explode. Or you fly, fly, fly, game crash.... ;DOr if you want to use speed booster to get quickly to new area... the game crashes almost every time you use this item.During fights, you can read target info only when it is on the screen so it makes it quite problematic since as i said they always stay outside of your FOV.I should also mention that it has horrible localization, had to switch to English as in my native language it was horrible.And one last thing, the RPG elements... its a bad joke, not worth mentioning.

												I'm sorry, I've tried getting into this game, but I can't.  I've tried several times throughout the last year or so.Mainly it's two things.1)  There is no tutorial.  Its idea of a tutorial is to give up to 5-6 dialog boxes at a time of what things do.  It's a bit of overload (""MORE? Come ON!"").  It should walk you things slowly, like a proper tutorial.2)  Gamepad mapping.  It has partial support, and it seems to work... but the tutorial doesn't tell you what the buttons do.  It says ""To move up, press JOYSTICKUPXO"", to look down press ""JOYSTICKDOWNXO"".  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Doesn't tell you what the gamepad buttons do or the triggers.  If they have gamepad support, just make it work or say no.  I play from my couch so I'm not about to play using keyboard/mouse.It seemed OK, voice acting is super campy in the typical space game kind of way.  I just coudln't get to the Planet in the first few minutes of the tutorial.  Sorry guys.			"

												I purchased this game almost immediately during early access because I had been wanting to play a good space sim for quite a long time. It is a vast improvement over the previous title in the series and successfully creates a fun space sim experience with some rpg progression for your character. Initially after release the game was somewhat buggy, but the developers have ironed out the rough edges and even successfully adapted most of the user interface for gamepad control. Thus far I have spent most of my time in the sandbox mode, but I have recently begun the story playthrough. Both modes are fun to play with the story mode featuring a rather standard, but competently-executed space sim plot. Best of all is that steam workshop is available for the game and there have been many great mods that improve aspects of the gameplay as well as those that create custom content. There is a good diversity of ships and weaponry in the game, with ship types ranging from small gunships and shuttle craft up to battleship size vessels available to be purchased. You can also hire officers who confer stat bonuses and other ships piloted by mercenaries to join you. There are numerous ways to make money including a robust trading economy, asteroids to mine, spatial phenomena to explore, odd jobs to be done, transport/taxi missions, and of course bounty hunter missions.Combat is satisfying, though you certainly feel like more of a ship commander than a pilot. This is probably due to the game's third person perspective which suits the game well because most of the ships you will use are more like capital ships than fighters. To sum it up, this is one of the best single player space sim/rpg's to come out in a very long time. In some ways I enjoy this game more than Elite: Dangerous.			"

												I liked the game so far, but I play a lot. I am an avid player of sci fi games, medieval, simulation battle and strategy. I play games so much I do not have any other form of life except work and games. I do stay in shape as I work out a lot. I can practically tell you exactly how to make a good game and it will be a #1 top seller, I have even made games myself constucting whole citys and governments with plots and story lines along with political agendas on governments and war. This Starpoint Gemini is very promising and is a good game. Couple of pointers to the developers, you should have ships hunt you down as if looking for you and then take off before being destoyed. Somone you can recognize that you have seen before but make some what elusive so he/she can come back again to hunt you from a jurisdiction you are not welcomed of course, but this should be once in great while not an everytime thing. Another thing is that when you get high level in the game all you see is big hard ships all the time, almost no small ones. In the begining you would see them a lot. I am level 80 and it does not seem to be going any highier(no complaints). But sometimes you exit from a station or a star gate and you are jumped by a horde of big ships just out of the blue(c'mon a little ridiculouse at times)it happens often and half the time you dont stand a chance unless you have big hired mercenarys that are expensive to maintain, which does take a big toll on the money you make. Sometimes you fall behind unless you really try to keep up the hustle and bustle of making money, then its more stress instead of pure enjoyment to try and keep good powerfull mercenarys at youre side. You should fan it out more to where at least 50% of the time there are still smaller groups of ships, or one or two important people(hunters) that show up to hunt you like I said previously, Instaed of being mobbed by a lot of big powerfull ships all the time. There still needs to be smaller ships around of all sizes. All I see now are big ships everywhere and almost no small ones traversing through space or hanging out at space stations. Its almost as if everybodys super rich now and got dreadnaughts and carriers becouse I am level 80 now. You need to tone that down to be more normal. If you did that the game would excell in greatness, otherwise that is a major downfall. But I do see it getting bigger more powerfull ships to attack you as you are highier in level that makes sense, but overall it needs to be re-worked to how i mentioned previously, thank you...... Several hours later on re-editing, I am now back to write what I said. There is more randomness, I guess i was just to fast to express at 80th level. I went back in different parts of the galaxy, it does get heavy at times and then again light on battles just depends. Also what i like is there are also missions you can take that can be much lower than youre level and also much highier. There still needs to  be ones that hunt you down and occasionally escape to come back another time but with a name to them you can recognize. May i also add i have not played the story line yet and am looking forward to it, its just in the free roam you can choose other characters instead of bieng stuck with the same story line one. Overall its all good and was very enjoyable playing. Would be nice to have another dozen songs in the game, the music is similar to eve music which I liked a lot when I played eve back in 2009.			"

												I loved freelancer and this game has that feel to it. You can even capture ships and sale them which quickly becomes the best way to make money. However a few things that I dislike in base game (though since you can mod it heavily some things can be fixed), the way ship levels are done and strength of weapons allowed on ships bothered me as a lot of money spent for so little gained. I felt like (without mods) that upgrading my ship to a much more expensive version often didn't gain any DPS. I wound up using a lot of modding to make this flow better for me.			"

												Well so far after 14 hour i must say it a great game. what i can tell is that could be a bit more uppdates like : The Turial is all reading but could be easier if they give a short intro in a video and make you try it self (Fighting, bording and much more). It took me several hours before i really understand how to do the basic stuff like bording and easier way to lvl up with good money. This game reminds me of Galaxy on Fire 2 but its much more bigger galaxy and more hours of play time :) only thing i miss its the mining. In this game you only have to shoot the asteroids to collect the Minerals			"

The storyline aint the grandest or most unique experience, but the gameplay and space combat is engaging and fun. The pilot skill progression and the upgrading to better ships provides a compelling reason to keep blasting away.I say, if you enjoyed freelancer, give this a crack.			"

												I'll go on to say that if you enjoyed Freespace 2 or similar space themed games then you will find yourself immersed in this game. I will also add that the game requires a decent PC for the optimal smooth gameplay experience. In Starpoint Gemini 2 you get to upgrade and purchase ships as well as level up your character. There is a story ark mode available and freeroam option where you can try and emulate a raider, trader, mercenary and more. Combat in this game is extremely satisfying and blowing up combatant ships nearly never gets old. Even though this game is slated as a finished product the developers are still adding in more functions to add to the replayability and longevity of the base game. Plus all those Steam Workshop mods add to the overall experience if you want to mix things up a tad. Overall I rate this game a 7.8/10.			"

												Poor mans X Universe game. Here is how you defeat every ship that attacks you: Come to a complete stop, (because the space fighting is a joke and he enemy ships will stop with you) then because the targeting system is non existent, turn on auto fire, then spin 360 degrees spamming your heavy weapons. It may be a space game but everything is on a 2D plane. this may not sound bad, but fighting in space NEEDS three dimenshions. Every single ship in the game plays the same. Bigger ones just have more hitpoints, turrets, and hangars. And they still suck. If you want a true space fighter sim, get any ""X"" game. Except ""Rebirth"" ♥♥♥♥ that game.			"

												I was out of the genre for a couple of years, and still believe freelancer holds the title of king. While this games tries really hard to copy from freelancer (the ui looks like it was copied straight from 2003) the game doesn't flow.I have a modern GPU and a fast system, but the engine just doesn't seem responsive. In freelancer I felt like I nimble ship that responds to my every movement, Startpoint feels like I'm piloting a space oil tanker. Single player made unbarable by the voice acting and the incoherent script.  I still remember large parts of the freelancer plot back from over 12 years ago, here: I can't tell you what I did 5 minutes ago. I don't remember the characters name, don't care about his stupid quest, I just remember it's something really pointless and stupid.Don't buy this game. I can't think of anyone who it'll appeal to. Maybe Elite is better (didn't try), maybe no man's sky will live up, but there's absolutly no potential in this game, it's a waste of money and time.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but the texts everywhere are too small, hard to read, and so reading through the tutorial was a chore. The campaign was boring, but the Freeroam mode just leaves you out in the open. Quests you get are too straightforward, not even giving you a small background on why you have to put down a ship, it just appears on your starchart and you'd be free to grab it if you want. Ultimately, the voice acting is very bad, which was really off-putting. I was looking for an experience similar to Sid Meier's Pirates! and Mount and Blade: Warband, but I sadly didn't get that here.			"

												There's quite a few things to like in this space trading/shooter game. The developers have managed to infuse a fair bit of live into this one, and it does have some pretty neat game mechanics. The best way of defining it is as a crossover of Freelancer and Starfleet Command, even if I find SPG 2 to be neatly an inferior game to both. Compared with Freelancer, this title hasn't delivered for me the same degree of immersion and engagement with the storyline and the universe that I remember of playing Freelancer. Compared to the second, the tactical combat in this game to be flawed in some departments and shallower, even if there are some cool ideas in here.The stuff I like Even if we're restricted to one single system, there's indeed a lot of places to go and things to see. This is a *big* game. Trading and mining are actually viable professions, not just an side to mercenary or piratical activities. There's lots of ships, and lots of modules to fit your ships with.  Combat is engaging, and fun, at least for some time. I do like very much the ""ammo-based"" modules (scavenger drones, mining torpedoes, etc.). These modules can be swapped in flight - which might detract from a plausibility point of view, but I personally don't mind it much - and you can actually feel like having a purpose (they're quite useful actually). The game is highly moddable.The stuff that leaves me indifferent or I am not very impressed by While there's a great variety of weapons, I find that rather than having 5 varieties of the same thing with slightly tweaks to range, damage, power drain, etc. it would have made sense to have just one type and increase the ""rigging possibilities"". Per-module rigging is in  the game, but you can just add one type of rig to one specific module. You can recruit crew, but this crew is reduced to specific buffs to your ship (weapon accuracy, speed, etc.). They level out, and do provide with an extra layer of ship customization. But sometimes the bonuses are so specific that one wonders why are you paying religiously salaries on a monthly basis. There's no enemy leveling - that is, if you go to certain places you may find yourself vastly overmatched by NPC ships. Knowing when to engage and when to fly is an important skill to develop. The problem comes when these ""hero"" NPCs basically can appear anywhere and the information that allows you to assess whether or not you're outclassed is only visible if you keep it in your sights. Which can be quite difficult. The combat skills system looks good, but very much as with the crew, lacks some depth (and you also wonder why you should bother with those skills).The stuff I plainly don't like The HUD is functional, but I would have really liked that I could have waypoints (that is, locking on locations) and targets (that is, locking on ships and stations) at the same time. Currently, you either have a waypoint or a target. Even worse is that the waypoint/target data is only visible if you have your bow pointed towards the object you locked on. That makes stuff like checking on nearby hostile ships while travelling towards your destination disorienting or just plainly dangerous (since you will close onto these enemies). The world is very much structured like that of Privateer/Freelancer, but crammed into one single star system. What was plausible in those games, here feels a bit uncomfortably contrived. Even if the world is big, I didn't get that ""to boldly go where nobody has before"" kind of vibe that you get in Elite Dangerous or Evochron Mercenary, for instance. I find the main storyline to be completely uninteresting, and delivered in a very unappealing way.It's a cheap game, indeed, but since I haven't enjoyed it much, I can't really recommend it to anyone.

												It is interesting but fairly basic compared to other spaceship exploration type of games.  The combat is very fast and takes some of the nuance out of the skills.  The UI is clunky and ship movement isn't very intuitive.  Trading is simpliofied but won't really make you much money. Just doing the same 4 types of missions will net you the bulk of your income and experience.  But I would have still have left a positive review if it weren't for the frequent crashes.  These crashes aren't just the game, they often freeze up my system in a way I haven't experienced in years.In researching this problem one comes across many attempted solutions (which I tried many) from others and then dev posts that point to it being a problem with Windows 10, and that they do not and will not support this game under Windows 10.  Also read from the dev posts that ""this game is 2 years old"" so they are not focused on supporting it further.  So, buyer beware.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is easily the best space adventure game available!  Little Green Men Games did a superb job in incorporating those features that make a space exploration game enjoyable while avoiding anything that would be dull.There is a main-story quest line to keep you engaged with multiple side quests to mix things up.  Space travel feels exciting and scenic without taking years in between events (with added wormholes to speed things up a little more).  There are space pirates, some dangerous while others are targets of opportunity for some quick cash, especially if you capture their ship to sell to a nearby friendly space station.There seems to be just the right number of ship and weapon variety to not get overwhelmed while still feeling like you have a choice in weapon loadout and ship type.  There are even some that you acquire through quest lines or obtaining blueprints for exceptional weapon types, including torpedoes, plasma cannons, railguns, etc.Lots of Steam achievements, beautiful scenery, fantastic spacestation design.

												This game is more fun than I thought it would be... the plot (although kinda shallow on the side quests) is entertaining.The thing I find most enjoyable is that you can play it as a first-person space dogfighting game, or you can use the fire at will feature and just fly the ship while the computer does the shooting. Trading seems to be a waste of time at least early on up to where I'm at same for mining although its a little more lucrative. The gameplay is pretty addictive and you have to really grind pretty hard to earn enough money to build a decent ship - unless you use the cheats, which would probably instantly ruin the game completely.Definitely worth the couple bucks I spent on it, I probably wouldn't pay retail for it. However I'm a cheapskate in general so that statement holds true for me with pretty much anything.			"

								Only been playing Early Access Beta a few hours and so far I'm really enjoying it,Bit of a space sim fan in general…This reminds me some of Freelancer and EVE online.Beta access is “freeroam”, I’ve found that it is fairly easy to pick up the basics but takes a while to get proficient, there is some real depth here and I’ve only scratched the surface.First impressions, this game is looking great! Can only imagine how good it could be if it supported a multiplayer PU and had an optional cockpit/bridge view.To early to call yet, but this game shows so much potential I think I can rate it in my top 5 space sims.Anyhow having a blast so far and excited to see how the finished product plays!Edit 8th of October 2014 My first impressions of SPG2 was that it might make my favourite top 5 space sims… it has the potential but it lacks a few vital essentials like a functional overview such as Freelancer. I was probably more than 20 hours into my early access when I realized just how much I missed it.It’s no game breaker but having played Freelancer for well over 1500hrs and EVE online for much more you quickly realize just how much it holds the game back from being so much better. I’ve put some 140 hrs into the game (including beta) and I’m far from finished with it.The good news is that some serious HUD tweaks are coming... the DEV’s have worked  tirelessly to address a few bugs that appeared at launch and they’ve been responding to some imbalance issues relating to levelling, the game having only been released a few weeks ago is already feeling much better!Visually the game scores 9/10    Just beautiful!Soundtrack 9/10      Really great soundtrack.Storyline 6/10     Story was OK, I just didn’t get into it. Just dialogue, no character cut scenes at all. Voice acting 6/10  Some were hilarious they were so bad.Gameplay 8/10  Some solid gameplay mechanics, easy to get into but hard to master.Replay ability 9/10  I got my money’s worth just playing the Beta early access!General Content 9/10  Some real quality ships, gear, missions, bounties, capture ship gameplay etc…LGM Dev’s 10/10 Never come across such a great team working so hard with so little.I just finished the story mode… overall I enjoyed it, I’ve still got a few high bounties to go after and I haven’t explored all of the map. The game as far as the DEV’s are concerned isn’t finished they have a big wish list of features they still hope to implement and honestly I can’t wait.Starpoint Gemini 2 easily makes it into my top 10 space sim games and if you’e looking for something to fill the void while we wait for Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous etc Just get it already.SPG2 will keep on getting better as they go and I’m looking forward to it and new content.

								I do not feel it's fair or accurate to describe this game as ""Eve Offline"", but it does give you a good idea of what you are going to get. Starpoint Gemini 2 looks great! And I really do love not having loading times. I haven't been able to explore the game's entire map yet but I can tell you it is huge and despite you are traveling in space it doesn't get boring. There is plenty of stuff to look around for, side quests, random encounters, etc. I can see myself spending 80+ hours just fooling around on this game before I decide to start/continue the main storyline. The controls are perfect, they do give you the feeling that you are commanding the ship. I'm still new to ship's customization but there seems to be plenty of options, and I really can't wait to buy a better/bigger ship. I'm sure this game will satisfy your scifi adventure needs, wether you desire join a fight between enemy fleets, flee through an asteroid field from a tougher opponent, become a space pirate or just travel through space... this game has it all.

The game's everything you could want in a space themed game and it only gets better!10/10 would recommend.			"

												It felt to me more like and expansion to the original than a new game. That's not a bad thing.  I recall having stability issued with the original game, but have had little to none with this one. Fun space exploring and trading with plenty of pew pew pew. Great visuals. Crappy camera in my opinion, and minimalist control scheme, I thought.  Still, a  great game. 8/10			"

												An enjoyable but rather limited single player experience. Graphics, music and sound effects are good. Side-missions are a tad repetitive and being a space simulation, I wish there was some more content. In that regard it's a bit too shallow for my taste and not comparable to the superb Freelancer. Don't bother with the lackluster campaign and it's weak story, but go straight for the enjoyable freeroam sandbox game. The mod community offers some nice content, which enriches the game experience.			"

												A solid open world space sim in the vein of Elite, X-series, Evochron, Oolite, etc.  Purchased at release, I haven't gotten around to it until recently, and was quite surprised at what I found.  Often games in this genre can be a bit overwhelming in the beginning, but that's not the case here - very easy to jump into and play.  In fact, straight out of the gate I've been able to do bounty hunter missions...  very cool.I have yet to try out mods, but I suspect they will add quite a bit to this game.  Really looking forward to deliving deeper into this one.			"

												As a fan of the X-series I can see a huge amount of potential here. I really hope people keep checking it out so the developers will have an incentive to expand the scope of their enjoyable and stylish foundation, continue to add more items, characters, goals, and areas to explore. I monitor their patches and updates because side missions were hinted at in the menu systems but not implemented when I played. This game gave me a solid 35 hours of fun before I had enough money to buy everything. Recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								Regularly updated by the developers and quickly nearing completion. How many EA titles can say that?A great space flier with fairly simple flight mechanics - a nice change after some recent space game fails. This is not a dogfighting game. You spend most of your time flying bigger boats and trying to keep as many turrets on your target as possible. Standard mission running, war participation, trading and mining. The developers are keeping the campaign under wraps until release, so I don't have enough information to say how well it all ties together. I will say that the game is playable, as is, without the campaign. Random missions pop up on your map so it is more than possible to advance without it.The price is great for the gameplay value and the campaign isn't even implimented yet. Very few bugs or flaws, and the ones that do make it in are quickly squished.			"

								I find it hard to say that I recommend this game, or even that I do not.I was a huge fan of Freelancer, and I have spent years looking for something that could fill the hole that Freelancer left behind. While Starpoint Gemini 2 comes close, it's not... quite... there yet. This game is still in development (just recently in beta), so bear that in mind.All of the pieces are there - free roaming, trading, space battles - however, SG2 seems to fall flat a key area - ship movement. The starting vessel, a frigate, I believe, looks like a fish, moves like a fish, but steers like a cow. Most combat is spent circling around trying to get a bead on your enemy for about 1/2 a second before they move out of view once more. By that point, his buddy has been firing lasers up your butt. I'm a space combat noob with this game, but even Freelancer felt like it had more ""zip"" to ship movement. I had to crank the mouse sensitivity just to feel like there was some kind of response to the controls.Graphically, it's quite nice. Ships, planets, stations and space ""stuff"" is lovely to look at.The game requires some optimization. When you are in a serious furball with many other ships, I find that the game really chugs and slows down - even if you are not involved in the combat, and it's just nearby.The game is not multiplayer, and I am not clear on whether or not it is ever going to be multiplayer. That is also a major wall for a lot of people. Freelancer was great. Freelancer with friends was amazing.This is not a Freelancer replacement, though it comes close. If you're not concerned about a multiplayer experience, you're not going to find a game that delivers what this one does at this price point. However, I would wait for later in the beta cycle or even for wide release. It's not quite ready for prime time.			"

												18 hours in and so far this game is exellent. VERY similar to Freelancer for old school gamers out there. For new people think 3rd person space shooter with trading, mission, piracy or whatever. There are tons of different ships, weapons, loadouts and play styles.Graphics are excellent and it runs really well on my rig.It can be hard in places, so don't be afraid to go away, save up and buy a bigger ship. The mission level indicators can be a little bit off. Some are waaaaaay harder than you think, then others will be easy money.Still that is life in space:I don't careI'm still freeYou can't take the sky from me.			"

												My original review (while the game was still in EA) is shown at the bottom. Please note that the sections on performance are not entirely relevant now, since the game runs much better.REVIEW AFTER RELEASE:---------------------------------------------------------The game is a mix between Freelancer and X3. You can command fleets, hire wingmen, level up skills, buy massive battleships, trade, do missions. It's a lot like Darkstar One too, if we are comparing - but a lot better.The focus here is on large ship battles - and with many ships, rather than smaller dogfigthing. Your starting ship is fairly large ( gunship), and some of the stuff I have seen to buy looks cool. You can climb the ranks and get battleships, dreadnoughts and the like, and command officers and mercs to help you out in battle, either on your own ship or as a wingman. You can even board enemy ships and take control of them, or tractor ships back to stations to sell them.It looks lovely and has a massive open map to explore, complete with anomalies, slipstreams, wormholes, gates, planets, stations asteroid fields, nebula etc. - all you would come to expect from such a game and more.The campaign is basic, but enjoyable. The voice-acting is absolutely atrocious though - the accents are all over the place and it is detrimental in an necessary way. You also have the option to free-roam, doing missions as they come along, trading or becoming a pirate. It has a complete reputation and trading system, allowing you to become anything you want.A lack of multiplayer hits hard, since this game would be infinitely better with it and a real shame it is not included. It also seems to have a fairly repetitive and grindy feel to it - hence the mark of 6/10. If it had multiplayer I think my score would jump to 8/10 instantly though.Jimbo Rating: 6/10REVIEW WHILE IN EA:---------------------------------------------------------It's a mix between Freelancer and X3.

												A quick review for this really cool space game.I spent 35 hours on this game, In that time I finished the base game + one DLC, reached maximum Level and bought on the best ship. So even if I am not an expert, I think I can write a fair review.+ Great Value.  You easily can beat the game 2 / 3 times without feeling bored. And the Dev team enhanced the First Starpoint to the new engine, it should give you around 50 hours more of gameplay.+ Cool graphic; not realistic like Elite Dangerous for example, but a very nice representation of space.+ Nice gameplay /  Mix of Rpg and tactic space game ; if you play in high difficulty it can be very challenging.+ A lot of things to do.+ A lot of ships and weapons to suit all tastes.+ A extremely nice and responsive Dev Team. Basically if you post anything ( interesting ) on the steam forum, there is good chances that a Dev will be the first to answer.+ A perfect example of how a Early Access should be done and handled.+ Mod support.- Scenario not great.- A little bit short. I know it is against my + on greate value, but the thing is  I think 35 hours to reach max level is a little bit to quick; of course if you want the best weapons you will have to spend a lot of times, but it lacks the motivation of leveling up.- At the end you are incredibly overpowered. Some may consider that a + , as a kind of reward but not for me.So highly recommend this game made by a very nice and little team of passionate Dev.Will by their next project without hesitation. "

												I want to like this game however the lower quality voice acting and the eventual repetitiveness of all of the mission are what broke it for me. There are still some missions that completely bug out for me and I am unable to complete them until I fail it and try again. The main story missions can be long and you can only save at the space stations so when it does fail half way through you have to start all over again and push through the voice acting once more.Other than mousing over the faction and reading it's description there is nothing that makes any of the factions feel personal in any way.There is the basis for a great game here and some might enjoy this title. I however cannot recommend it.Update:For a 9 man indie team then this is a very well done game. I must admit I did no research before reviewing. I'm very impressed that the developers care so deeply about their project to comment on my small post and describe their plans and ambitions for the future. I have decided to change my recommendation because in light of this I want this game to succeed. Space games are the future!			"

												A slight variation on the standard space-battle game in that you get more firing control and ship manouvrability.  The tutorial is a little sketchy, simply as list of thing to read as you play along, rather than a hands-on episode specially designed for beginners.  Some great movie clips along the way, and graphics in general somewhat superior to the more basic plethora of space games out there.

												Up front:  Not deep enough or fun enough to warrant a $35 entry fee.  Definitely worth it for $10.Pros:+Artwork.  Ships and backdrops are pleasant enough to look at and cruising through space in your ride of choice is nice.+Simple, easy to use interface and controls.  Love the interface.+Straightforward missions+Stable and nicely refined.  Have yet to run in to a ""broken quest"" or a significant bug of any kind.+Decent enough sized sandbox system to play in.  It takes 15 minutes to fly across Gemini even with the fastest ship. +Game adjusts difficulty rather well as you progress to bigger ships.+Soundtrack is a definite plus that matches the mood of the task at hand.+Lots of factions.  No, they don't really fight all that differently but...they are labeled differently.+Faction loyalty.  It is simple to see who you are friends with and who you should avoid.  System is easy and intuitive.+Decent variety of ships, loots and weapons keeps things interesting.+Fighters and bombers can be launched from you ship.+Perk system.  As you gain rank you can shape your fighting style and abilities.  Easy and effective without being OP.+Steam workshop enabled.  I find looking at the hind end of an Intrepid Class is nicer than the stock ships.Cons:-Game progression can be very grindy at times.-Uncompelling campaign became unbearable because of horrid voice acting.  I began playing free-roam instead.-Ships all fly and feel the same.  A battleship handles just as well as a frigate, it just has more weapons, shields etc. :(-Unable to target specific enemy ship systems.-Sensor range is pitifully low.  You'll always see things before your sensors do.-Combat feels shallow a good portion of the time.  Tactics rarely decide outcome, usually ship stats are it.-Combat AI is downright stupid at times. As a level 18 I destroyed a level 70 pirate because they kept chasing me.  My one pea-shooter gun could hit them from 800 out, their guns could only reach 550.  As they chased me I eventually wore down their forward shield and nearly destroyed them before they turned and ran.  At that point I ran them down, overtook and finished by shooting through their non-existent forward shield.-Controls are simple, but can be awkward at times.  No target padlock option. (Really?)-3rd person views only.  You will never be ""in your ship""and that hurts immersion.-No sense of running a crew.  Your ""crewmen"" are cards with stats that don't progress.-Game does not track ships destroyed, troops lost, total money accrued etc.  Nice touches that are easy to make.-Small variety in mission types.  Scan something, shoot something, ferry something.  That's pretty much it.-No ability to build up a true fleet, can just hire a couple mercs.-No feel of actually influencing events in the game world.-When you dock at a station or planet, all interactions are handled through a simple splash screen.Summary:Starpoint Gemini 2 is a nice little space romp for casual/arcade crowds.  I would personally prefer options available to transform this basic game experience into something a little more hardcore.  Replayability is hurt by lack of simulation options, inability to shape conflict and shallow combat mechanics.  Less than 20 hours in I have a dreadnought class warship, have maxed out alliances with half the factions and explored roughly 60% of the systems in the game.  I do not feel as though I will make any substantial new discoveries at this point, just find combinations of things already previously seen.  The game has begun to feel like a ""digital fishbowl"" but may come back if I find myself in the mood for mindless point and click with a spaceship involved.  Score: 7.5			"

												Yes get this game, wait do you need to hear the dialog and be given direction? Okay less one sided. But if those are both no then hell yes get this game.Where to start, I got this game on sale, and wanted to refund it. However I gave it one more try and managed to get through the first little bit, and all of a sudden I loved it like crazy...Side notes I guessI really like the ship details and variety, although I wish there were more. (I always want more ships)The story line got kind of lame and or broken near the end.The main dialog is painful. Punishment for warcrimes painful...So if you are going to give it a go -Turn off the dialog! ----Do IT! (the music is nice though, and in freeroam the dialog is much less death)-And get ready to be spammed like crazy by ""helpful"" tutorial pop ups as soon as you start. (some are very helpful)----You can skip them or dissable them at your discretion though so not a big deal.-You can zoom out with the numpad +/- keys-You need to restore default keybinds when you start, or the delete key doesn't bring up your tactical view (which once up is handy)I think those are the main things that coloured my lack of enjoyment with it at first, so knowing that you should have a much better run of it. Oh I found the gunner class was less entertaining than the other two classes, even if you are mostly planning on shooting everythingBut seriously I have had a heck of a lot of fun with this game, and will likely continue to do so for a good bit more. I haven't tried all the ships yet and there are still some achievements to go. "

												I Love this game. Its a space RPG but you never you leave your ship. Sure its a bit old but graphics and gameplay are great.Its not too simplistic to be considered an arcade space shooter but not a mad in depth space simulator. Its quite easy to learn how to pilot, fight, nav and trade. Along the way you got many ship upgrades and ships. However be prepared to earn the credits to buy these. The space fighting is alot of fun, however its very level dependent if you engage with an emeny above your level you die. So run away tactics are sometime needed until you own a fleet of ships. There are a few problems sometimes the space fights can just kill you in seconds. You can only save you game at stations which adds to tension but alot of time you just end up replaying the same mission or area of space because of it. The soundtrack I tured off within 4 hours of gameplay its repitive and anoying and the sound effects could be better.So gamrplay is quickly learned but sometimes the fights are too difficult.soundtrack could be better.graphics are up to standard.A fun space adventure.

												I went into this game as a buffer between waiting on a few other games im looking forward to.  Keeping that in mind I do love all scifi/space games in general.  The beginning was difficult i was having a hard time learning the controls and ended up giving up within the first two hours.  I gave it another try and got the basics down and now am 36 hours into the game.  I found myself loving it and enjoying the mystery of the story.  From what i expect from a 30 usd game it surpasses in all categories.  Yeah tutorials are not great,  the voice overs are off sometimes  and not perfect, finding the help section or explainations in the game about buying selling or how to bounty hunt and null and void.  But with all that it is a 30 buck game reg price and i bought it for under 10 bucks.  I rather enjoy figuring out how to figure out all the aspects of making money in game.  I say 2 thumbs up for what it is and i enjoy it even though i dislike 3rd person or control the ship games where im not in a first person view.  36 hours into it im not even in the dlc yet and havent even explored all the space available in the game aswell.  I say its a win win!!!!			"

												I love this game!! Though it should come with a warning: ""Warning, this game will make you lose sleep!"" heh. I've played quite a few space games throughout the years, X3 series, Wing Commander, Freespace 2, Starlancer, EVE, Star Wars X-Wing and more and this one ranks right up there imo. If you're into these types of games I highly recommend checking this one out! Pros:-Great graphics-Epic music-Fun sandboxy type of do whatever you want freedom-Devs are very active and responsive (big seller for me)-Ease of modding (probably my favorite aspect of this game)Cons:-Requires a bit of tweaking to optimize and run smoothly on lower end systems. (Though there are mods that help, and the community is always willing to help with this)-No Multiplayer (but this isn't a factor for me, in fact, it's one of the reasons I bought this game...no griefers, no obsessively overpowerful others pwning you within the first ten seconds of you logging in. And it doesn't take 8 months to be able to fly a battleship! :) )I can't think of too many cons because the devs are always working on improving things, and fixing the few bugs that have surfaced here and there. Every time I think of a con, I find out they've already fixed it!Also, I have never actually published a mod before this game. It is insanely easy to mod...you want to change your loading screen? Easy. Want to change the music? Sure, you don't have to go through some maddening process of decrypting game files just to get to them, and then re-encrypt them using 20 different programs just to do that. Want to fly a ship that looks like a banana? Yep. And you don't have to learn eleventy different programming languages to do that. There are fantastic guides that help as well. And the devs are always around somewhere willing to help. Yea, big plus for me.The sandboxy aspect is a big plus too. Want to just roam around for a bit and blow stuff up? Sure. Want to just mine and get rich trading? Yep. Want to be a wanted criminal with a limited life expectancy? No worries.			"

								AWSOME GAME!!!! I have no idea whats going on in this game universe but this game is amazing, It gives you a background if you did not play the first game(This Guy) and throws you into a waring universe. you start out with a decent ship and can go around doing missions, mining ore, killing lots and lots of people. Most of those screen shots they are using to sell the game are real gameplay with the hud gone(all but that planet shot of the city are real ingame places). I love the game play. not too complex but you will need to get used to space flight. One thing I never realized that will help is when boarding another ship the Green and Red arrows that appear can be clicked to send or retreat your troops! Buy the game and go find out what i mean!

								GREAT GAME!  This blows other open-""world"" space games (Evochron Merc, X: Rebirth, etc.) out of the water as far as fun and dynamics go.  You don't have to grind too much to make geat profits.  Want a new ship?  Find one you can beat, board it, capture it, captain it, then work your way up the food chain.  Environments beautifully done, as well as artwork on the ships and weapons effects.  Combat is very tactical and lgical, taking into account where your weapons are placed and requiring you be at a certain azimuth to fire from them (left side, right side, front, back), so it takes some thought and power management during battles, especially when against tough ships.  I definitely recommend!			"

												An addicting game that makes you want that super expensive ship. Capturing ships is most fun, and also the quickest way to earn a lot of money. Though after 18 hours, and having bought the best carrier-class ship, I'm not so eager to get back in and play again. But it was definitely a great 18 hours.Just some thoughts, a story-line, more insanely expensive ships to want, ability to hire captains who go out and do work for you as well, would make add more hours into the game.Also, a cockpit view with people would be nice to see the scale of different ships. All the ships look the same size and the planets just feel teeny ;)			"

												Played for almost 20 hours now.  Good open galaxy, fairly easy to learn and develop.  One has said a mix between Freelance and Skyrim, and that's a pretty good idea of the game.  Begin by mining some astroids to get some dough.  Build up your ship a bit, then try a few missions.  Tells you the recommended level for the mission, so that's a plus.  Can hire some mercs to help out.  Build up an armada to go for big missions.  I expect this will get a LOT of play time, similar to Skyrim.  Looks like a random generator for missions, so the game isn't over until YOU say it's over.  Advice I heard was, buy it, you won't regret it.  I don't.			"

												7/10I really enjoy open ended space sim games. This one is a very happy medium between easy to learn and fun to play.It does not have the vast options and customization as games like EVE or X, but I would trade that for a more fun and easy to play game.Like:-Open world with a variety of play styles.-Good selection of ships and equipment loadouts.-Looks great, cool ship and station designs. fairly immersive-Easy to learn controls and interfaces, even decent camera control.-Combat is fun and sometimes intense.Really enjoyed:-Capturing ships.-Trading (Easy to use ""best buy/sell"" interface!)-Exploring, pirate hunting-Completing full loadouts on a ship feels very accomplishing.Dislike:-Map feels small and underwhelming.-Copy pasted missions (gets old in any game though.)-Story started out pretty lame (avenge my father! collect stuf!) but i didnt get far into it. voice acting was passable..-Random impossible difficulty battleships showing up out of nowhere, or even in a mission.-I feel like some stats are missing, or hard to manage when making a loadout. Such as:Weapon energy consumption vs regen. And how to buff regen / lower consumption?Turret arc max angles. Fix: List this on ship stats, or a visual on the loadout page would be awesome.A better display of your ships stats (the circular display looks very awesome, but is not practical when zoomed out.)Is there a display for your own crew size? I may have missed it, from my reason above.Recommended for any type of space sim fan, but definitely leaning towards casual.			"

Early Access Review
								Wow, suprised! This game was actually dang good! The reviews werent wrong at all. Its very similar to the X3 / X series of games except without the headaches, no laggy menus, no shoddy UI/maps, basically its everything that you wanted X:rebirth to be.. almostIts not the best game in the world, however the developers are hard at work polishing this title into a true gem. Its esentially flying around in space doing rpg-like stuff and creating your own armada/fleet and waging war.  Theres a few small issues and bugs left to be fixed and some features that will be implemented in the future, so this title has a bright future ahead of it, even though its worth buying As-is.  Theres moddability in the game itself so im sure the modding community will be able to fix/implement what the devs do not. The devs are actually active on the forums and not just to censor creativity and announce p2w and microtransaction garbage. If you like RPGs, buy it, support it, who knows? This platform/title could have a VERY bright future ahead of it.  This is probably the only Early Access title that isnt a rip off out of the lot.... And that's coming from one of the most virilent critics of the early-access system, so you know its for real.			"

								This games has tons of potential. It has decent graphics, good game controls, easy to learn and best of all, it's pretty addicting. There are three character classes, different type of ship classes, different kinds of ships within the classes, four different weapon types and tons of missions to do in sandbox mode.  I've been playing as the gunner,  especializing on weapons systems,with the ability to adds different bonuses to the weapon system of choice. My weapon of choice being rail-guns.  It's up to you how you want to play. You have the option of playing as a pirate, enforcer, bounty hunter, miner, trader or a freelancer (combination of all). How effective you are doing each type of job depends on the ship, the combination of skills you select as you increase in experience and buying a license. License determine how much money you will receive depending on what the license is for. For example, a mining license will get you more money when selling ore, a police license will reward you with moneyfor everykill, and so on so forth. The point of it all is to make money, so you can get better ships and better gear, you know, the same old formula that keeps us coming back for more.  Overall I really like this game and if you are a fan of freelancer and games likes these I dont think you will be disappointed. The best part? It's only  going to get better.			"

								Wow. What a fantastic game! While it is in beta, I found there was lots to do in this game. Lots of exploration and complete freedom to do as you wish. In a space sim, for me at least, that's a very necessary feature. I plan on logging many more hours on this game in the future.This game is absolutely beautiful. The universe feels immense; it feels like I could fly in any direction for miles. Just set a course, put full power to engines, and see what I come across. The game rewards exploration.Some of the graphics optimization features are locked as it is in beta, but I found that lowering the graphics settings available and the game's resolution fixed any issues I was having. I anticipate that anyone with a more modern rig would have no issues running this on high settings.Overall, it's worth the price they're asking for it. Good job devs! Looking forward to what comes in the future!			"

								This game is by far from perfect,but wow it sure is a wonderful game.If anyone is looking for a eve single player this would be it. Now I will warn anybody that wants this game that for the fist few couple of days you will be flying the same ship over and over, but once you finally get a better ship things really start to change. The other bad thing that I will mention about is that this game says it is big on trading. Reallistically it is not do to it is so complex and even then you still do not make much of a profit. Though for me the real money maker is being a pirate and captureing other ships which by far is the most efficent way to make money. If you dont mind the wait of leveling your ship up and all I would really recomend this game because it gets really fun and fast			"

There is a problem on my desktop in that the playing screen doesn't automatically resize to fit my screen.  Its too large so anything on the right hand side isn't viewable when I try to play the game.  I had to guess with the tab button until it cycl;ed through which is how I was able to play it.  I recommend supporting this game however as its lineage is very good and I can see in what little I could play a really good game.  I shall be here for the long haul.			"

This game could already be realeased with the content in it so far and it is only in beta. It has limitless potential for mods. The only big issue with it is that you can't get mods off of the steam workshop yet because it will crash if you do.

								This, game. I am enjoying it for all the reasons I bought it. Specifically, the play a game with the full freedom to drift aimlessly in space to look at something and say to myself... ""I should go there"" and be able to go there.  Issues arise in that so far there is no campaign, so there is a no guided leveling structure. Which is nice and freeform, but leaves you with a... ""hrmm, now what"", feeling similar to the sims or minecraft if you don't have a personal goal.  So far, you start off as  a rather beefy frigate off the bat, and from there are told there are other things you can do with your life beyond be a pirate/merc. Don't listen to that voice, stealing ships via boarding parties is the only way of acquiring money relatively quickly beyond the rare, bounty list job.  Which brings up space combat! This is both so much fun, and so much rage. Fun part! Depending on your choice of weapons, you are able to join random battles in space with next to no reprecursions as the two parties fight for life and you zap your enemy (see red guy), due to some laughably long range and guess shooting. Or you are able to watch in horror as you enter an area of space where everyone has some horrifyingly powerful guns that destroy your shields, hull, and happiness before you can make a pass at escape. Major issue is that you don't know what they are packing in weapons, you can't tell untill they open up on you, and the little info blerp provided is vague, very much so. The description varies from ""trivial"" to ""Impossible"", but you are not informed how they are rated to determine threat level to you. I seem to think it is an unspoken amalgamation of your ships type, and load out mixed with your level. But!  Trivial enemies in twos can wreck your life for reasons you are unsure of (maybe they are small glass cannons that are only GUN). Deadly enemies can just float around you in vain trying to bring their weapons to bare before dying to the explosion of their metal death trap.  Also, each ship has a load out of weapons, that are placed on four compass based directions on your ship, and each has a firing arc that is not discussed much, and even some of the fully decked vessels will always have blind spots in their firing patern.  So you are shooting, zapping, and hitting with all due fun then slightly tilt your ship to the left and stop. The weapons also have a range... which is an ignorable text box since it only matters in ""Fire at Will"" mode, unless you are being shot at then your AI ignore it just like you do and open up shooting everything like a Ork Freeboota.Exploration is fun, though potentially deadly since the whole area is teeming with bandits looking for the sweet rolls in your ships captain's quarters. There are about four mains ways of travel. Cruising, which is deadly and fun since for no reason at you can be cruising at a great speed (you think) then are knocked out of your cruise mode by pirates wanting you dead even if they are in no way a threat.  Or there are T-gates! Think stargate and that is exactly it, you anchor at the place and for a modest fee, travel in safety from one end of space to another point in space! T-gates are almost always at a space station/planet you can dock at (if your faction rep says so) and are the safest (relatively) way to go long distances.  Then there are wormholes..... wormholes are kinda like t-gates, if t-gates were a game you pay for up front, wormholes are the f2p that suck you in and slowly rob you with you having no knowledge where you are going. They are free to use, but they will kill your troopers (dudes you have on board to steal ships or keep yours from being stolen) each time and break your ship a little. And when I said sucked in I mean they have a gravity well that pull you into it and spits you out of another one, which is great but that other one has a gravity well too that pulls you into it. If not careful and if there are different pairs of wormholes nearby you can end up alone on your now burning ship on the other side of the map not really wanting to try to return.   Lastly there is an item that lets your teleport your ship in a circular radius of map hexes based on how many you want to use at time. Only to hexes you have already been to, semi safe since you have no clue what is waiting for you, can get expensive (you need a massive amount of the already costly items to even trying moving halfway cross map) but you wont get jumped on route like in cruising so, win?Lastly for now is the level up process... You can get experience from quests (variable from oh, nice to meh), and pirati- I mean defending your local area from them pirates and invaders. What does it do? lets you level certain skills you have chosen based on a life style of play I do not think impacts game too greatly. Really for most of the area I forget to use the things until I am nearly dying and go Save Me Buttons!  And Perks, perks are like skills but they are not tied to the action skills, they are always active.   Skills and Perks I think would be more impacting if they were not so dang situational, the buttons are very much a maybe use. Perks are very tied to certain aspects of the game, but are not acquired quickly enough to even remember to check for them. Or feel like they even do much when used.  It is a nice, balanced feature, but when you are able to reset your skills and perks the choices are less impacting on your decision time. I still am very happy I spent the cash on it, and if you like SPESS PIRATEZ, then you can be one in this one.  I do hope they keep this mode active if they come out with a story mode too.			"

Early Access Review
								Really impressed! It plays like a mix of Freelancer, X3 and Eve. It's super intuitive to pick up and play and the menus are all neatly laid out and self explanatory without sacrificing your ability to do what you need to do. Combat varies depending on the ship but for the most part it's slower than the frantic arcade dogfights seen in Chris Roberts games; with more emphasis on positioning and presenting sides of your ship to enemy.Trading and economy functions as you'd expect, with goods costing more or less dependant on their origins and the political affiliations. There's a fair amount of contraband so it's best not to use the ""Loot All"" button if you're trying to live a virtuous life.In terms of Early Access content; the game feels very polished already with much of the world content seemingly in place and all game systems working as you'd expect. The current starting scenario is possibly a little bit easy, starting you off as it does with a mid level ship and plenty of tools already at your disposal. The missions are all randomly generatied (apparently depending on your actions, though I've yet to make a big enough impact on my galaxy to see this) and most of them follow a fairly standard template. It'd be nice for some more intensive missions with multiple stages but the ones that are there give you enough to do, and when they involve going through hostile areas they can become quite harrowing. The full game will have a story mode, which isn't present in this E.A release, so who knows what that will entail.			"

								Wow, suprised! This game was actually dang good! The reviews werent wrong at all. Its very similar to the X3 / X series of games except without the headaches, no laggy menus, no shoddy UI/maps, basically its everything that you wanted X:rebirth to be.. almostIts not the best game in the world, however the developers are hard at work polishing this title into a true gem. Its esentially flying around in space doing rpg-like stuff and creating your own armada/fleet and waging war.  Theres a few small issues and bugs left to be fixed and some features that will be implemented in the future, so this title has a bright future ahead of it, even though its worth buying As-is.  Theres moddability in the game itself so im sure the modding community will be able to fix/implement what the devs do not. The devs are actually active on the forums and not just to censor creativity and announce p2w and microtransaction garbage. If you like RPGs, buy it, support it, who knows? This platform/title could have a VERY bright future ahead of it.  This is probably the only Early Access title that isnt a rip off out of the lot.... And that's coming from one of the most virilent critics of the early-access system, so you know its for real.			"

								This games has tons of potential. It has decent graphics, good game controls, easy to learn and best of all, it's pretty addicting. There are three character classes, different type of ship classes, different kinds of ships within the classes, four different weapon types and tons of missions to do in sandbox mode.  I've been playing as the gunner,  especializing on weapons systems,with the ability to adds different bonuses to the weapon system of choice. My weapon of choice being rail-guns.  It's up to you how you want to play. You have the option of playing as a pirate, enforcer, bounty hunter, miner, trader or a freelancer (combination of all). How effective you are doing each type of job depends on the ship, the combination of skills you select as you increase in experience and buying a license. License determine how much money you will receive depending on what the license is for. For example, a mining license will get you more money when selling ore, a police license will reward you with moneyfor everykill, and so on so forth. The point of it all is to make money, so you can get better ships and better gear, you know, the same old formula that keeps us coming back for more.  Overall I really like this game and if you are a fan of freelancer and games likes these I dont think you will be disappointed. The best part? It's only  going to get better.			"

Early Access Review
								I want to enjoy this game.  I can honestly see all the potential it has.  But I I have to hesitate in giving it a full thumbs up, but it's also not a full thumbs down.  As this is being written during Early Access, I can forgive any shortcomings.  Like I said, I can see the potential.  But try as I might, I'm just not feeling it.To start, I've always loved these types of games and felt they never made enough.  A space sim seems to have unlimited potential, but I prefer to avoid things that require subscriptions and groups like MMOs.  Conversely, I recall fond memories of doing just that in Earth and Beyond, lo so many years ago.  But what I loved most about Earth and Beyond is I recall enjoying crafting my ship and making it mine.  I'd say the same for the Lightspeed add-on to Star Wars Galaxies.  Clunky though it was, I thoroughly enjoyed taking those ship parts I blasted out of enemy ships and hoarding them, finally upgrading when I would get the time and adding it to my ship.  I felt like I owned that more.  Though you can certainly buy different ship parts here, there aren't that many right now, and some of the differences aren't readily apparent.  I can't even easily compare the old with the new.Funny enough, I started drawing comparisons to, of all things, the game FTL.  Though you don't actively fly a single thing, and the game basically consists of just a handful of screens, it does give you the ability to upgrade your ship in a way that makes you feel like you're in control of it.  And while even the upgrades themselves are a simple thing, I never really find myself using the same configuration over and over again because I find random things and random times.  Here, I feel less like I'm thinking on my feet and thinking more about where I'm flying next (fun, yes, but limited).Similarly, again, Early Access-itis: you get plopped into the game and are told nothing.  Zippo.  Sure, the tutorial is there, but it's not interactive.  It tells you what to do on one screen, then you need to close it out to try it, and  then reactivate the tutorial screen to move on.  Very clunky.  On the plus side, the controls feel pretty good and are easily customized, and yet, for it being space, it feels rather tight.  Granted, it's a game, so not everyone wants to sit there and patiently watch the seconds tick away, but it almost feels too quick.  It is space, after all.  If only to hammer the point home, once I figured out how to get where I was going, it didn't seem like I had to do much once I got there.  I also wonder about the items you get.  They don't seem to have much more purpose than to provide you with money.  And while that's all good, it also seems very limited.  Okay, I've got a cargo hold full of all these different things...that don't have anything special about them other than how much money they fetch you.  Then what?  Wash, rinse, repeat?  I could see where  the full game, story and all, would provide more substance, but I would hope it's substantial, because right now, like I said, I don't feel ""at home"" in this game.  I don't feel like I have a reason to be out flying, that my ship is no different than any other NPC ship flying around, randomly doing things ""just because.""So, like I said to start, I can see the potential: it looks amazing, the controls are customizable and feel natural, and there appears to be a real desire to embrace the mysteries of space.  Unfortunately, things feel like they move real fast, that customization needs to be greatly expanded to get some real tinkering done on ship, and that I'm not just moving from A to B to A again.That said, I eagerly await more content and gladly support the game.

												Star Point Gemin 2 is a fantasic starship space genre game that will have you playing for hours on end. I’ve spent more than 60 hours with the game at this point and I’ve only just scratched the surface. I’ve primarily been playing in the games “free roam” mode as that was the real draw of the game for me. I knew from the outset that I wanted a game that gave me the ability to explore, fight, mine and trade at my own leisure and do so in my own ship like a “real” space captain. After researching SP♥♥♥♥ bit I realized that this would be the game that would allow me to do all of that.I’m not a diehard space sim player so games like EVE Online and Star Trek Online have always kind of intimidated me. I’ve never really had an interest in the X3 series (my loss probably) but I have played Sins of a Solar Empire and the Homeworld series. It's been a while since I've played anything space related but lately I’ve become re-interested in the genre with games like Star Citizen and Elite: Dangerous on the horizon. I knew I wanted to play a game that felt huge and expansive but I didn’t want to play a game that made me feel like a small fish in a huge pond. I’m a casual player so the size and scope of this game feels just right to me. The game's setting is huge and there is a lot to do in it. Also, it seems like the devs are really committed to making the game better all the time which made the choice to buy it all the more easy to make. The fact that I’ve continued to play it so much is a testament to how good it actually is.SPG2 reminds me specifically of two games I’ve played before, Nexus: The Jupiter Incident and Star Trek: Starfleet Command. Although I’ve played many other space genre games since, I really wanted to play something that felt similar to those two games. SPG2 has a surprising amount in common with Starfleet Command which also allowed you to “tractor beam” aka grapple ships, scan anomalies and commandeer other spacecraft with “marines” aka troopers. I haven’t played that game in over 15 years but I remember how much fun it was to do those things in the game.These are some of the things I like about SPG2:-	the music is great especially the main theme-	the ship designs are cool and I know there are still tons more to discover-	the space station designs are great and varied which is a plus-	the variety of weapons and their FX in game look great-       the descriptions for items and npcs in the game are numerous and often amusing-       there are many mods availiable which help to enhance gamplayThe randomness of missions and enemies is great but whether or not you like this aspect of the game will depend on how much you like doing things in this universe. After awhile the missions can seem repetitive but luckily the fact that the level required to do each mission changes all the time, forces you to decide which missions to do or not to do. This in turn helps mix things up a bit and keep things interesting.The only issues I have with the game so far are the way the menus in stations and on planets were a bit confusing at first and still seem a bit cumbersome to navigate. Also I wish there was a bit more 'humanity' in the game. By that I just mean it would be cool if officers had portraits in addition to their names and when ships attacked you they too had portraits instead of just insignias. I know that's a huge 'ask' as there are already a huge amount of randomized officer names in the game. Perhaps a feature that allowed you upload your own portraits to the game (specifically for officers) could be cool. Also, I’m not entirely sure, but I think officers gain experience the longer they are on your ship. I hope so but it would also be cool if they could steadily gain loyalty for additional bonuses.Other than that I’ve really enjoyed this game and am glad I bought it.			"

												I'm going to give this a 5/10 at the moment.  The content that is present is well done and relatively stable/bug free.  Ship combat is fun for a while, and space is visually interesting with a few suprises.  But get a few hours in and the game starts to feel kind of pointless.  There is a faction system, but it doesn't do much of anything.  There is trading and mining, but neither give money at anywhere near the rate fighting does.  There are generated ""missions"", but they are extremely easy and give very little in the way of rewards (you'll probably do them just to have something to do).  There are enemy bases and structures, but you can't destroy them (you can get them to one health and they just hang there, and frankly it isn't hard at all to do that).  You end up collecting money to buy a bigger ship to collect more money to buy an even bigger ship (which isn't very rewarding, as the ship models are so small in relation to one another you dont get the sense that you have a bigger ship)...The game isn't garbage, and the devs are very nice and responsive.  At $5-$10 give it a shot, but not at $40.  The caveat here is there is a very soid framework to make a much better game (really this game is in the bin with so many others that are really in early-mid beta, but release early to make money).  If there is a content update that adds player bases and the ability to capture territory, balances out mining and trading, and puts in other end-game content and empire building mechanics, this game will be a 9/10 easy.  It feels like these things were intended, but just haven't made it in.  So, if you see a big update after this review, maybe give it a try.  Otherwise, skip it until there is a big steam sale (or skip entirely, if a space grind isn't your thing).			"

								Beta Review.First off, this is NOT my genre! I'm mainly fantasy (i.e. Wizardry, WarCraft, etc...) I'm much more turn based (i.e. Master of Orion, Galactic Civilizations, etc...) And I normally wouldn't even look twice at a flight sim game. But this game is fun!The game loads unexpectedly fast for being so vast and beautiful. The controls are very smooth (maybe even a bit unrealisticly so) and the hubs feel well thought out. For being a newly released into Beta game, it is very well polished (so far.)As of right now there seems to only be one mostly free-roaming map with little actual story or adventure to it, but even still I'm having a blast just discovering all there is to discover. I feel even with this one map there's still so many more hours (days even?) of fresh gameplay.If the Beta release is any indication of what the end product is going to be, it's going to be one great space game! And if someone releases a Firefly/Serenity Mod for Starpoint Gemini 2, I aim to misbehave.			"

												So far really enjoying this game. I am a huge fan of open-universe space games with ship and fleet customisations, but I do not like MMO-games (so unfortunately EVE is out of the picture for me). This game, to me, fills an X shaped void. It really offers a lot of what X3 had, and with some new and fresh ideas because it isn't X! And where the original Starpoint Gemini I couldn't get into because it simply wasn't as good as X, SG2 genuinly is. It is also particularly well timed, I loved all of the previous X games, until they released X reunion, which is probably the most sad, dissapointing and pathetic game ever made and totally missed the point of X and why it was good. I am glad to see that the developers of Starpoint Gemini have worked on, enhanced and listened to what space-gamers really want, and developed something that really fits. I am excitedly looking forward to where they take SG games in the future. I know I am basically saying ""it is the new X"", believe me when I say that coming from me, that is huge praise. If I were to nit pick, I would say that SG2s UI could use a little tweaking, the ability to zoom out on the map and a tool for selecting your own ships on the map and I'd like to see some of the fleet controls from X3 (for example telling a ships computer to go somewhere, protect something or trade something). I would also like to see space station ownership, and more skills and mods aimed at ship capture. But these are not huge criticisms, just where I think SG could be improved.			"

There is nothign cooler then sneaking up on your bounty target cloaked then firing a barage of missiles at its critical systems and then hacking the ship while your blasters tear it apart. The combat is engaging as well as the other aspects of the game. It is like a mix of Freelancer and the X series with a very user friendly interface.

While much of the content is still missing (No storyline, limited skill development, No Wingmen etc), its playable. If you're into some space pewpew, you may want to keep an eye on this gem as it may turn out to be a Freelancer contender.			"

												Great game while I'm waiting for Elite: Dangerous. Seems to push all the right buttons - it's one of those games where you keep telling yourself ""I'll just to this one last mission"" and before you know it you've spend the whole day on it. For me, it is what I wanted from X: Rebirth - note I never bought X:Rebirth due to the abysmal reviews at release.The developers of Starpoint Gemini 2are active on Steam and seem to take comments & reports serious. At version 1.0001 it's not perfect yet and the GFX could need some performance optimization but that's to be expected two days after release. Overall a good start. If you're into space freeroaming, get it.			"

								AWSOME GAME!!!! I have no idea whats going on in this game universe but this game is amazing, It gives you a background if you did not play the first game(This Guy) and throws you into a waring universe. you start out with a decent ship and can go around doing missions, mining ore, killing lots and lots of people. Most of those screen shots they are using to sell the game are real gameplay with the hud gone(all but that planet shot of the city are real ingame places). I love the game play. not too complex but you will need to get used to space flight. One thing I never realized that will help is when boarding another ship the Green and Red arrows that appear can be clicked to send or retreat your troops! Buy the game and go find out what i mean!

You don't have to grind too much to make geat profits.  Want a new ship?  Find one you can beat, board it, capture it, captain it, then work your way up the food chain.  Environments beautifully done, as well as artwork on the ships and weapons effects.  Combat is very tactical and lgical, taking into account where your weapons are placed and requiring you be at a certain azimuth to fire from them (left side, right side, front, back), so it takes some thought and power management during battles, especially when against tough ships.  I definitely recommend!			"

								A very enjoyable experience so far, only a few hours played but I'm looking forward to logging in and flying my starship around.    As for being an early release or beta, many of the features don't feel like they're in beta at all.  In general most of my experience so far has felt very polished and enjoyable.  Combat at times can be a bit odd where an NPC will not exactly fly intelligently, but then again, I'm flying a frigate around a larger ship for a reason--perhaps they just can't roll their ship?I'm looking forward to new features and as of now know I have many hours to explore and experience the features already implemented.  Also, the workshop has made some nice addons for the game which are helpful for those of us with triple-screens/genre specific appreciations.  Love flying my intrepid class!Hope this review helps and look for me on Twitch at twitch.tv/aedaric for gameplay of this game as well as many others!Also, dev's--hope you add in the ability for cosmetic updates/purchases, would love to help support you in another way as I did purchase the game via the 33% and feel this ""Early Access Game"" would of been worth the full price!

								Bar none Starpoint Gemini 2 has been the greatest space trading and combat sim experience I've had since I played EV Nova in elementary school, but I can tell it's going to be so much more than that (blasphemy I know). The developers are clearly involved with the community and dedicated to seeing this lore rich galaxy through to the launch without cutting any corners. As is, I already feel as though I've reaped far more than the value of my initial buy into the alpha and though I know there's far more in store I cannot wait to see what they come up with for story/main missions. Showing my bias again here: I hope they stick with the open universe route they've already got going a la EV Nova with various plotlines to follow for near endless replayability. I would also like to see the captains name and profile photo become customizable, but honestly that's the only 'nit' I have to pick. As I've touched on previously there are a few kinks which one would expect of any game in its beta phase that are being tirelessly identified and smoothed out, so don't make the purchase just yet if you'd rather wait for a finished product. However I can't stress enough how cool it's been to be even a small part of an emerging work of art like this. Seriously, these people deserve buckets of money and validation.			"

								I want to enjoy this game.  I can honestly see all the potential it has.  But I I have to hesitate in giving it a full thumbs up, but it's also not a full thumbs down.  As this is being written during Early Access, I can forgive any shortcomings.  Like I said, I can see the potential.  But try as I might, I'm just not feeling it.To start, I've always loved these types of games and felt they never made enough.  A space sim seems to have unlimited potential, but I prefer to avoid things that require subscriptions and groups like MMOs.  Conversely, I recall fond memories of doing just that in Earth and Beyond, lo so many years ago.  But what I loved most about Earth and Beyond is I recall enjoying crafting my ship and making it mine.  I'd say the same for the Lightspeed add-on to Star Wars Galaxies.  Clunky though it was, I thoroughly enjoyed taking those ship parts I blasted out of enemy ships and hoarding them, finally upgrading when I would get the time and adding it to my ship.  I felt like I owned that more.  Though you can certainly buy different ship parts here, there aren't that many right now, and some of the differences aren't readily apparent.  I can't even easily compare the old with the new.Funny enough, I started drawing comparisons to, of all things, the game FTL.  Though you don't actively fly a single thing, and the game basically consists of just a handful of screens, it does give you the ability to upgrade your ship in a way that makes you feel like you're in control of it.  And while even the upgrades themselves are a simple thing, I never really find myself using the same configuration over and over again because I find random things and random times.  Here, I feel less like I'm thinking on my feet and thinking more about where I'm flying next (fun, yes, but limited).Similarly, again, Early Access-itis: you get plopped into the game and are told nothing.  Zippo.  Sure, the tutorial is there, but it's not interactive.  It tells you what to do on one screen, then you need to close it out to try it, and  then reactivate the tutorial screen to move on.  Very clunky.  On the plus side, the controls feel pretty good and are easily customized, and yet, for it being space, it feels rather tight.  Granted, it's a game, so not everyone wants to sit there and patiently watch the seconds tick away, but it almost feels too quick.  It is space, after all.  If only to hammer the point home, once I figured out how to get where I was going, it didn't seem like I had to do much once I got there.  I also wonder about the items you get.  They don't seem to have much more purpose than to provide you with money.  And while that's all good, it also seems very limited.  Okay, I've got a cargo hold full of all these different things...that don't have anything special about them other than how much money they fetch you.  Then what?  Wash, rinse, repeat?  I could see where  the full game, story and all, would provide more substance, but I would hope it's substantial, because right now, like I said, I don't feel ""at home"" in this game.  I don't feel like I have a reason to be out flying, that my ship is no different than any other NPC ship flying around, randomly doing things ""just because.""So, like I said to start, I can see the potential: it looks amazing, the controls are customizable and feel natural, and there appears to be a real desire to embrace the mysteries of space.  Unfortunately, things feel like they move real fast, that customization needs to be greatly expanded to get some real tinkering done on ship, and that I'm not just moving from A to B to A again.That said, I eagerly await more content and gladly support the game.

												Very slow to start; the controls could be explained better.   Crashed into Trinity about 5 times when I was supposed to ""LAND ON PLANET""  wasnt until I asked on Forums that ""Land""= ""Anchor"".   Scanning of ship wasnt vry helpful either until I accidently hit the Middle mouse button (which I seldom ever used before)Travel is slow, have to have lots of patience, although I think with upgraded ships & a better knowledge of the travel short-cuts (t gates, rifts, blackholes) it could be faster.   Admittedly im less than a couple hour in, first impressions only.Not for everyone.			"

												I'd recommend this game, but it still has a few bugs to work out. So far I had a graphic anomoly where almost evr=erything went black and apparently invulderable so. Then a lock up towards the end of the mission ""Empire's End"", and that was a tough fight to get stuck on. Frustrating. But it's a good game. Since it's just got out of beta, the devs are still working on ironing out the kinks.			"

												Star Point Gemin 2 is a fantasic starship space genre game that will have you playing for hours on end. I’ve spent more than 60 hours with the game at this point and I’ve only just scratched the surface. I’ve primarily been playing in the games “free roam” mode as that was the real draw of the game for me. I knew from the outset that I wanted a game that gave me the ability to explore, fight, mine and trade at my own leisure and do so in my own ship like a “real” space captain. After researching SP♥♥♥♥ bit I realized that this would be the game that would allow me to do all of that.I’m not a diehard space sim player so games like EVE Online and Star Trek Online have always kind of intimidated me. I’ve never really had an interest in the X3 series (my loss probably) but I have played Sins of a Solar Empire and the Homeworld series. It's been a while since I've played anything space related but lately I’ve become re-interested in the genre with games like Star Citizen and Elite: Dangerous on the horizon. I knew I wanted to play a game that felt huge and expansive but I didn’t want to play a game that made me feel like a small fish in a huge pond. I’m a casual player so the size and scope of this game feels just right to me. The game's setting is huge and there is a lot to do in it. Also, it seems like the devs are really committed to making the game better all the time which made the choice to buy it all the more easy to make. The fact that I’ve continued to play it so much is a testament to how good it actually is.SPG2 reminds me specifically of two games I’ve played before, Nexus: The Jupiter Incident and Star Trek: Starfleet Command. Although I’ve played many other space genre games since, I really wanted to play something that felt similar to those two games. SPG2 has a surprising amount in common with Starfleet Command which also allowed you to “tractor beam” aka grapple ships, scan anomalies and commandeer other spacecraft with “marines” aka troopers. I haven’t played that game in over 15 years but I remember how much fun it was to do those things in the game.These are some of the things I like about SPG2:-	the music is great especially the main theme-	the ship designs are cool and I know there are still tons more to discover-	the space station designs are great and varied which is a plus-	the variety of weapons and their FX in game look great-       the descriptions for items and npcs in the game are numerous and often amusing-       there are many mods availiable which help to enhance gamplayThe randomness of missions and enemies is great but whether or not you like this aspect of the game will depend on how much you like doing things in this universe. After awhile the missions can seem repetitive but luckily the fact that the level required to do each mission changes all the time, forces you to decide which missions to do or not to do. This in turn helps mix things up a bit and keep things interesting.The only issues I have with the game so far are the way the menus in stations and on planets were a bit confusing at first and still seem a bit cumbersome to navigate. Also I wish there was a bit more 'humanity' in the game. By that I just mean it would be cool if officers had portraits in addition to their names and when ships attacked you they too had portraits instead of just insignias. I know that's a huge 'ask' as there are already a huge amount of randomized officer names in the game. Perhaps a feature that allowed you upload your own portraits to the game (specifically for officers) could be cool. Also, I’m not entirely sure, but I think officers gain experience the longer they are on your ship. I hope so but it would also be cool if they could steadily gain loyalty for additional bonuses.Other than that I’ve really enjoyed this game and am glad I bought it.			"

												I'm going to give this a 5/10 at the moment.  The content that is present is well done and relatively stable/bug free.  Ship combat is fun for a while, and space is visually interesting with a few suprises.  But get a few hours in and the game starts to feel kind of pointless.  There is a faction system, but it doesn't do much of anything.  There is trading and mining, but neither give money at anywhere near the rate fighting does.  There are generated ""missions"", but they are extremely easy and give very little in the way of rewards (you'll probably do them just to have something to do).  There are enemy bases and structures, but you can't destroy them (you can get them to one health and they just hang there, and frankly it isn't hard at all to do that).  You end up collecting money to buy a bigger ship to collect more money to buy an even bigger ship (which isn't very rewarding, as the ship models are so small in relation to one another you dont get the sense that you have a bigger ship)...The game isn't garbage, and the devs are very nice and responsive.  At $5-$10 give it a shot, but not at $40.  The caveat here is there is a very soid framework to make a much better game (really this game is in the bin with so many others that are really in early-mid beta, but release early to make money).  If there is a content update that adds player bases and the ability to capture territory, balances out mining and trading, and puts in other end-game content and empire building mechanics, this game will be a 9/10 easy.  It feels like these things were intended, but just haven't made it in.  So, if you see a big update after this review, maybe give it a try.  Otherwise, skip it until there is a big steam sale (or skip entirely, if a space grind isn't your thing).			"

												With the sudden increase in popularity of Space Sims thank's to the Star Citizen crowdfunding campaign I went looking for a Freelancer successor to keep me busy in the meantime. This game is it.Freeroam mode is great and you should get at least 5-10 hours of good fun out of it. In that time you should be able to get to the endgame with the best ship and after that there's not much else to do - short of restarting as another character or on another path.The campaign feels like a hurried add-on. The writing is cheesy, the voice acting cringe-worthy. If you want a single player game that stands toe to toe with Freelancer, you won't find it here.Get this game for the sandbox mode that is freeroam and go explore the Gemini star system!			"

								This game is everything I ever wanted in a space simulation! :D I love the options the game gives you on how you want to play and fight. You can choose to focus on maneuvering the ship and let the AI or officer fire at the ship (a la Star Trek), or you can fly and shoot yourself (a la Freelancer). The contextual menu makes learning this game easy! If a multiplayer option is added later, this would be the perfect space sim. Move over X: Rebirth, and make way for Starpoint Gemini 2!			"

								Beta Review.First off, this is NOT my genre! I'm mainly fantasy (i.e. Wizardry, WarCraft, etc...) I'm much more turn based (i.e. Master of Orion, Galactic Civilizations, etc...) And I normally wouldn't even look twice at a flight sim game. But this game is fun!The game loads unexpectedly fast for being so vast and beautiful. The controls are very smooth (maybe even a bit unrealisticly so) and the hubs feel well thought out. For being a newly released into Beta game, it is very well polished (so far.)As of right now there seems to only be one mostly free-roaming map with little actual story or adventure to it, but even still I'm having a blast just discovering all there is to discover. I feel even with this one map there's still so many more hours (days even?) of fresh gameplay.If the Beta release is any indication of what the end product is going to be, it's going to be one great space game! And if someone releases a Firefly/Serenity Mod for Starpoint Gemini 2, I aim to misbehave.			"

												If you've ever played Privateer or any other Wing Commander game, this is very similar. It looks prettier, has less depth at the moment but the devs seem dedicated enough to keep supporting it. I started playing in Alpha, there wasn't much to do and hardly anything was implemented. I stopped for a while, played again after release and was pleasently surprised at the progress made. Seems like some things I had suggested during Alpha were actually changed. I honestly didn't expect this much progress to be made. If you like flying around, shooting stuff, looting cargo and completing missions for credits to upgrade your ship, crew and NPC ship buddies than this game is for you.			"

												7/10I really enjoy open ended space sim games. This one is a very happy medium between easy to learn and fun to play.It does not have the vast options and customization as games like EVE or X, but I would trade that for a more fun and easy to play game.Like:-Open world with a variety of play styles.-Good selection of ships and equipment loadouts.-Looks great, cool ship and station designs. fairly immersive-Easy to learn controls and interfaces, even decent camera control.-Combat is fun and sometimes intense.Really enjoyed:-Capturing ships.-Trading (Easy to use ""best buy/sell"" interface!)-Exploring, pirate hunting-Completing full loadouts on a ship feels very accomplishing.Dislike:-Map feels small and underwhelming.-Copy pasted missions (gets old in any game though.)-Story started out pretty lame (avenge my father! collect stuf!) but i didnt get far into it. voice acting was passable..-Random impossible difficulty battleships showing up out of nowhere, or even in a mission.-I feel like some stats are missing, or hard to manage when making a loadout. Such as:Weapon energy consumption vs regen. And how to buff regen / lower consumption?Turret arc max angles. Fix: List this on ship stats, or a visual on the loadout page would be awesome.A better display of your ships stats (the circular display looks very awesome, but is not practical when zoomed out.)Is there a display for your own crew size? I may have missed it, from my reason above.Recommended for any type of space sim fan, but definitely leaning towards casual.			"

Early Access Review
								There's a lot to like about this game, equally it still has room for improvement, but overall I'd recommend it in its current state for the price. If you've ever played EVE, you will immediately see the attraction of an ""offline mode"" style game, that you can pause when the pizza guy comes or save before doing something stupid.Things I really like.* The universe is already pretty big, lots of places to explore but the game has features like wormholes, JumpGate networks and TeleportDrives to get you around faster than full speed ahead into one direction.* Ships look cool, there is a good variety of designs and varied configurations already, Its obvious there will be more to come.* Great maneuverability of the ship, it's the type of piloting I really wished EVE had, you can really out maneuver a lot damage if you get good at it allowing you to take out larger ships that claim to be ""impossible"".* Shielded sides, you don't fly around in a ""bubble"" shield like most games, each side of your ship has emitters and if one side is busted you're taking hull damage! That really fits my play style of focused attack. I hope that later one you can divert power to bolster one side or the other depending on where you are taking the most damage.* You can board other ships with what amounts to raiding parties and fight their crew, if you manage to take them down, you can grapple their ship and tow it (painfully slowly) back to a station and sell it or use it as your own. This will be a good source of income if it didn't take ages to get a ship back to station. I'd suggest adding a towtruck style ship that we can come back with or something and get it there much faster, just let us bookmark the spot and return would be fine.Areas in need of improvement* I guess its the pilot's radar, but its way too small to be useful and you can't zoom-in, you can tell if there are enemies in the area the same as if there are friendlies, but it's hard to gauge you're position or distance from them without ""looking out your window"" by turning your ship or the camera. I'd prefer more thought into that, it needs to be bigger and zoom able and a lot more detailed about what each tiny blimp is. For example, you can drop a ZETH which is basicly an automated sentry fixed in space, but if you fly too far from it you may never find it again and its not cheap. I frequently lose mine if there are NPC friendlys around because it's impossible to tell what anything is.* Stations need to be able to attack, I love the warnings that tell me any enemy station is nearby, so the first time I heard that I saved the game and flew right at one, but nothing happened, I think they should start firing some lasers if enemy craft turn up.*Needs more ship system customization and I think this is already on the way based on some of the anomaly scans I've done, cause you need jamming, ECM, shield boosters, etc. The ability to vary your ship should be based on more than just what skills you're pilot has, not to keep bringing up EVE but there's a lot to take for example there.

												One of the more solid EA titles. While there isn't much content in the game, its good to know that Starpoint Gemini 2 has a good engine running for it, gameplay is smooth and its pretty easy to get used to, especially for a space combat/sim game. While much of the content is still missing (No storyline, limited skill development, No Wingmen etc), its playable. If you're into some space pewpew, you may want to keep an eye on this gem as it may turn out to be a Freelancer contender.			"

												This gem is somewhere between the X series (vertical learning curve) and Galaxy on Fire 2 (my dog plays this game) in terms of difficulty with some of the best combat in any space game I've ever played.  SPG2 may not have any entirely new concepts or features but it has taken a lot from past games and the end product does all the little things right.  Ultimately this game meets the same fate as Skyrim, a giant world that is unfortunately only about 5 feet deep.  While I have absolutely no regrets throwing out $28 for it, I can't help but feel this game will be so much better in a year thanks to workshop support and a dev team that truly cares about their B - level game.  While the voice acting is pretty bad, It isn't House of the Dead 2 bad so it's playable, other than the voices the sound is pretty good, I could wish for a few more effects and songs but that's just nitpicking.  The one thing I truly don't like about this game is the faction system, if you do assignments in the Trinity sector your reputation goes towards lawful...Which means all lawful factions like you more, the unlwaful (pirates) well, they never liked you anyway.  If I do things in the Trinity sectors I want perks in the Trinity sectors, not halfway across the solar system.Unlike most titles I am actively looking forward to DLC for this game, which I'm hoping will greatly increase depth.-Throw in some: player built space stations, automating a freight company that I have built/stolen and funded, faction control, and territory conquering and this could truly be something special.8.5/10			"

There are various tasks to do inside the game, such as exploration, boarding ships, mining, trading(These do still need balancing.) and ofcourse, the campaign mode and pewpew fighting. The game is fairly complex, once you start getting into it, learning to fly and maneuver different ship classes, the firing arcs of various ships, finding fighting tactics that work for you and your ship, the enhancement system... And for those who get bored quickly after having played through the storyline, which did happen to a lot of players in other games such as Freelancer, you do have a nice amount of achievements to hunt, some of which aren't exactly easy to accomplish. Nothing is stopping you from hunting down the ""Heros"" either. ;)The community and the devs are active and communicating a lot, which reflects into the product and the pace patches, fixes and balancing attempts are coming through. There are plans for an expansion and DLC, which will further add to the amount of content in the game and ofcourse, the community made mods, which will be the crowning jewel of this game. The tools might not be fully functional yet, but as soon as the game itself is at a state where the devs and community are happy, the tools will be recieving some much needed love.A lot has been said about the game in many of the reviews, but here's another list of just some of the features already in the game and some which are being worked on:Already in:-Boarding Ships.-Working Campaign.-Lots and lots of ships.-Weapon/ship system enhancement.-Trading.-Dynamic events which effect item prices.-A large amount of space to explore, which can also be further expanded.-Lots of different factions.(Which will also get some more love in the future.)-Freeroam mode for those who don't wish to play the campaign.-Mercenaries to act as your backup.-Blueprints.-Working collision system.-Cloaking!-Heroes to hunt,-Mods.Planned/in the works:-Player owned faction and base(s).-Dynamic struggles for power/regional control between factions. Once this is implemented, every single playthrough will be and feel different!-Expansion/DLC.-Modding Tools.(Currently some work, some don't. Somewhat prone to crashes.)-Improvements to the HUD and other elements of the UI.-An entirely new ship class.(Larger, naturally. Bigger is always better!)... and the list goes on.If you aren't a fan of space sims or dislike games with emphasis on exploration, this might not be for you, as there is no MP in the game to increase its lifespan. However, if you do like what you've seen/read and can get past the fact that there is no MP and that the game relies entirely on mods/expansions/DLC to keep breathing fresh life into it, then this game just might be a perfect fit for you. Atleast I've completely fallen in love with the game.			"

												NOT A FINAL REVIEW, Amazing game even thou i have only played for a few hours i can already see a great game in the making. the detail of the ships as will as the weapons placement make sense. thou the ark of some are questionable. nothing that a few tweaks won't fix. Also supports mods which  i already install one, and audio mod for the engines. even so the game is looking to be one that i will play for months if not years. the ship sized feel a bit off as they are not that different from smaller ships. maybe the dev will consider resizing some of the ships. some of the weapons sound could use some work as the laser as they are dont sound very flashy. i hope more options open up interms of upgrades you can do too the ships such as larger shield if the ship can handle it. Also ships you capture can be added to your fleet at a cost but not to the level of mercs after all they are your factions (player influence ) i do hope they add medium shields, turrets, the heavy weapons as they are now require rearming. would be nice to have some that are laser base that shot out a massive beam but take a long time to reg at no cost to rearming. that would be a good trade off.  shield don't always work as they should i often taken hits from the left only to take damage from the right shield ? as if the shots went right through my ship. none the less considering your getting a massive open sandbox world and lots of things you can do will keep you coming back.  I'm sure the dev will balance the classes as will as the damage in time. i really hope they continue to expand the RPG side of this game a bit more and add some more side mission (freelancer). Also be able to take bases for a faction. joining a fleet in order to win over a terrorties would be cool. so far i would give this game a 7 out of 10 and when its complete i'll review it again			"

												If you've ever played Privateer or any other Wing Commander game, this is very similar. It looks prettier, has less depth at the moment but the devs seem dedicated enough to keep supporting it. I started playing in Alpha, there wasn't much to do and hardly anything was implemented. I stopped for a while, played again after release and was pleasently surprised at the progress made. Seems like some things I had suggested during Alpha were actually changed. I honestly didn't expect this much progress to be made. If you like flying around, shooting stuff, looting cargo and completing missions for credits to upgrade your ship, crew and NPC ship buddies than this game is for you.			"

												An addicting game that makes you want that super expensive ship. Capturing ships is most fun, and also the quickest way to earn a lot of money. Though after 18 hours, and having bought the best carrier-class ship, I'm not so eager to get back in and play again. But it was definitely a great 18 hours.Just some thoughts, a story-line, more insanely expensive ships to want, ability to hire captains who go out and do work for you as well, would make add more hours into the game.Also, a cockpit view with people would be nice to see the scale of different ships. All the ships look the same size and the planets just feel teeny ;)			"

												Played for almost 20 hours now.  Good open galaxy, fairly easy to learn and develop.  One has said a mix between Freelance and Skyrim, and that's a pretty good idea of the game.  Begin by mining some astroids to get some dough.  Build up your ship a bit, then try a few missions.  Tells you the recommended level for the mission, so that's a plus.  Can hire some mercs to help out.  Build up an armada to go for big missions.  I expect this will get a LOT of play time, similar to Skyrim.  Looks like a random generator for missions, so the game isn't over until YOU say it's over.  Advice I heard was, buy it, you won't regret it.  I don't.			"

												FIrst off, I love the game.  That said, wait a few weeks until they get all the runtime errors out.  I can't play more than forty-five minutes without getting kicked out.  Also, saving's a problem, I'm relying on autosave quite a bit.  It's insanely frustrating, but also speaks to how much I'm enjoying the game that I'm still playing despite such grevious bugs.			"

												This was a great game in beta and even better now that it's fully released. It may take a little while to get into but there's plenty plenty of exploring, missions, ships, weapons and upgrades and also Workshop support.I haven't looked into the campaign much since the freeroam mode interested me more, but it seems to just be freeroam with story missions.The freeroam missions are a little samey after a while but there's enough variety of mission types for you to choose to be a pacifist or a full on fighter.Would recommend this if you like open world space sims, with factions and a good variety of ship classes and ships.

												Leveled a bit with sidemissions, traded some things, started to steal ships, got rich af, bought a bigger stealth ship to steal bigger ships, sold bigger ships, bought licenses, bought even more licenses, bought ALL of them, found a station that sells me my best weapons for less than they buy them, stayed on that station for several months making money(haha, nice joke! ingametime doesnt pass on stations and planets), got out with an enourmously huge monster ship that can steal even bigger ships, got to the other side of the universe and bought the absolutly best ship to steal ships, kept all expensive weapons i found, i mean stole, went back to the station with the same full trading skills and trading skill mercenaries i found the stations trading logic with (yes, i wrote down on a sheet of paper where i can find them, just like with any of the ship slot upgrades), made 100bio in like half an hour of trading the same weapons over and over again. bought the universe.I legitimately broke the game.I even sold ships that i will never use anyway just for the overview. kept the cool ones ofc.At this point Im just hunting down Heroes, stopped the story at like mission 14 because overly upgraded and overly well equipped me and 2 uber mercenary ships wreck just anything, no matter the title.didnt get the artifact looting stuff, either its bugged for me, or i just didnt try to switch my reputation to the negative to be able to loot them.

												I love this game!! Though it should come with a warning: ""Warning, this game will make you lose sleep!"" heh. I've played quite a few space games throughout the years, X3 series, Wing Commander, Freespace 2, Starlancer, EVE, Star Wars X-Wing and more and this one ranks right up there imo. If you're into these types of games I highly recommend checking this one out! Pros:-Great graphics-Epic music-Fun sandboxy type of do whatever you want freedom-Devs are very active and responsive (big seller for me)-Ease of modding (probably my favorite aspect of this game)Cons:-Requires a bit of tweaking to optimize and run smoothly on lower end systems. (Though there are mods that help, and the community is always willing to help with this)-No Multiplayer (but this isn't a factor for me, in fact, it's one of the reasons I bought this game...no griefers, no obsessively overpowerful others pwning you within the first ten seconds of you logging in. And it doesn't take 8 months to be able to fly a battleship! :) )I can't think of too many cons because the devs are always working on improving things, and fixing the few bugs that have surfaced here and there. Every time I think of a con, I find out they've already fixed it!Also, I have never actually published a mod before this game. It is insanely easy to mod...you want to change your loading screen? Easy. Want to change the music? Sure, you don't have to go through some maddening process of decrypting game files just to get to them, and then re-encrypt them using 20 different programs just to do that. Want to fly a ship that looks like a banana? Yep. And you don't have to learn eleventy different programming languages to do that. There are fantastic guides that help as well. And the devs are always around somewhere willing to help. Yea, big plus for me.The sandboxy aspect is a big plus too. Want to just roam around for a bit and blow stuff up? Sure. Want to just mine and get rich trading? Yep. Want to be a wanted criminal with a limited life expectancy? No worries.			"

												Highly recommend this for a good Space RPG. Seems to be running stable. It's got a tad bit of grind in good RPG fashion but still has that solid space sim feel to it. Much like Freelancer. It seems emphasis is palced more on efficient captaining (This is the RPG aspect, with abilities and consumables) than direct combat skills although it does allow you to manually aim and focus fire. So far I really enjoy it. The story isn't as enthralling as a story driven RPG like the Witcher, but hey we're a mighty space captain who goes around blowing up everyone around us and stealing their loot so it doesn't matter much anyway. Did I just describe a space hack 'n slash, yes I think that's what I'd call this. The story gives you some primary goals to focus on while exploring the game and shooting up the place ;3			"

								This looks like its going to be a great game...someday...which is the only reason I give it a thumbs up. I say 'someday' because I sat down and tried to play it today and after selecting gamepad with my xbox360 controller connected, I was forced to watch a series of tutorials that meant absolutely nothing to me because they were referencing joystick buttons rather than the familiar a,b,x,y,etc. They are also not interactive, which is great to help you learn the controllers. Simply saying that A = 'whatever' doesnt have nearly the same benefit as actually seeing what A does first hand. I searched online for an xbox 360 conroller map for this game and also came up empty. I kind of figured out the controller basics on my own. but I soon realized that the mouse has been completely disabled in the game, making impossible(?) to access certain hud elements.  ~scratches head~ Why would they disable the mouse??The other frustrating experience came right after the tutorials finished. I was left to play around on my own, but then I asked myself, now what? There was no nudge in any particular direction after the tutorial and even after landing on the planet (for a hefty fee) and a space station in orbit, I was still no closer to understanding how I should begin my journey. Between the lack of controller mapping info and the non-descipt beginning, I was left feeling somewhat abandoned.Now, I realize this is still in beta, so I think I will just shelve this game for now, until I can figure out how to play it properly. Hopefully with the help of a decent tutorial.			"

												many hrs in....8 out of 10 stars. :) - Huge sandbox universe to explore and interact within. :) - Beautiful graphics and framerates with settings maxed out :) - Many Corporations with their own ship visual styles:) - Solid game - not the typical steam crowd-funded title.:( - All ships are the same graphic scale, regardless of the class size you are playing.  So be prepared to be underwhelmed by the Corvette or Frigate upgrade visually, as well as tactically - especially given the amount of time saving up for them.  You gain only an extra weapons mounting point or two each upgrade.:( - Fleet Commander? No, not really. You to hire mercenaries (max 2) that follow you (bumping into each other) that you have no command or interaction over what so ever.  Most of the time they go off and get themselves destroyed or wirte you off as MIA when the green rifts take you for a ride.Restarted many times to try all the player skill sets, and starting ship types.  I will continue to play it for now as I anxiously await patches and expansions - or as usual, the steam community to mod out the oversights that the devs / testers missed (ship scale, enemy bases don't consider you a threat, complexity doesn't scale with firepower).Perfectly priced for what you get - especially if you catch a STEAM sale.

I really hope they make tutorials that explain the game a bit more actively, like the next one doesnt pop up till you completed the one before it.			"

								Very fun game. Beautiful environment, fun to cruise around. It seems to ""lag"" or freeze often though, especially when traveling at high speed or arriving at combat areas. Crashed on me once while landed at a planet. Other than that, I'm really enjoying it. Can't seem to adjust graphics to compensate for ""stickiness"" though.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is surprisingly easy to handle quickly, it offers a variety of piloting styles through a few shortcuts (i.e. space bar, or v for turret mode). It is indeed a versatile game where you can choose from 3 classes which can evolve in a RPG-lite fashion. Each class has 4 base skills and in each 5 facets you can improve when you activate the former, and classes share perks which can enhance some facets of your character (i.e. you like boarding? enhance your troops efficiency, you like trading? enhance your mercantile skills, you like piloting destroyers? enhance your skill with that class of ships).Several RPG aspects are simplified yet overall the existence of each feature serve a justified purpose. Depending on your actions, you will gain positive or negative reputation which in turn will make you hostile or friendly towards this or that faction. Once you are friendly with a faction, you may be offered to buy some ""licences"" which may provide diverse advantages like extra coin for destroying some other factions' ships or get free repairs at friendly starbases.All-in all, the sandbox space opera SG2 is pretty vast both in terms of maps, weapon choices (while there are only 3 types of light weaponry: beam, guns and plasma and 3 types of heavy weaponry: torpedoes, missiles and shockwave, there is a vast arsenal to choose from in each types and categories) and ships. The latter comes into no less than 10 types, 8 of the standard military classes and 2 in the more civil transporters, and each major faction provides its own versions of each class (with different hardpoint layouts, cargo and trooper capacity, etc.) so at the end there are plenty of ships to choose from and you can perfectly go through the game flying a corvette (the starting class) if you like to and still be some kind of challenge for heavier classes. You can also deploy fighters and get mercenary ships (of any class) to escort you (one of the player character class, the commander, may enhance those drastically).The combination of RPG and sandbox space opera inevitably means you have to grind (twice here since you need both money and xp), you'll be given the opportunity to peacefully mine ore, ice and much more (various type of asteroid fields, with more stones than you can dream of), you can attack any ship you like or you can do some mission from a panel of several ones (repair stuff, scan stuff, kill stuff, protect stuff from being killed, transport stuff) and while there is some diversity there it is of course very likely you'll do the same missions several times. In addition to the storyline (which is secondary in this game - you are even offered to skip it at the very beginning) you will unlock also some side missions (while some are custom scripted versions of the normal freelance missions, some are totally unique as well). So there is plenty of things to do, and the difficulity of the missions also scales up depending from where you are in the galaxy and your level. As a sandbox (freeroam) game, it is also possible for you to go to hostile territory and try to shoot down and loot anything you can, although this may be pretty difficult to do and you're more likely to die if you are not prepared for a proper war. If you are reasonable at start, you will do missions in neutral/friendly territory, watch enemies get shot by friendlies and scavenge the spoils of war (good thing being you still get exp).Sadly, SG2 is not exempt of flaws and one of the major one I've noticed is the IA in the battles. Sometimes (emphasis on ""sometimes"") enemy ships stop there and don't do anything until you shoot them. While I am not sure what causes this, my guess would be that the IA is programmed to have the same behavior regardless of having guns on the side or back of the ship or not. While sometimes the IA manoeuvers around you, many times it also just stop there and shoots you at full stop. In fact and especially if you pilot even heavy ships like if it was a fighter, you will find yourself having to reduce speed drastically in order to catch anything (unless you have several manoeuvrability enhancement like officers and equipement). While this is something you can surely get along with, it is still one aspect of the game that can be considered a critical shortcoming as it does not give you a intuitive feeling of piloting and the latter does not have so much impact on the fight (beside getting your enemy in your firing arcs). So if you expect a simulation of space battle, you won't find it here yet there is still enough complexity and customisation options in SG2 to actually make up for that in some way.A few other things kind of annoyed me like few specific types of ship seemed to always disconnect from my grappler when I set engines on overdrive while towing them. It only happened with those specific ships so far for some reason, so at some point, if I was too far from a station I would be discouraged to attempt to capture them. Some part of the UI are a bit clunky, manageable but lacking ergonomy like the contextual menu which you typically use for repairing or scanning which obscure the view. As I said a bit of a detail and easy to work around but still its one amongst several design calls that leave this ""meh"" impression instead of a ""wow"" one. Fortunately, there are a lot of well thought features that actually balance such little things in my opinion.Also, be prepared to stare at your screen for sometime while your autopilot is active, there is no time-acceleration feature in SG2. You can of course set the ""power to engine"" which greatly accelerate travelling and you have several ways of enhancing your ship's speed even further. There are also space highways (wormholes, gates - this one being expensive to use) that you can use, but most of the time you will have to travel through the void (not so empty at all actually) just looking at the distance counter shrinking for a few seconds/minutes till you reach destination. Of course a lot can happen when you do so, an asteroid or structure can be in the way (autopilot may not always detect it), a cloaked raider may attack you from nowhere or good old pirates may invite themselves to your party. Also you may want to keep an eye on some space anomalies like those space streams that may actually send you to hostile territories without your consent. A big part of your gaming time will be just that, travelling and making sure you reach the intended destination (although I find it quite bearable myself, it may be a matter of personality/taste).Overall, SG2 offers a decent space sandbox experience, with enough content, RPG elements and customisation options (character development, variety of space ships and equipements, additional bonuses with officers).  With the 3 character classes, there is of course a bit of replayability along with the 2 aligements (positive or negative reputation) nevertheless you will have to go through the grinding again (with a bit of experience though, you'll know how to progress faster on subsequent playthroughs). Economy is pretty balanced and merchant, mining, pirate, bounty hunter, military, scavenger etc. are all viable options to progress at similar paces (some are just more appealing to some types of players. some are more efficient for credits or xp's) and it is easy to switch from one career to the other"" just by changing ship (you can store several in a garage accessible from all stations) and playstyle (for a cost you can even reset your abilities and perks).If you like the genre (sandbox, not story driven) and do not mind the inherent features of it (grind) SG2 offers a fresh take on the open-world space opera. It is not as deep as the X series, yet it is much deeper in terms of game mechanics than many venerable predecessors like privateer or the earlier elite series to name but a few.			"

												Loved it! I loved that computers aimed my turrets. I loved the progression of ships, upgrades and mission difficulty. I never had to capture ships for money like some people seem to think is necessary, because I only bought a new ship when the old one couldn't survive the fight anymore (even with shield boosters and damage boosters), so I was able to skip corvette and never needed anything more than destroyer.  I also looked up the ship differences online so I bought the best in class for my fighting style.I would have loved more:Ability to buy a system to shunt energy distribution to 100% engine when activating PTE.Ability to buy HUD system to see tactical info on current target, even if it's behind me.Someone to buy 50 artifacts.Ability to buy more equipment slots, for non-combat equipment.I reconfiged Skip Dialog to the period key at the start and it never worked.

The only problem for me (i dont know if others have this problem) is that, the game will suddenly minimize if I let it be for some minute and i cant open it to continue. I will need to close it and open it back, quite stressful if i were in the middle of nowhere with no planet to save my journey and suddenly i have the urge to use the toilet			"

Early Access Review
								i have read the reviews and played the main scenario to its conclusion. and played a while in the open life goes on scenario. the reviews which criticize the game for its problems targeting and firing completely ignored the options. there are single keytokes which allow auto targetting closest enemy,closest object, fire primary weapons, etc. however they are not in my opinion logical. i recommend setting up your own hot keys through the options first. the voice overs are clearly russian, and the translations don't make for easily understood english. and the limited tracks make it useless to try to play with volumn on at all. the ships are easy to control and fun to use in a fight situation. Overall it deserves higher than the ratings it gets. It is a fun game to play for a while, but loses its appeal eventually. probably a good week of enjoyable play, then move on to other games.			"

												At the time of this post I have about 2 hours in the game. Just what can I say about this game that 2 hours of game play has shown me?It is fantastic.Simplistic it is not, yet it is at the same time. If you were a Freelancer fan this game gets pretty close. It is not perfect, but being that it comes from a small group of people with a small budget they really rocked this game. The graphics are good, lower end computers should be able to run it without issue. The sound is great and the soundtrack I have not turned off yet and that is saying something.Campaign or free roam. Don’t feel like doing the campaign anymore go wonder off and blow something up. Want to make some money go bounty hunting. Want to get rich trade some goods. Want to pick a fight do it.This game is an 8/10 pretty easy. For those of us that have been missing Freelancer it really fills the gap rather well. "

												I obtained this game in early April 2016 during a great sale. The TL;DR is this: simple enough to pick up, complex enough not to put down. For me The game is marred only by its poor save mechanic and truly terrible voice acting. I was a bit surprised at how good this game was. Others have called it “Eve Light” and guess what? Its good enough comparison. Like other games such as “evochron Mercenary”, the Various “X” games like X3:Terren Conflict” , Freelancer etc, you fly around and do stuff for folks and get money from that. You can mine, salvage, build an economic power house, play taxi, attack the meannies, etc. What sets this game apart from the rest is a mix of easier to use controls, a good mix of things to do, good pace and an active community. If you think many space games are just too complicated without a joystick and throttle then you may like this game. Since I am not a pilot in real life, do not have a us$200 joystick, and have no desire to learn an intricate set of controls, I think this game is much easier to play and enjoy then many others of the same genre. Pros-	Controls are easy to learn but hard to master without needing an expensive joystick and throttle-	Enough choice to feel in control-	Good selection of mission types-	Fun achievements-	Good mix of things to do-	Fun exploration-	Developers are active in the community-	Enjoyable forum community-	Single player offline goodness. -	Survives repeated alt-tabbing out of the game.-	A slower pace then some space games -	Enough choices to feel in control without being so overwhelmed that you cant wrap your head around where to even begin-	Long tutorial campaign is kind of fun but not mandatory you can start it and pick the main campaign back up when you want to. Cons-	Really poor voice acting. Seriously BAD. Its cringe worthy how poor the voice acting is. -	Poor save game mechanic you can’t just save when you want to.  you’ll have to fly back to a station so its not the right choice for busy life if you can’t set aside a block of play time. This sis not a game that you can start to play if there is much chance of interruption since you may often find you cant save for another 5 or 10 minutes. -	Boring choice of ships in the start – just your own ship, nothing compares for some time into the game. There is nothing wrong with your starting ship but you can’t just swap it out for another other until much later in the game the other choices are simply too weak compared to what you start out using. -	Often inscrutable choices – you’ll need to use google allot to get a hang of what is going on. It’s a good thing that alt-tab does not break the game. It is a good thing the community is so active and there is plenty of information out there. -	Tutorial is bit thin you’ll need to google allot. it will help if you have played other space games like Eve Online, Freelancer, etc before this game.-	If you have played other space sims and want an immersive dog fighting, pirating power house this is not the right game for you.-	Single player may be a snooze fest if you are used to the pace of online games "

												I wrote this review in January of 2015 on Metacritic.  I thought I posted it to Steam, but did not.  This game deserves a review.  Here's a copy/paste of my former review.  The game has only gotten better through expansions.I am a Star Citizen backer. Want to know a dirty little secret? I love and crave 3rd person space games. En route to searching for something to fill this desire, I came across this game. ""A Steam sale?"" I asked. ""Twenty-four bucks?"" I blinked. ""I spend that on 2-3 drinks at a restaurant with the wife..."" So, I plucked this one out of the Steam shelf, downloaded and started playing. Eight hours later I looked up and saw it was 4am. ""Woah..."" The next (read: later that) day I dove into the Starpoint Gemini 2 Community and learned I was late to a really cool party. Did you love Freelancer? Are you craving a 3rd person Space game? What are you waiting for...? Pick this gem up ASAP. There are few games that are so worth your money that you'll want to encourage others to purchase, but this is certainly one for me. In a day when space sims are seeing a great resurgence, it's refreshing to see a game that's not afraid to be 3rd person and give the player a bit of a relaxed take on space. I feel like a Malcom Reynolds, flying around in my ship, always with my eye on a new shiny, but lovingly holding onto, in my case, ""Big Red,"" until the time is truly right. There's dangers around every planet, but I've got a crew, a purpose, seemingly endless space to explore (certainly more than my limited time allows), and a ship. There's even a fun plot-line to follow along as you make your way in the galaxy--or don't; whatever--it's all up to you. I can assure you that if you want a rewarding, relaxing, and immersive (but not taking itself too seriously) space game, this is it. I give it a 9 (I'd have done 9.5 if it let me) because of the somewhat outdated UI, and the graphics are not the most polished. That said, the graphics do not detract from the game too much and again, it's sort of a breath of fresh air of late with the Elite: Dangerous's and Star Citizen's of the world. The development team has their ear to the forums and though I am new to the scene, they appear to be largely shaping the game around their community. It's mod friendly, and seemingly more so as time goes on, and there's already some great mods out there. It's much of anything you want in a fun game. Cheers.			"

												gotta say this was exactly what i hoped it would be. an awesome galaxy surfing vehicle combat game with excellent mods and dev support. endless replay value and more ships to choose from than you will ever even see in one playthrough. seriously ive played about 100 hours so far and still half my map is unexplored. as all good games are you start out weak and end up becoming a juggernaut of near infinite power. and yet you can still get ganged up on to the point where your only choice is flee or die. tactical decisions go a long way and you definitely want to gather the best weapons, enhancments, officers and skills. but the best part is the freedom to choose what you do. do you mine asteroid and gas with a freightliner, or become wealthy thru the destruction of your enemies in a carrier, or do you become the master trader soaring around the galaxy at incredible speeds trading resources and transporting vip's in a cruiser. its totally up to you how you play this game. if i had complaints about this game it would be these. 1) more mods, 2) more weapon levels and choices, 3) more levels, and 4) better explained stats. so 3 out of 4 complaints are that i just want more. thats always a good thing. to play a game you can never get enough of. and if boredom ever does set in i can always start anew with a different approach, class or end goal.

My issue with the game is the simplicity of it, its not always a bad thing but I would have preferred a bit more difficulty in scanning and docking etc. Its like freelancer pretty much. Pretty straighforward. good graphics, nothing mindblowing and I would have preffered nicer and more varied skyboxes and a better drawdistance. That said its still pretty and will run on most computers I would imagine even very old one but I could be wrong.The amount of weapon syustems and ships is also very good.oh, I would have preferred a bit more depth in the trading aspect, larger storage etc but again what it does is enough to entertain.I would definately recommend this game to people, and even though I paid only a fraction for the gold edition I would say the game with its dlc would be worth a whole lot more in terms of gameplay value, dare I say 30 pounds or so.7/10			"

												I'm only an hour or so in, but already I have that feeling as with many games I've loved over the years. Love the size of the system, love the campaign mode, love the visuals... combat is great fun and the addition of expendable modules is really clever. The Fleet isn't that well expanded on, I don't quite understand how best to use them or how to upgrade them.The way you access menus is fantastically intuitive, I didn't need a tutorial (which come thick and fast without any real sense of being anchored to what you're doing in-game) to reload weapons or move cargo, the buttons were just... where they should be.EDIT: Three hours in and still loving it. Worked out a few more of the game mechanics (loving the tactical overlay which you have to manually map, I have it on left-shift) and realised that I don't have a fleet yet! The RPG-lite elements are great, incremental improvements on all sorts of things means you have to really put some thought into what gameplay you want to get involved in. At this stage, unsure if it was wise to go with campaign mode, I think this could be even better in pure sandbox.			"

												This was a great game in beta and even better now that it's fully released. It may take a little while to get into but there's plenty plenty of exploring, missions, ships, weapons and upgrades and also Workshop support.I haven't looked into the campaign much since the freeroam mode interested me more, but it seems to just be freeroam with story missions.The freeroam missions are a little samey after a while but there's enough variety of mission types for you to choose to be a pacifist or a full on fighter.Would recommend this if you like open world space sims, with factions and a good variety of ship classes and ships.

												This is a fantastic game that truly expands on an experience given to us by games like Freelancer. If you've played Freelancer or any other game like it, then you should have a great idea of what to expect.That being said though, there are problems that should be mentioned. Right now, in it's current state, the economy is ridiculous, or at least feels that way. Everything is ridiculously expensive (and by everything, I mean everything, including fast travel). And the only way to deal with an economy like this and still be able to buy stuff every once in a while is to hijack ships.So yes, you are allowed the freedom to do whatever you want when you want to which is nice, but if you ever want to advance your ship, you're going to eventually have to hijack other ships to be able to earn enough money. Or be prepared for a really long drawn out game of mining, trading, or being a freelancer.			"

												While I've played this a ton over past 2 weeks, was very tough call on whether to recommend this for others.Pros:- Generally entertaining, I love the premise of an open-world space sim in general- Good performance & interesting visuals (no sigificant lag or graphics issues on my rig with GTX770)- Enjoyed exploring and ""freeroam"" option to explore galaxy & amass wealth as I desired- Fair amount of flexibility to do different activities such as trading, mining, fighting pirates, capturing ships, smuggling & choose to side with ""good"" or ""bad"" factionsCons:- Capturing vastly overpowered for gathering wealth quickly, breaks scaling- Enemies scale ... inconsistantly ... with your level & ship power, if don't gather a lot of wealth early can be very rough- Lots of late game special add-ons not quite working right yet / buggy (blueprints) and take a ton of work to collect- You can't actually land or explore planets (just get same menu interface as at any shipyard by clicking on it)- Factions vastly simplified, no complex interactions (while having something like 20+ factions, they all break down into 3 options: the hate everyone factions, the good factions, and the evil factions)- Also, as a ""space sim"" I find it extremely jarring from immersion that it disregards most aspects of physics as they operate in our universe (severe viloations or completely ignoring gravity with all objects permanently hung in same spots in space & no orbital mechanics observed at all, relative sizes/scale of objects at distance are wildly inconsistant and in particular planets are massively distorted relative to distance and relative to stars, optics of light/dark side of planets not shown, vacuum transmits sound, no conservation of momentum, space completely littered with stationary debris everywhere)Basically if you love the idea of an open world single player space sim with some very light RPG elements in upgrades/statistics, you might find this entertaining for a while as I did.  If looking for a movie-like story, or any realism in economics, politics/diplomacy, or physics, or multi-player options, or longer term RPG depth, you won't find it here.			"

								Hey, I happen to like Starpoint Gemini 2 quite a bit.The game reminds me of Freelancer with the relatively simplistic, but still very satisfying combat.  You have your typical guns of various types, potentially including turrets with a 360° field of fire...  and a selection of quite useful torpedos/missiles.  I haven't gotten very far into the game yet, though...  so I can't say much about how the faction system plays out, or anything on purchasing new hardware.  I still STRONGLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME for anyone who enjoyed Freelancer or anyone who finds the thought of an open-world space sim with an emphasis on combat.			"

								If you enjoyed Freelancer or the X series, you will probably like this game too.It took me about 30 minutes or so to figure out what the hell I was doing. The tutorial was decent, if intrusive (you can turn it off and access it later), and gives you a basic run down of how to control your ship, and some information on the various HUD icons and such. After that, its up to you to explore and play around with things. The (arguably) nice thing about this game is that, unlike the X series, it seems difficult, if not impossible, to fatally screw up in the early stages of your game.Give that this is early access, there are, of course, some issues:  Choppy performance - I bold this because it made the game very difficult to play. I am not sure if its simply my machine, or if others are experiencing it too, but it is a tad annoying.  Enemies are too easy - I am not sure whether they get more difficult as you play and level up. At the moment, if feels somewhat final fantasy-ish in that early enemies are deliberately easier to give the player time to power up and such before throwing them to the wolves. If that is the case, then cool I suppose, but right now, given how easily I seem to be able to wipe the asteroid belt with these pirate's ships, I'm not sure why anyone would pick a fight with me at this point.  Weird random graphical bugs - Whilst switching from auto to manual targetting, suddenly thousands of beam weapon streams fired out from my ship, followed my curser wherever it went. Looked cool though.  Lack of clear explanations - It took me a little bit to figure out what the different colours on various commodity prices actually meant. Yes, I did assume that red meant something bad (probably a bad selling price) and green was good, but it would be nice to have a tooltip, or something, to confirm my gamer's hypothesis. I'm still not certain what yellow means.  Probably some other issues I've either forogtten, or those I""ll encounter as I play...Despite the issues mentioned, I think this will turn out to be a really awesome game. I'm quite impressed with what the developers have done so far, and look forward to more updates. "

												First off: I like this game quite a bit. It is neither too expensive, nor bad looking or somehow broken or buggy.This is a first impressions, not a 100% review, because the game is huge.The good stuff:- Fly around in space in your own ""capital"" ship. I put that in quotes, because your first ship is a small semi-freighter whatever, but packs quite a punch. Apparently you can go all the way up to cruisers, destroyers, carriers and stuff.- Simple, yet efficient trading system (X3 would have done good to use that). You can see all available goods for trade as well as best buy and sell prices on the star map and can automaticall plot a course to the desired station.- Space looks good. Graphics are really not all that bad.- Combat is interesting in a sense that it's a mix between flying and shooting yourself and also using several skills to enhance damage, survivability etc. I'd just have hoped to have more interesting skills to use. You can also use items and fire your heavy guns like missiles etc. The coolest part, however, is to just have your turrets fire automatically while you concentrate on evading. This is not advised 100% of the time, but it's neat. Turrets will also have fire arcs to take into account. You can easily see the status of your shields and hull and can high tail it out of a fight with max engine power. You can also distribute power between engines, shields and weapons, so that is all very solid if basic (whoever played Freespace 2 for example knows what I mean). I would have liked to redistribute power from my forward shields to my rearward shields for example or have some sort of pause mode where I could issue my gunners or fighters to target a certain area of a ship. Either I just have not found a way to pause the game (because I see comments that it was supposed to be a thing) or it isn't there. I also don't know if you can target different subsystems on a ship. So far I have found an option to target ""ship systems"", but not individual ones. It would have been great to target a ship's engines or weapons individually to disable it, but I guess that would be a task better suited to fighters than capital ships. There are apparently also boarding torpedoes so you can take over enemy ships. The weapon types encompass all you really need, from railguns, to beams, plasma weapons, rockets and torpedoes. I'd just look forward to getting a bigger ship, but the only bigger thing I see costs a million credits and money is hard to come by if you don't invest a lot of time into trade or something like that. The cruiser even costs 15 million! Long way to go.- The map is huge and full of different factions and pirates.The not so good stuff:- You can apparently only have control over 1 ship (and some mercs) but not command your own fleet (maybe in an expansion or so I've heard), which is kind of disappointing, but ok. - Automated freighters. I don't see a possibility to have those either. You can own different ships, yes, but there seems to be no way to assign a freighter to go trading on his own in order to generate money while you do something more interesting, because seriously...trading is great and all but it IS extremely boring to have to fly the routes yourself every time...that is a ♥♥♥♥ing slow way of making money...but I think you can have stations or something like that at least...- The flight distance. Crossing from one point of the map to the other could potentially take a looooong time. There are fast travel routes, but those cost money...lots of money as far as I can see...that kinda sucks. There are also worm holes at least.- The campaign is...ugh...so utterly boring thus far? Go here, collect a core here, help this dude we totally don't even know or get to know...destroy a ship, bam 30 secs, go back...and all the while suffering through the TERRIBLE dialogue...I'm sorry, but this is definitely the weakest part of the game. Especially the main character just does not have an enticing voice to listen to in a game. Some spoken dialogue is even missing lol.- Scale. The fighting is a bit weird sometimes, because you don't even see a lot of the enemies you are shooting. At least not in the earlier stages of the game. Keeping track of multiple enemies in a fight is painful, because your automated gunners will not necessarily target your target, but whatever they damn well please. Also, the fighting is kind of weird some times. I've encountered an enemy that was apparently ""impossible"" for me to take on according to the game. I was level 1. I killed it. By staying on its tail and out of the reach of its main guns...really? ;) That was kind of anticlimactic...- Weapons and ships. I can currently buy some different ships and lots of different weapons systems and stuff, but it all seems worse than what I have, so either the game is not good at giving me information or there is no purpose in me buying new stuff. For example, I can buy a gunship for about 250k. That gunship has less hps than my starting ship, cannot carry missiles and has less power available, so why would I buy that? Also most weapons systems seem to deal less damage than what I have installed. That is weird.- Contraband. I once picked up illegal drugs from a destroyed ship. I was told I was entering an area where these drugs are illegal. I sold them. Nothing happened. Why can I sell this stuff at a station in a system where the drug is supposedly illegal? I don't get it.So, take everything with a grain of salt, but I'd say the game is definitely worth the asking price. If I had to rate it I would give it a solid 80+ I'd say. It does what it says it would do. It controls nicely, looks good and thus far I have not encountered any real bugs. There is always room for improvements and I hope an expansion or dlc will come out.			"

												It's a space sim.If you expect soul-mouving roleplay or vast army battles or deep scale business management, you'll be disapopointed cause... it's a space sim.It's a pretty darn good space sim at that. It's pretty, atmospheric and quite fun to play.  There are a few bugs still out there but nothing major, nothing to break the game.  The map is huge.  You have good control over your ship and character. There are more factions than you need and there's always stuff happening.  Nothing heavilly scripted, it's all pretty much standard space sim missions.  Destroy that guy, smuggle this, escort that, repair this, explore that. You know.  Space sim.The voice acting is abysmal.  So abysmal, it's awesome.  Honestly, it feels like a game made by people who have a lot of love for the genre.  I expect to spend many, many more hours exploring space. I just throw a few Malcolm Reynolds one liners here and there and suddenly, I'm in space, doing space stuff. I'm cool like that. (I may or may not be taking meds regarding this)Oh and the music... I would have bought the game for the music alone.			"

												After a bit of time with this game; there are a few things to say about it.  First of all the controls get a bit to get used to.  The game play can be a bit daunting at first, but after a fashon it ends up adding to the total game experience.  The Steam workshop mod support is quite extensive and can create a completely unique and individulized experience.  Is it a true AAA title, no, is it a bit different and fun to play yes.			"

												The game was enjoyable, but don't expect anything amazing from it. I come from playing EVE Online for over 9 years. I thought this would be a nice offline version, it wasn't. If you do find yourself playing this game, abandon the story line. Just play freelance and the DLC is a waste of time.Pros:Open worldFlexible marketMultiple ways to slow make moneysLots and lots of quest (every time you load the game new quests are generated)Lots of ships fit different command/combat stylesCons:Voice overs, they're comically badStory line, it sucks and is hard to follow. It made since in the end, but it must have been written by a 3rd grader.Bugs ruin the emersion (Random effect get stuck, ships explode but keep flying around)Some cut scenes have voice overs, then the voice overs just go away, then come back.....wut?Oddly enough, every character you ""speak"" to in game has a different accident.

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is to space exploration games what Skyrim is to fantasy adventure games. Vast, full of lore and play styles and activities for everyone, and just so beautiful to stroll through and appreciate the scenery. The long list of buttons and actions appear daunting at first, but are easy to learn and facilitate a rich level of interactivity that makes an enjoyable experience for both the casual gamer and the hardcore strategist. Stats, activities and tricks offer a healthy challenge for micromanagement fiends, and movement and combat are simple yet satisfying enough for someone who has an actual job and no time to micromanage in a virtual world. Also like in Skyrim, the voice acting is endearing and the accents are so thick you could cut through them with a knife. It's not often I play a game with just the right balance of exploration, story, environment, gameplay and general polish that I don't mind playing all day on a day off. Also like with Skyrim, STEAM WORKSHOP! Can't wait to find some funny mods in the future. Little Green Men Games nailed it. 10/10, would buy for the wife and kids.			"

												The best I can say for this game is: Meh.The combat is kinda fun at first, and there is potential there, but after playing space games in the past, this one makes a lot of the mistakes with not many of the successes. Pros: -It's an open world, and from what I have played so far, it's a pretty large space.-visual effects look pretty nice.Cons: -The writting/voicing are really vanilla. I spent more time wishing they would shut up than getting into the story or caring about backstory. as an example, once you complete a main quest, it just initiates another main quest. No cut scenes, no story development at all aside from 15 seconds of text being read by a character that you won't see again.-RPG is an exageration. you can spend points on different perks, yes, but thats it. instead of a new ability, you get a 5% increase in ""fleet soak"", whatever that is... speaking of:-The game doesn't really explain things like folks are used to now-a-days. Is it too much to ask for a tool tip to tell me what some of the features are?Overall, I bought the game on sale at 80% off, and still think I overpaid a bit.. Maybe the game will get a lot more exciting and in depth once I spend more than 10 hours on it, but I'm not going to slog through to find out.			"

												Did you like Privateer and Freelancer?  Did you read the reviews comparing this game to those, as well as Outlaw Star and other anime classics?  Don't believe them!  I did and I regret it.  If you like tutorials that are either outdated and no longer have any bearing on the game, or ""tutorials"" that are nothing more that a summary of key bindings, this game is for you.  (By the way, anyone who points out the shortcomings and is desperate to learn how to play the game they just bought are often derided as 5 year old simpletons in their tutorial forums.)Combat system is a joke:  The manual controls are wonky and attempting to manually control flight will send your ship into endless oscillations and fishtails.  If you let the computer take over this function by using the fire at will command, the ship stands still and shoots randomly at enemys off the edge of the screen, occasionally getting a hit but never resolving combat.  (I tried this, walked away for 1/2 hour, came back and it was still randomly firing at the same enemy with no real damage to my ship or theirs.)Don't care about combat and want to be a trader?  Good luck!  When you try to go somewhere, you are ambushed and drawn into combat, resulting in the frustration loop that I described above.Feels like an Alpha.  Despite what the developers say, this game is unplayable.  It has too many rough edges and still needs alot of work.Don't buy it.  I did and I regret it.Spend your money on X3, or some other legitimate franchise. "

Unfortunately you have to restart completely now and again, as every single save game past a certain level becomes corrupt with 100% accuraccy.

												Another space ship game which I love but this particular game is very shallow. It has a boring storyline and a bunch of missions, all very similar, which you need to run over and over again to get better ships so you can run the same, but tougher, missons over and over.Gets boring fast and I would not recommend this game unless you just want a few hours of space ship shooting. And dont be fooled by the variety of ships in the game. They all handle similary to each other and the size difference between the smallest and the largest playable ships is barely noticeable. So a gunship can fly side by side to a dreadnought and they are pretty much the same size. The dreadnought is maybe 20% bigger, that's it. So dont expect epic capital ships battles, you wont find it here.			"

												After a few hours in freeroam I feel like I've experience enough of Starpoint Gemini 2 to review it. First of all, this is mostly a classic space sim when playing in freeroam. It's mining/trading/mercenary grind to get better equipment and ships but it has some differences - there's skill points and experience levels, which is nice if you enjoy playing RPG's (I do)You don't start in fighter class ships. In fact - you can't fly the fighter class ships. You start in a Gunship class ship (or above if you have the DLC's). Your crew can man the turret hardpoints for you, and you will want them to. They are perfect shots every time. The turret AI is *very* good. You don't need to concentrate on weapons except to line up for heavy weapon shots, which are ammo limited but deal more damage per shot than your turrets. But....you probably won't even have to use them. Starpoint Gemini 2 has a problem if you're a pilot who knows basic concepts of space sim combat. If you can assess firing arcs, manage shield energy and experience in MMO type skill buffs, normal difficulty is a relaxing grind even if you take assassination missions 6 to 10 levels above your level. Most enemy ships don't have cloak scanners, so you can drop out and unleash hell with an undetected approach and take down ""Deadly"" and even with a little luck ""Impossible"" targets. This is a bit of a shame as this game wants to force you to fly combat role ships. I haven't seen ore freighters or transports. You can seemingly only buy Gunships and above with military kitting. Mining/Trading is viable but the cargo holds are disgustingly small and the mods that increase them in the workshop do not work with the DLC. You can not upgrade cargo capacity. If you're a frieghter captain your best bet is to get something with the biggest hold in the class which is marginally bigger than the rest and prepare to make MANY trips to and from asteroids and debris fields. Which is also a bit strange - asteroid and debris fields are EVERYWHERE, and you can't take advantage of it. Unfortunately most of the modders seem intent on putting in ridiculous godships instead of addressing the lack of civilian vessels. I usually like to play as a frieghter captain, in my game now I'm just a mercenary taking contracts well above my level for the massive increase in EXP and Credits. Overall I'm very pleased with this game. It's very underrated. I can expect I'll be putting many many more hours into it, as I have with X. This isn't Starpoint Gemini 1 for sure, and it's not the mess that is Star Wolves. It's not X either, but it's a better game than say Tachyon or Darkstar One and a nice alternative. Haven't played story yet. Not sure I will. Also this game and the Rebel Galaxy soundtrack works very nicely together. 10/10 Exploded a frigate as a gunship by exploiting cloak and firing arcs.			"

												Since it has drawn so much attention, i have played it recently to see what was new offline ( internet issues). For some reason it didnt show how much i played recently and my total is incorrect because i got the spacebuttplug ( tsar) and restarted a few times, played some of the story. so since you all are reading it, let me elaborate further, What i noticed that has changed, Gravity field of wormholes, wormholes are now working, some balancing stuff, same ship enemies dont go down as fast and use their abilities. Gameplay: The central game mechanic is the combat and trade system which are very tight, trade is simple but at times exploitable thanks to licenses and some close stations that are close by, no big deal though you can only get a few millions at most each run. Camera views, weapon systems etc were good but for the love of all that is space worthy why not include a database for weapons and enhancements like you did with trading? This might seem minor to you but it is infuritating to go to wiki ( which also turns the game to windowed so i have to restart) while same thing exists for trade. Gameplay is very solid which is why it got my hopes up. Those are pros mostly, cons would be mostly with presentation. Story: I must say i mainly played freeroam but when i did try story mode. Something about main character put me off. It might have been choosen one wibe i got from the start (son of an admiral and all that) not to mention his accent was strange. The voice acting was done by professionals this time i see but the ghost from starcraft 2 telling me where to go felt funny, love his accent and voice. Those are fine, what kind of broke it with me was that missions were presented through text that was in a box and UI designers would know, the things in small boxes should be small because for some reason we are not inclined to read all that. Nice flavor text on bouties though. 2 major problems with freeroam story, repetitive missions ( transport X to Y, or go here kill all that moves, very little flavor to it but if the surrounding fluff is good, that is all you need, world of warcraft did it. lots of games had repetitive missions that did not feel repetitive, Why? Answer in presentation )reputation that do not even feel like you are progressing, easier to read reputation bar and actually meaningful reputation would be nice.  I will explain the biggest problem that is connected to this in presentation. By meaningful some contact from faction representatives contacting you for special missions and thanking you for your help, you can go nuts from there. As it stands now. the only faction i know is trinity coz they have a weird space station. Presentation: Here is the place where i loved it and hated at the same time. Graphics are some of the best i have seen, sounds are great ( computer voice being modable is good too), ship designs are hit and miss but even the ones that are bad have something good about them such as tsar the spacebuttplug, it is pretty funny how it looks but is still intimidating. Tutorial is a bit annoying but the game is complex so its fine, takes practice but not as bad as many other games ( elite dangerous comes to mind, which i quit because 4D parallel parking in a flying box is not my fun)  The problem is, the real problem is despite all those great gameplay, the space is made lifeless, it would have been so easy just to add some flavor fluff like in rebel galaxy, visit a bar, with people, get some place specific music and visuals. Officers are nothing but stat sticks. In fact let me explain the crux of the problem by drawing comparison from world of warcraft and harry protter: In harry potter, wands are used for spell casting but are such a big deal and visible in the story that you know what they are and they make the universe feel complete. In WoW: They are stat sticks, something you forget you had and just use for stats exactly like officers here, wasted potential.That is why it is so painful to engage in all that space combat again and again, the space feel lifeless, like you are the only living thing in the galaxy. I understand your main thing was the gameplay and combat, i get it but you need to support it with other things. This could have been mount and blade in space easily. Why did mount and blade succeeded? Because outside of its outstanding combat ( just like this game), it had decent world building, there were lords who acted based on whats going on in the world, lords and ladies who talked, npc's who you would see face to face, so what if they had literally 2 lines of dialogue, it was still an improvement over a text box, It is even more painful when you see these gorgeous graphics but all this dead space. The only reason i considered rebel galaxy superior because it had this world building, world still felt shallow but it felt like a world, not a combat simulator. Remember why No Man's Sky failed? Trillions of planets that all felt same and lifeless? Here it is the same thing but here is is painful because it can be fixed so easily. As a side note: combat is meh compared to other RPG games, in space simulator genre, its pretty good ( but can you make the boarding a bit more interactive? Its a space sim not pokemon) I hope this wall of text explains your worries, again i played before and after writing this review  ( after since the reactions) I think it could be great but you need to work on the world building, it is simply inexcusable with such talent you guys got.

												A Freelancer-Style Space shooter with little rpg and the illusion of a sandbox.The main problem is... there is nothing to do. While the universe is huge, and filled with stations, orbital bodies and spaceships... everything is very generic and becomes boring quite quickly. Player interaction with the universe is rather pointless, things like trading and ""mining"" are not profitable enough to even bother with and almost all actions have no consequences for anyone. So, after a while you end up capturing random ships and towing them to station for sale, over and over again, because its the only way to actually make enough money to buy the higher tiers of ships.The gameplay is messed up so horribly, that a couple of patches will not turn this into a great game.Basically... just stay away from this game. Unless you can pick it up for less than 5 bucks. It'll do for an afternoon, but nothing else. "

												Fun at first, but a little more shallow than you'd think at first blush.  The combat is good, the graphics are good - but it will start to feel very repetitive and boring long before you discover/uncover the whole map.  At least it did for me.   For the asking price, I was expecting more gameplay depth.  It's a $35 game for the combat and graphics with a $15 game's depth of core gameplay mechanics?  That's my take, anyway.  Take with a grain of salt.			"

												Firstly, understand that although my review will say I've only logged 9 hours on this game, it's more like 20 because I played a lot in offline mode.This game is beautiful, both visually and with the music. But other than some eye candy and a few atmospheric soundtracks it doesn't feel like it has anything else going for it. Saving up for better ships is a slow grind, and combat becomes repetitive quickly. Once you get the better ships all you really accomplish is the ability to throw some more bullets/lasers at people at some different angles, but gameplay never fundamentally changes. Stronger enemies are just like the easier ones only they have more health and higher damage output, but you fight them all fundamentally the same way. The enemy AI is terrible; they have a self-preservation instinct akin to plastic ducks in a carnival shooting gallery. Killing enemies ranges from extremely easy to just downright tedious, but never feels challenging. The universe is clutterred with interesting stuff (real space doesn't have objects this close to each other) so there's no shortage of places to explore, but there's no real incentive to explore anything. One region might just be another solar system but with a blue nebula instead of a red one and the asteroids are made of some different resource. I'll give this game an alright/10. It's fun when you first pick it up, but playing for long periods will make the game stale quickly. I'm at a point where I want to play this game, but I just can't stomach flying around in space shooting at the same pirate ships to travel to some samey looking region- not for more than maybe 5 minutes at a time. I feel like there's nothing to do in this big universe the game presents. Hopefully the mod community will be able to salvage the game so I can feel like I got my money's worth.			"

												Pros:-It's pretty straightforward and fun. You don't need a month to learn all the controls.-lots of ships to collect and fill your garage-upgrades and things to spend money on-pretty good atmospheric space with things in itCons:-the ships feel a little same-y. After progressing from gunship through cruiser so far, there's little real difference-the missions feel a little same-y, side quests are just the same as the randomly generated quests. Main quests are only slightly different so far.-no dynamic economy, at least as far as I can tell. Gods are such small money compared to capturing ships and doing missions that you'll find yourself just hitting'sell all' instead of telling around for best pricesThis closest game to compare I've played is x2. This stacks up as a much simplified relative. It's more fun much faster, but there's also less depth. In x2 I would leave my computer running all day with time compression on and come back to see how much money I'd made reading. A game that can pay itself, and you build in the means to speed it up, should probably put a little more focus on fun. But it also was a much more engaging dog fighter. Here ask guns are on turrets, so the most effective combat is to just set them on automatic. Not the most engaging. The capture mechanic is decent, better than the x2 random bail out thing. But you can't command your own fleet and start and trade empire or manufacturing empire. There just seen to be fee ways to interact with the world. You can shoot things, scan them, grapple them, shoot them... I like the grapple mechanic by the way. But the ships don't feel different and lack a grand sense of scale. So yeah it's fun to capture and collect a bunch of ships, but the upgrades are a little wonky and there's not a ton to do outside of that. The weapons can be upgraded and swapped out, but all the other systems on the ship are fixed and can only have upgrades added. Why can't I customize whether I wasn't cloaking or a hanger? Style of pay is dictated by ship choice, not Games are cool and the most fun when you feel like you're discovering something special. An abandoned derelict that you can salvage for special items? Or one that's functional and maybe had a special feature. Hidden upgrades, officers, unique items that you can find as you explore would all help the depth of the game world. Overall 7.5/10Fun, but comes across a little flat. Could use some flair to make it feel more special.			"

												First off ignore my play time. I do most of my gaming at work and dont have an internet connection. Unfortunately Steam doesnt keep track of play time while in offline mode. As of writing this I have around 24 hours of gameplay in. In short this game is excellent and well worth the money.The universe is huge. And it would take a long while to fly from one side to the other. The ships are awesome. There is a lot to do.. You can be a trader, a pirate, a bounty hunter... The list goes on. It takes a lot of work to acquire new ships and level up. Not in a bad way.  I actually love it.. In my 24 hours of playtime I've only recently just captured a ship worth keeping and transferring to. Its not really grindy in my opinion as there is so much to do it seems you're all the time doing something different or new. I see that as a really good value for my money. I have only done 3 main/campaign quests at this point as you have to take time to level up and gear up for them. So its not a game you're going to beat within a few hours. Capturing ships better than yours is a real challenge and its very rewarding when you finally get one. So far Ive found capturing ships to be the funnest and most profitable thing to do. And when you finally get out of the starting gunship into something better it gets a little easier and much more profitable. The learning curve is easy. Not like learning X3 or anything. You can pick it up fairly quick.The game doesnt baby you.. You can run into a battleship that will destroy within minutes of starting the game so you always have to be careful and keep an eye out. There's always a challenge..It's not a game that will allow you to feel like a god that just steam rolls everything that comes along. I like that as it gives you something to strive for. However I will say now that I've gotten a better ship (Its a corvette btw) i come across a lot more ships that are weak or trivial. Its extremely cool when you come into an area with a bunch of them.. I just turn on Auto fire and watch my ship just destroy 5 or 6 ships within minutes.. It's awesome.So far the only things that Ive found to be less than great are the voice acting and traveling..The voice acting is far from good. Its not so bad that it destroys the campaign for you.. But its not good either lol. Your ships computer voice is great though and thats the one you'll hear 90% of the time. The traveling.. When you first start you dont really have a choice but to fly all the way to each location. As warp gates are expensive and not really an option at first. Worm holes do damage and really dont have enough of them to justify them as a good way to travel. Rifts help but they are kind of hard to stay in. So at first the traveling gets kind of old as the map is just so hufmge it can really take a long while to get from one point to another. But after you get a decent income going and you can afford the warp gates its not bad. All in all the game has been an excellent experience. And I feel the user rating should be quite a bit better than it is now. It's a game that I've quickly became addicted to and I already know I'll have hundreds of hours into before I get tired of it.If your looking for a good space rpg, sandbox, freelancer type game this one will not dissappoint.

												Very nice game, it really caught me right from the start. As with all space sims it takes a while to get used to the controls and UI, but if you've played space sims before it should not be a problem. Feels a bit like a combination of X3 and EVE online. Where the developers have chosen what they like the most about both games and thrown them together in a singleplayer epic space sim. I have not tried the campaign but the freeplay mode is great fun with very varied missions.Highly recommend to space nerds!			"

												Ok, to get the good stuff out of the way this is a vast open universe with many missions and some cool ship designs. Now for everything else... really this is just a shadow of freelancer, the game it tries so very hard to imitate, the UI is far clunkier in feel, the graphics though nice aren't as in your face and don't lead to an immersive feel. While it allows things like fighter wings and other ship systems that freelancer did not, the mod community has provided the majority of those things for freelancer. Even with the whole process of mission selection, buying, trading and the storyline freelancer sadly just does it better with the cut scenes and even just being able to talk to people and get rumors around the bar providing a much greater level of immersion.A perfect succesor this is not but if you enjoyed freelancer there is still probably a place on your shelf for this game.

								Starpoint Gemini 2 – ReviewHi everyone,This is my first ever review that I am writing.  I just bought the game last night and started playing this morning.  Before buying I read some other reviews just to get an idea if I should take the leap into the void.  Well, I took the leap (based on some good reports) and what I found was far from a void.  Here are some bulleted remarks:•	I was immediately impressed by the structure and layout of the game as soon as I entered. No nonsense.  Get in and get on with it.  I loved that.•	There is a lot of depth to the game with a creative insight to usability.  •	Personally I like the way the tutorial is incorporated into the start and the way that it is presented (simplicity and effectiveness).  Here are some thoughts:o	The font on the display was a little difficult for me to read (15`` screen, max settings), but that could be due to the screen size, not sure).o	At the start where you select from the three types of careers, it also might need a better font and colour scheme (just my personal opinion) to read a bit better. Everything still very good, don’t get me wrong.o	Would also advise to have a smart lady voice to read out tutorials as you go along, whilst displaying text (always keep the text).  Do not overcook and cause annoyance.o	Just mention within the tutorial that a “Collect all” indicator will pop up (after you destroyed an asteroid) once your close to the collectable. Was a bit unsure at first how I would collect, but became obvious when the pop up appeared to collect when I destroyed an asteroid up close.•	In- game graphics, display hub and layout is amazing. Great job.•	I absolutely love the small tutorial button, accessible at any time, especially when getting use to the game (keep it).•	Like that I can scroll up and down with mouse wheel in tutorial and other hud displays.•	Like that there is a info bubble over icons and other aspects.•	Love the idea of boarding and capturing ships and that you can do different things with those ships, brilliant.•	Great idea to be able to launch the whole or individually selected fighter wings and that there is criteria added to the fighter wings as well.•	Personally I like that there are asteroids all around to get some loot from and that it’s not just in pockets.I am a teacher by occupation and therefore I like clear and structured instructions.  I think the developers got this done well and that the ""polishing"" is going to make the tutorials and overall game experience even better and better.I love this game already and I have only been playing for a couple of hours.  I am super excited about what it is yet to deliver and the hours and hopefully years of joy I will get from venturing through this vast space full of life and challenges.If you love space sims you will not regret buying this game.  It is definitely worth the money for me below $17.I will try and write more reviews on the game as I continue to play.  Man, this is a lot of fun.			"

								Having had this game for quite some time but only having checked it out for a couple of minutes, today I decided to check it out how it has come along in the months since I originally bought it. Needless to say I was instantly hooked and immensely enjoying myself.I am a Freelancer fan and although this game is not the same, it bears some resemblance with it.For anyone looking for a very good looking space action/strategy/trade game with lots of depth and very nice graphics (and music - I just love the soundtrack !) I can heartily recommend Starpoint Gemini 2.One last thing I would like to mention : the developers of this game are very active in their community and reply almost instantly to questions / remarks / suggestions.

								Haven't played long, but it is turning out to be a fun game. The combat is a little difficult at first, but if you get a pirate that is much higher than you, just use the go to and get out. I am looking forward to them adding stuff to this. It really needs a lot done. I wish it would tell me in a onscreen scolling text or something what I just picked up. I also wish there was some indication how close I need to do to do certain things. Like how close to do a Repair or scan. You apparently need to be within like 100.			"

								Awesome game. Even in Beta it is a well done piece of work. With the polish that comes with the Beta process and finishing up a lot of things it is set to be the absolute best SciFi/trading/Space sim/ rpg out there. Ill give it 4.5 stars out of 5 as is stands right now. Good job LGM.			"

								Though still in beta this game has the potential to be one of the greatest space sims thus far. It's not focused just on combat like most others seem to be but exploration and trading. I'm glad I found this game.			"

								For an early access, I do love the game ! The graphic options are limited for now but still looks great ! I'd like to see the joystick support ASAP because the control on the keyboard and mouse is good enough but you can feel that the gameplay would be better with a joystick.Even for an early access , i'd recommend the game as it is , in his current state, immersive enough to have fun while testing the game ! Usually testing comes with horrible bugs , unplayable moments, unstable graphics or random crashing which as for now starpoint gemini 2 havent produced.			"

								I buy a ton of early access games, they are the best in my opinion, this game is by far the best I have purchased. Yes it has bugs in it, you will have those at this current stage. This game though allows for a great deal of fun, right out of the gate you feel like you are a part of the world but your path is not yet defined. You get the fun of an RPG with the twitch of a TPS and all the enjoyment of space! I love EvE online but I can't afford to dedicate the time or money to the game at this time and this game is like having a small version of EvE in my opinion.Keep up the great work devs!			"

								If you happen to be a fan of science fiction and flying around in space, Then this game happens to be for you. There is no out of flight sections of this game or any gun fights that don't end in space. This game is purely a fly around and shoot things kind of game. The world is open to you from the start but you will find yourself overwhelmed in any other sections of space past the first planets, You can mine for ore's for money to buy over priced weapons and ships or you can destroy enemy ships (or allied) for higher grade loot and income, That said..Mining is safe and unrewarding, Unless you find yourself in the deepest part of space mining in the most dangerous of places you will not find anything worth the time spent. Meaning most of you're money will come from hunting down bandits right? Well, even this can become unrewarding quickly. Depending on you're situation you may find yourself battered from all sides or simply obliterating you're opposition, Movement quickly becomes clumsy in combat and you will find you're ship is rather slow compaired to everything else. That said, Combat can easily be just as rewarding as it is dissipointing, The game in the beginning will feel slow but more options will rise up to meet you as you advance to better ships. The game is also in Beta and many of these issues will probably be fixed, I'd buy it again, So maybe you will enjoy it.			"

								So far I am liking on the game, though the only issue i see is that a remove turrets button would be nice. i figure you then can add/remove turrets at your lesiure to play your way. Also, adding cost to adding turrets would be good, i mean sure you buy the original one but wouldn't it be true to pay for another turret?			"

								As it stands now, even in Beta, it's a gorgeus game, and you can have great fun with it if you are a fan of the X4 genre or the more arcadish space sims out there. Well worth the money asked for.But I feel it needs a little push in some directions. It can become much more than it is now, if given enough deep and polish. For instance, weapon stats are confusing, and they have no description. Uniqueness and a little story for each weapon/ship/commodity in the world would make it deeper. The huge starmap needs more deepness too, the different factions are not different enough, more involvement in each of them would make it more fun. You need to love some factions and hate others, to be really immersed in the world. Currently, there are only good guys, and bad guys. You shoot the bad guys, that's it :-). Voiceovers and images of the different factions are a must to achieve this.Balance is still a little off, but it's to be expected in beta after all. You can destroy large enemy ships (destroyers or battleships) with your starter ship, without much sweating, but overall it's very fun and asks you for fairly involved gameplay, you need to use special powers and equipment to see it through the large battles unscathed.I know for a fact that the team is constantly updating and expanding the game daily, so I have high hopes for it all to be fullfilled in the end.Must buy for every space combat, space trader lover out there!

								Starpoint Gemini 2 – ReviewHi everyone,This is my first ever review that I am writing.  I just bought the game last night and started playing this morning.  Before buying I read some other reviews just to get an idea if I should take the leap into the void.  Well, I took the leap (based on some good reports) and what I found was far from a void.  Here are some bulleted remarks:•	I was immediately impressed by the structure and layout of the game as soon as I entered. No nonsense.  Get in and get on with it.  I loved that.•	There is a lot of depth to the game with a creative insight to usability.  •	Personally I like the way the tutorial is incorporated into the start and the way that it is presented (simplicity and effectiveness).  Here are some thoughts:o	The font on the display was a little difficult for me to read (15`` screen, max settings), but that could be due to the screen size, not sure).o	At the start where you select from the three types of careers, it also might need a better font and colour scheme (just my personal opinion) to read a bit better. Everything still very good, don’t get me wrong.o	Would also advise to have a smart lady voice to read out tutorials as you go along, whilst displaying text (always keep the text).  Do not overcook and cause annoyance.o	Just mention within the tutorial that a “Collect all” indicator will pop up (after you destroyed an asteroid) once your close to the collectable. Was a bit unsure at first how I would collect, but became obvious when the pop up appeared to collect when I destroyed an asteroid up close.•	In- game graphics, display hub and layout is amazing. Great job.•	I absolutely love the small tutorial button, accessible at any time, especially when getting use to the game (keep it).•	Like that I can scroll up and down with mouse wheel in tutorial and other hud displays.•	Like that there is a info bubble over icons and other aspects.•	Love the idea of boarding and capturing ships and that you can do different things with those ships, brilliant.•	Great idea to be able to launch the whole or individually selected fighter wings and that there is criteria added to the fighter wings as well.•	Personally I like that there are asteroids all around to get some loot from and that it’s not just in pockets.I am a teacher by occupation and therefore I like clear and structured instructions.  I think the developers got this done well and that the ""polishing"" is going to make the tutorials and overall game experience even better and better.I love this game already and I have only been playing for a couple of hours.  I am super excited about what it is yet to deliver and the hours and hopefully years of joy I will get from venturing through this vast space full of life and challenges.If you love space sims you will not regret buying this game.  It is definitely worth the money for me below $17.I will try and write more reviews on the game as I continue to play.  Man, this is a lot of fun.			"

								Voice feedback gets a little repetative, UI is clunky, too big and seems aimed at a touch interface, ship control needs a lttle more finesse but overall I like this game, it's like single player Eve Online (not so big and varied) but it has potential. Recommened if you're into Freelancer etc.			"

								I'll update my review as the game continues development.7/19/2014, First ImpressionsI bought Startpoint Gemini 2, in spite of not really caring too much for the first one, but since it was on sale, and since it seemed to be so popular, I thought I would give this development studio another shot.  So far, I am glad I did.  Being an early access game, I expected some features needing polishing, and other features not yet to be fully implemented, which indeed is the case at the time of this initial post.  Having said that, I must say I find the gameplay mechanics very interesting, and the combat compelling.  If you are a fan of the old ""X"" games (except for X: Rebirth), you'll find some familiar concepts such as trading and boarding.  I also enjoyed how functional the developers made their starmap, making it easy to find missions, side jobs, or other distractions, whilst providing a wealth of information such as reputation and factions of each sector.  My only complaint here, is the lack of a legend.  I hope, in the near future, that will be provided as an on/off toggle.The combat is fun and flexible.  With the ability to upgrade, enhance, or otherwise customise your ship, each ship type you are capable of flying provides a wealth of possible combat configurations to fit your playstyle, or to try out different tactics.  I found the tactical overlay in combat especially helpful, though I had to manually assign a hotkey for it.  Of course, being an early access game, there are several areas upon which they can improve, such as providing a text-based battle log, or some other method of communicating more detail on what exactly is happening.  For example, when targeting an enemy, you have no consistent view of their shields.  There is some kind of HUD element that pops up when you first target them, but it does not stay up, and there is no clue on how to consistently get the information available.  It would be nice to be able to see, at least, the target's shield status on a consistent basis.  Likewise, critical hits are communicated, but no details are provided, such as what systems were critically hit.The Skills & Perk system of your officer is pretty cool.  It adds a lot of depth by allowing skills to provide several affects at once, while at the same time keeping the amount of button mashing (or mouse clicking) to a minimum.I will say one thing in this ""first impressions"" entry, and that is I was disappointed at not being able to command a fleet whilst directly controlling a ship of my own.  It is my hope that the developers have plans to allow this, as some of the game menus and screens suggest (such as ""fleet management""...implying the ability to manage more than one ship in your fleet).

								Amazing, Simply put this game is a good choice for your money. I'm not one to push Early access games's ( well maybe a little) but this game does bring some well devloped art into a space rpg, alas there is no story(yet, dev's are working on it) So if you enjoy games where your the captain of a ship(only three-4 crew members+ some # of flying bodybags) you'll find the appealing. I'll put it this way. I was playing games that take forever to get into. I have yet gone back to those games after installing this.  "

								Great Potential.I have not touched the first Gemini, this is my first time into Gemini world. But I have been a huge fan for Freelancer, X3 series and EVE. Right now it feels like this game is pretty close to Freelancer in the sense of combat and universe design. It provides a huge universe for you to explore, combat whatever or whoever you see as enemy and different ways to gather credit.So far I think there are several problems with this game.1. The universe feels detached from the player. Of course this has something to do with the absense of campaign and a main plot, but the universe still feels lonely, even worse than X3.2. Some of the UIs need more work. Sometimes it is difficult to find out more information about an item. I hope the game can impliment something like the info page in EVE, which gives a full list of all the details about an item and you do not have to go around the place to find out or get confused.3. The combat. The combat is very similar to X3, you have several batteries on diffent side of your ship and they can be controlled independent of the ship. This is OK but when you are engaged in a multi ship combat, you will most likely lose the sense of situation. I hope a third person view can be implimented. Also the weapon/damage/energy balance feels a little strange. Most weapon will suck your energy dry while taking less than 25% of your enemy's shield. It looks like it is encouraging hit and run tactics which is perfectly fine for small agile ships. What bothers me is the big boys like battleships do not get a substantial upgrade on the battery energy. Other than those, I think this is an exciting game and it has a lot of potential.PS, it looks like the game has some hints of a fleet feature. I hope they can do it right because fleet in X3 is a nightmare. Eithre do it right, or don't do it at all.			"
