												Firstly, a TL;DR for the lazy reader:+ Great Art and Music+ Great lore, for those interested in the Endless setting+ Great design and interpretation of the rogue-like genre+ For 10 bucks, you can enjoy at least a solid 6-10 hours of gameplay and potentially dozens more.+ Multiplayer is finally fixed and well designed.- However, it is heavily team dependant and one player can genuinely kill three others by making rash decisions. With friends, this game should be a blast.- The game’s mechanics may not be for you, read section “Game Mechanics” for more info.- Some minor bugsRead More:Dungeon of the Endless follows the lore of previous games by Amplitude Studios (Endless Space & Endless Legend) and presents it this time, in a “rogue-like” fashion. The objective is simple: Explore the dungeon, search the rooms and then get the dust crystal through swarms of aliens into the teleporter for the next floor. The mechanics of this game are somewhat profound and relatively unique, based on a turn-like system that dispenses new events after a door in the dungeon is opened. This isn’t to be mistaken with the fact that the game is very much in real-time, players will have to make very quick decisions on defensive relocations, retreats and emergency use of skills/medkits. I imagine the most convenient mechanics comparison to be drawn here is to that of Faster Than Light. Game Mechanics:The biggest design component of the game leads me to warn potential buyers to possible disappointment- heed my word. Suppose the main feature of rogue-likes that people enjoy is the risk: reward decisions one has to make. This is tied with the subsequent “snowballing” of a character’s strengths and the increasing challenges; item collections in Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac. At first glance, Dungeon of the Endless may not meet these expectations, decisions to develop one’s character is often met with only simply a new ability or meagre stat boosts. This isn’t an inherent flaw in the design but rather, a choice made to cater to players having to combine all of the resources: Industry, to build modules for resources and defense, food for character development and medkits, sciences for researching better modules. A player that may only enjoy, say, the character development of a roguelike will be met with disappointment here as one cannot neglect the other aspects of the game in order to succeed- the very same reason why Amplitude has curbed the potential of characters clearing whole floors by themselves. However, when said mechanics are utilised properly the game truly shines. Players will find themselves scrutinising their floor’s layout, optimising where to allocate power and resources, what resources are most required, whether or not to save resources for the next floor, if characters should be replaced by newfound possible companions, the list goes on. Decision making is the core component of the game that gives it drive, anticipation of resources desperately needed, whether it be dust or a replacement for a fallen companion will lead players into a game that forces them to make decisions. Make no mistake, the game is balls to the walls difficult and will not hesitate to stomp on your carefully knitted floor plans whenever it gets the chance. For this, I commend the developers in creating a relatively fresh balance of mechanics in a recently inflated genre of “rogue-likes”. Multiplayer:Multiplayer is also quite entertaining with gameplay identical to that of singleplayer except with one character per player. This leads to less micro-managing and a larger pool of resources, making the game easier only when players can cooperate properly and plan ahead together. The biggest complaint I have about this however, is the lack of a save-multiplayer feature, thus games can often stretch out for multiple hours and leave players exhausted or unwilling to continue. Furthermore, the lack of a host migration system means that if a host leaves the game—you’re screwed. Amplitude must address these features as they are critical to the quality of gameplay and I find myself only playing alone or with a friend instead of with other players. Art & Music:Other than that, the only noteworthy mention of the game is its further development of the Endless lore, which I am a particular fan of and DotE does not fail to impress, new characters and revelations about the world left me relatively keen on the story of the game. Furthermore, secret character interactions are revealed when specific combinations of characters are placed in a party, leading to a more interesting play through and for the eager player, experimentation with compositions. This lore is accompanied by a pixel art style that is of an impressive quality and the usual stature of music that amplitude has impressed me with so far. Though these are subjective and you in particular may not agree with me.Final Judgement:For the singleplayer experience alone, I recommend the game for its listed retail price. On sale, it’s a must-buy. Though multiplayer bogs the game’s overall quality down, Amplitude is known to respond very well to player criticisms and I am confident they will address these issues. Overall a fantastic little game. On my first playthrough, I fought hard to get the crystal to the elevator and in my rash attempt to escape, left my other party members behind to get eaten by aliens. Made me think “Would play again”- and I did, a lot.Update as of 27th April 2015:- There is a save feature for multiplayer now, this was much desired and a great improvement.- However, the community has slowly died down. It is not impossible to find a match depending on the hour of the day, however there are far fewer lobbies than a few months ago. I would recommend searching globally and not just within your region when searching for a game.- Multiplayer overall works well now, however there has been observations of a recent bug that removes items from the characters of certain players whilst they return when traded to others. Hopefully this is fixed by amplitude.			"

Warning: The following was composed while the game was released in Alpha 0.1.0. Please understand that the game is still in development and when the game is updated the information in this review may be obsolete. When the development surpasses Alpha 0.1.0 you may be able to use this review to compare how the game has changed over development. IntroductionRogue-like games are normally games which offer some form of level randomization and permanent death; your character dies and you must either start over or keep going until everything is lost. These types of games are normally unforgiving. If you have an interest in Rogue-like games and think that an intermixed concept of base defense is a good idea, keep reading. If you do not like traditional Rogue-like games where it is turn based, you might still like this since it is a hybred of turn-based and real-time with a pause feature. However if you do not like either concept of Rogue-like “permadeath” or base defense you may want to consider doing more research or finding something else. Also with a Rogue-like game the graphics are not normally the main focus, thus if you are turned off by anything below 3D graphics you should consider something else.This will be a breakdown of concept and features, atmosphere and stability.Concept / FeaturesThe concept of mixing Rouge-like with base defense is interesting; it gives an interesting way to progress. Including Dungeon of the Endless uses real-time with waves verse the traditional turn based method.Right now the game has three available resource types, Food, Dust (energy) and Industry (tech). Food is used to recruit new members to your team, heal them and level them up. Industry is used to create defenses in powered rooms. Dust is used in two ways first to buy things from random merchants and to power rooms beyond the starting room with the core. Dust currently resets every level while Food and Industry do not.  Progressing in the dungeon you will have to make decisions on if it is correct to save Food to heal or on the chance to recruit someone or even to level someone up. The current max level is five and five makes a large difference verses a level one however it is expensive.The player will have to decide what rooms to open to since they will not have enough Dust to supply all the rooms at the start. When you have access to merchant the player will have to decide if they are going to give up Dust used for defenses to buy equipment or sell equipment for dust. Defenses can be used to also increase your income while exploring.Progression also at this time also includes finding chests and blueprints for building new defenses.The interface is rather clean and easy to use after you have it down. It also allows short-cut keys while building defenses, so you can hold shift and click to place multiple defenses instead of reusing the menu. The game also employs a monster wave system, where waves occur over time from unpowered rooms. Thus if the room remains unpowered monsters come from the vast darkness to kill the team.The overall objective is to find the room to the next level and then move the core there using one of the heroes to do so. You will find that the rooms begain to lose power while doing this and waves of monsters start to show up to stop you.AtmosphereOverall the feeling is deployed correctly for alpha; the story is short and sweet and not overly lengthy or bulky. Basically your team of two is on a ship and become stranded and must progress through the dungeon. The generated two characters the player start with have a slight background to have the player interested and give a hint on how they should be used to progress.   The graphics are a very nicely done pixel art format, with effects and seem to pay homage to older graphical related Rouge-likes very well. Personally I found the graphics enjoyable. Music was interesting and seems to fit well with the current atmosphere of the game however it may become bland unintentionally over extended play.StabilityOverall the game /did not/ hang or crash on older machines that lacked the graphics requirement. I tried on older desktop machines and laptops under windows Vista and Windows 7; it was pretty efficient and was not a complete resource hog on the system. I also did not run into any critical errors which cased instability and the program failed to run. While I’m unable to speak for everyone and their systems it seems to be overall pretty solid. Most of the time games in alpha or beta still are unstable while this game seems to be nicely polished in respect to stability in the listed windows environments. ConclusionI would currently recommend this to someone who is /interested and willing/ to try a Rogue-like combined with base defense which is implemented in hybred fasion of real-time and turn-based. This game will most likely have a very interesting development process from Amplitude Studios and I look forward to it.Work HistoryPosted: Dec 11, 2013 @ 6:09pmUpdated: Dec 11, 2013 @ 11:15pmSlight EditsUpdated: Nov 7, 2014 @ 12:28pmAdded Work History.None of the complied review text was changed.Changed text formating slightly.

												Early Access ReviewThis is what happens when your FTL crew crashes into Binding of Issac's basement.It's pretty pretty and painfully punishing, Endless is entertaining to say the least.Update, post-release review.This is a great dungeon crawler, highly recommended for anyone who enjoys resource and combat management, and beautiful pixel art.It should be noted that gameplay is not focused on direct combat control. The heroes can be told where to go, and each have a couple abilities that can be activated to assist in combat, but they will auto-attack enemies in the room. Although combat is real-time, progression is door-based (basically turn-based), with hero ability cooldowns, resource collection, and research, all on a per-door opened basis.I don't know much about multiplayer, other than each player controls one hero, up to four players.The developers are active in the community and even more on their own website. Thanks to the team for consistant updates and continued support for the game!			"

												Dungeon of the Endless wears a leather jacket, has a greaser pompadour, and smokes cigarettes in the bathroom. Old Man Tower Defense catches him.""You can't smoke in here,"" says Old Man Tower Defense. Dungeon of the Endless puts out his cigarette on the old man's face and steals his style.""Get lost,"" says Dungeon of the Endless, and Old Man Tower Defense shuffles back to his room at the old genres' home.4X Strategy Nerd is walking down the hall as Dungeon of the Endless walks out of the bathroom, smelling like bathroom soap and Camels. DotE shakes him down for his gameplay elements and stuffs him in a locker.After school, DotE hangs out with his friend Ritchie ""Rogue-Like"" Valens.""I wanna put a band together,"" says DotE.""Yeah? Watcha thinkin?"" says Ritchie.""I got all these things I stole from people at school,"" says DotE.Ritchie looks at these Tower Defense elements and these 4X strategy elements and wonders if it could work. He looks at DotE and sees that look in his face - if he could trick Principal RTS into eating fifteen cans of Spam to get people to believe in base-building and resource management again, he could do this.""Yeah. Yeah,"" says Ritchie. ""It'll take some thinking, but we could make this work.""			"

												This game is the prime example of the modern roguelike done right.Before playing Dungeon of the Endless, I've played a HUGE host of roguelikes from Angband to Tales of Maj'Eyal to Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. As diverse as the settings and gimmicks are, roguelikes have some things in common - as you get more and more powerful and you explore the world, the game tries to match your power with more powerful foes or new mechanics, and throughout the way the game tries to kill you when you make a wrong decision, get in a wrong area, or do a wrong step. This is not necessarily a bad thing - it gives a sense of challenge and a thrill that gives roguelikes its addictive charm.Most roguelikes also feature a huge number of mechanics and statistics that can be very daunting - for example, Tales of Maj'Eyal has at least six unique resources (health, mana, stamina, rage, hate, equilibrium), seven stats, at least 26 different types of damage, saving throws for physical, spell, and mind damage, resistances, resistance penetration, five types of speed (global, movement, spell, attack, mental)...you get it. The more unorthodox Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead has a complex crafting system, twenty-nine skills ranging from computer knowledge to tailoring expertise, and at least 102 feats for your character. All of this can be incredibly daunting to face for newbies and is a staple of the genre.Dungeon of the Endless, however, breaks from that mold. The concepts and challenges are simple: find the exit, bring the Crystal to the exit, defend the crystal carrier against waves of enemies. There are only eight statistics all in all, with each character possessing a set of passive and active skills that will be seen as the character levels up. The skills and statistics are simple to understand and make use of.Compared to most roguelikes, Dungeon of the Endless is relatively gimmick-free: there is one non-random gimmick about characters killing one another due to their relationship, which is incredibly frustrating but is easily avoided in your next playthrough (unlike unbeatable scenarios in FTL or some ""trap"" areas in Tales of Maj'Eyal). If you lose, it's not the fault of the game as it usually is in roguelikes - it's all yours. Maybe you didn't think about watching your carrier's back; maybe you neglected defending a certain chokepoint, leading to your party getting flanked and killed. Since you know it's your mistake, you can determine what you did wrong and how you can prevent it next time. Not only is it a new game every single time, but you learn and refine your strategy, and you buckle down and see if you can make it to a deeper floor with your experience this time.Dungeon of the Endless represents what a modern roguelike should aspire to be: a highly replayable game that provides a genuine, fair challenge that you can climb through and improve your skill in every playthrough.(I still like Tales of Maj'Eyal better. :3)10/10 gg			"

												A game where strategy is life, every pixel in the game is another reason to buy it.Pros+ Great level design, and characters ""Also has characters from tf2"".+ Lovely soundtracks, effects and animations.+ Very challenging rogue-like that requires thinking and fast responses.+ A lot of characters to choose from, each with their own abilities and equipment.+ Find, levelup and upgrade your characters using your resources.+ Randomized levels that brings out a lot of monsters and holds a lot of secrets.+ Several ships to unlock, each containing either a new game mode or gives perks and vices.+ Really addictive to play on single-player since its randomized and hard.+ Very fun to play with friends on multiplayer with a PeerToPeer system and up to 4-players.+ A lot of secrets to unlock, stories to discover and pictures to add to the gallery.Cons- It uses physx, so you might get some poor fps performance on old systems.- Multiplayer is really fun, but it sucks that if I join another host it will overwrite my previous save with my friends.- Same thing but for singleplayer, it sucks that I cant create a new game without overwriting my previous one.Example, I have a save in endless mode floor 15+ , and I want to start a new game to try out the other spaceship perks, but at the sametime I really don't want to delete that endless mode save ....And devs stated they're working on the console port so I dont think this will change anytime soon.Rating 9/10, Very addictive and so initiative, has a lot of content to unlock and so many things to achieve.Imo, its fun to play alone as much as its fun to play with others.I highly recommend buying the crystal edition, it unlocks a couple of new modes and just supports these awesome devs.			"

												This review was done with the Founder Pack version.Pretty fun game from what I've played so far. It's a tower defense dungeon crawler/RPG. For the stage the game is at the moment I think it's very polished and the artwork is fantastic. The game generates random dungeons so there is a lot of replayabilty.  Another thing that I thought that was neat was DOTE follows the lore of Endless Space (Another fantastic game, especially if you like a more simplistic Civ game in space). Which I think is a nice touch.   I'd highly recommend this game if you like FTL (Faster than Light). Pretty similar gameplay but in a dungeon and you have to protect your Crystal reactor. Which you use to power up rooms with open slots for upgrades for industry,agriculture and science. Dust much like Endless Space is the currency but also doubles as a fuel source in this game. Which you would use to power up the rooms or to buy items from the merchant. Also you can level up your heros with agricuture, instead of experience like Endless Space. I think it would have been cool to get Xp from slaying mobs but it is still early access so the developers may change that (The developer is very active with the community and takes feedback. They also have votes for changes in the game via their forums that you got from buying the game).   I'm going to play this game a lot more and would recommend it but to someone who hasn't played Endless Space (They use a lot of of the resources, tech trees and lore, that Endless Space uses.) or doesn't likes tower defense games. You should probably wait until it's on sale or when it's out of early access (As of right now there is only 3 levels).Founder Pack version notes:   This part of the review will go over the Founder pack extras that are included in-game and cross game. I'll add in the other in-game items and extras once they are released (Or if I even remember to :D). The to be released items and extras are the Ship Pack: The Library, the Hero: Josh 'Ntello, the Official soundtrack and Vaulterskins for Endless Legends (Game will be out next 2014).   At the moment you get 50% off for Endless Space and the expansion pack (This is an awesome game, a more simplicated Civ game in space with tons of lore), 2 community badges on the Amplitude forums (So you can feel special over people with no badges, just kidding) and The Vaulter faction for Endless Space. The Vaulter faction for Endless Space is a bit disapointing for me at least.   I had a chance to play today and they do have nice stats and nice abilites but the ships were disapointing and also that there was no introduction video for their faction, like other factions have. They're really similar to the United Empire ships. Unlike the the Piligrims ships where you can see the differences in ship design there is little to none with the Vaulters. They just seem to be reskined United Empire ships like with the Sheredyn faction. Where as it's understandable with Sheredyn faction sense they're still close to the United Empire and were the Emperors  personal guards. But other then that, as of now the Founder pack was worth it (My opinion). Hopefully they will redesign the ships and add a introduction video in a future update.   Founder Pack and can be a hit and miss for some and would recommend that you buy the Pixel pack instead, if you're unsure. Amplitude have been known to have an option to upgrade for Endless Space so it's possible that you will be able to upgrade later but at the same time it's a ""Founder pack"" it may be limited time only.Update: Now that the game has officially been released, a couple of things have changed. See below.- Currency is now randomized (FIDS) and is not just Dust. FIDS is Food, Industry, Dust and Food.- Science is now used to update modules and you research via Endless Artefact.- Updated the intro movie, main menu and some parts of the Hero UI. (I like it)- Soundtrack has been updated.- You can now save items in a backpack now, that are not in your heros inventory for the next level. (I was waiting so long for this)- Ships can be unlocked now, by completing certain conidtions in a successful playthough.- Heros can be unlocked now, by meeting them in a playthrough and meeting certain conditions.- Monuments also have been added which give random buffs or debuff for a  random duration.- And a multiplayer mode has been added but have yet to try it.- You have to click exit to move to the next level.- Loading screen to next level has been changed.- 13 levels to complete a playthough. Unlimited levels, if you use the Drill ship. (Unlockable)- Steam cards and Steam achievements have also been added with DOTE's release.My thoughts; game is amazing now that it has released and awesome updates to the DOTE. Updates will probably be continued just like it's sister games ot the Endless Universe.			"

												I had a review for this before. But that was when it was in early access.Now this is a review for the game now it has been released.You should be buying this already. Hell, you should have already bought it.Here's the deal. Do you like tower defence? Do you like roguelikes? Do you like dungeon crawling strategy type games? If the answer to all three is yes, then I can imagine your trepidation at hearing that this game combines all three, as I was nervous too. I mean there IS such a thing as too much of a good thing, and too many cooks spoil the broth, and sometimes many great things added together do not make an awesome thing...But in this case you can lay your fears to rest. Dungeon of the Endless is an incredible game, so much fun, brutally difficult and very rewarding. It requires quick thinking, strategic planning, and a buttload of blind stupid balls-to-the-walls courage at times.The BAD parts of this game is that the view is very zoomed in, and there are only two states to the view. Zoomed right the hell in, or zoomed right the hell out so it looks like a map screen. This DOES make things slightly awkward, especially if you have split your party to explore a particularly large dungeon, or if an attack comes from various areas of the map.Secondly it's unforgivingly hard, even on ""Too Easy"" mode. The game lies. Too Easy is still brutally hard. You will lose party members. You will get two floors with a new team member unscathed, only to have them die suddenly and unexpectedly during the rush to get the crystal to the next floor before you can unlock him or her fully.Thirdly the pixelly graphics may not appeal to some. To me, personally, they are amazing, I love them. They've got a lot of charm, BUT I recognise that it isn't always everyone's thing. It CAN also make combat extremely confusing. Granted you don't have to directly target any enemies, but it's still difficult to watch lots of things at once.Finally the control system takes a little getting used to. It's simple enough to navitage everything via right clicks and left clicks and such but getting used to the UI and how it does equipping and everything is .... well it feels slightly counter-intuitive. An ability to click-drag items about would have been nice for example, and a quicker way to open/close inventory/stat panels too...Now for the good stuff:Music? Really nice. Not too epic, sadly, but not annoying at all, or obnoxiously loud and grating, nor does it overwhelm you. The devs know when to use what music and it's very apparent that in that aspect their sound design is definately on the ball.Gameplay mechanics? rock solid. Resource management and building, turret defence/augmentation placement, power management and placement, the Risk/reward nature of opening just one door or many doors for the added XP/loot multiplier at the risk of being overrun by swarms of enemies, the various different types of enemies and their priority targets, the sheer volume of characters and skills and strengths... The pure joy of opening a door and finding a merchant or item box and being able to equip something awesome is amazing. Finding cool little things like Steles or Research Artefacts is also great fun.Also this game has an amazing, rather dark sense of humour. Characters make quips as they traverse between levels and as they open certain doors, they talk to each other, they crack jokes... The item/skill/module descriptions as well are ALWAYS worth reading too for a good chuckle.As for a game that's come through Early Access? Incredible results. It's come out so polished and refined, and so full of meat and bones that it's become an even greater game for all the feedback the fans gave it. This is well worth your money and absolutely a lot of fun.Just be sure to prepare yourself for inevitable demise.			"

Early Access Review
								General synopsis of the game:This game is actually surprisingly deep once you figure it out.  It tricks you into thinking its just a roguelike dungeon crawler.  And if thats how you treat it, you will not last past the first floor.  It centers around exploring each level room by room, and once you locate the exit to the level, moving your power source to the exit.  You have to place your heroes tactically (at choke points basically), and build defenses around those heroes to harden their key positions around your power source.  This usually leaves only one hero remaining to explore.  Enemies spawn in random unpowered rooms you have discovered.  So, sometimes one of your heroes may get overwhelmed, and you will have to take advantage of the handy pause feature to make sure one of that hero is not getting totally butt-r***ed.  And, if he is, then you need to figure out which hero you can send to reinforce him.  Or, you can activate one of his, unique to each hero, cooldown skills.  Which will give him a temporary boost in combat.  Or, you could order him to run away.  Fleeing is always a viable option in this game.  The in-game currency revolves around entering new rooms.  For each new door you open you get a set amount of resources and/or currency which allows you to build extra defenses, hire another hero, level up your existing heroes, research better defenses, heal your heroes in combat, power new rooms (to set up new defenses), or buy new gear for your heroes.  Once you have opened a door, you cannot close it.  So, you have to be careful not to expose a flank route to your power source by brainlessly opening doors.Thats kind of it in a nutshell.  I obviously recommend it, even in its alpha stage.  It has not crashed once for me, and is pretty content rich.  I can't wait for the game to be content complete.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is probably the best rogue like dungeon crawler that I'll ever play, because it takes the genre and adds a tower defense mechanic to it with a science fiction theme. The object is to explore randomly generated floors all while defending your crystal. The crystal gets used to power rooms that you'll place defenses and harvesters that bring in extra science, food and industry for every new door that you open. Once you discover the exit, one of your party members needs to lug that crystal from the elevator to the exit as the floor floods with enemies. Any party member not in the room with the exit gets left behind if you chose to exit without them.Your characters will defend a room automatically and fix any damaged equipment if there's nothing happening. You only need to have your people in the right room at the right time. Its a fun and casual way to play the game. If someone gets too low on health, you can click a medical bag near your character's card to use food for more health. Some difficulties even replenish your health for each room or wave of monsters that you clear. You can spend food on each character to level up. The more rooms of a floor that you clear out, the greater chance of enemy waves attacking. There are still rooms full of enemies, but its the waves that make things a true challenge. These waves will spawn in any room that isn't powered. Your foes can't go through doors and they'll only spawn in rooms you've uncovered so its best when you start a new floor to choose one door and work down that path instead of opening all four doors to each elevator.You've got your choice of four characters from the start and plenty to unlock as you progress. You can find new recruits and purchase them with food, but that doesn't mean they're unlocked. In order to unlock them you need to have and keep them for at least a floor. The game lets you have a maximum of four per party and it can be difficult juggling them, because you can only control four at once. Under normal circumstances, I have three of them guard the crystal and explore with one.Dungeon of the Endless has an amazing multiplayer that gives each player one character. Its a much easier experience. You pick a server locally, with your friends or even global. Then select who you want to be or let the game chose randomly and hop into a game. Once it starts no one else can join, even if a player drops out. When a character dies, they can't be revived and this goes for single player too! Instead you'll need to find a new character in the dungeon and recruit them. If you have more than one character under your control, you can pass them to another player. If you play global, its just as smooth as someone in your own region. The only issue that I have with the multiplayer is when the host leaves, the game ends!The controls are easy, right click to move. That's it. Right click a door to open it and watch your character go to the door. Right click to interact with something. Right click your character icon to open their stats. Of course there are still hot keys and you can scroll the screen or focus in on your character. If you ever need to see the map, mouse wheel back to see the entire dungeon along with icons where the players, enemies and highlights are. Even see unopened doors in red. Its all streamlined, then mouse wheel forward again. Again, its super easy, a joy to play.Along the way you'll find merchants to sell you things, but the game doesn't bog you down in equipment. Most characters have two or three equipment slots. There are science crystals that you spend science to research upgrades. You'll need to wait a while and open more doors before the research is complete, so don't spend science to research then exit the floor immediately. The recruits and merchants you find will also be attacked, so you'll need to defend them or they'll die.There are plenty of things to find throughout the rooms: treasure chests, capsules to unlock at the cost of industry and even things that give you science, industry or food. Everything takes a second or two to unlock. Even doors take a while to open, but once they're open they can't be closed. An odd thing about the game is when you open a door, you've commit to walking into the room beyond it. So if its full of enemies, you will still walk in. Even a room full of enemies doesn't feel like a threat, you can still fallback to a room full of turrets that you've setup.As for placing defenses, you can't just dump a bunch of turrets into a room, you need empty modules in a room to place modules. Some rooms don't even have any modules available, but 90% of them do and the trick is powering the rooms. You've got a limited amount of power your crystal can generate. If the crystal takes damage, it can power fewer rooms. Of course exploring will find more power to beef up your crystal and charge more areas. In terms of defenses, you've got health, defense and weapons. Defense things such as holograms that will attract enemies. Weapons like turrets, Tesla and sentries. New things can be unlocked at science crystals.Once you find the exit, its best to deactivate some of the powered rooms in order to power ones along the path. After they're powered setup defenses, because when you pick up your crystal every door opens automatically. So every undiscovered enemy is activated, but more pressing than that are the waves of enemies that spawn.Instead of classes, there are characters. Each character has their own stats for speed, damage, health and so on. Every piece of equipment can change those stats slightly. Things will boost your speed while lowering your damage per second. Some characters use swords, others have a pistol or a gun. Characters all have their own defense needs, some rely on armor, shields or devices. These characters all look and feel unique to be and play as.Dungeon of the Endless does have only fifteen floors before you'll need to play again from the start. So there is an end game for anyone that needs a goal. Its just reaching that fifteenth floor that is a challenge. Floors become longer, more difficult and dangerous, yet still doable.Since the game revolves around a sci-fi setting, the premise is simple, you've crash landed in your escape pod. Why am I telling you that now this deep into a review? Because its never an issue in the game, the only time it is an issue is before you start, you'll select your escape pod. After going through the game, you'll unlock different escape pods, each with its own perk. There are a few different difficulties, very easy and easy. I assume that you can unlock more, but after 8 hours into the game I still have two difficulties.As for the graphics, they're simple and pixelated, yet still drip in atmosphere. Dungeon of the Endless is a dark and eerie sort of beautiful with a futuristic alien twist. The music gets relegated to ambiance and near chip tune music. Its barely a memory in my mind even after 8 hours of playing.With everything said, Dungeon of the Endless is definitely worth your time for fans of both dungeon crawlers and tower defenders. This isn't a genre for everyone, but what's here is addictive, engrossing and easy to play.			"

												My experience with Dungeon of the Endless has been mainly ""struggle and frustration"" so far, but because the game is just so ridiculously hard as in it requires a lot of managing, planning, and some luck, every attempt makes you delve more into the depth of the game. Simply opening doors without much thoughts will ONLY lead you to bad endings.Lists below are what I believe to be the game's good parts and (rather than saying bad directly) parts that left me unsatisfied.Good parts+ Simple - collect and manage resources, survive the enemy waves, construct towers to help your heroes, RESEARCH: these are all you need to know to ""endure"" the challenges until you get the grasp of more details+ The simplicity is what makes the game really Fun as well! Its easy to get into and rogue like element makes every round different from each other+ Interesting characters to choose. Later into game, you would prioritize operator (for extra resource production) over other characters, but IT IS WORTH exploring other types too! They have their own unique taste of skills and playstyle.+ To be able to level up and equip heroes you love and enjoy playing so that they can be even more stronger and sometimes.. a little bit OP under certain circumstances+ Different dungeons to choose, finally managed to finished the first? Here comes the second with even harder (subjective) which may require different strategies+ THE JOY OF BEING ALIVE at the end of each round. Seriously, after dying so much times and failing to clear due to stupid mistakes, this relief makes you go on in the game+ Ridiculously hard sometimes - greatly recommended to those who enjoy challenges out thereBad/Unsatisfactory parts- Lack of multiple saves system, basically you are stuck in one game to either beat or be crushed- Hard to play in a co-op game, as in barely any room to join (playing with 3 other friends instead is generally recommended rather than waiting)- After awhile, you can notice some heroes are plainly just more ""useful"", balancing is left to be desiredSTILL the game is just amazing, I really did not expect for me to have this sort of intense fun when I bought the gameTherefore, I would like to rate the game 9.5/10! :)			"

												Dungeon of the Endless was a game that I was avoiding. Tower Defense wasn't my ""scene"" and the pixelated (albeit stylized) graphics didn't grab me either. However, many of my gaming friends at ""Octopus Overlords"" were raving about it, so I eventually gave it a try. And I'm glad I did. In the game, your crew of heroes must explore a floor of a spaceship to find the exit. Then, they must transport the generator/crystal to the exit to progress to the next floor, and ultimately exit and win the game. What really hooked me were the RPG elements built in to the game, where you can upgrade and customize your crew members, also outfitting them with weapons and gear. The random nature of each floor and the included encounters/events/surprises appealed to me too (but then, I'm a sucker for Rogue-like games). Lastly, as a gamer with a family, it's nice that each floor makes a satisfying, quick play session - convenient for when real life calls. (There is a ""Save & Quit"" option if needed mid-level).  And I haven't even gotten to the point where I've unlocked all of the ships and crewmembers to use. Drawbacks: The tutorial is short and not entirely helpful. I had to check the wiki for clarity on some of the game basics. (i.e. - Opening doors are the ""turn"" mechanism; You manually choose to level characters from their inventory/stat screens;etc.).  I haven't attempted multi-player, though it seems people are reporting problems at this date. (The developers are continuing to address this with patches.) I've not encountered any technical problems, on my mid-level gaming laptop. Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's surprised me with how much fun it has been, once I got the hang of it. To win me over to a genre that I usually avoid is high praise, in my opinion. My last thought (again, shared by an Octopus Overlord member): ""Easy"" level is hard. ""Very easy"" is normal. Don't be afraid to start there.			"

												So many puppets, so many strings... And once we've lifted off, who cares if they figure out who was pulling them? No one on the ship will return to Mazen. Our future lies among the stars. The Dungeon of the Endless Dungeon of the Endless is a hard and unforgiving game. It teaches its gameplay mechanics by making you die a thousand times over. With each run you'll find yourself in a different situation, can't find the elevator exit, not enough dust to power another set of rooms, not enough industry to create much needed modules etc. It's an addictive game. Each playthrough has twelve floors, which get much and much harder with every floor. So many puppets A few hundred condemned criminals find themselves shipped on the prison ship ""Success"". Only for the ship to be shot by a nearby planets defensive system. A few escape pods flew off towards the planet, and crash deep inside an old facility of the Endless. The game has an roster of nineteen heroes, which are all very unique and fun to control. You start with two heroes and you can recruit two other random heroes you find deep inside the dungeon. With the big roster of heroes, you'll easily find a favorite. Each hero is balanced by his/her/its strength, defense, speed and DPS. The heroes are all set in three different factions: Prisoner, Crew or Native. This will also affect your group, heroes can have special conversations in the elevator rides in between the floors and they can have special buffs if heroes from the same factions are present in the room with each other. So many strings Dungeon of the Endless has rouge-lite elements like FTL and The Binding of Isaac, RPG elements with its leveling and skill system, and tower defence elements with the modules that you need to protect yourself with. It's a weird combination of genres, but it works so amazingly fine. As said before, it's an addictive game, you'll die many times because of its hard and unforgiving nature. But sometimes it feels unfair and based around luck. You could've made this floor easily if only you choose the upper path instead of the path to the left. This is what I think every time I die, but that gives it just a little bit more of that addictiveness. Conclusion Dungeon of the Endless is a true gem. A game that you see or hear little to nothing about on steam, but deserves so much more attention than that it gets. With a giant roster of great heroes, and a perfect mix of genres that you would've never suspected to even get mixed. The game can sometimes be based around luck a lot, making runs very unfair at times. That being said, Dungeon of the Endless is definitely worth your money. That is if you're up for a big challenge. 9/10  "

								Just a beautifully realised game. Start with 2 random ""heroes"" and explore a randomly generated dungeon while building modules to increase your resources all the while protecting your generator from your crashed ship. Find the lift on your level and get on to the next one. The pixellated art style is gorgeous and appealing, this game is a joy to play!			"

								I've been dissapointed by a lot of Early Access games.  This is most certainly not one of them.  If you're a fan of either Rogue-likes or Tower Defense then you're going to enjoy this game.  The Alpha is currently very short (only the 1st 3 levels of the dungeon) and has lots of features still to be implemented, but it's already a blast to play.  I can't wait to be able to play with all the currently locked features.			"

												Great combination of rogue-like and tower defense gameplay creating something very original along with a great art style. I would say that the game is amazing with one big caveat -- it's not balanced at the moment. The game's primary resource: Dust controls how many rooms you can have lit up or safe from enemy spawns. However getting the resource is entirely too random and it's the main game ender at the moment.Not having enough dust will leave you with multiple rooms that will spawn enemies and there is no way for you to cope even with the best defenses or heroes in the game. Until the developers do something to fix the balance, Dungeon of the Endless is a great but frustrating game that has limited replayability because of it.			"

												Co-op? Strategy? Rogue-like? Yes please.There are so many wonderful aspects in this game that make it what it is and all of those details add up to a fantastic final product. There's just no debate about it being one of the best games that I have in my inventory, and it only gets more stuff as time goes on.You are the survivor of a crashed escape pod from a prison ship, and you have crashed so far down, the entire game is a quest to navigate to the elevators on every floor and make your way back to the surface with your pod's power core. Every door you open is one turn, so you have the time between doors to think and strategize how you are going to proceed. You build generators in build-nodes and collect resources from those generators with every door you open, however you also have to build defences as every door you open could have monsters and every unlit room that you've already discovered could spawn additional monsters if you're not standing in it.So, the game is a balance of character advancement and combat with turn-based building strategy and resource management. At high levels the game gets pretty intense, but you always have time between doors to cool off and rethink how you're doing things. At least, unless you let them break the doors open. It's quirky, it's pretty, it has a sense of humour, and a great soundtrack. And best of all, there's a variety of ways to play, from over two dozen heroes to stick in your party, to a host of different defences and support modules. Every randomly generated dungeon brings its own opportunities and perils as you deal with whatever the gimmick of your ship's power core is.Dungeon of the Endless can be a challenge, but it's fun even if you lose, and there's a lot to be said for that. But, in my opinion, it's only fun if you have a party. So find some friends and play it like a Friday night board game.			"

												I had about 40 extremely entertaining hours in this game. This game is one like no other.The Soundtrack is beautiful and fits perfectly. The overall sound is pretty haunting and convincing. The main title is a beautifully crafted piece of music.The Pixelgraphics work and they are charming.The User interface is pretty minimalistic and still more than enough. It is easy to understand, which is important because the player has to focus his mind on the actual tactic.Semi-turn-based. This game is basically a turn based game. But at the same time, it is not. Because it is missing one thing that many turn-based games can't avoid: Waiting. In many cases, you will not have to wait alot. Because you can always do something. Research, buy and sell, upgrade, plan your upgrades, plan a new route and so on.It forces you to think and that is what I love the most about it. You will never have enough of everything and your enemies will constantly grow in numbers and in strength. So every turn is important. You will have to count in order to know when you will be able to research or build what. You will have to plan routes and prepare for hordes that might attack your vulnerable resources. You will have to understand the hero class you are playing and how your whole team would benefit the most of your actions. There is so much to plan and seeing it work out afterwards is extremely satisfiying. The moment you hope your route to the elevator is safe and you fight off hordes of monsters, never knowing if the teammate that carries the objective will make it is awesome. Thats another important point:Satisfaction. If you don't make it, you were not prepared in most cases. But thats not the end of the story. If you die, you will still be present, can manage your resources and support your team and if they manage to find a new hero, they can hire it and give you control over him. So, this game shows you without any mystery, that you have to work as a team. You depend on each other. And if two people of the team die, the rest wont get far. If somebody simply opens the doors in a rush because of missing patience, the whole team will have to deal with the consequences and mostly, be punished. But, you will always know what you did wrong. And that is great.So, now that I have said all that, I will mention the worst downside of this game: The multiplayer seems to be dead. Every now and then, I check if there is an open lobby, but all I see is emptiness. Don't get me wrong, you can basically play this game alone, but the real experience lies in the teamplay. So, if you would want to try this game, be sure to look for a group on steam or elsewhere, so that you have some people with you. It is alright in singleplayer, but the real game is in the multiplayer part.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is unlike any other game. It is a top-down real-time tactical squad-based tower defense RPG roguelike, which does not make any sense as a concept. It is also, somehow, very fun and vey hard and gives all the feelings of reward and tension and loss that a well-designed roguelike game should. On top of that, Amplitude puts an exceptional level of polish and awesome UI design into this and all their other games, more so than almost any AAA or indie titles I've ever seen.The game plays a lot like FTL on a dungeon layout rather than inside a ship - you command your units to a certain room or door and they'll set about doing whatever task they can, but it's also topped with an equipment, level-up, and skills system that gives layer of individual investment in your heroes similar to 2000-era Infinity Engine RPGs. Within every floor of the dungeon, you're also gathering and investing resources into a sort of base-building system, using build-nodes and a power grid to either auto-generate more resources or to actively help your heroes in defending rooms. It all takes a lot of getting used to, but once you get enough of a grasp on all the systems to work towards understanding them better, they come together in a really satisfying way.The soundtrack is very FTL as well (perhaps too FTL-like, even), noticeable but not overbearing space-y background tracks that feel fitting for whatever situation you're in. There's a large amount of flavor text across equipment, research, hero dialog, and other things like that, and everything I've seen of it has been generally informative and often surprisingly funny. The humor isn't the overt RPG-parody style of something like Dungeons of Dredmor, but more simple and under-stated in a way that's appropriate to the style and setting.The one complaint I have so far is that there seems to be no way to move multiple heroes as a unit, at least not that I've found. I very often want 2 or more heroes to stay together or all get into one room ASAP, but my instinct to use click-and-drag style group selection does not work. It's kind of flow-breaking to instead select people one by one and then issue each of them the exact same movement command, and it makes breaching new rooms as a group or falling back to a different position more cumbersome and take a bit longer than it should. A very minor interface gripe in an experience that has otherwise been awesome. (**EDIT: Nevermind most of this paragraph - there is a way to set groups and quick-select those groups. But I still think click-and-drag selection would be the ideal.**)Bottom-line short-form summary: This game is fun, and I have never played anything like it and maybe never will again. I'm not capable of recommending anything more highly than that.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless (DoTE) is a strange mix of genres that works surpisingly well. Part tower defence, part squad management and part roguelike.DoTE presents an interesting dilemma for the player; should I open this door? Ever door you open has the chance to make your escape to the next floor harder. Every room you don't run power too, and very rarely will you have enough power for every room, has a chance to spawn hordes of aleins who want you dead. You can slow their assault by building towers in powered rooms. You must also choose which resources to generate so you can afford more towers, tower upgrades or character levels. Everything in DoTE comes down to a simple choice: how hard do I want to make this for myself? All of this, with a helping of humour and increasing difficulty results in very rewarding risk/reward gameplay.There is a wealth of characters in DoTE, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. Their combined flavour texts makes for an interesting narrative and the various interactions between the characters in the post level screen is a very nice touch and makes the world feel alive. You will rectuit additional squad members  the deeping you dive into the dungeon, but you will have to decide who to sacrafice in order to create room for them as you can onyl have 4 squad members. Even unlocking new characters for future playthroughs has a risk/reward aspect to it as you must dive at least 3 floors into the dungeon with your new compainion before they are available to you for other playthroughs.    The only downsides to DoTE are in the multiplayer. At the time of writing this here are my issues:    You cannot create private multiplayer matches. This has resulted in me kicking many people (sorry!) when I only wanted to play with a friend.     You cannot trade items between player's characters outside of selling the items to the shop keeper and having them buy them.     The game tends to drop connections often and you cannot rejoin a game which effectively ends it.     You cannot save your progress in a multiplayer game and a game of DoTE can take a few hours so make sure you have nothing else you need to do before you start a game up. I hope that the devs iron out the technical issues so that multiplayer can be a more enjoyable experience.In conclusion, I would highly reccomend this game despite its flaws in multiplayer. If you like rogue-likes and tower defence games you should definitely try this one out. It is a steal at only $14 (CAD) and some of the most fun I have had with a game in recent memory!TL;DR: Rogue-Like, Squad Management, Tower Defence. Very fun. Very cheap. Broken multiplayer. Go buy now.			"

												<edit>  In light of the comments on this one, I feel I should word my thoughts a bit better:  My entire feeling about the game comes down to one idea - I like my rogue-likes to be hard; I like randomness to play a large factor; but I don't like RNG that takes the entire possibility of victory out of the players hands - _especially_ when a single run takes 2-3 hours.  It makes the rest of the game meaningless; there's no strategy to an unwinnable floor. </edit>My library is full of rogue-likes and I have hundreds of hours spent playing them, but I have a hard time recommending a game that a) leaves up a lot to chance while b) having extremely long completion times.   The number of times I made it to floor 12 only to lose because I got a double door-breaking rino spawn that I couldn't address because I can't control which enemies my character attacks was just too damn high.  It's not the deaths that are so bad - it's that it takes 2-3 hours to get through a run and to have it end because of nothing you did is just infuriating.The run that finally turned me against this game was a run to floor 12 and there was not a single room in the 12 that I was able to check that had a place to put down a major module.  I had 700 industry saved up just to make generators and 4 characters at level 12 / 13 and there was nothing I could do.  I couldn't kill the swarms before they got to my crystal, and while I killed many of them, when you have 15 dust, you will lose that game of attrition.			"

												We were going to die.	Up until the instant that door opened, there had been hope, there had been an inkling of a chance, we would make it through this last floor, we would escape the facility and finally be free. Maybe the floor's exit would be in there, or it would lead to a hallway leading to the exit, or something, for God's sake every other area of this floor had been opened, it had to be in here...	It opened to a hallway with three doors... upon opening it, the dozens of unpowered rooms surrounding us burst forth with monsters, crawling in from every corner of the icy hellhole we were trapped in. We fought desperately, exhausted out abilities, lost countless turrets to the hordes that door had unleashed upon us, and what did we unlock for our efforts? The opportunity to open three brand new doors, to watch our defenses wither and die at the hands of the disgusting hellish bugs that lay behind these doors, there was no doubt, there was no lingering hope, no desperate chance... the team was too battered, our turrets and defenses worn ragged, the next wave would surely kill us.	Squidward was the first to admit it, that we were going to die. I had tried to fill my team with optimism, but when he called it like it was, there was no denying it, the next door would kill us, so many monsters would spawn that we'd be overwhelmed, and die within seconds. ""We're out of food, Handsome Burger's barely got any health left... I think this is where we all say our goodbyes."" he typed, the text lingering on the screen in brutal silence. Burger responded promptly, ""It's been an honor, bois."" ""Amen to that."" I chimed in, all the while desperately wracking my brain for a solution to this impossible problem, trying to plan some kind of escape route or fullproof defense in my head, there had to be some way to change this, fate may be a fickle mistress, but this was beyond unfair, it had become a downright impossible run...	No. Nothing was impossible. Defending the next wave, perhaps, but with so much of the map already revealed, it had to be in one of the three...	""Guys, don't open anything yet, I've got an idea.""	""Um... sure, ♥♥♥♥ it, what is it?"" Squidward remarked.	""We open all three at the same time.""	""You know, we could just abandon this one, not sure I feel like watching us die after all this.""	""One of them has to have the exit, we've checked everywhere else. We open all three, we see the exit, I run the crystal there, we escape.""	""What if they're all hallways, or empty rooms? Have you seen how this game has ♥♥♥♥ed us so far?""	""Guys, we can't defend the crystal from the next wave, but if we throw up enough neurostun modules and slow them down a bit, we can outrun them to the exit. This is our one shot.""	""♥♥♥♥. I wish you weren't right...""	""Let's do it.""	We took our positions; Squidward, Burger, and Gray each stood before a door, and I sat beside the crystal, throwing what little indus I had left into neurostun modules along the path.	""Ready?""	""Ready.""	""RIP in pepperoni.""	They activated the doors, and an eternity passed as they yawned open, my fingers hovered over the mouse, ready to desperately right click the crystal to freedom.	Dead end.	Dead end.	Hallway with a door.	""OPEN IT NOWE,"" There was no time to spell check, the waves were coming, the map was filling with a wall of red dots, Burger triggered his slowing ability, and the neurostuns did their part, but as slow as the wave was, that didn't keep it from being pant-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly big.	Squidward sprinted for what had to be the last door, and as it slowly opened, and as the fastest of the creeps burst into the crystal room and rabidly dove for me, I prayed to RNGesus for one last chance at freedom... that we could be free from this god-forsaken facility, and that we could taste the sweet clean air of the surface world that awaited us just behind that final door.	Three more doors.	♥♥♥♥ this game.(This game is worth $20. It costs $12. If you're a fan of strategic roguelike gameplay, you should buy this, sale or not. Don't freak out about DLC, just buy the pixel edition. This game doesn't shame you, there's no question mark heads eternally gracing your roster, it only shows who you have in your game, which is an incredibly respectful way to handle DLC in this day and age. If you come to love the game as you play it, the DLC's worth grabbing, but in multiplayer, if the host owns it, you can play it, so don't sweat it, and come hate this ♥♥♥♥ing game with us! :D)			"

												I've tried to like this game, but it just doesn't get it quite right. To begin with, the tutorial is lacking and the game gives you little in the way of instruction. You basically have to die over and over in order to even work out what it is you're supposed to be doing, and even then, to really understand how to play the game ""correctly"" you really need to read a guide.Dungeon of the Endless (DotE) is a merge of two types of game. It's both a turn-based and real time game, and it is both a tower defence game and a roguelike hero/RPG game. This is actually quite a novel idea, and at times it works really well and makes for compelling gameplay, but where it gets let down is the difficulty scaling, and how punishing it is when it doesn't go well for you, and this is due to the mechanics of the game. To understand why, you need to know a bit of how the game plays.It's a top down game featuring a maze of connected rooms. Each turn you open a door, which reveals a new room to add to your map. When a door has been opened, it switches to real time so that you can battle any monsters that may appear. Monsters get randomly generated in any room that isn't powered, and rooms are powered by a resource called Dust. Rooms that are powered can contain turrets and other defensive buildings. You get Dust by opening doors - it has a random chance to appear.The starting room contains your crystal, which when attacked, causes you to lose Dust. This means that the moment your defences start to fail you lose the very resource that prevents monsters from spawning and that powers your defences, but since the mobs increase in difficulty each turn, as soon as your crystal starts getting hit you find yourself in a downward spiral.There is also some benefit to leaving rooms unpowered since you can earn Dust by killing, so there is a balance to be maintained. If you always power as many rooms as you can, you can find yourself without enough Dust to power rooms in the future, but if you leave too many rooms unpowered, you get overwhelmed. Damned if you do and damned if you don't.In a good tower defence game you would alter your defences according to how they stood up to the previous wave. In this game that just doesn't work, due to every unpowered room randomly generating a mob, there are so many random variables involved that you can go from the previous wave barely doing any damage to the next wave completely wiping you out. And as said before, if you do manage to survive such a wave, you'll be in a worse position to survive any future ones.Two of the other resources are Food and Science. These are accrued each turn according to how many of a certain building you have. You need Food to level up your heroes, and you need Science to research new buildings. But they have a secondary use to heal a hero or to reset a hero's skill cooldowns. But this suffers from the same problem as the Dust, in that as soon you find yourself needing to use those resources to keep your heroes alive, you've already lost. The fact that you needed to give emergency heals to someone or reset their skills suggests that you were being overwhelmed, which means next turn you will need to be even better prepared, but you now have less resources than you had in the previous turn, and are in a downward spiral.In a roguelike, random events should be difficult, but if you survive them your reward is the fact that the run continues. In Dungeon of the Endless it often ends slowly, but it's obvious that the game is lost because your resource management has been vitiated and your defences ruined. You don't feel the ""I was so close, next run I can do it"" urge. You feel dejected and just close the game. Starting another run feels like a chore.This is compounded by the fact that a run can take 6+ hours, and some floors are impossible due to the randomly generated layout and rooms simply being indefensible, or randomly getting no dust on a floor, or random events that disabling the only places you could defend from.In FTL you might find yourself up against an enemy that you cannot beat. But you can flee. You might find the rebels caught up to you. But you can fight them and get to the next sector. You might make the wrong choice and lose your best crew member. It makes things more difficult, but your existing crew will improve and you can find others. You might find yourself with a severely damaged ship, your oxygen system down, and your dwindling crew suffocating. But with the right decisions you can turn it around. It's ultimately about decision making and risk management.In Dungeon of the Endless you can do everything right and then after 5 hours be presented with an unwinnable situation. But you play on, to watch the inevitable demise now that everything is ruined through no fault of your own.In The Binding of Isaac your success is heavily dependent on loot generation and your own mechanical skills, but this is fun and addictive. You don't feel cheated, you feel like you could have done it, and you try again, looking forward to the novelty of which items you'll get this time.There is no novelty in Dungeon of the Endless. In fact, once you've worked it out the game is quite shallow. There is essentially one optimal strategy of how to explore, where to leave certain heroes, and where/what to build.Perhaps Dungeon of the Endless tried to do too many things at once, because it's neither a particularly good tower defence game and nor a particularly good roguelike. Tower defence games are about funnelling dumb enemies into your most powerful towers and getting them to stay there. DotE breaks this by handing you layouts and rooms that do not allow you to do this. Roguelike games are addictive because every run is different, you never know what item you might get that greatly changes a run, and deaths feel like your fault rather than the game's. DotE breaks all of this. The items are all very similar and don't change a run, progression through level ups and upgrades are slow and imperceptible, and all runs are played the same.It's a real shame because the gameplay is actually fun and when it works it works, but at other times it all falls apart and leaves you with no recourse. If there was a neutral option I would give this game that because I do like some things about it, but I don't think I can recommend it given its flaws. "

												THIS GAME IS AMAZING! I went for 10 hours straight when i got it and still want more. I Got the founders pack because its actually fricken awesome. This game has so much replay value, Its very well thought out and gets pretty tough. The rpg element is just as awesome as the tower defence, it blends together perfectly. I wasnt even a fan of tower defence games that much but this game is just great. Once you start getting some items and a party of 4 it gets really fun. It has really cool music in it as well! 10/10 from me. Im also trying to think of bad things about it but I just cant! :D*This is an update to my review*Dungeon of the endless is still fricken awesome.			"

												So I closed all the doors and the lights inside my house. Then, my 3 year old son and I were flying on a huge spaceship but something hapened and we had to use his bed as an escape pod. We barely made it out and made a crash landing into a mysterious complex...We opened the first door and sent dust from our escape pod battery to power up the light. It was quiet... but the next door we got attacked by some kind of bugs and sentient crystals. It's a good thing i brought a nerf shotty and that my son had his trusty foam sword because the adventure could have ended there but we prevailed! Little did we know, we were far from finding an exit and further we went into the complex the more and more creatures were coming at us. Lucky us, we had found another survivor inside a box. It was a friendly unknown beast and it was helping us, for what purpose? we don't know. So after having a lot of fun opening all the doors and some lights and fighting off monsters with our new imaginary friend, we found what hapened to be an elevator. We went up to the surface and found a glass of milk and fresh chocolate chip cookies. Tummy filled, we repaired a radio we had picked up earlier and sent a signal in hope for a rescue team to come an pick us up.... we hope someone gets our message!...10/10 would crash land an escape pod into my house again!

												I took a flyer on this game while it was on sale because it looked interesting and I wanted to play something different. 600hrs later; this is easily one of the best games I've purchased. If I had to describe Dote, it is a Turn Based Strategy/Tower Defense with some RPG elements sprinkled in. DotE is pretty straight forward: build a team, protect the crystal, and survive for 12 floors. Sounds easy? Perhaps you should try it.			"

												This game. THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME.I have stopped counting how often I ragequit because I ♥♥♥♥ed up an otherwise perfect run on one of the later floors. But I keep returning because I KNOW it can be done and can be done perfectly and that almost everything that goes wrong is due to a mistake I made.There are so many little nuances and tactics, character skills, items and modules - it's amazingly fun to find synergies and different strategies. There's really a lot of content and hidden background info to find, which makes the price asked very moderate.The flavor texts on everything are an entertaining read and this is probably one of the 3 or so games where I actually go ""YAY!"" when something in the ""sticker album"" that shows art and bits of background story is unlocked. Also the art is absolutely perfect, pixel-perfect so to say.Almost 25 hours of playtime right now and I'm so not done with this.			"

												This game has a really unique feel to it.Challenging, but mostly things that can be foreseen to a certain degree. You do not control the combat directly.  Your character fights whatever is near them and you just tell them what room to go to. Lit rooms do not spawn monsters.  Every time you open a door (you've ended your 'turn' by doing so) there's a chance that the dark rooms may spawn monsters.  If players occupy those rooms, they will not spawn there when the door is opened.  The monsters are basically trying to get to your spawn point -- this is one part tower defense.After you've cleared a path you feel confident about and feel like you've gotten enough loot/XP from a level you have one person slowly carry the crystal to the exit.  Everyone has to be there when they hit it or you're dead as dead can be!Very interesting game.  If you're looking for some weird challenging planned dungeon crawling, this is for you.  It will take a few runs to really understand what's going on and then it clicks.			"

												(Note - I have a lot more hours than shown as I have played a LOT of this game in offline mode)This game is really fun. The art is great, the music is IMHO very good, and fits great. The mechanics are solid and fun to play with. Progress feels like it moves at a good pace, and there is a nice dual-progress system in that you have your in-game progress of leveling up heroes and building the team up, getting new tech, stockpiling resources and getting items for your heroes, and then you have your between-game progress with starting hero and pod unlocks.Overall I'd strongly reccomend. Its a great game that makes you think a bit (but not too hard!), punishes you fairly for bad decisions and helps you learn your way, but it isn't brutal on you (especially with the ability to pause at will with the spacebar). Its quite a departure from other Amplitude games (i.e. its not a 4X) but they've done this really well and I would 100% reccomed this game			"

												If you don't feel like reading the entire things here's the summary:As with any game, keep in mind that this may not be the right combination of elements for you. I'd say if you enjoy tower defense games, roguelike mechanics, science fiction settings, and a subtle sense of humour, there is a high probability that you will enjoy this one. If you get easily frustrated or like strategy based only on skill, without an element of luck, perhaps this is not the game for you. Personally, I love this game. It has all the right ingredients for me, and it's quickly become a favourite. I can't praise it enough.Good points:+Solid design and game mechanics.+Beautiful pixel art.+Immersive soundtrack and sound effects.+Great characters and subtle humour.+Endless replayability. Every game is different, and every combination of heroes and items will make you rethink your approach.+Good time versatility: you can either pick it up for half an hour or half a day. Though a complete run will require several hours to complete, once you know the game mechanics it's relatively easy to pick up a game partway through.+Relatively frequent updates. In a time where far too many games get abandoned in Early Access stage, finding developers that actually listen to the players and release updates seems such a rarity!Possible caveats:-I have not tested the multiplayer(The general consensus seems to be that it still needs some work. Same with some crashing issues. The developers seem to be aware and working on it.)-Difficulty spike towards the later levels. Even the easiest settings can be very, very challenging. This may make the game feel unbalanced.-On that same note, bear in mind that you require both skill and luck to win the game. These points are not a problem for me, I've played old school roguelikes and this one feels pretty forgiving in comparison, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. A bad combination of items, heroes or rooms, and your late game may become nearly impossible. A good one, and you can win with much less effort (though a certain degree of skill is a must, and you will still be punished quite severely for acting foolishly or carelessly).I do like that element of luck, and find that any frustration vanishes fairly quickly in the face of the next challenge (a rarity for me these days, as I don't have much free time and seem to have grown old and grumpy when it comes to frustrating games). I  find luck a perk, rather, something that distinguishes this game from other roguelikes, and I think the immersion really helps, in my case. -Some extra content is unlocked separatelyI'm making a note of this because I've seen some nasty comments around. There is a special edition of the game (crystal pack) that unlocks an extra character and ship, but if you want the other extra character and ship you have to buy the special edition of Endless Legend, as well. I believe that the developers plan to later unlock this content, but are giving this option now for early supporters of their games, which I think is a fair strategy. I think this is much preferable to standard DLC, in any case. Your opinion may differ, so I think it is fair to give a warning.(Edited to correct a sneaky typo!)(Update November 2016: yep, still playing and loving it! :) )			"

======================================Dungeon of the Endless (Read on for the full review!)======================================TL;DR:Dungeon of the Endless is an exceptional roguelike with high quality design and polish, variety, challenge, and fun.======================================Pros:+ Aesthetic: Gorgeous pixel art, animations, and visuals.+ UI Design: Extremely appealing and functional.+ Audio: Great music, great ambient sfx, and crisp clean UI sfx tie in with the visuals perfectly for great immersion. + Gameplay: Strongly prominent elements of resource management and tower defense in a roguelike dungeon crawl? Yes.+ Variety: With no expansions 21 characters and 5 pods give you plenty to look forward to, experiment, and play with.+ Online: Being able to play and coordinate with friends locally or from around the globe is a nice treat.+ Developers: Special shoutout to a devteam that has spent many an hour supporting, expanding, and patching their game well after launch.Cons:- Progression: Feels like later floors conspire against you; making you spend a lot of resources to get few back, making the last couple of floors feel like a mad dash.- Friendless: When playing alone, there's a micromanagement aspect that can make the game more difficult for you.- Endless Inventory: Just kidding, it's limited, so if there's no shop, you're probably going to be sacrificing.Neutral:± Nothing: There's few cons, let alone neutral aspects to DotE.======================================Introduction:Hey there and welcome to this review of Dungeon of the Endless; likely the first roguelike of its kind, fusing together elements of tower defense with direct hero control with a healthy dose of resource management and dungeon crawling!Gameplay:So, as stated, prominent features are direct hero control, resource management, dungeon crawling, and tower defense. So in order:Direct Hero Control: You can have up to 4, and you right click to move, left click to select. Attacking or opertating (increasing efficiency of a structure at the cost of staying in the room for successive turns) is automatic, but requires you to be parked in the room you want to do it in. Most heroes have at least one active ability, which will display under their avatar at the top right of your screen. Click them anytime you feel they are best used. Various mechanics such as operating, the ability for your character to spawn block enemies in unlit rooms, and more make it so that you will often have to keep very active tabs on who is where, doing what, and when to change it. This can make the game much more friendly to those playing with friends, as you won't have to keep track of 4 heroes, their abilities, where they are, where they need to be, and constantly select different ones.Resource Management: There are 4 main resources: Dust, industry, science, and food. Dust is for powering rooms, allowing you to make your path through the dungeon safe, or unsafe, at your choosing. Dust is the single most valuable resource going forward, as unpowered rooms can spawn enemies when you open new doors. It is also required to keep rooms with machines functional, so if you want to keep getting your resources from your generators every turn, they have to be powered. Industry is used as a resource with which you build things, so I would say it is of second highest importance because if you can't build new generators on each floor, you won't be able to get many resources at all. You either have it or you don't , pretty simple. Science is used for research, done in specific rooms if you discover them and spend the science to research from one of the available options, which can differ from naturally found research pods. Last comes food, an important but often dismissable resource that enables you to not only feed your character to heal them in an emergency, but to level them up. While doing both of these at times can be critically important, not having food isn't always the end of the world.Dungeon Crawling: So every floor has a random amount of rooms, which can be powered or (mostly) unpowered, have heroes for hire, additional resources, shopkeepers, and various other surprises. As you explore more and more of a floor, you will require more dust to power important rooms while also trying to balance powering the most inconvenienent places for enemies to spawn in on you. Dust can come from newly explored rooms, machines, and killing enemies. There are also items and passive as well as active abilities that can increase your dust gain. There is an emergency generator machine that you can build to power a room and help with gaining dust, so research this technology asap if you find it. As you explore more of a dungeon, you will find yourself having to make decisions and sacrifices. Do you keep the sword for that awesome character you hope to find and unlock or the healing item for an emergency? Do you keep the piece of armor that protects you more, or lets you gain more dust? Can you afford to let that hero operate this machine, or will that place you in jeopardy? Essentialy, the dungeon crawling aspect of DotE is about quickly responding to new discoveries and how they may alter your priorities. If you can't tell, DotE is a very tactical experience.Tower Defense: So yes, I'm sure you now have it firmly in your head that you can build generators to spawn resources every turn (door opened) but that doesn't cover the wealth of options. No, not just that emergency generator you need to find and research immediately, but also a shop for the shopkeeper to be relocated and operated, and various offensive and defensive pods that can be used as traps or buffs for your heroes that will be fighting in specific rooms. There are many otions here from direct attacks, slows, disables, health regen, offensive ability increasing pods, etc. You have to plan ahead and not place these wastefully, as you are not only limited in amount, but the landscape of the dungeon may change unfavorably as you open more doors, leading to a hole in your defenses you can't patch either due to lack of industry or lack of dust to power a room.So. Can you utilize your resources and cunning to keep your heroes and structures safe as you uncover the whole floor? Do you make a mad dash for the end, knowing you no longer have the ability to sustain yourself? Or do you ultimately run out of options as you slowly die, trying to hold on for hope of a lucky find that will save you and let you get to the end and escape the dungeon?Good luck!Graphics:The graphics in DotE are absolutely beautiful. From the sharp  minimal UI, detailed pixel art, fluid and distinct animation, great color palette or beautiful digital paintings that serve as loading screens that may become some of your favorite new desktop backgrounds your eyes will always be entertained and enthralled. Seriously, the bar has been set high.Audio:On the other hand, the audio is just as good. Haunting music and crisp decidedly placed sound effects tie together very well with the graphics and gameplay to create a cohesive whole.Conclusion:Just buy the damn game. Unless you hate challenging games, roguelikes, or the stress of micromanagenent, you'll love this.======================================This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.====================================== "

												This is how Early Access should work. Now I only bought this game two weeks before release, but at that point it was already more polished and complete than most on release and now that is is officially out I am blown away by the quality! I just love this game for the randomness, but usually that isn't enough for me what makes this game special is every game feels like a new story. ""Does this group have what it takes?"" I find myself asking, ""Is luck on my side today?"" sometimes I find my way through the maze and beeline to the exit, (happened on floor 10 kinda scared me because its so damn huge and I found the exit so fast couldn't even power half the rooms on the way to the exit) and the writing for the characters is awesome! Sure they don't talk much but the descriptions, plus the few intertwining stories that you may or may not hear in the elevator really flesh out the characters to a point where I find myself making up relationships between them that might fit, or thinking about how much they must hate having to work together and I will even make up friendships between heroes that end up working together throught multiple floors. (sometimes i can even encorperate one of the ""canon"" stories into it and it just feels great) On top of all that. is an amazing game that doesn't really have any peers (at least to my knowledge) sure it feels like FTL or Space Marines or what have you but it combines them all in such a way that it creates something revolutionary. I see this as almost a difficult story generating game, where the goal isn't to win but to create a good story.			"

												This game is great fun, but hosting multiplayer is hell, if you're buying this game to play with friends make sure your connection is the most stable thing ever. Small connection interuptions as well as steam matinence will end the game and theres no way to reconnect with your pals on the same level without them restarting, which with 2 hour + long games can be very frustrating.

Early Access Review
								Although I've only spent a small number of hours exploring Dungeon of the Endless, I can honestly say that I am both impressed with the state of the game already and eager to see what's in store for future updates. The visuals are already quite pleasing and polished. I love the music and the sounds fit very well with the visual atmosphere. Gameplay is frustrating at first but picks up quickly as you get the hang of the controls and figure out clever ways to survive for longer periods of time.Unfortunately, this game is still in progress. As an Early Access title, there is much left to be done with the game before the official release. Although compared to other Early Access games, this one shows a higher level of Dev-Love than most. If you have been considering buying early but haven't decided yet: get it.Nurse Deena Ratchet has been killed. Let the tears flow.			"

												This game is a hidden gem. Complete diamond in the rough. My best friend bought this for me, and I would have never anticipated the amount of joy it has brought me. It's another game from the Endless trilogy, that's an amazing combination of tower defense, dungeon crawler, and turn based roguelike games. It also has an amazing retro pixel look, which is very aesthetically pleasing. I've honestly never played anything like this. My only complaint is that I didn't anticipate it to be so highly addictive. I am currently suffering from ""one more door"" syndrome. There is no cure. In all seriousness, I cannot give this game enough praise or recommendations. At this point, I will buy anything Amplitude Studios creates. 10/10			"

I'm not a fan of tower defense, but this deftly mixes TD with roguelike elements, RPG elements and squad-based gameplay. LOVE IT.

												This is a unique cross between tower defense, 4X, and rogue-like game.You have 1 to 4 heroes that explore a random dungeon consisting of rooms separated by doors. Every time you open a door, monsters spawn in all the unlit areas of the dungeon and try to attack your heroes and reach your base. You can stop them by attacking with your heroes or building defenses.After the wave of monsters is done, you are safe and may build or upgrade your structures. This phase plays a lot like a 4X game where you must manage food, research, and industry. Each room can a certain number of structures of various types, and some rooms contain existing structures.Your heroes themselves level up and gain skills as they would in an RPG. Death is permanent and when all your heroes die, you must restart the game from scratch.There is a huge amount of replayability here due to the random elements and number of ships and characters you can choose. A typical game can take 3-4 hours.As with roguelikes this is fairly difficult game, particularly if you play it on the harder difficulty (there are two difficilties, mislabelled ""easy"" and ""very easy""). If you enjoy difficult games, you should like this a lot.Subscribe to my curator page hereView my other reviews here "

												Dungeon of the Endless is a bold new take on the roguelike genre, including tower defense mechanics and strategy RPG elements. It may sound like a strange mashup, but it just works. Like the other Amplitude games, levels are generated procedurally, so expect 'endless replayability'. Add awesome pixel Art, and the usual great music by FlybyNo and you got a gem. One you shouldn't miss especially given the ridiculously low price tag!

												FTL with tower defence. Excellent concept, brilliant execution. This is a great time sink that combines elements from various games, yet manages to be original and different.Buy this, it is another example of an indie game having more depth than AAA titles. Not even in the Xcom titles or in FTL did i feel so attached to my crew members, each death spelling certain doom. You will restart a lot.11/10			"

												Endless EnjoymentYou look at the door and wonder what’s behind it. Salvation? Doom?You’re not sure how long you’ve been roaming these halls now, working your way forward and upwards, through myriad savage encounters with sentient rocks, bugs, slimes, demons, and other cavernous creatures.All you remember is that the escape pod of your prison ship crash-landed on this desolate planet a good time ago, straight into the lower levels of some kind of Endless underground facility, and your ragtag band of crew members and prisoners has been carrying the ship’s generator from elevator to elevator till now, powering up doors and automated defenses along the way.Some friendly species, equally trapped as you and craving liberty or fortune above all else, offer their services for Dust, the mystical nano-elements that go for currency around these parts.Amassing enough of this Dust substance attracts all kinds of nasty critters, but it also recharges the generator, and even provides the means to build food, industry and science stations, who in turn give you another slim fighting chance against said critters on every floor you pass by.And chances are more slim than ever. You see your comrades in arms fall around you, and nothing can get them back up. But you keep pushing, using all of your skills and resources to survive the next onslaught, until you reach the next door. What will come next? Friend or foe?

												A unique defense game that requires strategy, patience and attention. It may seem to be becoming repetetive until you switch your roster and ship tough. Nonetheless i still enjoyed every minute of it. Great music and art style imo. character dialog and bios are worth reading aswell. Multiplayer is unfortunately reserved to playing with friends as i have seen little to no public rooms. The rogue-like randomness is not as big as in other games but still noticeable. Ultimately i can recommend this to anyone who likes these kind of games. 30 hours of fun are guaranteeed here for a very reasonable price.			"

												I love games with strategy that is addictive to the point where you must have a ""just one more try"" mentality. This is one of those games that will make hours melt away. Having said that, it is HARD, It took me 9 hours to beat the game once on Too Easy.			"

Early Access Review
								One of the best roguelikes I have ever played! Maybe it's the soundtrack, or artwork, or the lore, or Amplitude Studios. Maybe I'm just straight up being a fanboy! This game really breaks away from the ""standard"" of roguelikes and brings more to the table (in my opinion) than any roguelike out there. Since the game is now in Beta, it still has a few kinks to work out. However, the upside to that is Amplitude Studios's dev team! You post on their forums and they'll get back to you ASAP! They will try to provide solutions or take it into account and try to resolve the problem! So, if you're looking to support a great indie company, have a blast with a fresh roguelike, and work with an excellent dev team, then this is the game for you!			"

												This game slowly eats time. Just thinking about the premise of the thing... it makes me feel wrong. It makes me feel like I know something that shouldn't be known. It tugs at parts of my mind with cold, worm like appendages, always reminding me that it exists. The game that should in no rational way work, or be, but it does and is. I'm certain it takes part of you with it, into its absurdity, because it leaves you sitting there wondering what you've been doing after something closes to your desktop. Because this game shouldn't exist. I refuse to accept the hours noted, the moments of blurred confusion in which I'm staring at my monitor realising two hours have passed without my knowledge. I refuse to accept this thing, this ungodly creation of some terrible, irrational reality, exists. Sometimes I just black out at my desk. And that can be normal for people, I've read about it in books. And when my hands start to shake whenever I go to open a door, I just remind myself that I've been drinking too much coffee.			"

												This is a somewhat interesting combination of RPG and Tower defense. I love this game and do not regret getting it. Spent too much time playing it and can assure you – this game is not easily beatable. It supplies tons of excitement and would be a fun thing to geek on alone, in the dark. Devs definitely have been working on this hard with updates flowing regularly, this should tell you – they take their work seriously. Not just a money scamming, riches promising DayZ-like scammery.  If you are looking for a game that lets you take your time planning your move and at the same time provides tons of escalating action, this is the game for you.			"

												First off, I highly recommend this game for anyone that is looking to kill some time. It's definitely worth the money. I bought this during early access, and am usually hesitant of buying unfinished titles, due to some scoundrel developers taking the money and running with it, leaving gamers with a half-finished product. But Amplitude has a very good track record of not only finishing what they started, but also continuing with support well after the title has been released. This game is no exception. Just when I thought the game was finished, I stopped playing for a bit. I came back to this a week ago, only to find they added a bunch more characters, and new options when starting a new game. So a big kudos to them for being a developer that really puts the work into their games.Now on to the game.It's simple, yet complex. Keep your guys alive, get out of the dungeon in one piece. But you can't just rush every level, or else you will skip out on collecting a lot of much needed resources and research opportunities. Opportunities you will desperately need later on. Open too many doors at once, or have a lot of unpowered rooms, and a swarm of enemies will come your way and end your game quick. It's a fine balance between greed and fear. Try to open one more door, to try and get just a bit more resources before going to the next level, you could be hammered with 5 waves of hell. But if you skip out on it, it might hurt you in the long run.Since dungeons are randomly generated, and so are things like weapons/armor/item/artifact locations, there is an element of luck to it. But once you get the hang of it, you can make it through most playthroughs even with some bad luck.There is quite a bit of lighthearted humour from the characters in-game, which is right up my alley. From a woman who thinks she's a spider, to an overcompensating midget with a huge sword. They all have their quirks. It's not so much a band of heroes, as it is a group of unlikely misfits. You might even recognize characters from other games, such as Samus Aran..... errrr... I mean Sara Namus...The game plays a lot like a turn-based tower defense. First you decide how to set up your defenses and production, then you begin the action phase by opening a door.  That's when it goes from ""Okay, everything seems to be coming along fine, all hallways seem to be covered"" to ""CRAP! DON'T ATTACK THERE! THAT WAS MY FREAKING GENERATOR YOU JUST TRASHED YOU ♥♥♥♥♥!!!!""All in all, as far as bang for your buck goes, I'd rate this title a 10/10. If you like cheesy humour and tower defense, don't hesitate to buy this game. You won't regret it.edit: Don't feel ashamed if you cried after losing on easy mode..... We all have....			"

												I didn’t even want to play this game. Got a DotE key from the developers as a reward for my humble input in polishing Endless Space (bug reports mostly) right after the game had hit early access –  it was a nice surprise. My initial experience with playing DotE was very painful and I was like ‘It’s too difficult, too unbalanced and unpolished. I’d rather the devs release another balancing patch for Endless Space than waste their resources on developing a rogue-like’. Now DotE is one of my all time favourites and it’s definitely the most addictive non-4X game I know, which is why I nominated it for the ‘Just for 5 minutes’ award.Pros: DotE is a very successful mix of different game genres. It’s a rogue-like tower defense dungeon crawler with some RPG elements which also offers a lot of strategic depth. Such an amazing mix I’ll never get bored of. Nice graphics. DotE shows us that pixel art games can be very beautiful. A woman who’s convinced she’s a spider, a well-dressed carrion eater with delicate palate, a masochistic soldier, a booby mage with multiple personalities disorder (kind of) and very poor hygiene, an overcompensating shorty with a giant sword… The heroes of DotE are whimsical and hilarious.  DotE's good writing with bizarre humor make you read every single item description. Use football whistle to cause monsters to fall down, grab an ankle and cry. Don’t forget to equip one of your heroes with hipster scarf to make him or her number one target for all monsters on the floor. Huge replayability: there are 8 different game modes including Endless mode. Plenty of community designed content. As usual, Amplitude Studios did a really good job of bringing to life some good ideas proposed by their friendly and creative community. At least 1 major game mode (Bioship), 2 playable heroes, a bunch of minor modules and  random events were designed by players.  The soundtrack by FlybyNo. I personally consider  FlybyNo one of the top musicians working in gaming industry. Prooflink:

Cons: Steep learning curve. Die, die again, learn something, die, try a different strategy, die. Note, the game is NOT too or very difficult, but it's unforgiving. It takes time to find out what’s important and what’s not. Once you figure out how to deal with the most dangerous mobs and which items you must acquire ASAP, you’ll be doing just fine. At this point (after 200-300 hours spent in the dungeon playing in offline mode) escaping the dungeon is no challenge for me, sadly. Some heroes (looking at you, Sara) and modules need rebalancing but nothing game-breaking. Only one save slot. This is very annoying, especially if you at some point got tired of Endless mode and want to start a new playthrough without losing your current progress.I recommend Dungeon of The Endless to any gamer regardless of their gaming preferences. It’s a real indie gem, which you will not regret buying, even if at the end of the day you find out that it’s not your cup of tea.			"

												Wow okay. So a while back my friend got me to buy this game and play it with him. He had just picked it up, and wanted a team mate. We quickly discovered that ""Easy"" mode is anything but easy. But because we are MEN we vowed never to try ""Too Easy"" mode, and to eventually beat ""Easy"".64 Hours of playtime and 90 attempts later, after countless guides, meta-game planning, and honing our teamwork, we finally beat the first pod on ""Easy"" mode last night.Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game is hard. But there is just something about it that keeps you coming back for another ♥♥♥ kicking, over and over. I'm gonna break down everything there is to love about it.- The artwork is adorable and combined with the music the game really does a great job of creating a cohesive aesthetic.- The strategic options are insanely expansive, there are so many different plausible strategies.- The game not only has multiplayer, but embraces it, giving you great tools for working with your friends, including resource sharing, character and item swapping, and you can unlock pretty much everything in multiplayer mode.- Completely unique gameplay, really never played anything quite like it.- Tons of characters to unlock, and each one feels special.- one of the characters thinks she is a spider and crawls around like a maniac eating bugs off the floor and if you don't love that then we aren't friends.The game is not for everyone, though. The combat is simplistic, it's more of a macro approach, commanding your hero where to fight, but not how to fight. It fits a really small niche really really well. If you like rogue-like strategic potato-chip gameplay, this is the one for you. If you spend your free time at work creating excell spreadsheets mathing out the most effective resource generation strategies, this one is for you. If you reallym like getting into the nitty gritty of a game and being genuinely enjoyably challenged by it, this one is for you.I leave you all with this; beating Easy mode with my friend was probably the highest and more emotional moment I have ever experienced while gaming, and I am not being hyperbolic. It was probably enhanced by the shots of Kraken we had taken in anticipation of losing in the last few floors, but still. Absolutely fantastic.			"

												I had about enough of rogue-like games but Dungeon of the Endless is a whole other animal. By going down the RPG-road, taking a hard left at the tower defense genre and bringing this clevery package to a full stop at classic strategy games like dungeon keeper, DotE arrives at a unique place. It´s high difficulty, motivating character development and stage design grants the game a rare pull that keeps you coming back for more. Beautiful pixel-art, a haunting soundtrack and a good sense of humor round up what was easily one of my most enjoyable experiences this year. Don´t miss Dungeon of the Endless!			"

												after almost 150 hours in this amazing game, probably my favourite game. I finally got all the achievements. The first 30 or so hours were really frustrating and annoying but i could see the potential and that the game was balanced and fair and that every mistake i made was a learning experience. Once i got the hang of things i never lost a run. And then the achievement hunting began. And there are some difficult ones lol. Never one to look for help i tried hard to come up with my own strategies and finally prevailed and conquered them all. To all the newcomers trying out this amazing game, give it time and keep playing. It's the most unique and satisfying game i've ever played in my life.			"

												Possibly the closest a game comes to mechanical perfection, Dungeon of the Endless can be both brutally difficult and extremely rewarding both in a single turn. Forget what you know about tower defense or rogue-likes, or any of the other genres this game is thrown into. It's a unique mish-mash of ideas that somehow works, and works very well. There is a lot of great character and humor infused in the game without it ever distracting from the core experience. The visual design is beautifully stylized with a pleasantly minimal UI design. It's also an absolute blast to play co-op with up to 3 other friends.Just be ready to fail a lot early on.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a gem of a game that mixes RTS, Tower Defense, Roguelike, RPG and resource management. It sounds messy, but works pretty well. Your objective is to protect the crystal, explore to find the exit of the floor and take the crystal there. You gain more resources for each door opened, and each door means more monster and loot.At a first glance, DotE looks like a very simple game, but as you play you'll discover a lot of depth and new strategies. There's a lot to unlock, including pictures for your album, new heroes and new ships (each ship adds new rules to the game). Each playthrough is randomly generated, so you'll never play the same game twice. This adds a lot of replay value.Dungeon of the Endless quickly became one of the best games I've ever played. I can recommend to anyone looking for a unique experience.PROS:*Very fun and addictive*High replay value*Great visuals and good optimization*Beautiful, immersive soundtrack*A lot of possibilities*Hard but fair difficulty*Satisfying to playCONS:*Bad tutorial*It's hard to tell what's going on when you're in a battle*To own all ships you need to buy the Crystal pack and Emperor pack (from Endless Legend)---I rate this game a 8.5 / 10			"

												It's pretty difficult. If you want to play a interesting original roguelike, this is a good choice.Pros:-Resource system that actually works.-Multiple heroes.-Different types of buildings/turrets to build.-Unique art style that fits the game well, the menus and loading screens are designed nicely.-Immersive soundtrack.-Unlockable ships that offer different playstyles-You will die.Cons:Online multiplayer is very unreliable. (at least at the time of my review.) every game I played players disconnect halfway through a floor or just lag out. Long review versionYou delve into a dungeon with 2 heroes and go through the rooms clearing monsters and collecting resources. 4 resources - dust (to power rooms) science (for research) Industry (for building) and food (for leveling up and healing heroes.)The more rooms you open up, the more dangerous the dungeon gets. The limited resource dust is aquired from exploring and killing enemies. You have to manage this resource to power rooms so you don't get overwhelmed. (Enemies spawn in unpowered rooms.) which makes it a time crunch to find the exit. You have to actually plan your actions and adapt to situations accordingly.Along the way, you find equipment, and other heroes that you can recruit to your party. If you make it far enough with these heroes, you actually end up unlocking them, which is a nice feature.For the price, I think this game is great. I bought the normal version which is $12.99.If you like roguelikes and don't mind dying alot, you can get a quite a bit of replayability out of this.			"

												Take the procedural dungeon generation of a roguelike, the looting and hero-building of an action-RPG, and the research and development of a tower defense game and you'll start to get an idea of what ""Dungeon of the Endless"" is about.  You might still hate the game, but it won't be for lack of creativity.  I could probably spend a lot of words explaining the game's mechanics to you, but I'd be talking all day:  At its essence, Dungeon of the Endless is about guiding 1-4 ""heroes"" through a series of dungeon floors.  To transition floors, you must use a crystal to power the elevator.  But the crystal is heavy and fragile, and everything living inside the dungeon wants to kill it above all other things.Along the way you'll encounter new ""heroes""--some of these individuals have histories with one another (for better or worse) and each represents a unique set of potential skills in getting the hell out of the dungeon.  You'll also find an anachronistic mix of equipment--swords and machineguns, textbooks and jumpsuits--for outfitting these characters.While heroes will be your primary way of interacting with the dungeon (and the only way to get the crystal from one elevator to the next) you will also need to research and develop a whole host of ""modules"" that bolster your defenses against the dungeon hordes while your heroes search for the next exit.  There are modules for generating new sources of science (needed to research and upgrade new modules), food (needed to level-up heroes), and industry (needed to actually BUILD modules), modules for killing different kinds of creatures, modules for defense and healing, etc.  Suffice to say, your heroes probably won't get very far unless you're actively researching and developing new modules.There's also a fourth resource simply called ""Dust"", which is required to power rooms.  Modules only function in powered rooms, and powered rooms prevent monsters from spawning in them.  To keep your defenses functioning and your heroes from being mauled by monstrous swarms, you'll need to carefully route and re-route power to rooms as you explore each floor.  But for as complex as the game can be, there's an efficiency to it that makes it easy to learn but challenging to master.  There's no obligatory grinding, or dead-end research trees to waste time on, or useless skills to invest in.  You can rush through each map as quickly as it takes you to find the exit, and ignore research or heroes (at your own peril).  Everything that exists in the game has a valid role or use, with few (if any) ""traps"" to watch out for.  And that's nice, frankly, because you'll be experimenting with a lot of different strategies and dying a lot in the process.  Speaking of dying, there are a few issues with the game that may sour opinions.  For starters, dungeons can be downright stingy with Dust--the aforementioned resource that powers modules and rooms--later on in the game.  If you're not prepared for the chagrin of the RNG, a Dust-shortage can rapidly spell disaster.  Fortunately there are numerous solutions to this scenario, including Emergency Generators, Shop modules, and hero-specific skills and items that promote Dust collection...but most of them require at least a little foresight.  I don't think it's a huge issue, but some players may disagree.There's also one enemy that really doesn't work well with the game's mechanics.  It has a chance to spawn in later rooms where it mutates into a powerfully ""tanky"" and immobile monster.  Although it doesn't pose an immediate threat to your heroes, it must be killed for the game to consider the wave ended.  As a result you'll frequently have situations where everything's dead except for one (or more) of these things, they've already grown into their final form, and now you've got your heroes on rotation, taking turns whittling its health down and stepping out of the room to heal.  Alternatively, you've got to break defenses and rush out to kill them as quickly as possible...but then your (wounded) hero has to kite the inevitable horde of angry creatures back to a powered room and hope it doesn't overwhelm them.  Neither scenario really adds anything to the game.For the most part, though, Amplitude--a company known for approaching things a little differently--really delivered on Dungeon of the Endless.  It's not a perfect recipe but it's incredibly novel and, between the variety of unique heroes, loot, modules, and ""ships"" (game modes), there's a significant degree of replayability in a compact package.  The average player will find it to be thoroughly challenging while rarely feeling cheap or unfair.  Then again, the RNG is not always forgiving.			"

												*Recieved as a gift, but would sure pay its price, worth it*Highly recommended game if you're into indies, and a mix of tower defence with rogue-like elements. The game offers you a ""Too easy"" difficulty which I skipped and went directly into easy thinking ""Meh, how hard can it be?"" Only to be devoured by waves of diverse monsters on the 2nd floor. The characters are diverse, each with their pros and cons that fill multiple roles into a team of 4, there are also 4 characters from TF2 which I absolutely love being a veteran of that game. Multiple ""modules"" to build from which offer resource income, support, defensive and offensive towers. Think tower defence, resource management and beautiful atmospheric monster hunting in a space ship with odd characters and lovely backgrounds.			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon of the Endless gives the system of Tower Defense a really interesting perspective.The core: every tower defense has it and the goal always remains the same, protect it and do not let it be destroyed. But what if you need to transport the core to an exit point after finding it? This is what gives this game a really interesting system to it.Basically, you start out with the core, two people to start exploring and so called ""Dust"", which is currency and the life of the core at the same time. 10 dust is needed to power a room after exploring it. Powering it will result in being able to build structures in it and make enemies not be able to spawn. Opening doors will give you resources to build things, level up or heal your team. You gain Dust by exploring further and killing enemies, which allows you to expand your base in the course of the level. Your crew is the key to getting these resources as you can place members next to built resource stations to increase thier gain per opened door, also they act as moveable turrets to keep enemies away. If all of them die though, the game's over.As the goal is to take the core and find the exit, it is important to power the right rooms, place your guys right and build the right structures. When you think you're ready for the heat, take the core by letting somebody pick it up and run for it, if the carrier dies though, it's also game over. When the core leaves the beginning of the level, enemies will spawn non-stop in every room that's not lit. Every room the core passes will not be powered any longer as the energy's not connecting to them anymore.So far it seems like a really dynamic game and like a fresh idea to the genre, and for it's early Alpha stage the game still seems very finished when it comes to the design and the systematics. I am looking forward to the content as it's added to the game and happily recommend it to everyone that is into these kind of games.			"

Early Access Review
 JOURNAL ENTRY #1  - So it appears a dual-gun wielding man and a sword wielding woman have crashed landed on this ship. The room I am in seems like a generator room with a bright yellow cube. I figure the woman should proceed first as she wields a sword which'd be better at close range and then I can send in the man to attack from a range. This worked efficiently and I managed to gather to enough resources to level up both my characters a few times.  JOURNAL ENTRY #2 - Warning symbols appear all around the generator room, I figure my objective is to protect that for now, so I use the woman's special ability which lets her move significantly faster to get back to the base. I make and it is swarmed by multiple enemies. My gunman follows and I use his special ability which buffs our damage in the room. We manage to fight off the enemies and return to exploring the ship. I now come across what I imagine to be an escape, so I grab the generator core and run using the woman's special ability to get out faster. We escape and that's floor one done. JOURNAL ENTRY #3  - After upgrading my characters a few times and equipping them with the new gear found, I continue using the same strategy as before. After reaching a shop I spend a lot of money on new equipment for my characters. Bad idea, I now have no money to spend on health. Enemies appear in the next room so I send the sword wielding woman in to fight them and send the gunman back to base. A wave comes and I manage to fight them off, but I forget about the woman who sadly gets overwhelmed with enemies and dies. After two more waves I finally find the exit and escape. Alone.  JOURNAL ENTRY #4 - Alone on the next floor, I begin searching for the rooms, I find the exit almost instantly and figure it's my best interest to escape now so I can get a good score. I grab the generator and head down. JOURNAL ENTRY #5 - This is where things start to get difficult. I begin by upgrading my character and saving enough money for healing. I start searching the rooms and each is a struggle. I narrowly survive each room and gather enough money to heal regularly. A wave is now incoming. I prepare by heading to the base. Enemies flood in from 3 directions and I fend them off the best I can. Eventually I'm overwhelmed and just like my partner, I die.This game is fantastic fun, it has gameplay like Faster Than Light with elements from The Binding Of Isaac, give it a try!			"

Review for solo-play :This game is a strange beast.It's surprisingly addictive, but it's ultimately shallow : the strategy is pretty basic and it's mostly based on knowing what's coming next. This knowledge is acquired by dying & dying again.I beat the game using a trick to backup & restore my save. Looking back on my run it feels very empty and meaningless without any special event nor excitement ; there's only the stress to be crushed by a horde of enemies coming unexpectedly without any warning... :-/The game is ultra-repetitive, even with only 1 run of 12 levels ; it splits like this :- Levels 1-3: learn the basics- Levels 4-6: rolling easily, except for mistakes coming from the annoying interface- Levels 7-11: running low on Dust, which means we have to use towers more & more to stop the big waves of monsters- Level 12: rush to the exit, as there's almost no build slot anymoreLuck (or its absence) matters way more than skill. I did & re-did many times some levels, doing more or less the same thing, only to win easily thanks to an efficient layout.The Tower Defense part is dim in the 2nd part of the run, and totally negligible in the 1st part.And the length of a full run (around 6-9hours) is just too long for starting all over again every time you die.In a close concept, I'd highly recommend FTL which succeeds everywhere DotE fails (except it's not Coop ;-) ).Pros :- Very unique set of rules & mix of concepts- Very intriguing at 1st- If you get into it, decent replayability with new modes offering slightly different rulesCons :- Luck matters way more than skill- Strategy is actually pretty basic- Highly repetitive- No special event- Only 2 difficulty levels : ""Too Easy"" and ""Easy"" ; and ""Easy"" ain't easy, it's more like ""Hard""... I guess the developers of this game must have a high esteem of the quality of their humor. They shouldn't.- Pixel art is a total mess : it's nearly impossible to see what's going on when there's a ton of enemies crushing in the same roomDebunking the Steam Store Page Description :exploring an ever-expanding dungeonNo, the dungeon doesn't expand.all while facing waves of monsters and special eventsNo, there's no noteworthy special event (the only one I can think of is the EMF that disables your towers for a couple of rounds ; that's not exactly super exciting).Form a team of heroes, each with their own strengths (and psychoses)No, they don't have psychoses (ie: it's not Darkest Dungeon ;-) ).Manage the balance between ex-prison inmates and guardsNo, this doesn't have any influence on the gameplay (except maybe for the small ""trust"" bonus, but who cares about that?).Each door is a danger; prepare yourself and your team for anythingIt's only monsters. (Again.)Explore and discover an infinity of levels and layoutsWhich are all pretty basic.Fight your way to the surface to discover the truth about AurigaMight be another proof of the great sense of humor of the devs : there's a little animation with meteorites falling on the planet surface with our team looking at it. The End.			"

												After 80 minutes of initial gameplay, the Dungeion of the Endless feels like a solid dungeon crawler. It was brutal to me at some moments and challengingly fun at other moments. Overall, the game is fun, with smooth gameplay, immersing atmosphere and soundtrack. Don't know what stopped me from buying this game on Christmass sale, but I have no regrets for buying this game now. I recommend to sci-fi fans and rogue-like fans alike.			"

												A fantastic rouge-like if you don't mind sitting down for a few hours (or taking breaks between sessions). Campaigns can last anywhere from an half an hour to 4~5 depending on your skill level. It can be brutally difficult and has an unforgiving mix of luck and strategy, but the sense of success after gambling your whole game on a single door really is something I wish I could find more frequently. The art is fantastic and never feels redundant especially with the random level layouts. The soundtrack really is something else, too!			"

												(This review was very close to the beta entrance.)Dungeon of the Endless is a roguelike-dungeon crawler game. But... it it not exactly ""Fantasy"". It is more like... ""Sci-fi"".Consider your mind blown.Pros:+ Gameplay is fun if you like exploration and strategy (which I do).+ Replay value is pretty good.+ Handling resources makes this game challenging.+ Pixel graphics are amazing (good job devs :D ).+ GRRRRREAT soundtrack if you like light-ish dubstep.+ No two replays are the same. Random events are common.+ Humor. The best.Cons:- Story. The plot is REALLY interesting, but they don't build on it enough in my opinion.- Repitition. March of 2014 I stopped playing this because of boringness, but it has really changed from then.- It takes a while to unlock all the gamemodes.All in all, if you like The Binding of Isaac, I recommend buying this.

												WoW... this game surprised me a little. There are 2 difficulty. Easy and Very Easy. If you think it's simple you got tricked. Instead of Easy and Very Easy it's actually Hard and Impossible. Took me 7 trys to get the hang of it and finally finish the Easy on prison ship. You gota give them credit to make a basic TD game into something much much more. Graphic is a little more to be under par but it's good enough once learn the ropes and fully understood the concept of ""keep as many room lighted as possible"", ""heavy Defense at chock point"", ""Focus Hero attack"", ""Learn to Operate"", ""Learn to Repair"". Soon you will be drawn into the game and forget the time.Getting most of the achievements are easy and i was able to get about 7 on my first victory but getting all achivments needs a lot grinding and many different replays with each different ships. Got a strange bug that i complete the game with 4 hero but i was only credited for 3... I would defintly recommend everyone to get and try this game. Do not give up when you play the first few attempts, keep on trying. You will jump out of your chair cheering when you complete this game for the first time.			"

												A turn-based tower defense-ish game that seems fairly easy on the surface but actually has a lot going on in terms of strategy and skill.  Pros:- Lots of strategy and skill needed, especially as you progress to higher levels- The random-ish maps mean you are always playing a new game, bad luck with dungeon composition will force you to make hard decisions.- Unlocking characters and ships is fun and challenging- Playing with friends can be a fun experience (good coop)- Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Unique version of each item- Characters play off each other so each team has it's own style and strategyCons:- No save feature in multiplayer (Though this is supposedly getting addressed)- Players can't share items in multiplayer.- The UI can be a bit tricky for new players, not very intuative Overall:More to come...

												Now, I haven't played this game as long as some people, but I have to say that it is one of my favourite games I've played in a very long time. A quick run down of the Single Player mechanics (Multiplayer is basically the same thing, except you control one hero from the start but you can have 4 people start)From the start, you pick two heroes. These heroes have four stats: Speed, Health, Strength, and Wit.Speed helps you move around the rooms faster, but most heroes who have the highest Speeds tend to have the lowest Health and Strength. Speed is also used for moving the crystal around for when you find the exit.The Crystal is what you have to defend with your life. It acts as your power source for the rooms you encounter, and if it gets destroyed, it's game over. You can only pick up the crystal after you have found the exit.Health lets you tank rooms which have the lowest defenses or if you need to hold a choke point. The heroes wth high Health tend to have high Strength as well, but low Speed and Wit. You'll normally want to place these heroes in rooms that aren't powered, whether that's because you don't have enough Dust to power every room, or if it's because you want to conserve your Dust for the rooms that you're exploring.Dust is what you use to power your rooms, and it's gathered by the Crystal. If the Crystal gets damaged, then your Dust count lowers. When it hits 0, you've lost the game. Dust is collected from three places- Opening doors, killing monsters, or operating on a Store module that has a shopkeep in it. I'll get into modules later, but the only definite way to 100% get Dust in every single room is by operating on a Store module.Strength is what determines how much damage you'll do to enemy monsters. High Strength heroes tend to be the most diverse, allowing for high Health, high Wit, or high Speed, but if a hero has two high stats, the other two are going to be extremely low. These heroes are the ones you want opening doors.When you open a door, it will generate your Industry, your Science, and your Food, as well as having the chance to find Dust. Opening a door will also spawn monsters that you'll have to deal with, lest they will kill your heroes and destroy your Crystal. There are also certain things that you can find when you open a door: Cryo pods, Heroes lost in the dungeon, a Dust generator, and a Crystal which allows you to research different modules. These all have a random chance to occur, and if you find one, then you won't spawn monsters. I don't have time to go into every detail about each of these things, but just know that they're there.Wit determines how much of a certain resource you'll gain when operating on a module. That's pretty much all Wit does for you in the long run. The higher your Wit, the more resources you'll generate when operating on the module that corresponds with that resource. High Wit heroes are important, though. You'll understand why when you start playing.Modules are how you generate more resources, and there are three of them to start out. Industry, Science, and Food Generators, each of them generating more of their respective resources, and they cost indurstry to create. There are also Minor Modules, which you can place on the small module location, and they can serve a multitude of purposes, too many to explain, but you start with a single one, a ""Prisoner Prod,"" the weakest of the attack modules. To get more modules and to upgrade them, you're required to use Science on a research Crystal.So what about food? Food is used to level up your characters and heal them on the way. Levelling your heroes causes their stats to go up, but it also raises the costs of your healing.There are two modes: Easy, and Too Easy. Don't let this go to your head, Easy is extremely difficult and should only be played if you're experienced with Dungeon. You should play Too Easy first to get a handle on everything, and it'll save you a lot of time and energy if you do.Easy starts you off with less resources, less resources generated from opening doors, more costs for healing and placing your modules, as well as less module health.Too Easy starts you off with more resources, more resources generated from opening doors, less costs for healing and placing modules, and more module health.That's about it for now. There's a lot that I still haven't covered, but the rest of it can be explained by playing the game.This game is a lot of fun but it's extremely difficult and requires a lot of patience and time to complete even just one game. My average winning games take about two and a half hour on Too Easy, just a heads up.Kick some ♥♥♥ and don't get lost heroes!			"

												Wow. I wish I had an option somewhere between yes and no. This is fun, but ultimately it is almost entirely ruled by a random number generator. I had a good time figuring out the mechanics, but after the fifth dungeon where I was only offered terrible upgrades (a mixture of hero oriented and tower oriented upgrades which did not play well together) and received almost no dust for opening doors in a highly branched and un-linear environement (thus being unable to reduce mob spawns or place defence effectively) I got pretty frustrated. I suppose that's the nature of ""rogue-likes"", but even Angband would allow you to regenerate a level if you got dealt total crap (assuming you could find an up staircase). In this game, if you get dealt awful it will follow you until you die (probably somewhere around level 6 or 7). It's the biggest failling of this game. Sometimes (frequently?) you will be handed a pile of steaming crap. In other rogue type games, part of the skillset is being able to recognize this and bailing appropriately. In this game, one bad level will follow you since your resource totals persist over levels, mobs get increasingly harder as you descend, and there is no going back to earlier levels if you had to bail due to terrible RNG. If there had been some option to redo a very unlucky level, I'd give this a yes. As it stands, your only option is to go deeper and there were many, many games where I knew I was done for well before I actually died. If the developers had offered some way to mitigate this, I would give this an unhesitanting thumbs up. Unfortunately, they didn't.			"

Early Access Review
Impressions based on January 5th 2014 Early Access AlphaIf you liked FTL but wished it had more depth and choice this game is going to be for you. The concept is simple. Every time you open a door you're given resources. You use those resources to power rooms (preventing monsters from spawning in them) and place machinery to gather more resources and act as defensive/offensive turrets. Of course it's not all that easy, each room has a chance to contain monsters, useful items, blueprints for more machinery and additional people that you can hire. The goal, get your power crystal at the start room to the exit, when you find it. Each play is randomised so you're never sure what's going to be behind that next door!Of course there are lots of other elements in there beyond this. Each member of your team has their own stats and abilities which you can level up at the cost of food. Placing them in a room with a machine increases its efficiency but of course this means spreading your team out. If a machine is destroyed so is the building platform making the room much less useful. It goes on and on.Regarding the Alpha. Game length seems limited right now, you get three dungeon runs before you win but of course each run is different so the limit really is more to do with leveling your team than actual play time. This really is a state whereby the mechanics are being tested rather than the content. The developer is keen to engage with players and encourages feedback and voting on features. And the future feature list is quite extensive.As I said at the start. If you like FTL then this should suit you down to the ground, it's Alpha but it's very much playable and will be fun to see it grow into a full release.			"

												A relentless pseudo-turn based dungeon crawler, with no end of challenge. The game features only two immediate and apparent difficulties: Too Easy, and Easy. Don't let these difficulty titles fool you, they're a lot more daunting than they seem. The dungeons are unforgiving, one mistake or failure to prepare can ultimately lead to your cascading loss of the dungeon. The already challenging difficulties can be further multiplied by selecting different escape pods that give new rules to your dungeon. The greatest enemy you will face in the dungeons isn't the monsters, it's the random number generator. What's in the next room? Monsters? Dust? A much needed damage-per-second, or utility hero? Maybe the room will be empty. Who know's what's in store for you in the depths of the Dungeons of the Endless. This game is not for those who are looking for a casual dungeon crawler.			"

												This game is a blast. Think dungeon keeper as a rogue-like but with only a few units, and heavily influenced by RPG mechanics. Basically, you start out in a randomly generated dungeon, and your goal is to find a room with the exit. All rooms can be ""powered"", which means enemy monsters will not spawn in them, and allows you to build all sorts of defenses, offenses, and resource generators. Whenever you open up a new room, it is counted as you taking your turn. Once you take your turn, enemy monsters will spawn in rooms that you do not have enough resources or ""dust"" to power up, and try to attack either your heroes or your crystal which is like your ""heart."" If all your guys die, or your crystal's dust reaches 0, you lose and have to make a new game. It gets increasingly tricky to balance everything as you get into later levels, so you'll die a lot at first.Pros:- Randomness makes each playthrough unique.- Even though your heroes just sit there auto attacking enemies, you have to constantly watch their health bars and be ready to use active abilities or micro them to another room. It can get a little frantic.- Music and sound effects are great and totally pleasing.- Strategic placement of modules and traps is rewarding.- Self-Powered Rooms.- Heroes have a decent amount of variation and customization.- The art looks cooler as the game progresses.Cons: - There could be a little more variation in random occurances in rooms. After a little more than a few playthroughs, I had seen all the random room events. Off the top of my head I can think of many more which wouldn't be hard to implement, such as ""Trade a hero permanently for 50 food?"" or ""Trade 30 science for 20 dust and 20 industry?"" Very simple things to spice rooms up a little more.- Multiplayer has given me and my friends a lot of headaches. I keep trying to play with people and I get disconnected, or I get de-synced. I haven't been able to get past a couple levels without something going awry, so I have nothing else to say about the rest of multiplayer.- Slightly lacking in variation of mobs. I was hoping there was a ""boss"" mob or randomly generated super enemies. After one-two playthroughs, you won't see any different mobs unless you got further than you did the last time.Misc:- For all the RPG elements in the game, it's weird they didn't include critical hits. At least I haven't seen any. "

Early Access Review
								As a fan of both Tower Defense games and Rogue-likes I have to say this game is fantastic! It's not that much of a tower defense game (even though it has strong influences from the genre, like waves after waves of mobs and module/tower building) as it is a resource-management and a survival game.This game is step-based, meaning you have to open doors in the dungeon, and after each door is opened you gain resources depending on how many active modules you have and an action phase starts where mobs rush to your crystal room. Game is real-time during the action phase, but it can be paused to plan your strategy accordingly.There is a lot of depth in this game from things like:- many heroes, all of them with stat progressions, levels, abilities and personalities- many constructable minor and major modules, that offer effects to your rooms, heroes or resources- research system, that allows you to unlock module tech by spending science- item system that lets you tweak heroes in various ways (each hero can hold 3 items in special slots)- though monsters, most of them with special effects - interesting progressive dungeon rooms, with good visuals, and many bonuses to be exploredBonus points:- great minimalistic artstyle- soothing soundtrack- great gameplay- future potential as the devs continue to develop it- devs are great and they are updating the game frequently- endless hours of fun- challenging gameplayBad points:- can be too difficult- still in early developmentI really recommend this game to anyone that wants a challenge and a good old rogue-like, with a modern feel.

												This game is really hard to place. It has a great art style, and brings new ideas to the table when it comes to the roguelike genre. Here's the kicker: it's not balanced. This might require some explanation.You start the game off with 2 heroes and they gain minor stat increases and activated abilities by leveling up. To level up it takes food. Your ability to get food is based on the number of rooms you can power using dust which drops off monsters. Now it seems pretty straightfoward that you should unpower rooms in order to accumulate more dust from monsters, but if you spawn more monsters it gets harder every time you open another room. Also, if you unpower rooms you can't accumulate income from the modules you place, and the turrets and support modules won't work in that room. So you want to be saving up industry, food and science but you can't do that if you unpower rooms. Dungeon of the Endless actively punishes the player for doing well, making it more difficult to push their advantages. It also becomes extremely deadly when the player is behind on item upgrades, industry and dust. To me, at least, that is the polar opposite of how a roguelike game should be balanced. It's just not fun!Each run of this game takes a TON of hours to complete. There's 12 floors in a run and if you want to succeed you really need to open nearly every door per floor. It's the only way to get resources, so you have to! The game gets repetitive really quickly in this way. I really wish they would trim down the floors per run. It would feel more roguelike increasing the enemy diversity you encounter per floor. Another problem is the number of enemies the game spawns negates the level of effort put into art design. Have fun watching a pixelated sword flash inside a mob of 40 pixelated enemies which would like awesome if there were only a few but endless is definitely the correct term for the number of enemies spawning.I also have found the concept of using heroes in a turret defense, but placing more weight on research and turrets quite confusing. They have spent considerable time developing these characters and putting them in the spotlight but discouraging gameplay revolved around leveling your heroes quickly.I'll mention briefly all merchants were bugged on release, however the devs have caught on and said it's being fixed in their next patch. Unfortunately the bug made the game virtually unplayable as your items could get stuck in your inventory, and merchants are the primary source of upgrades for your heroes. Multiplayer seems tacked on, much like Risk of Rain's multiplayer which is still quite buggy. Most community posts concerning multiplayer have been negative. Honestly I don't know why roguelikes are even including multiplayer it's really not the point!Unless something BIG happens to change the game balance I simply can't reccomend Dungeon of the Endless. The experience has been more frustrating than fun, albeit some interesting concepts.			"

												Now here's a game with some choice meat on it. Dungeon of the Endless is a sci-fi rogue-like/dungeon crawler/RTS/TD hybrid where you control a team of explorers trying to escape an underground dungeon that they crash landed into from outer space. You create a team of varied heroes, who all have different feats and strengths to climb this dungeon floor by floor. Each floor is randomized every time and to clear each floor you have to explore unlit closed rooms for an exit to bring your power crystal to the next floor. Each room you open gives you resources to either level up your crew, plant resource generators, or create towers to help defend you against monsters. Here's the catch, each unlit room has the chance to spawn monsters which will fight your heroes or ultimately attack your power crystal. You can light up each room by placing a hero in that room or by using a resource called dust, which can be collected by killing monsters or found randomly in unlit rooms. If your crystal is destroyed, or your heroes all die, you lose the game and must start a new randomized run from the ground floor.The game plays like an RTS, in that you control your heroes from a top down perspective with only your mouse. It feels like an RPG because you can level up and collect loot for your crew, and you can also pause time by pressing the space bar. However, it is crucial in your survival to learn the TD aspect of creating minor towers to help you defend your crystal. Finally the perma-death ""everything goes away"" along with the ""everything is randomly generated"" gives it that touch of rogue-like that everyone loves these days. This game is the true definition of a hybrid if I've ever seen one.Fair warning, the game is HARD. There's a strong difficulty curve when playing on what I can only see as a developer joke of a difficulty labeled ""easy"". It is not easy, you will die and you will die a lot. But like other rogues, the game has that patented addictive element of ""just one more floor"".Multiplayer is currently busted, so I can't really comment on it. There's lag spikes, desynchs which cause disconnects with no reconnect feature, and no item share functionality. If you do get a game working without disconnects, the co-op is pretty great. But do not get your hopes up, as currently it's a problem 90% of the time.However as a single player experience, this fairs very, very well. It's definitely a new favorite of mine to spend time with. Between the simply gorgeous art style, the very good soundtrack, and the interesting mish-mash of game elements that somehow just work, this game is an insanely good time. Highly recommended.			"

												Shortly after I finished Dungeons of the Endless (DotE) on ""Easy"" difficulty, I went back to playing The Witcher 3 for one of the expansions. I had played 105 hours of DotE, so I laughed when I saw that I had played 111 hours of The Witcher 3 (only 6 hours more!).DotE is just that good. The only game to which I can make a direct comparison is FTL: Faster than Light. Both are roguelike, both involve exploring a ""dungeon"", and both require you to make decisions regarding which heroes should be stationed in which rooms. The classic ""risk vs reward"" theme applies in both cases.But I stopped playing FTL after about 25 hours. Whereas I hit a wall with FTL's difficulty and gave up; with DotE I couldn't help but throw myself at that same wall over and over again. Although the ""Easy"" difficulty can be brutal (nice troll on the developers' part), the game does reward experimentation over time.For example, do I start with heroes that focus on fighting, limiting the research I can do on better modules? Or do I begin with heroes that have high ""wit"" (i.e. - ability to help generate more resources). Or do I try to balance the two? Or as yet another option, do I have one or more heroes that focus on generating ""dust"", a crucial resource in the later levels?This extends to things like......leveling: do I try to level up my heroes evenly? Or just focus on my fighters?...research: do I concentrate on offensive modules (turrets, mines, etc.)? Or defensive ones (defense buffs, life steal, etc.)? And how much of my research should go to making the modules that generate most of my resources better?...exploration: do I keep opening rooms on the current floor, getting resources with each door but risking a huge monster onslaught? Or do I just run for the exits?If you Google ""Dungeons of the Endless strategy"", you will find helpful answers to these questions. But I would encourage you not to do that. For me the fun was to see how far I could get without consulting the Oracle (I mean Mr. Google :D). Eventually I did have to look at the DotE wiki for some character tips, but it was still satisfying finally making it through ""Easy"" difficulty without reading a full-on walkthrough.Unfortunately I cannot comment on the multiplayer, but I have to imagine this game is a blast to play with friends. Whether you have people to play with or not, check it out!			"

												RTS x SF roguelike, I prefer to say that this is roguelike-like.If you like both of real-time simulation games and roguelike games, then DoE is highly recommended.Pros +16The game has many ways to dig harder, but also has lower entry barriers than other roguelike games. +3Supports multiplayer game. +2Provides a unique experience, which makes it further enjoyable. +7Well balanced. +3Good sound system to keep the player concentrated. +1Cons -4Poor dot graphics.

												Now let me say one thing - This game is REALLY hard the first few times you play it (even in Too Easy difficulty), but once you get the hang of it, you really start to enjoy it.I've noticed that almost all of the negative reviewers have only clocked up a couple of hours playing the game and are just probably fed up with the game.Realistically, this game is a rogue-like RPG tower defence game with retro-style graphics that makes the game (in my opinion) better than if it had realistic graphics. It's definitely worth the value.But if you want more cotent in the ame, you're going to have to download some DLC. Some of it is free but others aren't (unfortunately).In the end, my rating is this:8.5/10. Would rage again.			"

												A unique entry to evergrowing roguelike genre and one of the best I’ve played. Dungeon of the Endless skillfully merges both turn and real time based strategy in a way I’ve never seen before. It strikes almost a perfect balance between luck and strategy. It keeps you on an edge but is fair. Things can be chaotic but there's a logic in that. Dungeon of the Endless is rich in playable characters and game modifier accompanied by pleasing visuals. Because of that, I name it a top tier roguelike.Final score : 8/10The good :-	Addictive with “just one more turn” syndrome-	Pleasing presentation-	Unique gameplay-	Fair and balanced but also keeps you on your toes-	Variety in simplicityThe bad :-	UI is not as informative as it should be-	Equipment and gear is not as numerous as in other roguelikes-	Humor is kind of meh-	Lacks a story			"

												One thing I certainly have to say for Dungeon of the Endless is that it's awfully hard to describe. You're basically in a ship trying to move a crystal from one floor to the next, killing enemies that spawn in unlit rooms which try to attack the crystal. The caveat being that you don't have enough power to light ALL the rooms.  Within that framework, you can make yourself better at killing enemies (leveling up or finding items) or research and drop some defenses and machines to help you do it. Playing the game typically comes down to thinking in advance about what could happen and taking chances. Should you build something that, over time, will help you research more defenses, even if you may not spend much more time in that particular level? Should you risk hanging out across the map maximizing food production, if your gun will mean the difference in whether your teammate is able to defend the crystal (or themselves).  These tense decisions keep the game engaging.			"

												It's a weird mix of games that I don't really play, specially the tower defense..But it's surprisingly fun and interesting! When you first start playing it has a ""Very easy"" and ""easy"" setting which to me translates into ""Not too bad"" and ""Oh god that person died immediately this is easy?"" but I'm not gonna say I'm the best at this sorta thing.But anyway! Basically, you crash deep in the ground, need to go up, need to protect your crystal, move crystal, enemies go woogy boogy, reach top, then yay you did it! But then there's Endless Legend which is like a continuation of the story, then something or another space. Basically stop reading this nonsense and just play it.			"

												A mashup of roguelike, tower defense and RPG that works shockingly well. Rock solid mechanics, lots of strategic and tactical decisions to make and a buttload of content. Easy to learn, hard to master, impossible to put down once you get into it (seriously, you know the ""just one more turn"" syndrom of good 4X games?

												Fantastic approach to dungeon crawling with some unusual gameplay mechanics featuring semi-turn based tactics and micro-management.I could call this game 'a mix between a party dungeon crawler and a tower defense' but that wouldn't cover all this game has to offer. You start off selecting a 'crew' which is to land inside a planet's randomly generated dungeon. Your crew is consisted of 2 to 4 heroes, which have their own skills, stats, intentory, background story and dialogue. Upon landing you explore the dungeon by opening doors to other rooms, which are hidden in a fog of war, until you open them. Every door opening counts as a turn. Each turn you gain resources, which you can then spend on: building modules which generate more resources or assist your heroes in various ways; constructing turrets and such in rooms you have already visited and sent power to; shopping for equipment and leveling up your heroes. Your ultimate goal is to find an exit/elevator on each floor and to deliver the 'crystal' you start off with in a first room to the elevator. The catch is: every 'unpowered' room you discover has a chance to spawn monsters every time you open a door. Every monster will then proceed to attack your crystal, reducing your 'dust'(A currency, required to power rooms which also serves as crystal's HP) until it's depleted. Also as soon as you take your crystal off its place - there is no turning back, monsters will spawn in every room and begin attacking you until you reach the elevator.Your progress is not limited to just leveling up your heroes and giving them equipment. Tons of random events occur in a dungeon, which offer you to hire new heroes in your party, trade your resources for a powerful equipment and research over a dozen turrets, modules and other ways to defend your crystal as you proceed through the floors.The game features a great amount of unlockable content. Characters, starting setups and an artwork gallery. Its replayability is totally on the highest of levels. Especially considering that every piece of equipment found inside a dungeon is generated with random stats.Game also features a multiplayer mode, which adds more tactical depth since you can divide the roles and do whatever you wanted to but lacked a partner controlling a character in a singleplayer mode.TL;DR : A great party dungeon crawler with a randomly generated floor structures, deep tower defense features, unique and interesting pre-made heroes and a great replayability value because of the unlocks. Also music. The soundtrack is very good.			"

 TL;DR  A 2D hybrid strategic tower defense game with resource management elements where you guide your hero towards the surface of the dungeon as you protect the crystal that is your only hope of salvation. Comes highly recommended to fans of tower defense and rough-lite games since death is permanent and every level is randomized.Game DetailName: Dungeons of The EndlessDeveloper: Amplitude Studio [Endless Space, Endless Legends]Genre: Tower Defense, Resource Management, Rogue-litePersonal Score: Hard but is cushion enough to never blame the game but instead each mistake is yours alone. What is Dungeon of The Endless? From Amplitude Studios, maker of such fine strategy games Endless Space and Endless Legends comes a game that does not match their portfolio at all, Dungeon of The Endless; a rogue-lite 2D dungeon escaping game with a dash of tower defense and resource management where every resources count and the RNG hates you.Despite being their first foray into this genre they took what works and throws out what doesnt and in the end we are left with a compact,clean and functional game where the RNG actually adds level of fun instead of pure hate and grind. Read on. Short Intro You are a prisoner sent to a new world where it shall be your duty to colonize it but just above the planet your prisoncraft explodes plunging you straight towards the planet below and stright into the bowels of an Endless Underground Complex.Will you escape towards the surface? Or will you perish along with the others? 1:Graphics 2D retro style graphics that is from the 90s style not the horrible 80s one. That means delicious looking bits of colourful pixel where it is detailed enough for us to know what we are looking at yet vague enough for us to assume a little bit.Included within the game is an album that fills up as you accomplish objectives showing short bio about the characters and monster as if it is written by a mysterious omni-present being. Beautifully done stuff overall. 2:Music And Sound Fans of the Endless series rejoice for once again Amplitude has included within your game directory the soundtrack for the game as they have always done. Melodious and well crafted music flows along as chiptune version of their usual fare brighthens up your day in the dark dungeons or in situation where all hopes are lost, carries you forward to the next game. 3:Gameplay You start the game in your chosen escape pod with 2 heroes inside and as you progress through the game, more escape pods for your future session that has their own pros and cons to consider although the starting pod is the most balance thankfully.The gameplay is fundamentally about you defending a crystal as you open doors after doors that each count as a turn and watch in horror as your supplies dwindle, the monster kills you and a myriad of other things. The crystal serve 3 function, providing you with dust so you can power up rooms and make sure nothing spawns there and as the power souce you need to escape from the current floor you are in once you found the exit. Its destruction means the end of the game session and even minor damage can easily set you back in precious Dust which does not carry over to the enxt floor.Protecting your crystal are heroes that you control up to a maximum party of 4. They can be hired with Food if you happen to find them in the dungeon and you start the game with a few of thems. Each hero are vaguely divided into several classes with the hard hitting bruiser and the fast speedster serving as an example. Conversely their class type also reflects upon their stats and equipment allowed. A trickster type simply would not be able to carry weapons with them but they serve as an important utility with their myriad of skills.As you open doors which serve as a turn indicator, monsters and other random events can happen to you and without spoiling things the theme of the floor often reflects on the danger that lies behind these doors. Enemies are divided into several sub-types that have different priority with an anti hero monster will target the hero, an anti-crystal will go straight for the crystal and boss enemy will destroy everything in their wake. They only ever spawn in dark unpowered rooms but considering doors and room outnumber your Dust resources by several magnitude you often find yourself being swarm by them the moment you open doors.To help you with that the game allows you to build modules and turrets to help lessen the diffculity a bit. Turrets and modules uses your precious industry point and science point to for both research and building purposes. Many types of turrets do not attack but give buffs and debuffs instead but sad to say any turrets you have built will be lost when you reach the next floor. Modules make you industry, science and food points respectively but their cost goes up as you place more but more efficient module can be research.... at the cost of more resource point. Industry point serves as your base building points and the occasional random room where you gamble it for goodies, science points are spent at artifacts room for researching new modules and turrets and lastly food points are used to heal, level up and recruit more heroes. But the little wrench in the whole things are the merchants, randomly spawning in rooms they demand one of your resource point for items that are useful for your hero but the thing is they will sometimes charge in Dust , your most precious resource used to power up rooms to stop monster spawn.More heroes are unlock along with new escape pods as you play through the game. Conclusion  Once again Amplitude Studios produce the same minimalist game with the same great quality soundtrack as they have always been known for and it sure is great. Death while harsh is still cushioned confortably by the game so even the loss of 2 of your heroes does not spell doom for your game session. Overall a great rouge-lite game.Final Verdict: Do it. Buy it. Tips!  Industy point is your greatest weakness early on, try to upgrade its module and carefully watch where you are spending but by late game you are swimming in dough.Merchants sell items.... they also buy. So while you can only save 4 junks to carry to the next floor it might be wish to hold on to them should you find a merchant who can buy it from you.The most badass hero often gets targeted first otherwise the game defaults to first come first serve in regard to the enemy ai so use it to your advantage.Easy is misleading, choose Too Easy First to familiarize yourself with the game.Lastly my name is Chlorique Queas and thank you for reading my review of Dungeons of The Endless.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												Just noticed this on sale and have to say it is most definitely worth the price!!!  I'm a big fan of games that rely more on original content than super beefy graphics, and game like this are exactly why.It's a totally new twist on the tower defense genera.  It's addicting and challenging and the artwork gives the game an atmosphere that honestly hits the spot for me.  You have a variety of characters to choose from to start, as well as encountering and unlocking new ones along the way.  Each has bit of a back story.  Nothing over-thought, but each entertaining in themselves.  There is even a bit of a back story that unfolds between certain characters when you play them together.  You have three seprate types of resources to collect.  You do this by building modules which produce these resources evey time you open a new door in the dungeon.  These module, like the others, can be upgraded along the way.  Food is used to heal and upgrade your characters.  Science is used to unlock and upgrade new modules to build.   And a mechanical resources is used to build new modules.  It's definitely worth your resources to invest in modules that produce mechenical resources to begin with.  Modules are build on nodes, each room having a differnt number of nodes, some having none.  In order for the nodes or modules build on nodes to function the room must be powered.  Rooms are powered by ""dust"" which is a resource you collect by exploring new rooms that can also be lost if the enemies reach your crystal and damage it.  Use the nodes to build modules of various types that defend agains enemies that have a chance of spawning in unpowered rooms each time you open a new door.  This makes it important to strategize the order in which you open doors and to distribute the power to each room in a way that hopefully gives you some degree of control over which direction the enemies will attack from.  Your heros also attack enemies authomatically.  You can control them as far as telling them which room to be in, as well as equiping them with special items, clothing/armor, and weapons.  In some cases they can gain the ability to repair modules or be assigned to increase the productivity of resource producing modules after staying in a room for more than one (door opening) turn.  Protect your crystal, and your characters, build modules to defend against monsters and produce resources,  and find the exit elevator for each floor.  Once you find the elevator and open the remaining doors on the floor to collect as many resources as possible, choose one of your characters to carry the crystal to the elevator and have them, the crystal, and all of your charactrers in the elevator room to click the escape button and move to the next floor.  Steam says I've only spent just over 19 hours playing this game, but I'm certain I've played it much more.  For some reason it doesn't seem to always record my hours when I'm in offline mode.  In any case, should you decide to pick it up, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  There's tons more to unlock that I haven't gotten anywhere close to accomplishing yet, which means it's a game I will likely be coming back to off and on for years to come. "

												Decisions, decisions. Every one of which could put you in a slightly better position, dramatically worse position, or end your game completely.DotE is a very unique experience that combines RPG-roguelike, tower defense, and resource management elementals into a single game - and somehow it manages to do so quite well. Every turn you have to weigh your options: Should you spend food to level up a team member? Should you hold on to it in case you need it for healing? Should you spend precious materials on defenses before you open the next door? Should you even open the next door at all? Maybe it's better to head for exit while things are relatively safe.. Research new defenses?.. Research better resource production? Maybe you should just hold on to those research points in case you happen to run across a merchant who uses them as currency.. Maybe you should head north.. maybe east.. Maybe you should cut the power to one room and risk monsters spawning there next turn in order to power another room and make that section safer.This game is a constant struggle with choices.. and more often than not you don't know in advance which is the better option in the remote or even immediate future. But you'll have fun learning as you go and slowly ascending further and further up the levels with each game (Except for the ones where things just go horrible wrong - Which will probably be most of them)			"

												Very solid Towerdefense/Dungeon Crawler hybrid. Players pick between a roster of characters that they may expand upon while exploring the dungeon floors, and try to delve to the final thirteenth floor (in all scenarios but special start condition). Sessions tend to be very long; unless you get extremely lucky while attempting to rush.  Online sessions have saves incase you want to break it off and continue at a later time due to these long sessions, worth a pickup while on sale, as well as the Rescue Team DLC to add some new characters with some nice unique skills.

												Dungeon of the Endless is a treasure of a game. It's slow and methodical, and yet I always get tense as I go further in and try to escape the depths of the dungeon! There's so much customization in the game, you can build however you want to build and play however you want to play. It's a seamless blend of turn-based strategy, roguelike and tower defense and I haven't found anything quite like it since. It's so engrossing that you forget you have other obligations sometimes! Thus, for the Steam Awards 2016, I nominate this game for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" award!			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon of The Endless is overall a great game for being in such an early state.  With just 7 of the 30 characters and only 3 levels of madness to play through so far in it's Alpha State, it is truly a fun take on a Rogue-Like Dungeon-Defense game! I am already greatly anticipating the next update of content to gingerly explore door by deadly door! AMPLITUDE Studies keeps producing spectacular and unique games that have lots of heart and replayability.			"

												Now that I have beat 2 pods and played 20 hours, I feel that I am experienced enough to write a review on this little gem. Does this game give a tutorial? Yes... but it is very minimalistic. Even the tutorial says that you will learn the rest by simply dieing repeatedly, and learning from your mistakes and/or experiences! If you are easily frustrated or want something casual I would maybe stear cleer of this one.  It's not a game that you need to set aside a couple hours at a time to play. You can save whenever you want, and once you get the hang of it it's not all that ""hardcore"". Once you learn your basic skills and get some confidence be carefull it is very easy to become over confident and this will lead to a quick and painful death! Dungeon of the Endless is not impossible or insanely hard however it is very punishing. By punishing I mean that even a little mistake will cost you a hero or two, or some serious dust! So place your turrets carefully, guide your heroes, tread lightly, and escape that pod!			"

												I refunded this game not long after getting it. No, not because it's a bad game, it has an awesome concept don't get me wrong. I refunded it because it was not my type of game.For someone like me used to instant rewards, this game just wasn't my style (irony is I love pixel art styles)As much as I like strategy, I have little to no patience. The game is also pretty difficult, so combine the patience it takes to get from ""here to there"" then maybe failing and having to do it all over... Ugh. So as much as I would like to say I don't recommend this game, that's my personal opinion, and I can't give a bad review for a game that's good. So I recommend this to people who actually pay attention to what they're buying (Look at the genres). This is a hardcore, patience-requiring tower defense game. If I wasn't corrupted by FPS games, I might've really enjoyed this game.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a complex and unique tower defense roguelike. It's an addictive mix of resource management, risk taking, and hectic realtime repositioning when things go wrong. It's also a complex and challenging game, even on the easiest difficulty setting.The good:- Strategy matters a lot- Challenging, even on easiest setting- The Endless universe shared with other Amplitude games is coolThe bad:- Floor generation is too random, especially in the later levels. A good roguelike should punish the player for their mistakes, not for bad luck with level generation- It does get repetitive fairly quickly, even with a big roster of heroes			"

												I got this game because it looked like it would provide me with a lot of fun for while I'm relaxing and away from work. Well, it did...except the more playthroughs I completed the more stressed out I got. Let me explain: The game is a rogue-like/tower defense mix that provides glorious, wonderful, random fun and it slowly gets harder and harder in a good way as you make ur way through the 12 levels of the dungeon to escape and win. The thing is, when you get to the last few levels, the fun starts slowing down and it slowly starts to feel like ur working again. The diffuculty is ramped up so much, even on very easy and I feel like I have to follow a guide on specific tactics in order to beat the last few levels and there isn't much room for choosing from the huge variety of options the game provides you. In my first few playthroughs I had so much fun...trying out different things, discovering different things, and did stupid stuff just because it was fun. In my later playthroughs, it was just stressful money saving, building, and preparing for those last few levels because the resources you save earlier on can the experience you earn will carry on with you to the later levels, and you will need every bit of resource or experience you can squeeze out from the earlier levels because it gets really really hard. I found that after awhile, I couldn't even enjoy the earlier easy levels anymore after having the knowledge of what's to come. This is a problem for me because this happens even if I choose the very easy difficulty. This wouldn't be a problem if they saved the stressful end-game for the harder difficulty levels and let me have my random mindless fun on very easy. If I wanted to have stressed out, intense, sophisticated planning, sitting on edge of my seat every time I started the waves, I would have picked very hard difficulty.I love the art and the game mechanics and the randomness to death but I can't recommend this game anymore because I feel like a game like this should just provide non-stop fun. That's just my humble opinion and some people may actually want to get this game for the challenge it provides. I've seen the insane amount of changes this game has gone through and the devs have my respect for their willingness to adapt. In short, I'm too worried about saving up for the last few levels to actually enjoy this otherwise glorious game.			"

												Every now and again a little bit of magic happens. This game is one of those little bits of magic.In a nutshell Dungeon of the Endless is a hybrid realtime/turn-based, procedural, squad survival strategy game, with RPG elements, resource management, research, building, maintenance, permadeath, humour, and a large roster of unlockable characters to play with. Quite a bit in that nutshell right?Generally when game designers try to create hybrids it all goes horribly wrong and you end up with something that's mediocre at best. That is not the case with Dungeon of the Endless. After 20 hours of trying to rise above the deceptively simple challenge of fighting my way to the surface through 13 floors I have come to the conclusion that this game is flawless. I cannot fault it. Everything just works and feels right. It is simply a gem of game design.Five stars from me. "

												Simply put, it's a rogue-like squad-based strategy game, but it is much more than that. This amazing indie game features elements of tower defense, RPG, 4X Strategy, dungeon crawling, and brings it all together in a unique experience.It is similar to FTL in that it is addicting and you can replay the game multiple times with drastically different experiences (different team heroes, sometimes you find the exit right away, others you comb through the entire dungeon), and you progress by unlocking new (characters and) ships, which unlock new modes.The normal difficulty is actually quite hard already, and if you unlock the Sanitary ship it is the real Hard Mode (which is basically impossible for new players lol). Try your hand at it. You will be pleasantly surprised :-)EDIT: I would not buy this for the co-op multiplayer mode, unless you have friends to play with. Public matches are filled with leavers, and since the game lasts 3-5 hrs to complete, its not reasonable for 4 strangers to stay that long for 1 run.			"

												Seen a video of this game posted by Quill18, finally a company capturing the incredible visual astetics old games once had, and the gameplay seemed enjoyable as well, I was sold.Game has just enough strategy to have a nice learning curve, i enjoy it a great deal and think it would be one of my go to games when i want to burn a few hours on a run for practice. It requires some understanding of basic ""economy"" principals learned from game like starcraft, in addition to that you are required to make some resonably logical albit a little casual decisions, if you apply all that you are set to win very easy(the lower of two difficulties, other one being ""easy"").

												DotE is a hardcore roguelike where you have to gradually explore a large ship crashed in space. You unveil rooms one by one whilst levelling a large variety of characters. You start with two and can have a maximum of four all of which will have different upgradeable skills, uses, and equipment. It soon becomes apparent that this is more of a tower defence game than anything else and one which takes a fair bit of getting used to. I didn't like it very much at the start but if you can push through the obligatory constant deaths of a tough roguelike then you will unearth a decent tactical game with a large ammount of replay value. Not being a huge fan of roguelikes myself I was surprised to find myself both engrossed with, and mildly addicted to, it. It is very reasonably priced despite often being offered in bundles, as is its DLC, making it excellent value for those who persevere with it.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a game of resource management, calculated risks, and careful positioning... as well as frantic re-positioning when the monsters inevitably overrun your defences. Each door you open grants resources that can be used immediately or stockpiled for later floors, but every room you reveal and can't afford to power becomes a spawn point for monsters. Before long you've created a sprawling maze of dark and dangerous corridors, and you're desperate to find the exit. Finally, after one too many close calls, you'll stumble across the elevator to the next floor. And you'll think, ""maybe I should open just more door...""			"

Unique mix! - 7/10Introduction:'Dungeon of the Endles' is really something special and it's hard to describe, what it really is. Throw the following genres: tower defense, strategy, RPG, economy management, dungeon crawler and a tiny breeze of gambling into a mixer and have a delicious juice. I'm not sure how to describe the result, so just let us stick to the name 'Dungeon of the Endless.' The game acts in the 'Endless Universe' like 'Endless Space' and 'Endless Legend'. Unlike the other 2 games is 'Dungeon of the Endless'no 4X game, but if you have already played an Endless title, then you will notice, that the game shares the same background story (most notably races) and the typical ressources like Dust, Food, Industry and Science, which is pretty great. The Endless universe is awesome and it's really adorable to see, how AMPLITUDE Studios is handling it and how different AND successful games of the same universe can be.Before you can start your journey you have to choose a capsule and your starting hero(es). Why a capsule? Because your spaceship will blow up and you're forced to make an emergency landing (story at store page)! There are several unlockable capsules to choose from and each provides a different challenge. Your objective is to defend your energy crystal, to find an exit in form of an elevator and to finally carry your crystal to the exit (which will summon endless hordes of monsters), stage after stage (most capsules have 12 random generated stages) until you have reached the surface...alive. You don't navigate your characters directly, instead you can send them from room to room and they automatically engage in combat, once they've reached the target area. Skills, levelups, healing, research, building and vendor actions are completely under your control. To find the exit you'll have to open A LOT of doors. One newly opened door = one turn. You will gain ressources (Industry - needed for modules, Science - needed for research, Food - needed for healing + lvlup, Dust - needed to light up dark rooms) according to your production rate. You never know, what's hiding behind a closed door. It can be a group of monsters, recruitable people, monsters, a vendor, monsters, resources, monsters, research stations, monsters, the exit or nothing. More monsters can only spawn in dark rooms after every turn. They don't have to, but they can. You can switch the light on for 10 dust per room, but you're only able to light up a room, which is next to an already powered room and the power supply always has to be connected all the way to your crystal. Usually you're not able to light up the whole stage and this is the point, where the real fun begins. You have to spread your power and make decisions, where and how you want to put up your defenses and how to move on with your exploration. There are very different types of enemies. Some will hunt your people, others are magically attracted by your crystal, some prefer to simply destroy all your modules and others...oh god how I hate them...want to open even more doors, which can lead to a total apocalypse. Luckily you can research and upgrade loads of different modules to increase your production and defense, but usually you will have a hard time, which will force you to grind and open more doors. It will become an addiction, even if you don't really need more at the moment, but more is always better, right? Right. And then the moment will come: stage 10, 11 or 12, everything is fine, just one more door and boooom, hell on Auriga, 2 hours wasted, AGAIN. So keep in mind: one single door can lead to a massive escalation. Don't become to greedy, especially if you've already found the exit! Pro:unique and interesting game conceptlovely artstyle and animationsunique and very different charactersfunny elevator conversationsrandom generated levelsdifferent capsules provide interesting different challengeshigh replayabilityit shares the same fictional universe, ergo references, and resources like it's the case in Endless Space and Endless Legendloads of different modular unitsit makes fun with friendsaddictiveContra:it could need a higher number of different itemsitems like armor or weapons don't change the visual lookmore possible conversations would be niceonly 2 difficulties and even the easiest one can become very in brutal in the last stages oftenmultiplayer has still some connection problems -> Devs are working on itno save function and midgame join option in multiplayer (your game is doomed, if one of your friends disconnects or you have to go) -> Devs are working on itConclusion:The game has triggered a door addiction for me. I could wander all day long through my home and open doors, close them and open them again...so satisfying, aw yeah. On a more serious note: the game is pretty great, addicting and the blend of different game genres works surprisingly well, which turns the game into something purely unique. My experience in single- and multiplayer was very good. However, the multiplayer has still some flaws like connection problems and no save/load function, which can ruin the fun sometimes, but the devs are aware of it and are working on it. If you're merely looking for a great multiplayer experience, then you should definitely wait for the update and keep your money in your pocket, BUT don't forget about this gem of game. If you prefer to play alone or don't have any friends (please insert 'forever alone meme'), then I can really recommend it to you. There are some things, which could be improved in my opinion and along with the multiplayer flaws I have to give 'Dungeon of the Endless' a 7/10 for now. The game deserves a 8/10, once the multiplayer is really finished. It's still a great game!7/10 ...just one more door----------------------~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion? Feel free to make a comment. "

												Great game, with some glitches.. However the game is sooo good that you dont really give a ♥♥♥♥ about them. No joke. Thats how good it is.. Seriously though i really hope the developers polish this game up and fix alot of the issues with multiplayer. Having no save function in multiplayer means having to commit to atleast 3-6+ hours. Which isnt ideal... another huge problem is no reconnectability.. soo if you DC, it's curtains to you and your 3-6+ hours of time spent. There are also a small amount of flat out glitches in the  game.. like somtimes you cant buy or sell from a merchant. Or sometimes your cant equip your items..It just makes things more difficult sometimes.. Its funny though, even though ive been ♥♥♥♥ed over countless times by those glitches, i still play because its just that good. It almost feels like they want it to be, not only hard in game, but also hard IRL.. playing in co-op requires TONS of teamwork, and having no voice chat funtions in-game, no reconnectability and no save makes it feel like they dont want you to play with friends.. Even though this game has its issues i cannot argue with the gameplay. The amount of strategy needed in this game is absurd.. The kinds of ideas and decisions you need to come up with to make it out of your first shuttle is rediculous. Its not just hard because all the mobs are diverse and all priotize their attack on different things.. its not just hard because it requires you to spend resources efficently.. its hard because it forces you to think and prepare for any little thing that might happen.. Its like having a knife fight with RNGesus. The graphics are classic 32bit style, extremely well done.. the lighting is amazing and the effects are extremely pleasing to the eye.The soundtrack is amazing.. it gives you chills while youre playing especially in the most tense moments. This game is a master piece and deserves to be in everyones library. 10/10 = Single Player8/10 = Multiplayer (FIX YOUR BEAUTIFUL GAME... PLEASE)			"

								This is an amazing game, one that makes me come back again and again, to rage at how stupid I am and the decisions I make that lead to grave consequences. If you like rogue-likes, with plenty of personality and constant fear of danger no matter how far you are the game, then buy this. You will not regret it.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a terrific blend of RPG, RTS, TBS and Tower Defense elements that forces you to evolve not just your gameplay strategy, but your thinking paradigm as you advance. It also carries the inevitable 'pondering a potentially deadly situation' and 'permadeath punch' of a true roguelike.The core mechanic is exploring a dungeon level to find a rare resource 'dust' in order to power rooms to carry your crystal from a central location to the 'exit'. Dust is always in short supply, and so you will find yourself forced to leave rooms unpowered. Unpowered rooms allow a variety of incresingly powerful monsters to spawn, who will attack towards your crystal.You can use module slots located in each of the rooms to power either major modules (which give a resource boost); minor modules (which assist your chracters) or turrets, which defend the rooms. Balancing these out will be key to  a successful run. After you're done placement, you choose which door/room to open next, and a wave of monsters spawns from the unpowered rooms. If you survive, you major modules produce resources, allowing you to build more... and you either open another room, or make a break for the exit with the crystal. Deciding when to quit the floor becomes a critical strategic decision with a well-balanced double-edged risk vs. reward mechanic: milk a floor for all the resources it's worth and risk being overrun enitrely, or cut loose and make a panicked run for the exit?The characters trying to escape are varied and range across a variety of skills and playtypes, and finding a combination that plays to your micromanagement style (or lack thereof) is one of the game's brilliant design features. Especially when a key character dies and you're forced to substitute them with someone you're not as comfortable with/have to learn, or make do without.A lot of love has gone into the level and character design, and the pixel art is terrific. Sadly, the music from the launch trailer vastly outstrips anything in the game itself (and is also not on the soundtrack, for some unfathomable reason).This is a great game to experience core elements of different genres at the same time, without getting bogged down in the trappings of each (it allows the player a great deal of freedom in how to approach the game, at least initially). Highly recommended, but also fair warning: this will not be an 'easy' win for the casual or AAA gamer--mistakes come swiftly and are fatal.btw: The music from the 'Rogue Life' trailer for the game is the track 'On and On' by Tom Hillock. You can buy the album off Bandcamp. You're welcome :)			"

												While a degree of luck will lead you to a quick success, a certain amount of strategy and planning of resources will be necessary for the long haul. Dungeon of the Endless is addictive in its simple concept, but also has many layers underneath its core design as a rogue-like tower defense game.For 13 dollars and with the newly released online multiplayer, it promises its worth and delivers.

												An rougelike addition to the expanding universe of the Endless, Dungeon of the Endless is an interesting hybrid of traditional rougelikes and a tower defense game.

												This game is a good example of hoe early access games should do things. I have bought several early access games and when they ""realeased"" they were still missing large amounts of promised content and while they tend to have most of the bugs fixed they are still in large underwhelming in the new content deparment.  Dungeon of the Endless tho is realeasing and it feels complete and is defently a game that I feel Great about supporting. The sound design is awesome and I love how unless you have an overarcing stragety with your resources your going to fail while at the same time you have to wing a bunch of descions on the fly. If any part of the trailier makes you in any way interested in this game, You shold buy it now. Dungeon of the Endless is a well polished product that will appeal to many diffrent types of people.

												After having played this game for over 500 hrs, I have to conclude that this is a bad game.===Edit for the comments section:I spent a lot of time on the game, but that doesn't make it good.  It means that there was a lot of content.  Walking simulators can have a lot of content, Fallout 4 had enough content to fill several hundreds of hours but it doesn't mean it was a good game.What I believe makes a good game is challenge, with which Dungeon of the Endless does not give.  It attempted challenge, and did well, but a game can only be a challenge if it is not impossible.  With which Amplitude Studios hasn't addressed some edge cases that make the game so.I played the game thoroughly for the 90% case of winnable scenarios, the idea is good, the execution is just something I can't condone.  Please understand.If the game is only 90% winnable, it's a slot machine.  Not a game.And just as we can waste many hours on television or a slot machine, or reading clickbait articles.  The amount of time we spend doesn't make it a game.===A lot of Love went into this game, and I did like it, however it has a few glaring flaws that have not been resolved and I don't see them being resolved in the future.Amplitude Studios shares it's notoriously buggy programming, with simple issues like forgetting that an array starts with 0, causing very reproducible bugs.  Perhaps it's because they're spread so thin among several clever but poorly implemented games.Bugs aside, the problems are rooted in gameplay ..  But first, what the game does well.===Also, like Amplitude Studios, Dungeon of the Endless mashes up several genres together and does it miraculously.  If it's one thing I would like to credit them for, is that they aren't afraid to innovate and then put it into game form.  This studio is what the indie scene is all about.  Bringing truly new ideas into existence.+ The Cast, all the Prisoners, Guards, and Natives are beautifully illustrated and designed.  Animations are so immersive and dear to me, and the back stories are interesting and tease of story.+ Good meta gaming for deciding on doors together.  The game is a board game sometimes, sometimes it's a timed board game, sometimes it's a moba / tower defense.+ Great unique ideas.  Leveling up is based on Food, not how many mobs you kill.  Science is used to Research or to replenish your character's skills.+ A lot of random conditions make for stressful challenges, all of which can be arguably survived, some of which you can win.  Stress is good, it means you're being pushed to a limit+ Monsters are very varied and each have unique abilities.  None of the mobs are simple variations of HP and attack.  They all behave and target different things.===- However, where it suffers truly is in gameplay.  Like Dungeon of the Endless, the game is rather flow-chart-esque.  Random Scenarios don't really ask for varied solutions.  It's like being faced with an Apple and an Orange, but they both do the same thing. What's the point ?- There is no targeting mobs ..  At first this disappointed me.  Then I recognized it as part of the game.  Something that felt unique and perhaps confused for innovation.  After beating the game several times, and trying out several things I realize it as a glaring flaw.Imagine so, you have a character with a gun.  Yes ?  Guns are good at shooting things at a range, which it does.  However, your character is dead set on shooting ( at a range of course ) a mob he's predisposed to target all the way in the back.  So he runs into crowds of melee monsters just to get in range of shooting a mob that poses no threat.Effectively making ranged combat useless.Or perhaps, you've got a Dozer + Hurnas combination ( A testament to the game, I've memorized all the monster names and abilities )  The hurnas do a lot of damage to heroes, and the dozer attacks major modules ..But if you've got heroes in the game, they won't kill the Hurnas while it's killing them ..  The heroes will tap away at the Dozer which has more HP while they get killed by Hurnas.  That may be part of the game design ..  But it's awfully unimmersive.It's just bad game design, plain and simple.A possible solution would be to toggle the types of tactics characters use, it doesn't have to be true RTS, just choose things like ..  "" Target Anti Module Mobs "" vs "" Target Anti Hero Mobs "" and etc.  Maybe even make a little game of it ..- There are monsters that render your heroes entirely useless.  Which seems neat, and would seem to be asking the player to be challenged by having to build towers.  But there are also monsters that render your towers useless too ..And here is how this design flaw got past QA ..You see, in the game, there are random items that allow you to circumvent this issue.  Like an item that allows you to be cloaked from monsters so that you don't get targeted, so you can take out the monsters that render your towers useless ..The problem is ..  This item is completely random ( which is an example of a poor use of RNG ).  Effectively, you CAN be placed in unwinnable scenarios.  This is a big Rogue-like no-no.It's easily confused for "" difficulty "", but there's no challenge in it.  Because there's no win scenario.  You essentially get to choose whether your heroes die valiantly or your crystal gets destroyed.This issue would also be arguably circumvented if you could pick up your crystal and go but ..  You can't pick it up until you've found the exit.  So there are situations where you simply can't win.- I have played with all the characters in and out ..  There is no balance scheme whatsoever.  All of them basically fit into four categories : Nuke, Run, Operator, Combat.  Some characters can fulfill three of these roles at the same time ..  Some characters literally do none of these well.

												Masterpiece.Very few games blend genres like this, and actually pull it off in a way that's enjoyable.Though I do only recommend this if you're open minded about games. It's not going to satisfy any particular itch--you play Dungeon of the Endless if you want to see just how creative indie dev's can be. The answer is really damn creative. Thank God we have Amplitude; what did the human race do to deserve them?P.S.

												Awesome game. Very challenging, totally unique and fresh. Here's some tips. Learn how the game works. There is a ton to take in, but the game is so addicting it only takes one session to learn all the hidden rules. Think 32 bit arcade Dark Souls Co-op.A tip on movement. If you need to gain some distance from an enemy to fire ranged shots. Click to a different room, (away from mobs) than reclick the room that you and the mobs are in and you'll turn back around and start firing.Criticism: Game is likely at it's funnest when playing with competent friends. However, there are a few functionalities that put a direct negativity to multiplayer.1: Not being able to save the game while in multiplayer is dissapointing. I agree it shouldn't be so simple as ""oh lets save a 3 player progressed game and I'll just finish it later by myself."" But we were at it for 3 hours and only got to the 7th level of the 12 levels on the first dungeon. Now the idea is kind of cool to do it all in one sitting, which if you can do, that'd probably be best. But some gamers are workers too, and might not be able to commit 6 hours for on session game. What I'd like to see is a ""group save"" function, where the save file is only accessible if all involved players are present.2: Keeping criticism 1 in mind with how long the session can last and how you can't save, you also can't re-join any game you somehow DC from. 3 and half hours of progress then ""poof."" Gone. You lost the hero you almost earned, and your mates will have to try and carry on without you. This happened to me and it was extremely dissapointing (because this game is extremely good.) After surviving hordes and hordes of some of the most difficult mobs, no one wants to die indefinitely to server problems.3: It's far easier to earn new heroes playing solo, since in a party of 3, there can be only one more hero added to the party and can only be controlled by a single player and only that single player will earn  that hero. Which from a different perspective may seem like ""only the ones who earn the hero get the hero"" but to me it's just a reason to not play multiplayer, which this game shouldn't be doing. In summary, embrace the multiplayer. Make it a bit friendlier. Other than that, awesome game. 4/5 stars.One more thing. The 32 bit art in this game is gorgeous.			"

												Strongly recommended!TL;DR: Get this game. Very few weakpoints listed in the pro/con section. I made a video featuring a last man standing amateur tournament with 18 out of 20 playable characters, added to this review.Dungeon of the Endless does a lot of things right, taking the positive aspects of various genres andsurprisingly manages to mash them together without creating a big pile of crap. Not only is it fun to play, easy to pick up and hard to master, it also offers a great deal of replayabilityand nice community.PRO/CONI won't go with a full pro/con list here, let's focus on the very few cons.-- A few (currently 2 out of 20) playable characters need to be purchased separately and cost way more than what would be reasonable. Josh N'tello is included in the Dungeon of the Endless Chrystal Editionand Kreyang in the Endless Legend Founder Pack, an addon for a different game of Amplitude Studios.It has been stated on the forums that the Kreyang-situation will be adressed at some point in the future.-- Some footage from the trailers isn't actually included in the game or simply outdated, like the overworld view with the Necrophage Nibblers, or Max opening a door that takes a lot longer to open in the actual game.-- While the game features coop-mode, at this point in time it lacks a savefunction (will be added) and also offers a different and in my opinion not as enjoyable experience because of the missing pause-feature, which is an essential part of the singleplayer mode as you can issue orders while pausing.-- The secret hero of the game is rather a gimmick and in my opinion way too weak in comparison to the other heroes. -- often slowpaced, heavy focus on strategy and ressource management, also permadeath. Stuff like that isn't for everybody.That being said I thoroughly enjoy the game and can easily recommend it. Not sure about the chrystal edition because of the unreasonably high price, but that's something everybody should decide on their own, I got it anyway.I also created a video featuring a fully edited last man standing amateur tournament of almost all playable characters, where I not only shoutcast but at the same time explain the basics of the game in more detail.

												A cross between unique style defence game that requires strategy and some nice little RPG elements. It can start to feel seem slightly repetitive but changing over characters or researching new tech all of a sudden changes your play style sometimes you also may not have a choice if one of your characters dies via perma-death.The rogue-like randomness is not as big as in other games but still noticeable. Nice music and interesting character backgrounds and dialogue. Worth a try for those who are into tower defence or rogue style dungeon crawling with a sci-fi feel, but be warned it’s unique in its own right and may not appeal if you’re heavily into your tower defence or RPG and it doesn’t do either extensively or in detail, saying that it’s a thumbs up from me!

												Awesome roguelike!  Heavily FTL inspired, but with roguelike dungeon exploration, squad combat, tower defense mechanics, 4x resource management, permadeath, and mad horde survival when escorting your crystal to each floor's elevator.  This is a pretty wild mashup of genres!  Everything feels just right.  No gimmicky mechanics, no useless fluff.  Ship and character options look to offer a ton of replay value.  Graphics and music are beautiful.  In a sea of bland forgettable roguelikes, this is everything I've been looking for in the genre.  If you are a fan of FTL, or roguelikes in general, don't overlook this gem!PS. If I could find any fault, the tutorial doesn't explain all of the mechanics.  Only takes a few minutes to learn though.  Do yourself a favour and watch a quick video tutorial on youtube.  You'll find more enjoyment if you know the reasons for your frequent death ;)			"

												I'll admit, I was skeptical about this game at first because of the ""tower defence"" in the description, even with the beautiful pixel graphics. After playing it for several hours, I can say that skepticism wasn't warranted. It may have some aspects of those types of games, but don't udnerestimate it.With quite an extensive amount of content (unlockables) and replayability (procedural generation) I can see myself sticking with this game for quite a while. One major gripe, though, is the inability to save in multiplayer; when playing with other people you're in it for the long run.Just a warning, even on Very Easy, it's tough and unforgiving. It's a game of planning, strategy, and reflex. Good luck.			"

Early Access Review
								I was a little hesitant to buy this game at first, it seemed a little ambitious, but then I played it, and Holly crap is this thing good!Dungeon of the Endless is phenomenal. With its rogue like elements, always keeping the tension flowing. (even during the first floor!) The sections of RPG like stature, and not to mention the brilliant flushed out strategic thought, is compelling. You will die A LOT! But, surprisingly, you don't get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. Everytime you start a new floor (level) it's competely different. So each time you die, and restart, it's like you're playing a new game.Very few games are quite this flabbergasting. Dungeon of the Endless is a must-buy, and if you like RPG's, Strategy, Tower Defense, you name it, this game has you covered.			"

												Another great game from Amplitude.  The lore ties into their other 2 games (Endless Legend, Endless Space), and there is a feeling of awe as you discover bits of the lore.This game is basically a 4x-towerdefense-roguelikelike. The resource management has a lot of similarities to a 4x game and you sure have to explore/expand/exterminate and to some degree exploit. To really optimize your play, you have to consider some TD elements: wave management and turret choice (and Hero location) is very important, but the feel of the game is very roguelike. Failed runs feel like roguelike failed runs. Sometimes the RNG is against you but you always think you could have found some way out.			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, best money you will spend on a game. 10/10 replay value, 10/10 satisfaction after winning.Dungeon of the Endless has not only great 32bit art but also amazing sounds and gameplay in general. This game has everyting a gamer would love, little bit of rpg, big chunk of tower defense, and big scoop of strategizing. There are just so many things you have to keep in mind, so many trials and erros, and the fact that it's all randomized each time you play is just pure genius. Yes, indeed you also need some luck due to the fact that it's randomized, but that's what makes this game THE game. Even though it's so frustrating at times it just makes it that much more satisfying to finally beat it, it is so challenging that you don't want to try the ""too easy"" option, it brings out the inner gamer competitiveness in you (seriously don't puss out and do ""too easy""). At first you may go ""WTF this ain't no RPG man you cant even control the damn heroes the way you want!"", but as you play the game you will realize how ♥♥♥♥ing wrong you were.This game IS RPG, maybe not the RPG you are normally used to, which is what makes this game so unique! Just that hint of RPG, the roles of heroes that you need in a group, the dream team, it just makes my inner nerd so HARD.You seriously have to put your soul in this game, you have to figure out every little details to fully enjoy it. It is so simple that it's complicated, this game will test your limits and to break those limits you will have to use everything you learn and know about the game to beat it every.single.time.In all, to me the best part of the game honestly was the ending scene, it has no fancy cinematic or anything at all, just one mother♥♥♥♥ing epic cutscene, it makes everyting just so worthwhile, too epic, so majestic. It just makes you want to beat it again with different heroes. DO NOT get this game if you are impatient or if you do not have good game senses, I guarantee that you will probably stop playing after couple hours. It is a VERY hard game so I recommend you play with at least 1 or 2 really good friends that you can communicate with at all times, or else you are going to have a bad time. COMMUNICATION IS KEY (you can trade all resources with other players at any time, don't hoard resources if you don't need them, ask for resources!)-You can trade resources by clicking your resources at top left of the screen-        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SOME TIPS: Leaving a hero in a unpowered room makes it so that it's ""slightly lit"", which makes it so that mobs don't spawn from that room. THIS IS KEY TO WINNING, so make sure to place them strategically after each waves and such before opening any more doors. Never get the same module updates as other players, pick a role and stick with it, DO NOT get greddy. It is also important that you play this game like any other RPGs, pick a tank, dps, support. I recommend having 1 range dps, 1 tanker, 1 runner (fastest movement speed for crystal run at the end of floor), and a operator with high wits for that extra resource boost when operating major modules.I also recommend getting Tear Gas and Smoking Gun for offense because with those 2 combos you will melt the ♥♥♥♥ out of mobs with ease. (Tear Gas is ♥♥♥♥ing dope, that defense reduce so sexy as hell)Every other minor modules are not really necessary to beat the game, other than Autodoc Shards for heals really late game. What I did was have a room full of Autodoc Shards as a back up ""healing room"" for emergencies or for fighting bosses that appears late games.Prisoner Prods are also good for cheap defense for early games and such, upgrade them ASAP for easy wins early floors.Although not necessary to win the game it will be a lifesaver to have the Emergency Generator major module for late games when dusts are rare as ♥♥♥♥.         ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are still some annoying glitches such as not being able to buy or sell ♥♥♥♥ to the merchant, which can be a HUGE pain in the ♥♥♥ esp late game, but bear with it and just play the game through. This however is easily fixable during a solo play by saving and quitting then just continuing the game again (for some reason this fixes everyting, yay :D). Still a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ since you obviously can not do this during a multiplayer game.With this in mind you will have the best chance to beat the game, it will still take incredible amount of replays to get it just right, so be patient and hope for the best.BUT SERIOUSLY BUY THE GAME AND PLAY IT, ENJOY!P.S. no you can not trade items with other players sooo don't be hogging all the chest you come by.

												This game is far FAR more entertaining that it seems. It's a rougelike, dungeoncrawling, tower defense, all in one. You select you party of up to 4 characters, level them up, build modules, explore floors of this dungeon and try to find the exit and keep rooms powered while still protecting your Generator (crystal) from monsters that spawn in unpowered rooms. Every time you open a new door, theres a high chance for a new wave to appear. This game was well worth the $15 dollars, and the $7 extra I'll use to upgrade to the Founder pack.			"

												I love strategy games, my friend likes rpg leveling and equipment, another likes resource management, and one more likes tower defense.  This game combines these elements in such a great way that it doesn't take away from any genre it is pulling from, but it enhances all of them.  I love the gameplay, and on solo mode you can challenge yourself, unlock characters, and try new strategies.  But the most fun I have with this game is playing with my friends, everyone can chose a unique role on the team or you can all run around in chaos (though you won't get as far).  You get the real time feel of fighting enemies and using abilities, but with a turn based twist that allows you to strategize and collaborate with your teammates between waves.  The rouge like elements are just icing on the cake, allowing for massive replayability and devising many successful and unsuccessful playstyles.  I definitely recommend you give this game a shot, especially if you have a group of friends who are interested in playing as well.  It took me one play and I was hooked.			"

												This game is a rogue-like strategy with multiplayer, it also has a few Tower Defense and RPG-elements which add nicely to the game.*If you dont care about your first run, skip to the pros/cons* So what happens in a nutshell your first time:You dont know WTF is going as you got put into with 2 characters you dont know.You open the first door... ♥♥♥♥ monsters are attacking me/core and how do I light up this room?Apparently resources are used for building, healing and leveling your character. Wait there is more then 1 tab which I can build from?You continue to find more monsters and some loot to equip for your characters and find the exit.You are like: ""How do I continue?"" and after a while you find out that you can pick-up the crystal from the start and go to the exit to the next floor. But as you try to do that and forgot to lit up some rooms with your dust you get swarmed by all monsters that spawn from the ""Exit event"" and die.Pros:- Fun to play after you found out how to play- Strategy elements are really needed to win the game- A run on easy can take up to 3-4 hours. Which you can split up into multiple segments by save and exit.- Multiplayer can cause ultimate chaos for you (and your friends)!- Unlockables, every char you have to survive a few floor with before you unlock them and to unlock each new ship you have to win the game with the last ship you earned or achievements! - Game get regurarly updated with some new content and its bugfixes.Cons:- As of now the multiplayer still has a few bugs if the host or someone who joins times out for a few seconds, which makes the one who joined invisible for the host (however this can lead to some exploits like double loot from a room)- You need to learn how to play the game before you can actually start enjoying it.- If RNG isnt on your side in the later floors you can get f**ked real hard and fast.- Micro-managing can be a pain in the butt.Conclusion:Dungeon of the Endless can be a endless pain if you dont know what you are supposed to do. But as you progress and start to learn more as you go on this game is endlessly fun. Every run is unique due to the random layouts on each floor. You can have a floor with no monsters and then your next floor nothing can be lit up. RNG decides a lot in this game which is a good and a bad thing. If I had to give this game a score it would be around a 8/10			"

												Introduction:DoTE is an interesting take on Tower Defense, coupled with what should be turn-based RPG, Rouge-like squad combat.Initially i was gonna give this one a pass, considering i dislike the turn-based aspect. But here the combat itself is done in real-time, so i thought id give it a go.The only turn-based aspect to this title, is in essence; the opening of doors. Once you open a door, you are commiting your turn. Resources wont generate in real-time, instead they will increase based on each turn (door opened). Though i may have very little experience in the case of turn-based games (never played FTL, for instance), i would say that this game is as close as ill get to enjoying one.Graphics:The pixel art style here is done very well, especially on the characters. The environments are nice too, each varying style of floor have their own theme. Though maybe they are slightly *too* static, in places. Admittedly there are some animated effects that compliment rooms, like blinking rats, candles and toxic/electro-magnetic 'aura's' (which in the case of the last two; play into the game mechanics).Idle and movement character animations were very well-done and add a lot of flavour to the style. I was hoping for more variation in attack animations for each Hero, though. Yet at the same time i will say that they are more than adequate. The UI/menu presentation is of its own style and its non-obtrusive and easy on the eyes. Players are given the option between a large/small UI/HUD based on their own personal preference.Audio:Whoever did the music, has really nailed the atmosphere for this game. Probably one of the best aspects to this game, i think. The sound effects themselves are adequate, nothing bad about them, nor is there anything overly impressive about them either. There is no spoken dialogue, yet there are text based conversations between Heroes.Gameplay:To put it simply; its turn-based tower defense with real-time combat. You move, in real-time, your group of up to 4 Heroes through a procedurally generated dungeon. Enemies/monsters wont have a chance at spawning until you open a door, so its important to plan before opening too many doors. You can place Minor/Major modules (Automated Weapons/Resources) which is where this game gets its Tower Defense tag from. To expand on that, the player is constantly having to choose between risk/reward. For instance; do i save my resources for the next floor? Or do i increase the amount of weaponry (Minor Modules) i have in this current floor, to aid my Heroes? Its quite risky hanging onto your resources and hoping your Heroes will get the job done, on their own. Yet if it pays off, come the next floor (or many after, due to an overabundance of resources), if you manage to succeed. There have been many times where ive lost a Hero or two, because i attempted to hoard my resources. This is by far the most challenging aspect of the game for me. As im constantly trying to ensure i use 'just enough' Minor/Major Modules to keep my neck above the water, so i can bank enough resources for the next floor.The combat itself, which was an important aspect for me buying this game, doesnt give you direct control of your Heroes attacks. Rather you have real-time control of their movements and their attacks are automatic, if in the same room as enemies.A wide variety of strategies can be deployed based on your Hero setup and/or your preferred play-style. This gives the player the sense that he/she can beat this game in a variety of ways. Which is a good thing. For instance, you could level up your Heroes and Tactical HUD Modules to increase their stats and effectiveness in combat. Alternatively you could research Minor Modules which come in the form of base defense weaponry, focus on accumulating more science points and upgrading those weapons further. That wont necessarily increase your Heroes stats in combat, but will increase their chances if they occupy the same room.Both of those strategies will require quite differing tactics in order to succeed. I tend to use the latter and got as far as attempting to hoard enough resources so i could afford the former. That lead to my eventual death on the 11th floor.Narrative:This game definitely has its own edge in humour. Which is mainly played out through small story arcs that happen between certain Heroes if they are grouped together. Some of the dialogue/bio's got a few chuckles out of me alright, especially the midget who is obsessed with his disparity in height, so much so that he has worked his muscles and upper-body strength to the point where he can wield over-sized weaponry. Inbetween levels, in the elevator, he said something to another Hero that made me lose it. Ill omit that considering i believe it belongs in the game, not this review. ;)If certain Heroes are grouped together for enough time (ie. levels/floors), their dialogue will eventually lead to an end in their story which will have either a positive or negative effect on both of them. This gives the narratives a purpose, as in, its not just tacked on. Its complimentary.Overall:A solid offering. I was pleasantly surprised at how much i ended up enjoying this game. Initially i was very aprehensive as i really dont like turn-based games, but i believe that DoTE should appeal to both fans of turn-based games, and those who arent but have an interest in tower defense with squad based combat. Ive clocked like 33 hours so far and i havent beaten the Dungeon yet, so in regards to longevity i do believe this title should fulfill that aspect for most people.Personally i dont really care for rating systems, so i wont attempt to do one here. +Recommended. :P			"

												This is a tricky one to review and I have just started to scratch the surface of it, but here it goes.First of all, the story: you are forced to flee on an escape pod before your starship gets destroyed, and after you crash-land on planet Auriga you find yourself in a depths of a multi-level dungeon, from which you have to escape with the very few resources you have at your disposal and whatever you can find in the ruins, fighting monsters in the process.Don't let yourself be fooled by the pixel-art graphics (which are beautiful if you are into this kind of thing) and think that this is a simple game. It's not easy at all (despite the fact that the initial difficulty levels are labelled easy and too easy) and you are going to die, a lot. The music also has a chiptuny, retro-style which fits well with the graphics assets.The game style is a very nice blend of RPG, tower defense strategy and roguelike games. There is a constant feeling of uncertainty and fear, since stuff happens whenever you open a door: you might find new loot or something/someone else, you might trigger a mighty horde of monsters coming for you, your resource nodes, defences and/or your energy crystal (which, if it breaks, leads you to a game over). Resources are scarce so you will have to think well how to spend them; moreover, the fact that the dungeons are procedurally generated means that such a strategy will have to change whenever you restart the game.During the game you can research for new weapons (both static defenses and items for your heroes) and for new, better resource nodes.To me, it feels like a board game (a feeling that is enhanced even more in multi player) that changes every time you play; the board game closest to Dungeon of the Endless I can think of is Munchkin: whenever you open a door, you don't know what you will get. Riches? Monsters? Even worse? Nobody knows, but -- unlike in Munchkin -- at least your companions won't turn against you. :)If you like roguelike or tactical games with strategic elements and you're a fan of sci-fi settings in general, I highly recommend you Dungeon of the Endless.My vote: 8/10Update 20/12/2014: Upped my vote from 7.5 to 8 as the game is really growing on me. I've died countless times already yet I keep coming back for more.Update 27/12/2014: added a Munchkin reference, for those who know the board game.			"

The items are not quite varied enough...I see the same ones over and over, and despite flavours in quality of the item, the perks are the same and not quite enough of them.  Biggest problem is crashes.  The game crashes regularly for me and wipes my progress.  I've had several games that I felt were winning, but I have yet to reach the end before the game crashes and takes the save progess with it.  So I can't comment on the ending of the game.  I bet it's great, but at the rate of failure I'll never know.  Even with the reliability issue, though, it's a clever game that's a lot of fun in short burts.  Definitely recommend. "

												Game-play is an engaging cross between Role Playing Game (with hero level ups and hero to hero interactions and back story) and Tower Defense. The album element is akin to both ""in game achievement"" and further immersion in the game's universe and back story. Tower defence elements and, in particular, dust/energy management make for significant floor layout strategies. Humour runs rampant through character dialogues and item names and descriptions. Somehow this game manages to blend not taking itself seriously and yet being a serious game to play.One part Original Rogue, one part Deadspace/Doom (re. creature vibes), one part nostalgia (Other endless references, graphics, game style et al.). I have found this to be highly entertaining and it will easily be a ""go back to"" game even when finished/fully unlocked.			"

												A very good surprise ! Based on the trailer, i was expecting a basic roguelike or a ""roguelike-like"" (like FTL or Binding of Isaac). So i was expecting something interesting, but not very original. But it turns out Dungeon of the Endless is a completely unique mix of roguelike, tower defense and ressource management.The game asks you to explore a dungeon with a group of 1 to 4 heroes. But each time you open a new door, it starts a new ""turn"". At the start of each turn, each dark room may spawn monsters. You have to clear all the monsters of that wave to ""end the turn"", and get automatic and full healing of your heroes. When the turn is over, you're free to build more stuff, change the inventory of your heroes, etc. The game is in a suspended test until you feel ready to open a new door.I talked about building stuff, because that's the second part of the game, the tower defense aspect. Your heroes do not have to face enemies all by themselves, you can build offensive and defensive structures, that will hopefully stop the monster waves. You have many available buildings, so figuring out the best way to lighten the load for your heroes is of critical importance.The last part, the resource management, comes from the fact that 3 buildings are here to produce 3 resources. Industry is what you have to pay to build. Science is what you have to pay to research new technologies. Food is what you use to heal and level up your heroes. The last ressources is gained automatically but is in very short supply: Energy is what you use to power a room. A powered room is automatically lit, and therefore can't spawn monsters, but also is required to build structures. A structure doesnt work unless it's in a powered room.So, with a limited amount of resources, and building spaces available, you have to figure out how to maximize the resources you currently need and also prepare for the future, as the latter floors will be deadly. The goal of the game is ""simply"" to reach the exit of each floor, until you get to the last floor and can finally escape the dungeon.As i said, Dungeon of the Endless was a very good surprise, i wasn't expecting that. Once i got the hang of the system, the game became very addictive, it definitely has that ""One more turn"" aspect that all turn-by-turn gamers know well enough. You always want to open one more door, until you notice it's 2 AM and you should have been to bed a long time ago. It's hard to leave the game when your in the middle of a run, and want to know what will happen to your crew. Somehow, i've logged more than 30h in my first week of play, even though it felt like half that, because i was so engaged in the game.Dungeon of the Endless also manage to be fairly accessible. Though it doesn't explain all its mechanisms and you will have to figure some stuff out it offers two difficulty modes ""Too Easy"" and ""Easy"" (yes the developers are cheeky) to cater to different groups of people. Too easy difficulty should please people who aren't too familiar with roguelike mechanisms, or people who just want to enjoy the game without having too much trouble. Easy difficulty is definitely 2 steps above that, and should please people used to roguelikes, or games such as FTL. Moreover the game has good replayability. First you get many different characters, who are all interesting to discover, unlock and play with. Moreover you will be able to unlock new ""Escape pods"", which change the game rules, and therefore the playstyle you will have to use. One pod gives you stronger heroes and weaker buildings, one pod is the opposite, and others pods mix things even more. Some will even up the difficulty quite a bit for those looking for a greater challenge.An interesting twist is you can also play the game online, with others people, which change the rules a bit and will also increase the replayability.To sum it up, Dungeon of the Endless has a pretty artstyle, a unique and interesting gameplay, a very diverse and well made cast of characters, and has good replayability. Definitely a big thumbs up for me !			"

												Rock-solid rogue-like dungeon crawler with tower-defense element!  I think a brief description of the game might be the best way to help you decide if it is for you:In Dungeon of the Endless, your goal is to ultimately lead a band of unique characters out of a dungeon.    To do so, you must open new doors in each floor to find the elevator that takes you to the next level.  As a part of the game mechanic, the opening of each door counts as a turn.  Similar to the beacon jumping in FTL, everything happens within the turn is executed in real-time.  The dungeon is dangerous and unforgiving place!  Research and build towers to help you survive.  Don't let the name fool you!!  The dungeon itself is not endless; it only takes 3-4 hours to finish a successful run.  However, finishing your first successful run can be a different story!!  It took me more than 30 hour to get there, and I wish you better luck :-)			"

												This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing struggle, an endless struggle. But it's a really good game and I like it better than FTL since the game is less relliant on rng and more on 'make the best out of the worst situation'. I say this because this game is backbreaking hard. We play hard games because theres more satisfaction in beating them, easy games are boring. But i've been playing for hours trying to get past the fourth floor and there is only two difficulties 'too easy' and 'easy'. This pretty much translates to 'easy' and 'prepare to die'. Great game once again, it's really cheap on steam now. I heard there isn't much difference between pixel edition and crystal edition so spare yourself the money. 8/10 Great.			"

												I have purchased so many disappointing indies this past year-and-a-half attempting to find a roguelike-strategy-combat-rpg-thingy as compelling as FTL. This is the one I've waited for. Multiplayer could use some tweaks to make it less tedious to manage resources among players, but other than that I wouldn't change anything. Please develop this into a franchise and take my money.

												Dungeon of the Endless is a fantastic game that combines Tower Defense Gameplay with Rogue-like Mechanics. Essentially you start in a single room on each level you begin on. There will be doors which will lead to other rooms - which can contain resource, items, characters, interactable objects, the exit, enemies, or just nothing. Using Dust you power up the room and can use it to create defenses, resource gathering equipment, or strategic gear. Eventually you'll run out of Dust and won't be able to power up rooms - that is when the fun begins since when you open up subsequent doors, unpowered rooms may spawn enemies for you to fight.You play the game with a group of crashed landed prisoners, crew members who manned the ship, or natives from the planet. You can have up to four at once in your group, and they are what open doors, collect items and resources, and kill enemies. You'll need to keep them alive as without any characters left you will lose the game. Permadeath is also a thing - so losing a character is a permanent thing. However with the exception of one game mode, you can pause the game at anytime to plan your moves.There is a heavy emphasis on managing resources - kind of 4X styled. You have Food which you can use to heal or level your characters; Industry which lets you build up your Tower Defense items; Science which lets you research and obtain new tech to build new Tower Defense items; and of course Dust which is ultimately what keeps you alive.You see, Dust is really the nature of the game. If you run out of Dust - which happens when your power source (a Crystal) is attacked, you lose the game. At the same time, Dust is needed to power rooms - but you only have so much of it so you'll have to be strategic in what rooms you power.Your characters that you can have in your party or meet in your game all have their unique traits (and flaws). As you level up your characters they gain powerful abilities and permanent buffs (or sometimes debuffs). It will be key how you manage your characters as some are useful as straight up killers, while others are more supportive, others will be best used as resource gathers, and some are just useful for running around in general.The goal of the game is essential to escape with your crystal to each exit of the level, and proceed to the next level. When you get to the end of the dungeon you escape to win the game. Later levels will feature different and harder enemies then earlier ones - but in some shape or form you can see the same enemies from level 1 to the final level; albeit in elite forms later on, but still the same enemy. Care needs to be given when fighting enemies, as much like your characters they all act differently.I wholly recommend this game, even if you aren't necessarily a fan of Tower Defense or Rogue-like games. Dungeon of the Endless has a little bit of everything in it, making it an extremely unique game among many.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is still in alpha and that needs to be noted when looking at it. the game is fantastic. it is a rogue like game and if you like going down random generated dungeons then this is your game! each play through is diffferent. i never seem to get the same items or blue pronts so each playthrough is completelly different. some games i will rely on towers heavely others more on my heroes, its all luck and adjusting to your situation.be sure to handle your heroes well. light up a room ro two ahead for a Tower Defence style. or build up a heavily fortified room and some tough heroes. recourse management is key. tech or food? which one is more important. use the merchant and not expand? there is a lot of different ways to play and i havent had a repeat at all.    the game has some kinda koocky twist in everything. form the armor, items, and heroes. they are a kinda odd bunch.the game has improved alot from the first couple patches and it keeps getting cooler and cooler. one sucessful playthrough right now you are looking at 2 hours give or take. cool world, simple to play. basic controls, random generated everything. the community is a little small for now, but realy nice and always willing to help or give out pointers. the Devs are awsome and they interact alot on the forums with us. they take input and give alot of updates. there are some minor bugs, but they are hard at work fixing them and are up to day with us. realy awsome community for sure.I recomend this game, it is simple and oen cant get lost in over complexity. there is more features to be added in the future to! how awsome is that!? buy it while it is on sale. the direction this game is going has so much promise.

												     What I love about Amplitude Studios and their 'Endless Universe' is that all thier games (thus far) take place in it. Endless Space takes place among hundreds of star systems, while Endless Legend focuses only on one planet-Auriga, at a specific (and unknown) time in galactic history. Dungeon of the Endless (DotE) connects Endless Space and Endless Legend-Amplitude's other games. It explains how the Vaulters, as well as many other factions, first appeared on Auriga long before the start of Endless Legend.      In any case, gameplay is fun, interesting and addicting. It's a mix of tower defence and turn-based strategy; each door you open begins the start of another 'turn'. As you gather your team of heroes and adventurers, each with their specific traits and uses, you begin to become more and more attatched to them. Additions such as conversations between your chosen characters at the end of each level make it really feel as if members of the group are intracting with one another. GUI is pretty plain and straigntforward. One small quip I had with the game is that your hero party maxes out at 4; I felt like I could've had a lot more fun with 6 or 8 members. Probably just me, anyway. If you're a fan of the Endless universe, this game is pretty much a must-have. If you're not, well, this seems to be a pretty good place to start .This is coming from someone who has has minimal experience with rouge-like style games, and prefers his games to be a bit less pixelated.

Its challenging game with a surprising amount of depth with the resource management but, in the end the random maps keeps you on your toes. There's a lot of  strategy with managing resources, players, science tech, and towers. It's also dungeon crawling at its finest with lots of treasure, exploration, and new characters to find.

												I tried very hard to enjoy thisI bought it because it looked great and I got a FTL-y vibe and was interested in playing a more fleshed out tower defense game. However it has not grown on me after many hours. -there is virtually no reward for defeating monsters, only a small chance to gain 1 dust which is not kept between floors. even the large special enemies in the last floors yield nothing at all. you have to spend science and/or food in combat and you risk damage to your structures/heroes, so combat quickly feels like an undesirable chore and even a risk that discourages exhaustive exploration later on.-my first experience with the character story interactions was that the quick blue girl outright kills my fat rambo tank dude. This crippled my team in combat and the only thing I got from it was like +10% attack and -5% defense on the blue girl. I haven't seen any other interactions that are that bad, but the rewards are always something with almost no impact at all, which brings me to the next problem:-everything is a drop in the bucket. leveling and equipping your team, improving structures and farming resources - all these things progress painfully slowly, the best you can hope for is to very slightly improve your crew on each floor and still break even on resources. only rarely do you get something satisfying like a new weapon or ability from a levelup that affects your game right away. everything else is just about very slowly accumulating tiny bonuses. they do add up eventually, but it takes hours to reach that point. Winning is slow, but losing is slower. when you lose something important like a character or resource structures, the game slows to a crawl. you'll have to spend more resources for cooldowns/heals in combat, you might lose structures, you might lose dust. much like the incremental progression, your defeat in this game will be excruciatingly drawn out - the more ♥♥♥♥ed you are the more ♥♥♥♥ed you get, you will scrape by with 2-3 characters and make it to the elevator but you know exactly that you have no chance to beat the game anymore. Genuine game overs don't happen because you will just throw the game and start over instead of wasting half an hour trying to get as far as possible.-the tower defense aspect is very weak. there's only one turret available at the start, new ones must be researched with resources and cost 200-300% more to construct than the basic one. you will notice that it is not possible to ""funnel"" enemies the way I know I love to do in tower defense. if you get lucky with the layout you might be able to defend several paths to your core, but never all of them - the core itself cannot house any turrets, you would have to build turrets all around it which is just too expensive and not even reliable as they are quite weak and fragile when unattended (anything you build can be destroyed by enemies). overall turrets are expensive and unflexible, they will often be useless because half the enemies will use a path they don't cover.TL; DRcombat is a chore, progression happens extremely slowly with barely noticeable unsatisfying increments, tower defense works out poorly due to the need to fight enemies in multiple rooms, setbacks like loss of a character or dust are a huge bummer you will not recover from and will snowball to kill you very slowly, RNG is mostly frustratingthese concepts and mechanics are the only things I have a problem with. the audio is ok, characters are cool, visuals are great. if you like spending hours slightly increasing and decreasing numbers, this game might be for you.

Dungeon of the Endless.. ..or: How will I die this run? And why do I restart every time? But first let’s take a look at this gem which keeps me nailed to the screen for hours. DotE is the third ""Endless"" Installment from Amplitude. You don’t need to know the other 2 and you don’t need to have played them. The story is simple: A Prison Space Ship crashes into an unknown planet, releasing its ""cargo"", prisoners and guards. Here they are, our newborn heroes. We should call them anti-heroes, because they are all pretty messed up, brutal, sociopath, misanthropic but at the same time, funny. If your humor is coloured black as mine is you will laugh a dozen times. Every hero has it’s own background, special abilities and some of them have a special connection, which you, the player, shall unfold. The game delivers everything in wonderful pixel-art, combined with a chilling, sci-fi soundtrack, so... How to play? This is the core of this game. It is a mixture of tower-defense, rogue-like, dungeon crawling and RPG. These 4 components fit together in a very unique, yet pretty awesome way, I would call it ""easy to learn, nearly impossible to master!”. Your task is to protect an energy-producing crystal, starting in a random stage, trying to get it to the exit. While this sounds simple on paper it gets pretty hard in reality. You start with 2 heroes, whom you pick just before entering the dungeon. Getting deeper into the dungeon you may or may not meet other heroes. First thoughts: Which one should I pick before entering? A Melee with good attack and defense? A ranged one? Or an intelligent contender, caring for your modules, producing more resources. Speaking of resources and modules. You are crawling through the dungeon, room by room. Every opened door rewards with ressources: Wisdom, Industry, Food and Dust. Industry is used for building stuff, wisdom to research new modules, food to heal or level-up your heroes. Dust is special. Your crystal needs it to produce more energy, because every room needs energy if you want to install modules or turrets. And you will need turrets. Not only resources but monsters will await behind every opened door. And to make it even harder, every room not getting energy from your crystal will possibly spawn new mobs. And they all know one target: the crystal! Mobs differ from stage to stage, forcing you to adapt and rethink strategies. Research is important to utilize your defense with different turrets, answering the mixture of monsters.Big Text, Quick Facts: Pro:Different heroes to choose from and unlockMultiple turrets + modules to strategize withHeroes can be equipped with different (funny) weapons, armours and gadgetsRandomized game + unlockable modes guarantee hours of re-playabiltyGreat (but unforgiving) AIPixel-art (if you like it) Con:It is very difficult, sometimes the first stage will be your lastYou will die a lot. Although this is not really a con this game doesn’t suit everyone.Story is fun but don’t expect too much of it.Level-design gets repetitive sometimes.Some heroes simply seem to be underpowered compared to others. Summary: Dungeon of the Endless is one of my all-time favourites already. It mixes different genres and what comes out is a brutally hard, yet unbelievably satisfying pixel-art gem. Although the background story could be better explained I like the way some heroes react and team-up with each other. There are some hidden stories I’ll let you find for yourself.You don’t care about dying a hundred times? You want to laugh about stupid item-names and weird dialogues? You want to build your turrets, equip your heroes and defend that shiny crystal? Hesitate no more, go get it. 9/10			"

Early Access Review
								So it had been a while since I'd played Dungeon of the Endless. Last time I'd played I had to stop because I kept getting beaten by my lack of power and supplies, mostly due to my own foolishness. I then ceased playing for a few months. Just today I looked at the title and instantly remembered the love I had for the characters even with the little back-story that you get about them. Upon loading up the game I was amazed at how much more there was. I fell back in love with it, and even though I only made it a few floors that round, I was still dumbfounded by the shear beauty. The amount of effort that has been put in this game to make it what it is. This game is worth the time and the small amount of money that it cost.			"

												I bought Dungeon of the Endless way back, as it hits the Steam Store. There it was way more simple and unpolished, but the developers have done a great job in updating it contantly and working together with the community to create a really outstanding rogue like game with beautiful art stile, epic soundtracks and a challenging gameplay. It even got a multiplayer that changes the way you play the game, cause you share your resources with other players and communication is the key to victory. I might be ""fanboying"" a bit, but this game has really close to zero flaws for me. Maybe the multiplayer could get some more polishing, that is all what I have to complain about. The best way to get an idea of the rpg/tower defense like gameplay is to watch a gameplay video of it, in my opinion. One of the few games I would recommend to anyone, really outstanding development and outcome. Pros: - art style - soundtrack - challenging gameplay - unlockable characters - co-op multiplayer - different game modi through different starter shipsCons: - rare graphical bugs - multiplayer needs some balancing			"

								Dungeon of the Endless is a rougelite spin off of the 4X stratgey series Endless Space, A lot of people on seeing Dungeon of the Endless (here on called DotE) may compare it to The Sword of The Stars spin off The Pit (If you haven't already I implore you to check out The Pit as well!) but besides being spinoffs of 4X series they are very diffrent games, where as The Pitt was a rougelike purists dream DotE is a rouglelite mixed with tower defense and RPG team managment. Although the game is in a very raw early acssess state one can see where the dev team is heading, in the TowerD part of the game you power up a limited number of rooms in the dungeon making paths to rooms that could modules to assist you in clearing the dungeon. After the room is powered you set up in the room an array of turrets and relays that will buff your party in combat against enemies that will come from new rooms and waves that may spawn from unpowred rooms, and if the room contains a slot for it you may place a module that will collect resources for you to use (the end game plans to have 3 but only two are currently avalible). The resources are used to build, trade with merchants, power rooms, or to hire and upgrade heroes, the third as of yet unimplamented resource will allow you to research a tech tree and upgrade buildings. The combat side of the game is a party based RPG where you move your party in real time either using them to explore or boost modual output. You can pause the game at anytime so as to give you time carefully layout plans as things can get quite tense as your heroes are not super powered space marines (at least not at the start) and will be mobbed and killied quickly if not managed properly. Overall in its raw form DotE is a fun experiance brining new ideas to both rouglites and tower defense and I'm egarly awaiting to see what the the devs will breakout in the future.			"

Geek Citadel - Dungeon of the Endless Review 
A Video of 
By: Geek Citadel

			Dungeon of the Endless is the perfect mixture of RPG and Tower Defense. Website: http://www.geekcitadel.com Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/geekcitadel Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/geekcitadel Twitter:...		


I admit that I’m not a big fan of Tower Defense games. I don’t see the appeal but somehow Dungeon of the Endless drew me in. Maybe it’s the Rogue-Like tendencies and the dungeon crawling aesthetic, but I was instantly intrigued by what this game had to offer. You play as a slew of heroes who have crash landed inside of a strange dungeon. The goal is to explore and defend your ships' power generator as you  head to the next floor. Does Dungeon of the Endless accomplish the combination of tower defense and exploration well? Let’s find out in this Bullet Point Review!What we likedPixel Perfect – The visuals in Dungeon of the Endless excels at providing a fluorescent sci-fi atmosphere to lose yourself in. The sleek pixel animations of characters and minimalist level design convey a truly splendid artistic wonder.The Sound of a Journey – Without a doubt the wispy tones of the soundtrack carry the heroes on their way to adventure. It’s a euphoric tickle of the ears that saturates us in unique and calming melodies. It reminds me of a few Chrono Trigger songs, and that my friends is high praise!Engrossing Exploration – The combination of RPG elements, Rogue-Like mazes, and Tower Defense feels just right in Dungeon of the Endless. Each door leads to a room that is randomly generated on each play session. The use of a power grid structure to illuminate the area and fortify a room is fanciful fun. Hunkering down to begin hoarding resources and plotting your escape is highly addicting. I always wanted to see what the next room had in store, even if it only lead to more monsters.No don’t open that door – Opening doors count as turns that activate enemy waves, complete research, and restore skill based moves for the heroes. It's an interesting take on turn-based strategy.Smart Automation – Combat is an automatic affair but it isn’t the type to frustrate you with dumb A.I. routines. The heroes will not allow enemies to stand on the other side of the room and destroy the precious generator. They make sure to keep all essential hostiles dealt with, so that you don’t have to break out into a rage festival.Tons of characters – The heroes aren’t necessarily deep characters in terms of backstory, but each of them have specific skill sets, designs, and animations to represent their personalities. It feels good to find a new survivor in the dungeon and bring them into the fold.Bring some friends – The Multiplayer allows up to four people to go online and survive some dungeons together. It copies the single-player fairly well, and gives each player their own resources for surviving the harsh monster attacks.What we didn’t likeWeapon bug – Players can only pick up 4 heroes in the Dungeon, and. the only way to recruit new heroes is by dismissing the one currently in the group. The problem is that any gear removed from the dismissed cannot be placed on the newly recruited hero. It can’t even be sold to the merchant and basically clutters up the inventory window until the next dungeon is reached.Selecting Characters – Multi-tasking can be in a pain the butt when you’re playing alone. Not because it’s difficult to move the heroes, but because you can’t always easily select them. The character portrait highlights are not easy to see, so at times a hero will be highlighted that you didn’t wish to move. Maybe a patch can allow us to scroll over the heroes to select them in Real-Time Strategy games.That looks familiar – Even though there are tons of variations on rooms, the areas begin to look extremely similar really quickly. This tends to be a problem with Rogue-Likes in general with the need to focus on indoor grid design. It can bog down the exploration experience when one place looks a little too similar to the last.Multiplayer Flaws – Dungeon of the Endless allows for players to reach 12 floors before completing the game. Players can stop and save anytime with one player, but Multiplayer does not have the option to save. This cuts down on the idea of exploration because games can take hours to complete. Also, items in chests are not distributed to multiple players. This would not be an issue if you could trade or door loot for a dungeon companion. Lastly, players can invite players to join a game but the option to create a private much does not exist.ConclusionThe story is a little light but that’s typical of the genre. What you have instead is a fun time waster that quickly becomes addicting. Searching around for various characters, stacking resources, and exploring for loot is a blast! We recommend you go out and buy Dungeon of the Endless. Find four friends and explore the endless mystery that awaits you.			"

												This game has so much potential, but just misses the mark due to some poor difficulty tuning and some lack of polish.The game starts with ""Easy"" and ""Too Easy"" difficulties.  ""Easy"" is properly ""Normal,"" or perhaps ""Hard.""  The strategic elements are really intriguing, and I like having characters that can equip items & level up.  The tower-defense-lite elements, mixed in, are neat too.  The soundtrack is nice, if a bit bland.But (regrettably, like many games lately) the RNG elements are poorly balanced.  In this case, the imbalance centers mostly around the ""Dust"" aspect.  ""Dust"" is some kind of energy source, and you use it to power-up the rooms that you explore.  You can voluntarily power and unpower rooms, to manage your ""Dust,"" which is strategic.  However, you accumulate dust very randomly, mostly by opening doors to new rooms.  Sometimes, +10 dust.  Other times, nada.  Powering rooms via dust (or rather, leaving them unpowered) is a double-whammy: your defenses won't operate in unpowered rooms, and enemies randomly spawn in unpowered rooms, always seeking to attack  your ""crystal.""  You don't  need to power the crystal room, but yoiu can't place any ""towers"" in it, either.  Monsters attacking your crystal will then cause you to lose dust, usually rather quickly.  It really boils down to the fact that a couple less-than-fortunate dust-related events, and the run will quickly spiral out of control and becomes irrecoverable.  Unlike some of the better rogue-like games (e.g., Binding  of Isaac, or Rogue Legacy), death provides you with nothing to show for it. At the end of a long run, there's very little impetus to start over.   "

												This is a fun little 2D side scrolling, survival game. The graphics are not great, but I found it interesting trying to keep multiple NPC's alive, while searching for the exit to each level, protecting your energy crystal, and killing waves of enemies. Shops, Upgrades, Research Stations, all allow you to better yourself with new and improved gadgets, weapons and armor, as you ascend level after level. Worth the buy.			"

Early Access Review
								A really really promising roguelike, with tower defence esque elements. It's really fun and has some interesting ideas, resource management, RPG character progression, randomly generated levels, and a decent difficult curve from what is available so far at least. It has a quite nice pixel-art style too if you're into that. That said, it is very much in Alpha right now and doesn't have much content (There's only three floors available). If you're looking for a GAME to play a lot of, and not an ALPHA to support, this is probably not the game for you. However even if you don't buy it do keep an eye on it, if they keep adding content this game will be great.			"

												An interesting mix of roguelike, turn-based strategy, and tower defense, Dungeon of the Endless crash-lands a group of futuristic adventurers into an abandoned facility on an uncharted planet.  Each floor of the facility is broken up into rooms, and opening a new room begins a ""turn"" in which monsters might spawn, skills recharge, and resources are generated.  When monsters attack they make a beeline for the player's escape pod, which must be defended with strategic placement of the controllable adventurers and turrets placed in between waves.  As a roguelike no two runs are ever the same, with different dungeon layouts, characters, and items completely changing the best method of survival.  The game even offers online multiplayer with each player controlling a single character; a simple change that makes for an enjoyable collaborative strategic effort.  Now, Dungeon of the Endless is NOT for everyone, as the high level of strategy, planning, and resource management required for a successful run (not to mention the possibility of bad random chance ruining said successful run) makes for a very slow and methodical game experience that can feel more like staring at a spreadsheet than a dungeon.  That said it is an expertly-crafted game jam-packed with content and possibility for the aspiring chess master to sink their teeth into.			"

Early Access Review
								A surprisingly deep strategic dungeon defense game with excellent pacing, sense of progression, and replayability. Premise: Your spaceship crashland on an unknown planet. You find yourself burried into an unknown facility, trapped, with only the hope of find an exit out of this treacherous dungeon. WIth a team of heroes, you must plan a strategic escape by moving your ship's powercore to elevator. Along the way, without knowing where your destination lies, you must open doors to dark rooms populated with monsters, hazards, or if you are lucky, treasures, recruits, resources and special events. One of your main decision lies in using the game's main currency to power rooms, preventing monsters from spawning. You also have to allocate resources to build defenses, improve your hero, and invest in long term tech growth. ===Review===*Note: this is a beta review. Gameplay:+++ Great balance betwen Macro and Micro management. Macro involves resource allocation, where and when to power/unpower rooms, tech progression, defense placement and combination. Micro involves allocating heroes to point of defense, creating chokepoints, using abilities, etc. This is a huge plus because at any given point in the game, you will always make meaingful decisions for which you can be rewarded or punished.+++ Great Pacing. Pacing is determined by opening a door, which begins a new round: you gain resources, monsters spawn, you fight, etc. You can open as many doors and at whatever speed you wish; in doing so you dictate the flow of action. There's definitely as sense of joy as you become better at the game, especially in regards to making efficient decisions and this becomes every evident in your pacing.+++Customizable experience = Replayability. You can choose heroes and your spaceship in this game, which modifies the starting and persistent conditions of the game. For example one of the spaceship in the game changes the number of starting heroes from two to four and boosts their damage, but disables certain resources/defensive structures. +++ RNG = Replayability. Many factors are random as you progress through a level, such as what items you find, when/where you find merchants, which/when recruits you find, what special events occur, which monsters spawn, level layout, etc. --- Uneven difficulty. Do not make this mistake of using difficulty metric from other games. EASIEST difficulty = NORMAL,  play on easiest difficulty to learn game's mechanics. But once you've learned the mechanics, you'll find that easier difficulties take away from the play of the game, as abundent resources, weak monsters invalidates the need for better strategy.Strategic Elements:+++ Monsters have differentiated goals. Different monsters will prioritize different targets, be it your heroes, resource producing structures, defensive structures, NPCs. As such their pathing is different. Learning such differences adds depth to  the game.+++Well defined Hero roles. Most heroes in the game are specialized, which means that for any given situation you'd prefer some heroes over the rest due to their stats and abilities. This is good because your hero composition matters. +++All Hero stats are relevant. This is impressive because 99% of games out there get this wrong. +++All but one building in the game is useful. --- Why is this building in the game???--- Need more environmental hazards, such as cloud of slowing.  I feel like this aspec has so much potential, as it makes certain locations more strategic. ---Needs more NPC types to protect. The merchant is great for the game since the bonus of keeping him alive is huge. But the game would be better if there are more NPC types that offered different benefits. Interface+++ Clutter free--- Skills need more information--- Need customization hotkeys --- Why is the Inventory window separate from hero window Visuals+++Great color pallete+++Stylized characters --- hard to tell towers apart if build in very close proximity---hard to tell some lower tier offensive buildings apart from others due to their small sizeTheme+++ Interesting character bios+++ Flavorful naming schemes--- Wierd assortment of obsolete technology and futuristic technology for item choices.  Verdict:Without a doubt, this game is worth a buy if you are interested in the defense genre.  Though it's hardly fair to pin this game down to any one thing in particular, as you'll find many elements from different genres that will add to your enjoyment, be it strategic planning/resource management, hero building/progression, basebuilding/defense, and a small slice of MOBA-esque hero micromanagement. In the end, all these things would be meanlingless if they didnt add up to a cohensive whole, but in this case, they do, and the game shines because all the parts ultimately add up to form a more intricate and interesting whole.

Early Access Review
								I'd be hesitant to offer a recommendation on a work in progress (something the game advises youf upon login), but this game really got its hooks into me from the first play through which is probably reason enough to give a recommendation. Let me first be clear though that the current version only offers 3 levels and so this is akin to paying for a demo with the promise of more to come.The simple premise of opening doors and dealing with the consequences offers a surprising amount of variety given the fact that the events are randomly generated (or so the advertisng seems to make me want to believe), and the presence of resources that must be managed effectively. I consider this second element something of a boon as any kind of game where you build a base (mostly Real Time Strategy, but this 'Dungeon Defense' can fall into the same trap) will immediately set me to designing the 'perfect base' which takes a lot of time and tends to keep me from enjoying all that a game has to offer. Of course, if you happen to like doing such things, there's no sandbox mode, so keep that in mind.In the present [0.1.1] version you must be mindful of Dust, Industry, and Food. Dust powers rooms and, if it falls to 0, marks the end of the game. Industry allows you to build improvements that do everything from improve your production to offer defense. Food heals, hires, and levels the characters you have under your control (starting with 2, maximum of 4). Resources (including character health) are restored when entering a new room, and so some element of guess work is involved in best preparing yourself for whatever the next room will bring.Success, as far as it can be measured in such a game, is achieved by picking up your crystal - the heart of your base - and bringing it to an exit once it is discovered. Easily the most tense moments of the game are created by the waves of enemies that attempt to prevent your heavily encumbered crystal holder from accomplishing this goal. Assuming the crystal makes it to the exit intact, you'll be presented with the next dungeon with whatever resources you had previously (as you might suspect, and I learned the hard way, committing all of your resources to achieving this goal is ill advised).There are possibly two considerations a potential buyer might want to be aware of before jumping in with this title. Similar to the publisher's previous title, Endless Space, fairly significant elements of the game don't seem immediately clear to a first time player, even after considering the tutorial. For instance, I assumed a character's level automatically increased by collecting food (it doesn't), and it took me until the second play through to both discover how to accomplish this and equip the items I was hoarding in my inventory. Fortunately, this title has very simple controls and so it is not unresonable to assume that most players would be able to figure these things out eventually, but this process of discovery may not to be all players' tastes.Second is simply the question of value. Is the game worth your money, and if so, does the Founder Pack confer enough benefit to justify the slightly higher expense. The game itself is definately worth it, and I myself went for the Founder Pack. FIrst, consider that the majority of benefits come from owning previous, and anticipated, games by Amplitude (and so you are likely to already be an owner of these games, though my copy came with a 1/2 coupon off for Endless Space and its expansion, so if you're not an owner, you have a good excuse to become one). The other major benefit is the participation in the G2G program. On this front I would caution that I was a long time owner and player of Endless Space and have not yet taken advantage of the points I have earned for that title. I also encountered difficulty when attempting to use these credits (resolution pending). So if the G2G content alone is the reason for upgrading, I would suggest going with the Pixel Pack. That said, as an owner of Endless Space, I don't regret my decision to go for the Founder pack.All told, I think this a very engaging title that is simple to pick up but doesn't go stale. Even in its unfinished state, it's a nice looking game with a wonderful soundtrack (another feature it shares with its predecessor Endless Space). I'm really looking forward to what the developers have in store as they complete their work on the title, but I absolutely feel like I got value for the money I spent even in its early access form. Check it out if you're looking to try something new.			"

												Imagine FTL crash-landed into Dungeons of Dredmor, and you could begin to explain Dungeon of the Enedless.  Sort of.  Amplitude has merged serveral genres into one in DotE (roguelike, 4x, squad tactics), and with stunning results. Don't let the mix of genres intimidate you. I'd never touched the 4x genre before, and found the basics of the game easy to learn.You begin by choosing two party members as your escape pod crash-lands in a hostile environment. The goal is to get your crystal (i.e., what powers all of your rooms and strucures) to the exit of each floor.  As you navigate your way through 12 levels, you will find a variety of equipment, teammates, and problems to solve (namely: how to keep your crystal from being detroyed).Each door opened constitutes a new turn, and that's when resources (industry, science, food and dust) are gained. Industry allows you to buiild, science can be spent on researching new modules, food levels/heals/recruits heroes, and dust powers rooms. Because rooms are powered by dust, you'll want to watch how much you have, as unpowered rooms will spawn enemies on most turns. Enemies will navigate toward the crystal in the most direct path available, so plan your defense as your explore.Choose your party members wisely, use their strengths to your advantage, and be careful about opening that next door. Some heroes are faster, tougher or more potent in combat than others. Some excel at a single role, while a few are flexible enough to do whatever the case calls far. Knowing when to man a defense and when to retreat will be important. A handful of heroes have the ""operate"" skill, allowing you to buff whatever major module they're manning. Make sure to pause often in combat -- it can save the life of your teammates when enemy waves become overwhelming. Death is permanent, so don't be stingy.Your heroes aren't alone in this, however, as you can build and research new structures (Major and Minor modules, both offensive and defensive) to help you succeed. Major modules are mostly for gaining resources, while minor vary from standard turrets, defensive buffs/debuffs or even healing teammates on enemy kills. Keep an eye out for how to gather as many resources as possible, as they will prove vital to success. You can't take your built modules with you, but you will retain any resources accrued.As far as sound and visual design go, DotE is a pleasant and consistent 16-bit palate.  The visuals are highly stylized and consistent, and the soundtrack will keep reminding you of tunes that could just as easily be from SNES titles or FTL. Thanks to unlocking new characters, difficulties and escape pods, the game is chock full of replayability. Online co-op should further bolster the game's lifetime, but I haven't had any experience with it to comment on.It's not as frustrating (read: unfair) as FTL, but still challenging enough to leave you feeling satisfied... even on the ""Too Easy"" difficulty setting.  Highly recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								Its challenging and interesting. With game elements such as Tower Defense and Turn-Based/Real-Time components, the current alpha will take some thinking to get through, even if it is only a few levels.The goal of the game is to explore the ""Dungeon"" to find the exit point. The exit point isnt for your characters, but rather an Artifact that you must protect and transport. The Artifact isnt solely for the Capture the Flag purpose, it must be defended whilst you are exploring the dungeon, since all damage done is taken out of an important resource that can only be gained through exploring, killing enemies and selling items (from what I have discovered).By Turn-Based, we can classify the turns as the opening of a new room. You build up your defenses and manage resources/heroes in real time, with no chance of being attacked. As soon as a door is opened, there is a chance of gaining loot, meeting a character, or initiating a wave of aliens. The aliens may not only come from that room, but other rooms that you have opened that have no line of sight. So by using the free time, you prepare your defenses for the eventuality that the aliens come. You move your characters in Real Time and can build structures during alien waves (albeit at a slower rate) to defend.When you are completing the goal of transporting the diamond to the end point, it triggers an All or Nothing alien swarm spawn, with large, endless waves of aliens preventing you from completing the final goal. Yes, you may get the diamond to the end, but can all your heroes survive? Their deaths will carry on to the next level, and you need all hands on deck. Did you use too many resources levelling up/healing or building structures? The leftovers also carry over to your next game. The graphics are not really an issue. There is a factor of fun I really enjoy. I am not sure if multiplayer could be incorporated into this game, uunless it is a coop - pvp fight against the aliens, cooperating or fighting to get the artifact to the exit first. Many hopes for this game that it turns out as well as i had fun playing it.			"

												""Dungeon of the Endless"" is probably the most unique and original game currently available on Steam.  I cannot praise this game enough--from the art style, to the audio, to the challenge, to the fun factor, to the originality, etc.  It is an all around, well-made game.  No matter how many times the game is played, it still offers something new and unexpected because of all the randomized elements, such as dungeon layout and different events that may occur.I really enjoyed the game because there are so many different gaming elements combined together.  At the core the game is a dungeon crawler.  Battles primarily take place with tower defense elements, since you buy weapons to place in rooms--you don't want your hereoes to do the bulk of the fighting since they are limited in their attacks and with their health points.  Naturally, in order to buy these defenses you have to use resource points--but you also need these resource points to build stronger resource generators and sometimes you'll need to spend those same resource points in shops to buy various weapons, armor, or items.  So resource management is another element to the game.  Another part of the game is also squad/team management; it is wise to place your characters in different rooms to maximize efficiency, such as having an appropriate character explore, 1 to defend/block a room from having monsters spawn, 1 to operate a generator to gain bonus resources, etc.The game can be played online with each player taking control of 1 (or more) of the heroes on the team, and that's where things get really fun.  The game has been known to occasionally glitch while playing online, but that doesn't happen too often.  There are so many different strategies that can be utilized with each playthrough based on the ship being used as well as which heroes are used, and that's what makes the game feel fresh and new.Be aware that since this game is a roguelike, if you die you lose all your progress.  So it can be very frustrating spending 5 hours over a couple days and you die when you are very close to finishing the game just because of continuous bad luck with opening doors.  That has not stopped me from playing--or enjoying--the game.  It always finds a way to challenge my mind, so I still cannot truly anticipate which strategy is best for countering the next move that the game may throw at me.  It is 1 of my favorite games currently because of how original and intense it can get, and I will keep playing for many years.  VERY highly recommended!			"

								A really really promising roguelike, with tower defence esque elements. It's really fun and has some interesting ideas, resource management, RPG character progression, randomly generated levels, and a decent difficult curve from what is available so far at least. It has a quite nice pixel-art style too if you're into that. That said, it is very much in Alpha right now and doesn't have much content (There's only three floors available). If you're looking for a GAME to play a lot of, and not an ALPHA to support, this is probably not the game for you. However even if you don't buy it do keep an eye on it, if they keep adding content this game will be great.			"

								Awesome game, of course still in beta, but has great replay value. The concept of the game is simply keep your crystal safe and along the way you collect dust witch is needed to power up the next dark rooms, you get dust by defeating the mobs, you also have to set up defenses and you get great loot from chest like blueprints or armor/weapons and you can upgrade your player stats by collecting food. You might also find a vendor or an extra crew member to help in the fight but will cost you dust. I am only about 30 hours or so but still a great fun game for a cheap price. I hope they add multiplayer or local multiplayer, but no mention in the forums, they have stated that they wll update the game every 2 weeks but have not stated what they have planned.			"

												So, when I was a kid, I owned this big red tricycle. Well, it was big to me, because I was around three feet tall and couldn't balance myself on a bike yet. I liked riding this big red tricycle up and down the street my grandmother lived on because there really wasn't much else to do in the house aside from watch game shows on this crappy little eight-inch black-and-white TV she had in the kitchen. That, and eat lots of Cream of Wheat. One day, I rode my tricycle down the block, and there was this big pothole in the road that I never saw before. It was surrounded by yellow traffic cones so cars wouldn't accidentally drive through it.			"

Early Access Review
								A surprisingly deep strategic dungeon defense game with excellent pacing, sense of progression, and replayability. Premise: Your spaceship crashland on an unknown planet. You find yourself burried into an unknown facility, trapped, with only the hope of find an exit out of this treacherous dungeon. WIth a team of heroes, you must plan a strategic escape by moving your ship's powercore to elevator. Along the way, without knowing where your destination lies, you must open doors to dark rooms populated with monsters, hazards, or if you are lucky, treasures, recruits, resources and special events. One of your main decision lies in using the game's main currency to power rooms, preventing monsters from spawning. You also have to allocate resources to build defenses, improve your hero, and invest in long term tech growth. ===Review===*Note: this is a beta review. Gameplay:+++ Great balance betwen Macro and Micro management. Macro involves resource allocation, where and when to power/unpower rooms, tech progression, defense placement and combination. Micro involves allocating heroes to point of defense, creating chokepoints, using abilities, etc. This is a huge plus because at any given point in the game, you will always make meaingful decisions for which you can be rewarded or punished.+++ Great Pacing. Pacing is determined by opening a door, which begins a new round: you gain resources, monsters spawn, you fight, etc. You can open as many doors and at whatever speed you wish; in doing so you dictate the flow of action. There's definitely as sense of joy as you become better at the game, especially in regards to making efficient decisions and this becomes every evident in your pacing.+++Customizable experience = Replayability. You can choose heroes and your spaceship in this game, which modifies the starting and persistent conditions of the game. For example one of the spaceship in the game changes the number of starting heroes from two to four and boosts their damage, but disables certain resources/defensive structures. +++ RNG = Replayability. Many factors are random as you progress through a level, such as what items you find, when/where you find merchants, which/when recruits you find, what special events occur, which monsters spawn, level layout, etc. --- Uneven difficulty. Do not make this mistake of using difficulty metric from other games. EASIEST difficulty = NORMAL,  play on easiest difficulty to learn game's mechanics. But once you've learned the mechanics, you'll find that easier difficulties take away from the play of the game, as abundent resources, weak monsters invalidates the need for better strategy.Strategic Elements:+++ Monsters have differentiated goals. Different monsters will prioritize different targets, be it your heroes, resource producing structures, defensive structures, NPCs. As such their pathing is different. Learning such differences adds depth to  the game.+++Well defined Hero roles. Most heroes in the game are specialized, which means that for any given situation you'd prefer some heroes over the rest due to their stats and abilities. This is good because your hero composition matters. +++All Hero stats are relevant. This is impressive because 99% of games out there get this wrong. +++All but one building in the game is useful. --- Why is this building in the game???--- Need more environmental hazards, such as cloud of slowing.  I feel like this aspec has so much potential, as it makes certain locations more strategic. ---Needs more NPC types to protect. The merchant is great for the game since the bonus of keeping him alive is huge. But the game would be better if there are more NPC types that offered different benefits. Interface+++ Clutter free--- Skills need more information--- Need customization hotkeys --- Why is the Inventory window separate from hero window Visuals+++Great color pallete+++Stylized characters --- hard to tell towers apart if build in very close proximity---hard to tell some lower tier offensive buildings apart from others due to their small sizeTheme+++ Interesting character bios+++ Flavorful naming schemes--- Wierd assortment of obsolete technology and futuristic technology for item choices.  Verdict:Without a doubt, this game is worth a buy if you are interested in the defense genre.  Though it's hardly fair to pin this game down to any one thing in particular, as you'll find many elements from different genres that will add to your enjoyment, be it strategic planning/resource management, hero building/progression, basebuilding/defense, and a small slice of MOBA-esque hero micromanagement. In the end, all these things would be meanlingless if they didnt add up to a cohensive whole, but in this case, they do, and the game shines because all the parts ultimately add up to form a more intricate and interesting whole.

												In Dungeon of the Endless, you play as survivors of a spaceship prison, destroyed while in transit.  Your escape pod crashes in to a dungeon, and your objective is to clear all twelve floors and get the hell out. You start with two squad members, and can pick up more (to a max of four) as you go along.  The gameplay itself is very in-depth, and would require a windy explanation.  There are plenty of reviews that have done that, so I'm going to keep it short and let you know just what kind of game this is.Game elements that Dungeon of the Endless does well:Roguelike (with permadeath)Tower Defense (a variety of towers that you'll need to complete each floor)RTS (with pause, research and resource management)RPG (character leveling and equipment)Squad-based CombatEach of those elements exist here, and they're all handled perfectly.  The closest thing this game has to a failing is the weakish story, and limited dialogue.  Some of the dialogue is a little poorly written, as well.  The characters are crazy cool, though.  And there are lots of them to unlock.  Don't buy it for the story.  Buy it because it's a jack-of-all-trades video game that masters every job it sets out to accomplish.Warning:  This game is hard.  The two main difficulties are Very Easy and Easy.  In 70 hours of gameplay, I've managed to win twice.  On Easy mode.  And I've loved every second of it.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless (DotE) is said to be a merge of dungeon crawler and tower defense, with random level generation and RPG elements. But is it really so? Let's find out.The game starts with two characters chosen from a pool of sixteen (many of them locked at the beginning) on a crashed spaceship. Their only source of energy is a crystal they must protect at all costs, and their objective will be to escape the ""dungeon"" where they have landed. The dungeon has twelve random generated floors, each of them considered a level. On each level, you explore the rooms in search for an elevator to take you to the next one. But it's not enough to find it. Once you find the elevator, you have to carry the crystal there.Both in the exploration and the transport phases, monsters will attack you, but in different ways. Here comes a key element of DotE: the dynamic combination of real-time and turn-based gameplay. A new turn begins each time you open a door. At this moment, you receive resources and monsters spawn. From this point, you control your characters in real time to fight the monsters or build new defenses. When you take the crystal to carry it to the elevator, the game becomes full real-time, with monsters spawning continuously until you reach the level exit. Or die.The game takes elements from different genres. First, you have a party of up to four characters. You start with two and recruit more during the exploration. Some will die, and death is permanent, so you'll need to hire replacements. Each character has three item slots that can vary from one to another, in which you can equip stuff found on chests or bought from merchants. They also have a particular level system: you don't level up by fighting monsters and getting experience points, you level up by spending food (one of the resources avaliable) on the characters. Higher levels lead to better stats and new abilities, both active and passive. Characters are different enough to have different gameplay styles. Next you have the resource system. There are four resources in this game: industry to build things, science to research new things, food to heal and level up your heros, and dust to lit rooms. Lit rooms allows you to build things in them, and also prevents monster from spawning. You can increase your production in any of the first three resources by building modules, but dust is only obtained when found through the dungeon, and resets at every new floor. There are also a lot of minor modules to build. From stat bonuses to plain offensive towers to enemy mind control modules. DotE comes with two difficulties: ""very easy"" and ""easy"", which in fact mean normal and hard, respectively, and also some pods that determine certain gameplay changes, like no health regeneration in exchange for better heals with food. This, in combination with the different character choices and research decisions, help to increase the game lifespan. In my opinion, this is a highly original game, an unique combination of genres with an identify of its own, and probably one of the best indies of the last year. It's hard and it's punishing, and many gameplay aspects are left for you to discover for yourself, but beating it is really rewarding.			"

								Quite a worthwhile purchase for $10. I'm having a good bit of fun with 0.1.3 and can't wait for further development. Wondering how science resources will tie in.Its an intereting hybrid of tower defence and dungeon exploration with RPG elements. The graphics are highly stylized which provide an odd but not bad feel to the game.Note that mobs won't spawn where you have powered rooms. Control click to power or unpower a room. So this allows you to have powered room chains generating resources that don't require any defence. Mob will also only spawn from explored rooms. So you need to be careful how you explore. Explorer fully down room chains. Don't create unneccessary directions where you have to setup a defence. That said, full exploration of a levels 1 and 2 make level 3 easier since you can level your characters and accumulate resources.			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon of the Endless has been one of the most pleasant gaming surprises I have had in the last months. I usually don't trust early access games, and honestly, I am not too fond of pixelated graphics, but after reading the different positive reviews from other gamers, I decided to give this game a try.And what a nice surprise it was, up to the point that I have decided to make my first review in Steam to support these developers and their game. As you might have read, this game is a mix between roguelike and tower defense games. Though they are two very different genres, the gameplay is so smooth that they blend together seamlessly.The difficulty is hard, but fair. You are going to die a lot, but you will learn something new from each run. Everytime you play, you will perform better and better (or at least learn new tactics or approaches). The randomization of the levels and heroes makes this game replayable many, many times. However, this randomness can also provoke that some of the levels are more difficult (or easier) on every run. Overall, I really love this approach, as makes every game very different from the previous ones.In spite of being an Alpha, the game is very playable, and in about 6-9 hours you will be able to finish the 5 levels that are currently developed. However, you will probably come back for more runs.Pros:- The gameplay is a blast, even in this Alpha stage.- Excellent blend of tower defense and rogue-like games.- A game that makes you think and choose wisely your actions. One mistake can doom your run.- Very nice art style.- Randomness makes this game very replayable.- Distinct and interesting heroes.- Nice difficulty level which makes every advancement very rewarding.Cons:- Pixelated graphics. It is something personal, but I don't like them very much. However, as I priorize gameplay over them (and the art style is very nice), it is a minor complaint.- Randomization can make a level very easy, or very difficult (it is a good thing, but also a bad one). For me, it is also a minor complaint, as I love surprises...As you have seen, I don't think that the difficulty level is a Con. I prefer the game being difficult (or at least having that level adjustable), because I think that games should not be a walk in the park.Very nice game, and definitely recommended! Thumbs up for the devs, and I am eager to see the new surprises you have in development for us in the following patches!			"

												The game, Dungeon of the Endless was made using the Unity engine and was developed by Amplitude Studios,and goes for the price of 19.99 US Dollars,The game came out in october of 2014 and is planned to have a xbox one release later this year (2015).The Endless Dungeon is a Strategy,Dungeon Crawler,Tower Defense game.You play as a crew that crashed there ship on to an unnamed planet after the crash of your ship you have to go through the many floors of the vessel until you beat that ship,once you have beaten a crashed ship you move on the next one and so on. In each ship you come across a crystal,that you have to protect it and in order to go to the next floor you.As far as gameplay goes you have to set up several sections of industry, science,food,LAN for the ship.The industry lets build up turrets for your defence against the plenty of hordes that will come.The food generators let you make food that you heal your hero with.The science produces as in the name more science which lets you upgrade the other modules.The LAN module Adds 120%/140%/170%/200% to all module's defense.The last main module is the Tactical HUD which adds 18%/21%/23%/26% attack power to all heroes on the floor.There is also a multiplayer so instead of contolling two charaters by yourself you can work as a group of four (Maximum).A few disclaimers,The standard price for the game is 19.99 as said earlier but I wouldnt reccommend buying it for that much,The most I personally be willing to pay for a game like this is around 10-15 US dollars.I personally purchased the game for 6.49 US dollars for the Endless Sale where all endless games were going on sale.Another slight problem with the game is the elevator at the end of the level on my first multiplayer game on The Endless Dungeon i had grabbed the crystal and went to the elevator and traveled up by myself to the next floor my team was left behind.Overall though I have enjoyed my time playing this game.I would reccommend if you are a fan of indie games,old school pixil graphics,and tower defence game.My overall rating for the game is a 85/100.

								Think FTL, but better, and different, but still hard as balls. You Start DotE with two randomly chosen heroes and your generator in your crashed ship, with a door to a randomly generated dungeon.Open the door, explore the dungeon, build modules to collect resources, use resources to level up heroes and build turrets  that attack, increase defense, heal or cast status effects. Discover merchants and buy better gear, blueprints for better turrets. Find new heroes and recruit them to your team. Find the exit to the next level and get your generator there safely to escape.At this stage in the Alpha there are a few features locked, and as far as I can tell there is only 3 levels available but that is more than enough, because you will die. You will die A lot. As I said, think FTL. Other than that, it's fantastic. Look gorgeous and plays great, honestly had you told me this was the end product I would still have bought it and played it for hours. 100% recommended!			"

												A unique roguelike that skirts the boundaries between tower defense and RTS, with systems and energy management systems that all work together to create a challenging game set in the Endless universe that continues to get expanded with lore and crossover references that make the unvierse feel cohesive and connected even though the games take place eons apart from each other. A squad management systems allows you to recruit new party members as you go and level them up, forcing you to decide between new unlevelled prty members as you find them, and the team you've started the game with and invested points into. You need to carefully balance your team between members thta are good at combat, good at scouting, and good at taking care of the modules and towers you place down to help you when fights get overwhelming.On top of this, the game sports excellent multiplayer at the expense of taking away the pause function - but with a second or third or fourth set of eyes, you shouldn't need to pause. Right? ... right? (no)The music and dungeon ambience and aesthetic are fantastic as well, giving the right environment to crawling thorugh all of these old abandoned facilities and parts of the planet as you try to escape, and shutting down everthing but one sepcific route as you try to carry your Crystal through, FF: Crystal Chronicles style lightnig the way, gets incredibly intense and nailbiting. There's also unlockables available about all crew members and monsters to draw you into the world more and learn more about them.And all of that is just on the basic default space-pod, which has no modifiers that change the way the game works on a basic level. There's more that change how every run works as you unlock them, and an Endless mode to see just how far you can go.Great game, and the only reason I haven't  played it more is because of a billion other games to play.

												An enjoyable RTS / Tower Defense / RPG hybrid with roguelike elements that will sink in your head for days. The gameplay is original, yet extremely challenging even on the lowest difficulty, the art-style is gorgeous and minimalistic, and there is tons of content just thrown at you at every turn. It's also story-lite so there's no walls of text thrown at you constantly.The game has a steep enough learning curve, only giving you a short tutorial on the basics, requiring you to figure out things for yourself. You start with two heroes, but eventually you will unlock up to two more hero slots as you find them in the dungeon, with a total of 16 different heroes available to choose from. Resource managing is key in Dungeon of the Endless. If you want strong characters, you'll need to build food modules, if you want tons of laser cannons to stop wave upon wave of enemies, you will need machinary resources. And if you want access to additional modules ranging from decoys, lasers, bombs, then you'll need to gather science resources.(Here is the part where I explain how to play this game, making it even more confusing.)The game has a unique ""turn"" system, designated by a door, i.e. when you open a door, a turn will pass, giving you resources based on modules you have built. Anything can happen during these turns. A wave of monsters can surprise you, power can go out, you may uncover a buff crystal or a research post, or a shop where you can spend a specific randomly chosen resource on some neat stuff.The objective of the game is to find the exit in the dungeon, allocate a hero to carry the crystal at the start of the level, and escort them to the exit, while of course, being bombarded by enemy waves. Rooms can be lit up using ""Dust"", the primary resource in the game. It's collected from enemies and certain rooms when opened. Dust is also the crystal's health, so if attacked, you will lose dust, thus losing power in rooms.Lighting up the rooms stops enemies from spawning during turns and the ""final"" phase, but also allows you to place modules on the dungeon floor at the cost of machinery resource.The game is perma-death, so if your crystal is destroyed, if your heroes die, or if the hero carrying the crystal dies, then it's game over, and back to level 1 again. There is a number of different ""pods"" you can choose from, all with various difficulties and requirements, so there is plenty to mess around with here.There is so much more to this game, including levelling up your heroes, learning new skills, abilities, picking up or buying/selling items, weapons, armour and accessories, triggering random events and most importantly, taking a whole bunch of risks. It's one of the most perplexing and gripping games I've played in a long time and you should buy it when you can. (There is multiplayer, however I haven't got around to taking a stab at it yet,  but when I do, I'll update this review.)			"

												This is a GREAT game that I think you should buy. NIce pixel style art! Hard and entertaining. And by golly the Merchant has a pet PUG!So far I have found almost no negatives in the Single Player. As for the Multiplayer though there eare quite a few problems but to be honest the Multiplayer has only just been introduced and the game isn't focused on the Multiplayer stuff.This game is perfect for playing alone, taking your time, saving and coming back to it whenever you have the chance.9/10			"

Early Access Review
								Let me state something that may seem a bit funny.  When I saw DotE hit Steam as Early Access, I hoped for a new dungeon crawler like Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight, and others.  What I got wasn't really what I was looking for and I put it down and did not touch it.  Fast forward to months after the purchase.  I decided to load it back up and give it a chance, due to the fact that I was starting to really get into rogue likes.  I didn't understand it, but I kept pushing myself to learn what makes this game work and if I can like it.  I started to understand and I started to like it, but I was terrible at the game and put it down again because of how bad I was doing.  Fast foward now to the present where I absolutely adore this game.  I finally understood the idea of modules, currency, dust, what stats do.  I'm still bad at it, but it's due to my skill and not for the fact that I originally hated it.  The art style, music, controls, mechanics, etc; everything here to make Dungeon of the Endless a fantastic title.			"

												I've played several games with my mates and we've had such a great time. Our enjoyment diminished quickly however, when we encountered the terrible issues in the multiplayer system Amplitude Studios have implemented. You seriously can't rejoin the multiplayer match if you disconnect from the game, which can happen at any time. There is some serious polish missing that doesn't seem to be on the developers minds. I've read forum posts and dev updates that acknowledged the multiplayer as far back as in 2013 and there still isn't a fix in place. I'm very concerned that the developers haven't been able, or just avoided solving this very important issue. It's the only reason why I'm not recommending this game.The rest of the game is just a blast to play, but is ruined by the fact that your progress can be ruined at any time after doing a run for over 3 hours. Just disappointing			"

												So let my start off by saying I love this dev, unabashedly.  I think they're great.  I think Amplitude is fantastic and I will still buy any game they come out with.  This game is terrible to me.What is there to do in this game?  One simply right clicks and then awaits the result.  I don't see any real depth to this because I'm just sitting here watching my heroes do their hero things and the RNG spawn mobs wherever it feels like spawning them.  There is no actual gameplay, it's just the power of your right click against the RNG.I don't leave very many reviews at all, but this one was a special kind of insidious.  The reviews are great, and I think for the hardcore roguelike player this game might have a lot to offer.  However, I work a full time job, I've got family stress, I'm in my late twenties.  I can't enjoy a game that makes me die repeatedly to learn what I need to do anymore.  At the same time, this game that makes me die repeatedly just plays itself.  There's no story (like Spelunky), no uniqueness (Curse of the Necrodancer) or class replayability (Risk of Rain).  It's just a little game, but god it's not worth the frustration to me.I refunded it.			"

												WARNING: So here we are, Dungeon of the Endless. A very different game from Amplitude studios; who specialized in 4X games (Endless Space, Endless Legend). And while this game has multiple elements of those previous games and 4X games in general, if you are looking for a 4X Game, this is not your pickup. If you are looking for a good rogue-like, a good tower defense game, or a mix of both and some 4X elements, this is the best pickup for you on the market.Settings: The settings are useful and helpful, as everyone has their own preferences. Overall positive. This goes for the UI of the game as well.Story: There is little direct story in this game, such as in The Binding of Isaac, but much is hidden in the lore and different unlocks you find in the game. These will not be further discussed, because spoilers.Gameplay: Time for the meat of this review. The gameplay is relatively simple. Your characters progress through rooms on twelve different floors, each floor progressing in difficulty. There is always a chance for monsters to spawn, and you will fight them. But the big part of the game is the four major resources that come into play. Here they are:Industry (Gear Icon): Industy is used to build things (notably modules): They can generate other resources, or defend rooms.Science: Spend science to research new modules.Food: Levels up/heals your heroes.Dust: Does not generate per floor, but is picked up. Used to light rooms.If a room is not lit, monsters might spawn in that room. So yeah. You're going to need some defenses. There is a crystal in the starting room, once you find the exit, you must take that crystal to the exit. You can't leave until the character CARRYING the crystal enters it. Once the crystal is picked up, in every dark room monsters will spawn.Elements: The rogue-like element is pretty obvious. The 4X elements of resource management and production, and how to spend them is super important. But tower defense is pretty simple. Build things that help heroes, or hurt monsters, so that they can't get to your crystal. When the crystal is hit, you lose dust. When the crystal dies, you lose. When all the heroes die, you lose.Difficulty: It is an odd game in difficulty. At the start, there are two difficulties: Too easy and Easy. Too easy after a few games to get the hang of things becomes too easy. Easy is brutal, and requires you to scrap for resources, mangage them incredibly well, and then most likely die to some fatass punching your crystal.Replayability: Yes. It has proceduraly generated floors. And it's a rogue-like. Never heard of a good rouge-like without replayability.Conclusion: This game isn't often what people are looking for, especially fans of previous games by Amplitude. But this is a fantastic blend of multiple genres, including the dying tower defense games, and the somewhat bland 4X games. This revitalizes these elements in a unique blend that requires the player to be smart, quick to adapt to situations, good with spending resources and leveling the hero, which brings some RPG into the game, and not getting too frustrated when that fatass kills your crystal three games in a row because you didn't upgrade those claymoar mines on floor seven to get a HUD module that no matter what you do keeps getting destroyed halfway through the floor because you haven't saved up enough industry or science to buy or research better protection, and now one of your heroes is dead because there wasn't enough food to heal her, and oh my god it's Midnight. I need to sleep. Well maybe let's have one more go.			"

												So remember those other two games that this dev studio made that were super innovative that I like a lot?This is like those games and not like those games. It's like them in that it's super innovative. It's not like them in almost (I say again almost) every other respect.This is kind of a dungeon crawl. And kind of a tower defense. It has elements of turn based and real time strategy involved. It's kind of funny but can be kind of tense and serious. It has a perfectly winning single player and a perfectly winning multiplayer that are virtually identical and don't suffer at all from this. Every choice might matter and it might not matter at all when the next door opens. You can probably play through a few sessions in ten minutes and have a perfectly good time or agonize over a campaign for hours, even yelling at friends in VOIP the whole time. You kind of want to screw around with this game and you kind of want to take it seriously and beat it, because it is quite simply very difficult and simultaneously very fun.For Amplitude: I am sold. Really, just keep up quality like this and I will tell you to shut up and take my money every time. You guys are amazing and I really hope everything goes well for you for this and any other project you guys work on.TL,DR- Buy this, play it, have fun, there is literally no reason not to.			"

												Very fun and addicting rogue-like game with mechanics reminding me of X-COM as well as many other games including KotoR, DragonAge, and even FTL. The pre-set controls are a little clunky but there is the option to change them (which I will do eventually, maybe). Other than that, a very beautifully crafted game with a lovely soundtrack. I would say get this game meow if you are a fan of any the above mentioned titles or would just like to torture yourself because like watching your characters die. Due to, as in many titles branding the name ""rogue-like"", you learn through your failure. Good luck out there if you decide to get this game, and if not, do yourself a favor and add it to your wishlist to see when it's on sale and pick it up.			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon of the Endless is part of the ""Endless Universe"" games, along with Endless Space and Endless Legend (the second being in early access too). As such, all their games follow a few key rules. All are turn based, all use FIDS (Food, Industry, Dust, Science) and all are interconnected in their races/themes and such. DotE though is not a 4X games like the other two. It is a isometeric view dungeon crawler/tower defense style game. You play as a crashed hero/prisoner on a planet. You land in a dungeon and must escape by climbing 10 floors. You start off with a crystal and some generators you can plant in some rooms. Each room is a turn, the act of opening the door to a room giving you more FIDS/advancing a turn. You can power rooms for the cost of 10 dust, which means money literally is power. Food levels your heroes, Industry builds things and Science can be spent at artifacts to learn more turrets or upgrade old ones. So far, it must sound complex and at first it will do till you learn the tricks. The key to this game are the heroes/prisoners. Each hero has their own style of play. Some are defenders that boost towers by standing in the same room, some are solo runners who do better alone, some are tanks. It's almost DOTA like and really helps you find interesting ways to play. You find heroes on floors and unlock them for use (so you can start with them when you die) by needing to keep them for 3 floors or finish the game with them, which ever comes first. It's a really fun way to make it more interesting and i often find myself trying to unlock people more then stay alive.At typing, Multiplayer is not in the game but it is the part i am most interested in seeing. I want to know how this will work because....simply put, this seems like a fantastic multiplayer game. This really is worth the price. Get the upgrade too if you own Endless Space, you get a new race for that game too. The Vaulter.			"

Early Access Review
								There is a reason Amplitude is the only game company that I trust giving my money to for early access titles, and Dungeon of the Endless is a great showcasing of why.To start off on early access (so I can remove this part when the game fully releases, or forget and at least have a seperate section for it), it feels complete with the minor exclusion of one or two bonus elements that don't detract from the game experience by missing, it feels polished and not completely unfinished, and most of the game ""feel"" is there. The only downside to possibly playing this on early access is getting yourself burnt out for when the actual game comes out- there are a few features not implemented yet, but development is speedy and happening every week or two.The graphics and music are amazing, and stylistically what you'd expect from other Amplitude games. The quirky humour you see in sci-fi games comes along too, retaining a serious feel while putting in the odd joke here and there (for example, there is a convict who is 100% convinced she is a spider and her description says she sometimes attempts to climb up walls), and overall the game is beautiful to look at and listen to.The gameplay might seem a bit overcrowded with buzzwords by reading the features list (My first thought: ""A turn based tower defense roguelike squad based exploration game? Is there mining and crafting and fighting zombies too...?"" ) but it somehow gets pulled off perfectly without feeling like there is way too much crap being thrown at you to juggle. Every feature is used and balanced- you need your towers to survive as much as you need to buff your heroes. The game is surprisingly simple, but unforgiving. I never beat the game to the ""under construction"" point, but I did get close- where it stands in early access, the dungeon is quite short, about 2-3 hours of solid playtime to get as far as you can if you rush.Overall, I highly recommend. Maybe you want to wait until it's finished, but spending money on it now is definitely not going to make you feel like you wasted your cash on a generic overhyped early access title.(for some reason I always buy the ""master edition"" of these games just because I enjoy having tons of icons on a forum I never use... I think I have a problem.)EDIT: The game is officially coming out on the 27th, and if you are interested in buying the master edition I am going to warn you the soundtrack is free despite earlier promises it would only be for those who bought the master edition. The soundtrack is here http://gameaudiofactory.bandcamp.com/album/dungeon-of-the-endless-soundtrackI am not sure if there is going to be a price drop or increase from the early access edition to the finished product on the 27th.

It is a little bit short so you can complete the game in about an hour. The Alpha only has three levels you can play and the highest level for your characters is five. But when they have added more levels, then I hope the game will get a bit harderEdit*After the update I saw two of my men die. It was something I didn't excpect, I was a bit dumstruck.

								WHat is there to say about DotE?Its good.! Its a Roguelike, its a Tower Defense, It uses Exploration as a limited resource. Only other game I have seen pulling this of was desktop dungeons, and that was allways a tense fight there.The graphics - Lovely. Its all Pixel graphics, but they still look so Good. I mean, It is Pixels, but then again they actually look like something other than blocks.Gameplay : It takes a little getting used to, but a lot can be found out in a few sessions of trial and error. still think this needs a Tutorial and/or First Time Tutorial floor, but you can only deliver what you have and since not all systems are 100% done and are subject to change, building an extensive tutorial wuld be a bit in vain. But the system at all is simpleyou build stuff, you open a door, you see whats inside - Monsters, Relics, Survivors, Loot - and you gain resources from your built stuffI also love how they got an EXP-less Levelling system. Thats what one of the resources is for. You give them enough food, and they Level up. But the limited building space, the limited Dust to activate rooms to build stuff in them and the fact that you have 3 resources you have to take care of make this game a really hot decision sometimes.Sound - The music is Gorgeous. Need I say more? I love me some good music in gamesOverall - for an early access game it is quite good and delivers a lot of content already. a good bunch of loveable heroes, a hard make-you-thing management system and most of all, tons of Rougelike Try againsy fun, since the game may end up playing the ""Diablo 2 Wheel of Skills"" with you and your building/resource decision(To explain the reference, Diablo 2 was a Clicky RPG with a multitude of classes and different skills. However, most builds that bring you through the game just fall short at the final boss. Means you could breeze through the game with a necromancer summoning skelettons wreaking havoc, but on the final boss they will be killed of way before they reach him. Not to forget that he one hits you as average necromancer. That boss was the ""Is your Skillset viable?"" moment. And no, the only way to respec was to use a trainer/Savegame editor. If you didnt want this, its start the game from scratch )			"

												So, what a surprise this game has been for me.  As a fan of roguelikes, strategy games, and tower defense (when done right), of course I had to try this one out.  And I've just been blown away by pretty much everything about it.Dungeon of the Endless is hard to explain in alot of ways, being such a mash-up of genres.  You have a squad of characters, but unlike usual squad-based strategy games, your team alone simply isnt enough to do the job.  They cannot make it through the massive dungeon by just clobbering monsters themselves, as the monsters are too numerous, and too strong.  And this is where the tower defense aspect of the game comes into play.Each room of a given dungeon can have a random setup of module points... spots where you can place your various modules (towers and gizmos) to deal with everything the game throws at you.  You have major modules, the sort that produce resources, or have special global effects.  And then you have minor modules, which are your weapons and defenses... all of the turrets and explody things that give you the ability to defend against the monsters.  Minor modules will tend to go all over the place, but major modules are harder to find a spot for (and much more expensive).  There is a huge selection of different gizmos for you to use, each of which does something different.  There are basic damage dealers, virus injectors that tend to target ""special"" monsters and do big damage over time, supressors that increase the damage of heroes in the room, and all sorts of others.   You have a ton of options here.But again, this isnt JUST a tower defense game.  Your heroes are just as important as your towers; you need both sides of this game working together if you want to have a chance of surviving.  Heroes have their own RPG-ish stats, and need to be levelled up by spending food on them (one of the game's four resources).  They also gain passive abilities, and active abilities, every single one of which is important.  Knowing what your heroes can do, what roles they are good at, and how their abilities can fit into your tactics for the current situation is very important.  What's more, there are lots of items to be found, pieces of equipment that you can give to them.  Weapons, armor, funky gizmos... all offering different stats, and many also offering passive abilities.  Heroes end up being every bit as diverse and interesting as your modules, and there are quite alot of them to pick from.On top of these things, the basic flow of the game is unique.  You'll start each game by choosing 2 heroes from your roster (many of which start out locked).  From there... into the dungeon you go.  Dungeons are of course randomly generated, and you never know what you're going to find.  The game as a whole is a funky combination of real-time and turn-based.  The turn-based aspect comes into play with the doors of the dungeon, one of it's most important aspects.  When you're just standing around doing nothing, not much will happen.  Enemies arent just going to constantly come at you or anything.  You're free to move your guys around and set things up, as you have all the time in the world.  Until you open a door, that is.  When you do that, you advance to the next ""turn"".  All of your resources (except dust) increase, a new room is revealed... and then, the monster waves can come at you.  The game will generally tell you how many are coming, and a ""wave"" is simply a group of monsters that spawns in a particular room.  All of these waves will spawn at the same time, and they'll start making their way towards the crystal, the all-important thing you need to defend.  When the waves are defeated, your heroes instantly heal to max HP, and you're back into that ""calm"" mode, with no more monsters showing up until the next door.  Basically, doors are everything here. MOST of the game's mechanics, from waves, to cooldowns, to research, to..... everything.... will connect to the doors in some way.  And the layout is equally important: rooms must be powered to be used, and you'll never have enough Dust to power ALL of them.  Your gizmos dont function in ""dark"" rooms with zero power.  Those dark rooms are also where waves can spawn.  Figuring out what rooms to power and what rooms to turn off at any given time is a huge part of your strategy, and really emphasizes your constant need to make difficult decisions.  Same with the choosing of which door to open next.As for those waves, your enemies are just as diverse as everything else.  Each enemy does something different, and you cant just think of them as a faceless horde; knowing what each enemy does and how they do it is really important if you want to have a chance of stopping them.  You need to use the right heroes and turrets for the right situation.  Any given floor will randomly choose a set of monsters capable of spawning there, so you dont have to worry about the game spawning basically every monster type ever over the course of a single floor.All of these game elements mesh very well to provide you with a game of incredible depth (and incredible difficulty).  One thing I really, really love is that there are so many different ways to approach this game.  You can develop your own playstyle, figure out your own favorite modules and heroes, and come up with your own winning method.  Of course, the RNG will force you to change it up sometimes, as you must do in any good roguelike.  But overall, many playstyles are possible here, even on ""easy"" mode (which is actually hard mode... ""normal"" is just called Too Easy.  Someone thought they were very clever here).The problem:  The learning curve.  This game is *difficult*.  You'll start out, and chances are, you'll die on floor one or two... and there are twelve floors, each getting more ridiculous than the last.  And you might have a hard time figuring out how you can even begin to improve.  The game isnt very good at explaining itself, and since it's so unique, alot of the strategy can seem more than a bit obscure, making it super-confusing for new players.  And it often wont tell you about really important things, like the Operating skill, which really is VERY important but the rather lame tutorial wont even mention it.  What's more, the different passives/actives each character learns are super important, but... nowhere is any of this listed.  When selecting a hero, all you can see is their four basic stats.  That's it.  The game's very design seems to ASSUME that you're going to look at some ""learn the basics"" guides to get yourself started.  This can make for a brick wall for some players.  What's more, the game can seem super-cruel with it's RNG.  It'll put you in situations that seem impossible.  It'll throw things at you that seem game-breaking.  It'll make you go ""how the heck could anyone manage that?  That's unfair!"".  In reality though, this is a very well balanced game, and there are always ways out of every situation... but it's up to you to figure out how to use the tools you have, and since the game is so very hard to learn, well.... good luck with that.  This can lead to great frustration, and LOTS of dying, which can be a problem in such a long game.But if you can perservere enough, if you can learn enough to at least get started and pass those first couple of floors, you'll find a game of incredible depth, replay value, challenge, and strategy, with tons of content, tons of outright fun mechanics, lots of tense, exciting moments, and so much more.  I play alot of strategy games, and alot of roguelikes, and so on.... but almost none of them are as good as this.  But if you're going to try it, you have to decide:  Can you persist through the learning curve of doom?  Can you keep going despite getting wrecked quickly?  Can you master the game's intricate web of complicated mechanics?   If you think you can.... give this game a whirl.  Once it ""clicks"" for you, it really is an incredible thing.			"

Early Access Review
								Review written as of 0.1.1:This game is definitely in alpha, and, as a warning, only 3 stages of the game will feel VERY short. It only took me a couple hours to experience just about all of the in game ""behind the door"" events, level up all the different heroes, and unlock all the different structures currently available. Ordinarily I would not recommend this title for the average buyer, since there is so little content existing at the present moment. However, as an owner of Amplitude Studio's previous title, ""Endless Space"", I know this developer as a consumer-oriented, professional studio that sets deadlines and pushes themselves to continue creating content for their games well past the ""we could just abandon the game, take the money, and run"" phase. I have lots of confidence that the content will continue coming. You will just have to be patient for crucial game elements like the whole research system, all character abilities, the full character roster, DEAR GOD MORE FLOORS PLZ AMPLITUDE, etc...The graphics and colors of this game are very pleasing to the eye, and shadows look great. FlyByNo is an AMAZING in-house composer, and his work on this game is just as great as his work on Endless Space. I do not know who does the writing at Amplitude but whoever it is, they put such flavor into every tooltip, every item description in all their games that you'll find yourself reading every word that finds its way onto your screen, no matter how dull you may expect the description for an item like ""T-Shirt"" to be. The founder edition comes with 50% coupons for Endless Space and the new Endless Space expansion (since buying the Disharmony expansion was in my plans already, this practically offset the cost difference between a Founder's Edition and Pixel Edition alone) for a total of about $20 in savings. The Founder's Edition itself costs $20 normally ($15 on sale now) so if you were actually thinking about buying Endless Space and it is not on sale, you may as well buy a Founder's Edition of Dungeon of the Endless and apply the discounts to maximize your Steam Wallet.In short, this is a fun and unique game with lots of easily visible potential that it doesn't live up to yet. If you are not confident in this developer's ability to deliver content steadily and stay committed to their titles, you will likely feel ripped off for the amount of content currently available and I'd recommend waiting for an official, non-early release. Otherwise, you'll enjoy this, but slowly, and you will wish there was more content available just because you're so enticed by what already exists.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a beautiful mash up of different genres that is really hard to identify.It is a rogue lite, tower defense, survival, resource management game with a bit of rpg thrown in, let me elaborate more.You begin the game after you choose your starting party of two people, these characters are the survivors of an attack at your ship near a mysterious planet. You choose a pod your heroes escaped in, which dramatically changes the rules of the dungeon, and off you go in your emergency landing, deep inside this strange complex. From there on, your only chance to escape the planet, is to carry your crystal from the damaged pod up to the surface. You have to use elevators to do this, they effectively mark the start and the end of each level. The game consists in exploring every floor searching for the exit, but also for resources, merchants, weapons, other survivors or who knows what your next objective might be. In the meantime, your dust reserve is used to power up the complex while you explore, because dark areas spawn monsters, and monsters have a nasty habit of wanting to break your crystal... so what do you do? You build minor modules to protect the path you carve in the complex, you build major modules to help you attain resources every door you open, you research new or upgraded versions of the modules you can build and onward to adventure. As for your heroes, every character has his set of skills, level up progression, statistics and possible equipment slots, which promotes customization and adaptability. The game has two levels of difficulties, one is doable, the other one is pretty tough.Of course the game has tons of replay value, everything being randomized except items, modules and heroes, every room and branching is randomized so there is no chance you will have the same game twice, even the merchants sell not only different stuff, but even accept a random resource for trade. The multiplayer is great but I suggest grabbing a friend since this a highly strategical game, more than an action one, but I've met my fair share of reasonable people online.If that wasn't enough, we are talking about the Endless lore, the same you find on Endless Space and Endless Legend, which is really cool if you're fan of the work Amplitude is doing, even the resources represent the FIDS system from the game (Food, Industry, Dust, Science).Overall I had a blast with this little title, I wasn't even expecting much but it became one of my favorite indie rogue like titles really fast. Not everyone appreciates it though (like one of my friends) though I still can't understand him, this game has everything one could ever hope for, it's original and cheap too!------------------------------------------EDIT : My nominee for The “Just 5 More Minutes” Award, since I always relax and sink in this more time than I realize.

												Take the traditional roguelike formula - randomized characters, dungeon layouts, items, stat systems, one life, etc.Take the traditional tower defense formula - turn based income, defensive towers, waves of enemies.Add a dash of a party based RPG into the mix.Combine them together? You have Dungeon of the Endless.Clever usage of your available resources is a must if you seek to come out on top, and any little mistake can very well cost you the playthrough. Simple in concept, deceptively tough in execution. It's the manacala of computer games. It took me 26 attempts before my first victory!			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon of the Endless first caught my attention with its quirky art style and RPG elements. It was only then that I realised this is a game set in the same universe (loosely) as Endless Space - another favorite. At this point the game is very much a limited demo, but it teaches its core mechanics well. Once they implement technology trees and science, this will be a great little rogue-like meets tower defense meets tactical management game. Recommended.			"

												An intriguing blend of tower defense, rts, and dungeon crawler, that suffers the foibles of all three.The art style is crisp and reminiscent of FTL, while bringing tidbits of lore from the Endless Space universe. Meanwhile, its cast is relatively new, so there's no worries for those who aren't a big fan of the 4x game Dungeon of the Endless is deriving its lore from.Gameplay largely functions in an RTS micromanagement style. Where in an RTS you may be controlling dozens of units in multiple control groups, Dungeon of the Endless plays in a more hero-themed style, controlling only up to four characters at a time. Multiplayer games allow players to reduce the number of units that must be micromanaged, and a four-man band can each have one player, allowing for very simple or very complex micro scenarios.Main stumbling block of the game is the newly implemented multiplayer. Because turns are based on doors opened, and because certain things, say, research, demand a number of doors to complete--and because there are a limited number of doors in a floor, and increasing threats in deeper floors--playing with new players is an experience in frustration, as they will be compelled to progress turns through a desire for exploration--whereupon overwhelming numbers of enemies can spawn.Additionally, DotE suffers from an overdependence on a turn-based resource pool, and thus the management of 'build orders'. While the build order/research dynamic works fine in an RTS, where you're in a technology arms race against an opponent in a sportlike setting, the opposite is the case in a team-based dungeon crawler. Since as many as four people can be in the same party, there's often a pressing urge to 'do' something, when the gameplay demands the players instead take their time and plan for the whole group. Depending on the player personalities, this can lead to an 'Armchair General' type of situation, where one player makes the decisions, while the rest either simply nod and follow along, or stand around waiting to defend against spawned monsters from unlit rooms. Not helped by this is an ""Operating"" mechanic on many of the characters, which incentivizes players to hold their ground and utilize a resource building to produce extra resources, instead of exploring seperately. Essentially, every move through a door is a collectively agreed-upon move for the team, or else resources dwindle, and monsters become overwhelming.Some of the spawning mechanics probably need a little tweaking. As much as a roguelike should encourage preparation, improvement, and memorization of what threats do what, Dungeon of the Endless has a bad habit of rolling the dice on what kind of enemies will pop up on a floor, and some combinations are downright diabolical given lack of dust, a resource that itself is RNG-limited. For instance, one run with a friend spawned massive hordes of yellow enemies that attack the floor crystal, reducing light levels--but the floor also spawned rapidly dashing enemies that FLEE combat, to bust open far off doors, to allow for more monster encounters to occur. Making matters incrementally more difficult, the floor also determined it would spawn an enemy that debuffs the PCs attacks, making juggling all three issues together impossible, for our group. While this is of itself forgivable for a normal roguelike (teaching the player that one particular threat must be seperated and singled out, or that preparing the right technology can avert a wipe), the fact that such a well-synchronized set of monsters can spawn en-masse on the roll of a die after hours of gameplay, and without much warning, does not mesh well with a tower defense/rts style. For layman's reference, imagine if Plants Versus Zombies threw hordes of Gargantaurs and Bungee Zombies at you, before even warning you that the upcoming waves would have them, or even showing you what one did, before sending dozens your way. There is potential for a similarly devastating scenario, in later floors of Dungeon of the Endless.All in all, it's a fun and new idea, and I'd love to see it refined into something different. Imagine a more straight-forward dungeon crawler that used this real-time, multiplayer mechanic, without the resource climb. Play this game for how it pieces together some diverse, disparate mechanics functionally and attractively, but don't be too disappointed when it starts to grow repetitive in that old, wave-after-wave, tower-defense way, or just pisses you off with an all-in ""zerg rush"" via AI mob spawns, that makes you want to take a break from it for awhile.

												The complexity of a Four-X game with the  brutality of an old Arcade game, plus Tower Defense. You wander through dungeons opening doors until you find the exit.When a Hero dude/dudet opens a door, monsters spawn in dark rooms and go to ""the Crystal"" (which acts as a power source for lit rooms) with the intent of destroying it. You can place modules in lit rooms to defend them from monsters parading towards the crystal thing. Modules cost resources generated by opening doors; some Large modules increase the resources gained when opening doors. When you survive 12 floors, you win.That's the beef of the game. The rest is details, but that's where the puzzle/experience of every game is too, even 4Xs. This game's beautifully modular design makes tiny DLCs feel revolutionary. It's awesome.Not reccommended for Pixel-Art tourists; you'll be savagely eaten by the game's mechanics. If you're patient, you'll like it though.			"

												Fantastic rogue like dungeon explorer. Best with some friends but fun solo as well. It's simple to learn but to make it even on the very easy setting you need to strategize and plan every room opening in the later levels.

Early Access Review
								The last patch for this title, as of this writing, was 0.5.2, so things may have changed as you read this review.Even if things have changed however, this is still a very solid recommendation. I had this game on my wishlist from the first time I saw it, and struggled with whether to get it or not as I have been burned by other Early Access titles before. But this game blends several genres together beautifully; roguelike (or roguelite, depending on how picky you are at naming it) along with tower defense and turned based role-playing.The story is pretty barebones at this point; you're on a prison ship, and it gets shut down and overrun by monsters, and thus you have to escape. For some reason that isn't explained, you need to take a crystal (presumably a power source?) with you. The crystal serves as your ""base"" hit points, along with a power source and currency. You start with two heroes out of three to start with, and as you progress you can unlock additional heroes by means of first finding them at random and surviving three straight floors with them in your party. Each 'turn' is the opening of a door. In between you can build modules to provide one of three resources (food, science, industry) or specific modules to attack incoming enemies, increase attack power, defense, or even debuff enemies. This is where the tower defense element comes in because you have to manage the resources you have to make sure the crystal is properly defended, and your resources aren't unlimited. Once you run out of rooms to open on the current floor, you're out of resources.The roleplaying elements come from finding equippable items, and using your food resource to level your heroes. Combat isn't involved, as your hero and the enemies take turns swinging, and while you can heal them mid-battle with food, that's about as involved as the combat gets.The roguelike/roguelite elements come from the fact that each floor is randomly generated, so you don't know what enemies you'll find, where the exit is, where any additional heroes are (f any), etc. Also the fact if you lose, that's it. If you meet the criteria to unlock a hero they will be available upon starting a new game but that's it. I should also point out that the only thing that carries over between levels of the dungeon is the hero's equipment and levels. It sounds complicated, but it's easy to figure out after spending some time with it. The music and sound is fitting, not really exceptional, but the graphics are very pleasing to the eye. But in this case it's the gameplay that sells the same. It's very good right now and should only get better from this point.			"

												At first with the presentation and the graphics I wasn't sure to test it.  Then I went in it because I also do bitmap art these days.  I was delightfully impressed in the free week-end.The learning curve is pretty intuitive in comparaison of the over complicated tutorial and 1Gig heavy game it was pitted against.  In the same time it is just enough complex to had made me growl the very first 4 times I tried to clear the first level because I didn't figured out yet how to use the towers/turrets.  Once that is understood, you can start to scheme so much for how you want your game to go and level out your characters, it is amazing.  And yes... another of those game without survivability with saves at each 2 seconds at the will of the player.  The character dies and the game is over. It reminds me of Hired Gun with a totally different angle and mission. In fact a single mission.  But good luck to beat the game I am pretty sure once at last level it will be a heavy tower defense labyrinth to get trough.Each character have different specialities and texts and must cooperate to get alive to the surface.  I do REALLY like it!Addendum:  As I looked back with nostalgia with the time I've spent on this game, I recalled that just at the end of the free week-end I've learned how to level up my characters and also, the multiplayer coop is also great.  ^^			"

It's a game that tactics/rpg-ish and tower defense elements intertwine to offer a good amount of gaming time, unlike other triple A titles available in the market nowdays.My only complaint, if any is the multiplayer part of the game, it really needs some ironing, especialy the trade/save/dc issues that come up every now and then.

												The only thing this games lacks is a huge energy cannon that fires through adajcent rooms in a straight line with a big FIZZ sound affect. I could describe everything else as, pretty much, groovy.It's a twisted, hand wringing tower defense game, with a shiny, new face.			"

												A rather interesting roguelike RPG - tower defense hybrid. Worth pointing out that it takes longer than average to beat (2-6 hours, depending on mode), thus leaving a somewhat bitter aftertaste if you have lost just few steps short of victory.			"

												An intriguing blend of tower defense, rts, and dungeon crawler, that suffers the foibles of all three.The art style is crisp and reminiscent of FTL, while bringing tidbits of lore from the Endless Space universe. Meanwhile, its cast is relatively new, so there's no worries for those who aren't a big fan of the 4x game Dungeon of the Endless is deriving its lore from.Gameplay largely functions in an RTS micromanagement style. Where in an RTS you may be controlling dozens of units in multiple control groups, Dungeon of the Endless plays in a more hero-themed style, controlling only up to four characters at a time. Multiplayer games allow players to reduce the number of units that must be micromanaged, and a four-man band can each have one player, allowing for very simple or very complex micro scenarios.Main stumbling block of the game is the newly implemented multiplayer. Because turns are based on doors opened, and because certain things, say, research, demand a number of doors to complete--and because there are a limited number of doors in a floor, and increasing threats in deeper floors--playing with new players is an experience in frustration, as they will be compelled to progress turns through a desire for exploration--whereupon overwhelming numbers of enemies can spawn.Additionally, DotE suffers from an overdependence on a turn-based resource pool, and thus the management of 'build orders'. While the build order/research dynamic works fine in an RTS, where you're in a technology arms race against an opponent in a sportlike setting, the opposite is the case in a team-based dungeon crawler. Since as many as four people can be in the same party, there's often a pressing urge to 'do' something, when the gameplay demands the players instead take their time and plan for the whole group. Depending on the player personalities, this can lead to an 'Armchair General' type of situation, where one player makes the decisions, while the rest either simply nod and follow along, or stand around waiting to defend against spawned monsters from unlit rooms. Not helped by this is an ""Operating"" mechanic on many of the characters, which incentivizes players to hold their ground and utilize a resource building to produce extra resources, instead of exploring seperately. Essentially, every move through a door is a collectively agreed-upon move for the team, or else resources dwindle, and monsters become overwhelming.Some of the spawning mechanics probably need a little tweaking. As much as a roguelike should encourage preparation, improvement, and memorization of what threats do what, Dungeon of the Endless has a bad habit of rolling the dice on what kind of enemies will pop up on a floor, and some combinations are downright diabolical given lack of dust, a resource that itself is RNG-limited. For instance, one run with a friend spawned massive hordes of yellow enemies that attack the floor crystal, reducing light levels--but the floor also spawned rapidly dashing enemies that FLEE combat, to bust open far off doors, to allow for more monster encounters to occur. Making matters incrementally more difficult, the floor also determined it would spawn an enemy that debuffs the PCs attacks, making juggling all three issues together impossible, for our group. While this is of itself forgivable for a normal roguelike (teaching the player that one particular threat must be seperated and singled out, or that preparing the right technology can avert a wipe), the fact that such a well-synchronized set of monsters can spawn en-masse on the roll of a die after hours of gameplay, and without much warning, does not mesh well with a tower defense/rts style. For layman's reference, imagine if Plants Versus Zombies threw hordes of Gargantaurs and Bungee Zombies at you, before even warning you that the upcoming waves would have them, or even showing you what one did, before sending dozens your way. There is potential for a similarly devastating scenario, in later floors of Dungeon of the Endless.All in all, it's a fun and new idea, and I'd love to see it refined into something different. Imagine a more straight-forward dungeon crawler that used this real-time, multiplayer mechanic, without the resource climb. Play this game for how it pieces together some diverse, disparate mechanics functionally and attractively, but don't be too disappointed when it starts to grow repetitive in that old, wave-after-wave, tower-defense way, or just pisses you off with an all-in ""zerg rush"" via AI mob spawns, that makes you want to take a break from it for awhile.

								Some new for a change, by its own, each part of the game is not new to anyone - the tower defense, squad mangement, leveling system, etc. - but altogether bring a completely new experience. I don't now if the game need more updates in the difficulty aspect, but as for now it brings challenges that most other games don't even try.It may be difficult at first, but the strategy that you develop as your heroes die, and the many unlockables this game has (a must for me), makes it an extremely addictive game.

												This game has the ability to make time pass very fast. I'm thankful to the pirating community for being able to try this gem of a game before I bought it. I don't have the best computer so it's a gamble to purchase games, and living in a small town without any place to work has made game purchasing hard as of late. So when I was working I made sure to pick this one up to have support the authors. That's something all of you should do, if you pirate a game and enjoy it, then buy it!         Anyway, this game is best described as a tower defence roguelike dungeon crawler. I'm not always in the tower defense mood, but when I am I am glad to have this game to go to. My only grief is the same grief I have with most tower defense games. Once you figure out a working strategy the challenge vanishes. Thankfully there are other game modes to play with, some of which don't allow me to do my winning strategy. (Boy did my heart sink once I figured out the strategy to just breeze through the game though)        I recently got caught up in a nearly 16 hour straight gaming session with this one (which is when I figured out my strategy) and got a little burnt out and probably wont be playing it again for some time. I'm still glad to have it in my library and if any further updates come alone to freshen things up a bit more I'll certainly hop back into it.        Oh, and one more grief is the online play. It's best to play with friends that you know already and to communicate using skype or something. I've never finished to the end on any online play, someone almost always drops out after the second floor, if not the host dropping everyone immediately after game start. I once made it to the eighth floor with someone online. But what started with 4 became 2 after the third floor. If there was a way for the resources to be divided up among the players or something different than the current system it would help a lot. I've had games that quit immediately because someone used up a resource right away or built a module that made the host upset. All and all, unless you have friends like I said before, just don't worry about the multiplayer.           In all if anything I wrote sounds appealing then go for it! Especially if it's on sale. I really need to stop getting inspired to write a review right before I go to bed. I've been nodding off while writing this and forgetting what I just wrote. So sorry if this is a bit jumbled. It was written by a very sleepy man who for some reason, decided now is the time to share with the world that I like this game! Keep up the good work game making team guys who made this!			"

												Amazing game. Simple concept, defend yourself and your resources while trying to advance through oncoming waves of enemies. Dungeon of The Endless is a great mix of turn based strategy with tower defense mechanics. It's an oddly addicting game that will have you saying, ""just one more floor"", again and again. This is especially fun if you have played a bit of Endless Legend as the lore carries between the two. Unlocking heroes and new ships is very addicting and well worth the price. Multiplayer is great and probably the highpoint of this gem; getting a great team of heroes is the most amazing feeling. I can highly recommend another title from the masterminds at Amplitude, they have gotten it right yet again.			"

												Pretty fun RPG/RTS/Tower Defense/(???) game that manages to stand out in spite of the ongoing roguelike fad. Nice production values and art direction. It's hard as nails, but you get the hang of it eventually. My only complaint is that the multiplayer is tacked on, and you spend most of the time standing still and talking about who's going to buy the new technology or open the next door. This game did not need multiplayer. Unfortunately, right now it's either that or have hundreds of entitled kids whining about no multiplayer on the forum.			"

												Im major roguelike fan. My favourites include Risk of Rain, Faster Than Light and One Way Heroics, so i have some experience on the genre. But yeah, let's get to the point:In Dungeon of The Endless your goal is to escape the Underground Lab whilst defending yourself with heroes and different turrets. You start humbly, but as you make your way closer to the entrance, you'll recruit new heroes, and unlock new turrets to keep them alive. But as you grow stronger, enemies grow outright brutal, in strength, variety and sheer numbers...The game is a masterpiece. I'd recommend it to anyone who's into roguelikes, towerdefence or dungeon crawling. If you're into 2 or more of those categories, you should have alredy bought the game just to see what you're missing.Here are the pros and cons of the game:+ Art style is unique and pretty.+ Music is great.+ Gameplay is innovative and fresh.+ Glitches are extremely rare.+ The story is interesting (if you care to search for it), as are the interactions between playable characters (heroes).+ Amazing replayability.+ Micromanagement. Doing one thing over and over might get you trough couple floors, but after that the enemies will slaughter you. So it's important to keep in mind what kind of enemies the floor in question hosts, and what turrets work on them.- Some of the heroes would need some balancing work. (Im looking at you, Max and Josh)- The luck factor. As with all roguelikes, sometimes the game just kills you without giving you even slightest chance. This becomes apparent, when you're on the last level, and game refuses to give you any Dust (resource required to power your defences), and then steamrolling you with first big enemy wave.Long story short, I still love the game. 130+ hours played, and I have yet to clear the Sanitary pod (hard mode). Update, Sanitary Pod cleared with around 140 hours.Rating:9.5/10			"

And you will need a bulletproof plan out there. For comparison I'd throw in Space Hulk. Sure, SH doesn't include upgrades like this, but the cramped room design is familiar and you're always on the defense. All in all, the game is actually really nice to look at and to play.

												Horrible, unbalanced, irredeemably broken, counter-intuitive game design that doesn't work. Yes it's ""unique,"" but so is a bicycle with cubes instead of wheels. Does that mean it works as a game? No it does not, contrary to what the ♥♥♥♥-eating lowlifes at charlatan blogs like RPS might tell you.I was initially drawn to this game because of its intriguing promise of a tower defense dungeon crawler. ""How the heck would that work?"" I asked myself. DoTE's answer was: ""lol it doesn't, but thanks for the money."" What we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is your classic Emperor's New Clothes situation. 90% positive reviews, naturally, because none of the brain surgeons writing reviews for this abomination wants to be the first to ask why the Emperor's strolling around in the nude. The RPS monkey ♥♥♥♥ers gave it a rave review based on ten minutes of cretinous button mashing at a trade show so it can't be bad! If your first instinct is to dismiss this as a cracked design due to its many fatal flaws immediately apparent to even the most casual connoisseur of game design, allow me to say you would be perfectly right in saying so.What's wrong with it, you may ask? Where do I begin? It's a mix of real time and turn based which may strike you as totally counter-intuitive at first. Oh, and you can pause. So... why is there an RTS component again? Presumably the developers didn't have the imagination to create a turn-based TD game and instead forced RTS onto it because of the conventional wisdom that all TD MUST be in real time. Just like all shooters must be in first person, herp derp. But I'm getting away from the point. This isn't necessarily a fatal flaw in the design, even if it is incredibly clumsy. The fatal flaw is introduced in the interaction between the game's janky real time combat and the permadeath system. As you might expect from a game advertising itself as a ""roguelike dungeon crawl"" this game has permadeath, which is fine. The problem is in how easily your characters (in whom you're compelled to sink huge amounts of resources. Did I not talk about that? There's no XP. Of course there isn't! Instead you have to spend the Food resource to level your characters. Because every game has to have that FIDS resource system crammed into its design.) die with ZERO warning. You can look away for a split second to build some towers or some ♥♥♥♥ and one of your characters will be dead when you focus on them again. Great game design. They aren't incapacitated or require reviving or anything, they are immediately DEAD when their hp goes down to 0, effectively ending your run. Contrast with the clever character permadeath system from something like Darkest Dungeon.I could go on with other similarly horrid examples, but I'll spare you. Broken, non-functional, non-viable, vomit-inducing game that should've been aborted in the prototype stage, but instead astonishingly made it to release. I keep trying to find some good in it but come up empty handed at each attempt. And finally, the lazy hipster pixel graphics as the icing on this particular ♥♥♥♥ cake. Last time I give this studio any money, and I've already given them plenty.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless, to put it simply, does everything right.At its heart, Dungeon of the Endless is a relatively generic hero-based tower defense game. You defend your core node against spawning armies of increasing difficulty while building modules to defend and support your heroes. If this was all Dungeon of the Endless was, it would really just be another Kongregate tower defense game.However, the mechanic that Amplitude chose to focus their core gameplay on is exploration, and what a glorious implementation it is.  I've always been a fan of games that use exploration as a resource mechanic. I enjoy puzzle games and this one simple mechanic can turn nearly any game into thought-provoking puzzler.The premise of the game is simple. You're on a ship and you crash land. The only thing salvageable from your ship is a power source. You need to protect this power source and drag it through each of the levels until you reach the top and can be rescued.Of course, it's not that simple.Dungeon of the Endless uses a resource system comprised of industry (for building things), science (for learning how to build things), and food (for keeping your dudes alive and leveling up). You gain these resources by opening doors (exploration). There is also a concept of Dust as a resource, which you find in some rooms or from some monsters. By allocating Dust, you can light up different rooms in the level. Lighting up rooms does a few things: powers your devices in the room and prevents monsters from spawning. However, you don't have enough Dust to light every room, so it becomes a puzzle of what rooms to light up and/or occupy to minimize the spawning enemies. When you do find the level's exit and you plan to try to move your power source to it, the fun truly happens. From every dark room, enemies constantly spawn. The person carrying the crystal moves at half speed, so it's up to everyone else to defend that person until they reach the exit and your team can leave the level.Speaking of your team, you start with two dudes. They all have different abilities and different stats. Over the course of the game, you can use food to level up your guys (up to a max of level 15) which helps their stats, gives them new abilities, etc.All of these concepts work completely and are executed flawlessly. There is a sense of constant panic and dread when you're exploring, particularly when you're short on resources or dust. You want to spend resources to improve your team, but want to save some for emergencies. If I have a complaint about the game is that it's a bit too easy. Once you understand the fundamentals of the game and have a good strategy, it pays to just keep repeating that strategy for the entire game. However, the developers very intelligently added a variety of ships that change the rules of the game. This is where the future challenge lies.One of the best titles in recent memory. Well worth the low price.			"

(Im looking at you, Max and Josh)- The luck factor. As with all roguelikes, sometimes the game just kills you without giving you even slightest chance. This becomes apparent, when you're on the last level, and game refuses to give you any Dust (resource required to power your defences), and then steamrolling you with first big enemy wave.Long story short, I still love the game. 130+ hours played, and I have yet to clear the Sanitary pod (hard mode). Update, Sanitary Pod cleared with around 140 hours.Rating:9.5/10			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a really kickass RPG/rogue-like Dungeon-Defense game. It's very fun with multiple people but there are a few issues, you see, to unlock a character (even in multiplayer) you have to hold that character in your control for 3 floors after finding them, but only you unlock them. The only other issue I've had is that every time we get to around Floor 10-12 the game auto-crashes or will freeze, or the elevator simply wont trigger, so at this current point it is unwinnable for me or my friends. Maybe we're the only ones with this issue, but i've come to doubt that. Other than the previous listed issues, Dungeon of the Endless, like its' other games, kicks total ♥♥♥, fun gameplay, cool items (and item descriptions) cool characters with great backstories, good OST, and most of all, Endless Fun.

								What a wonderful roguelike comboed with tower defense.  Even in Alpha this is as stable and playable as Endless Space was on release.  Amplitude had my trust after Endless Space which is why I risked an Alpha purchase.  Not disappointed.  You start with two heroes.  They have skills, inventory and slots of weapon/armour/tool.  Each room you clear gives you the next wave of resources which you can use to level your heroes, build or research.  You can have your heroes man stations that you build in each room to vary your resource income if you can do without them.  So you have to manage your heroes and incoming enemies.  That's the basics of it.			"

								Most people that enjoy FTL will enjoy this. In FTL the thrill is getting to the next beacon. Seeing what the game throws at you, and trying your best to handle itIn DoTE? What's behind the next door? If the proposition of sick anticipation for the next sadistic amalgam of chaos that you might find behind that door excites your inner masochist then this is the game for you!Dungeon of the Endless is an immaculate blend of genres---so much so that it feels like something brand new. The consortium of rpg elements, tower defense, procedurally generatred levels, and tower defense are all wrapped superbly in Amplitude's signature UI. Speaking of the UI it is sleek, clean, cripse, and effectively delivers you all the information required seemlessly. While the game is far from complete there is more than enough difficutly and challenge involved. A meaty roster of characters and several difficult floors to plow through. The randomly generated nature offers much replayability, all the while Amplitude contineously injects more content!			"

												Pretty addictive. It's a fairly unique combination of genres - I'd call it primarly a resource management/tower defense game with roguelike elements and some RPG mixed in rather than a roguelike with TD elements, but that's just me.+ High replayability - unlockable ships (influences how you start as well as your strategy throughout) unlockable characters, randomized maps, loot and research opportunities makes each playthrough different.+ ""One more turn/game"" appeal - whether I was trying out a recent unlock or simply trying to correct the mistakes I made last game, I found myself wanting more.+ Challenging without being unfair, tactical without being overwhelming - this game can slap you into the dirt, but when you lose it tends to be because of your own actions rather than RNG. And while there are enough mechanics in play to make the game interesting and intense, you won't find yourself lost. You die, you do better. You die, you do better.+ Good sound/music. Not much else to say.- Ugly. If you're used to roguelikes you'll be expecting this, and if you're like me you'll get so immersed that you'll forget it's ugly entirely. But, when hordes of enemies are streaming in and you can only recognize a few distict shapes in the pack, you'll wish it was just a tad better. Still, very minor.			"

												 Dungeon of The Endless definitely will be one of my top 10 favourite game all time. The game is pretty clean and simple but is very challenging, it is really tough and will rekt us upside down. One had to strategize the next move, manage the resources and and secure thyself with defensive structure for what may come. DoTE definitely does a stunningly impressive job with the in game graphic and OST, after spending countless hours of venturing the floor with the pixelated graphic and BGM... it was suprisingly immersive and beautiful. This game had a pretty depth learning requirement and excellent strategy are in order to be able survive and escape from all the floor. I had to sayeth it was not an easy task either. In here I strongly recon new player either go through some guide or play in a multiplayer games with more season player in order to learn how and know a few tips and trick about Dungeon of The Endless before you give up this piece of gems. When I first bought and played this game; I was like ""Oh boy...I land myself another crappy 75% discounted game and needed refund again...."" How wrong was I?!! After giving another trial at some time later in a multiplayer run It was unexpectedly fun !! Intense and so much amazing !! Too bad the player base of this game is really-really low and is much more harder to find player to play in multiplayer, so from time to time I'll just single play Dungeon of The Endless in offline mode and sometime I'll browse in forum to l00k for companion to escape and journey the amazing DoTE together with. This game will take your another 5 minute more than what you had ever expected. Grab your copies today when Dungeon of The Endless is discounted, even is on 50% is totally worth it. Worst case scenario...""Oh boy...I land myself another crappy review game and needed refund again...."" "

												Dungeon of the Endless is a top-down roguelike dungeon exploration & tower defense game with many unlockable elements set in the Endless game universe.The player uses a squad of up to 4 characters to explore a multi-floor dungeon one room at a time while protecting a power crystal. Like other Endless games, the four resources are Food, Industry, Dust, and Science (FIDS). With each door opened, more FIDS accumulate, but dangerous monsters may spawn. Players eventually discover a dungeon floor exit and carry the crystal to a new dungeon floor, continuing on until the game ends at the 12th floor.Characters may be discovered in-game and unlocked after completing a certain number of floors with that character. Characters have different strengths as might be expected, including attack power, defense, movement speed, and ""wit"", which in this game translates into better module operation bonuses. Certain secret combinations of characters lead to different in-game events.Food, Industry, and Science increase in a predictable fashion with each door opened, but Dust is less predictable and cannot be saved between levels. Dust may sometimes be discovered in new rooms or obtained after defeating monsters.Rooms adjacent to the crystal may be powered (or ""lit"") subject to a limit based on the current amount of Dust. Lit rooms do not spawn monsters. Given enough industry, different ""modules"" may be built in a powered room based on the characteristics of that room--not every room can hold a module, no room can hold more than one ""major module"", and different rooms have different limits for ""minor modules"".Items may be discovered in new rooms and are bought and sold for FIDS at merchants which may be discovered in new rooms.A special Research module may appear in a new room, allowing for Science to be invested to unlock new modules or higher levels of existing modules.Modules may be removed, for example removing an unneeded Research module to make room.Like any great game, Dungeon of the Endless presents the player with many interesting choices, for example:- leave a room dark to spawn more monsters and the chance for more Dust, or light the room to reduce monster spawn and provide room for modules?- invest Industry in FIDS-producing modules (longer-term payoff) or defensive modules (immediate payoff)?- spend Food to recruit a new character, or save Food to see if a better choice is available later?- take the exit as soon as it is found, or open a few more doors to try to gain more Food, Industry, and Science for the next level?- invest Science now, or remove the Science module in favor of a different major module?Tactical elements include: positioning of characters when unlocking a door, character movement between rooms during combat, activation of special abilities, healing (which takes Food), and resetting abilities (which takes Science) in combat. Combat may be paused for easier micro-management, but some players will find it more fun to do without pausing (there's even a Steam Achievement for beating a dungeon without pausing).			"

												A unique combination of roguelite, dungeon-crawler, and tower defense. Definitely worth a look. I love the graphics, and the music even more. If you own Endless Space and/or Endless Legend (Amplitude's other games), then it's worth it to buy the upgraded editions, as there's some unique content available by owning those other games. If you buy the upgraded editions of those games, you'll get added content for buying Dungeon of the Endless! None of it's essential, but some of it's fun.I've played over 50 hours of the game and have unlocked all but 1 character, and only half of the pods (the 'ship' you start in--various pods alter the starting conditions and change the rules throughout the course of the game). There's plenty of content, and the formula works well enough to provide hours of gameplay. For some real fun and chaos, just add friends! You can't pause in multiplayer, and with 4 players, everyone controls their own character, making coordination vital and extremely fun, especially if you can get some voice chat going (which is easy now that steam's voice chat is pretty damn good these days.)*One thing to be aware of: You do not directly control the actions of your characters, nor do you directly engage in combat! You click to open doors, interact with NPCs and objects, and move from room to room. The characters will automatically attack enemies based on certain priorities. You can activate your abilities on command, but that's it. When I bought it, I thought you controlled your characters like in Diablo or League of Legends or Dota, but that isn't the case and I was majorly turned off. But I quickly discovered that the more hands-off control lend itself very well to this game and quickly picked up on it and started having a blast!9.5/10, would recommend. I subtracted .5 only because there are a couple minor annoyances regarding controls: I wish you could assign all your heroes' abilities each their own keybind. As it is, you have to select that hero and then press a key (or click an icon) to activate the ability. It's fine in singleplayer when you can pause it, but in MP when you're controller 2-3 heroes at once, it can be a pain in real-time. "

												This game is hard, relentless, unforgiving, incredibly fun, addictive and has tons of replayability.  I personally think this game is a hard to learn, hard to master type game.  This game is not for the weak-willed who seek handholding, checkpoints or walks in the park.  Dungeon of the Endless is a tower defence game that draws RPG, rogue-like, dungeon crawling and resource management elements.  You start each game by picking 2 heroes out of a 24 (with all of DLC and unlockable characters) member cast.  Each hero has different stats that help your team in one way or another (Speed, Power, Health, and Wit).  Your objective is to look for the exit of the floor, which leads to the next floor.  Each floor gets progressively harder and harder the further down you go.  To ""win"" or complete the game, you have to complete all 12 floors.  You start each floor in a single room and have up to 4 different directions you can go.  Each room you enter has a chance to spawn dust (used to powers rooms) as well as: other resources, merchants, treasure (that can be worn for bonuses or sold for resources), other heroes to add to your team (for a max of 4 heroes per team) and/or monsters!  For each room you enter, any room you do not have powered by dust has a chance to spawn monsters in it.  You will eventually come to a point where the minority of your rooms will be powered and lots of monsters are spawning.  This is where strategy and micro-managing your heroes comes into play.  You have to find the perfect setup where you can defend all your modules and your crystal, without your heroes dying.  This will require quick thinking, quick calculations and quick action to make sure you can defend all directions without losing modules, heroes or resources.  If you lose (from either monsters taking your crystal down or losing all your heroes), you do not start from where you left off, you will need to start from floor one again with a new team.I’ve read a ton of negative reviews saying this game has way too much RNG to be recommended.  You can definitely be ♥♥♥♥ed over by RNG in this game, but 90% of the time you have that bad of RNG, it’s definitely winnable if you just play your heroes and defence right.  The feeling of conquering an insanely hard floor after getting some bad RNG is pure bliss.  I recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging game or a completely new take on tower defence.  You will lose NUMEROUS times before you finally win (on Easy at least), but that first victory is one to remember.  If you’re looking to start playing this game, I’d highly recommend checking out the let’s play link below.  This video really helped me understand the basics when I was first starting out.

												Loving this game so far. I have both Endless Space and Endless Legend, and I think they both show promise, but ultimately aren't quite 'there' yet. But with this game, they've taken the world, the lore, and the feel, as well as some of the concepts (resources) and applied them in a VERY different package. This is part RPG, part tower defence, all fun!Graphics style works, and the game has a feel that is reminiscent of the wonderful iPad game - Sword & Sworcery. Pixel graphics that really work, a wonderful, atmospheric soundtrack. Really solid.And the game play is wonderful (albeit hard - i'm playing on the easiest setting and still finding it a real challenge to get a decent strategy). You'll need to be a little patient, but use those defences and you'll get there. A wonderful example of how a simple concept, well executed, can be delightfully engaging. Well done dev team, well done!			"

												This game has a neat little combination of features that is kind of a mix of dungeon crawler and tower defense. It's fun to pick up and play for a bit or to try and get all the way through a run. The art is pixel, and when you see the more functional and attractive art of their other two games on offer here on Steam it makes you wonder why they chose to go with such a terrible look. I can live with that, I've always been a proponent of fun gameplay over shiny graphics.Unfortunately the multiplayer seems to be hampered by bugs. When a player quits out I am normally left locked out of the game. The game just doesn't hold enough appeal for me to attempt ot grind away in single player. For this reason alone I can't recomend the game. I have finished only about half of my attempts at multiplayer, and that's probably only becaused I died so early on it didn't have a chance to glitch out on me.			"

The only negative thing I'd have to say about this game is the multiplayer, at times can be very unstable. If this is fixed in any coming updates I'd have no complaints about this game. The difficulty is just right, and rewarding and I can't wait to see if we get even more brutal difficulties to truly test our sanity and endurance. Some would say the dust generation is unbalanced, but I find it just right, of having to choose between fully exploring or just blizting it before i lose any (more) characters. To any of my friends who even reads this, you totally gotta get it for such a cheap game.			"

								This game just proves that you don't need a powerful graphic engine to make a potentially great game. The interface is intuitive and the style is rich enough to give you an artgasm. The game itself has a fairly easy objective - get your dust-filled crystal thing to an exit. But don't be fooled by the simplicity, the game can be punishing. When you take the crystal out of its notch, be prepared to face continous waves of enemies. It's difficult in a sense that it'll force you to utilize anything at your disposal in favor of just making a run for it. It's a game that will test your attention as well as your ability to make tough strategic choices.If you're sick and tired of shooters, consider picking up this game. It's colorful, easy to pick up and incredibly easy on the eyes.			"

												I'll keep this short, if you like 4x, tower defense, rogue, or other topdown genres of the sort you will enjoy this game alot, and its defiently worth what its asking for. Any flaws have been too minor for me to notice because I've been having so much fun with the game. I have yet to try multiplayer so you'll have to look at another review for that. Would suggest to anyone who enjoys top down of any sort.			"

												Very enjoyable roguelike with tower defense elements. Enough tower/hero types to keep you engaged for more than one playthrough. More difficulty options would be great, as ""Too Easy"" is exactly what is implied, while ""Easy"" can be pretty brutal at times. The option for 4 player coop is great, although the coop mode requires a bit of polish before I would recommend it. Coop has no ability to save your game, and with a full playthrough requiring a few hours of gameplay, you better make sure you set aside some time. I recommend playing at least a game or two on singleplayer, as this will allow you to unlock some characters before trying multiplayer. Also, the game had a few connectivity problems where players lost connection with each other about an hour in (In our case, two players maintained connection, while two players lost connection, while still able to view each other's movement. Some sort of host desynch...)Overall, worth the $13.			"

												Just picked this up on the Holiday Sale. I've been a big fan of Amplitudes games for awhile now, having spent a whole bunch of time with Endless Space and not enough time with Endless Legend. Their games are clean, polished, and they've done a wonderful job of world building with the whole Endless thing.Only one session down with DotE so far and I know I'm going to be hooked. I'm a sucker for tower defence games but the way in which they put together this game has brought the genre to a new level. Great design, both gameplay and visually, make this stand out for me. I look forward to spending many, many hours with this title.			"

												The title is wrong, as these dungeons are not endless. Unless play it in endless mode... Yeah.Well, it's a roguelike rpg dungeon crawler with tower-defense elements. You crash into some shiттy place and you got this cristal, right? Well, you need to carry that cristal all the way to the elevator, which you have to find in a first place, as you have no way of knowing what will expect you in the next door. Maybe it's loot room, maybe it's full of enemies, maybe there is another character inside that you can recruit for your group, maybe I'll go and fцск myself... You just don't know. And thats the fun part of this game. Get your group, explore the dungeon and try to get to the end. I suggest to reinforce your path to the elevator with turrets of all sorts, as things will get really bad really fast once you remove the cristal from the previous spot. This game has a good price-replayability ratio and it's a wise purchase, if you are a fan of roguelike games or tower defense ones. Fun to play it in coop with your friends too. I give it 8 of 10 and now I am going to cry myself to sleep. Have a nice day, anonymous reader.			"

												Outstanding game design, unique, immersive, challenging, the very definition of a gem.Do yourself a favor, don't spoil yourself any further and dive into it.UPDATE: I found a couple of bad things to say about the game, figured I'd share.- A bug preventing you to equip items sometimes, save and exit, reload, fixed.- The different game modes you unlock after beating the game are a bit lacking, the general idea is to remove some features and give it a different name. This hurts the game replayability quite a bit (compared to what I expected) but it's still worth the money.			"

												Before buying this game, keep in mind that, unlike what you might think from the description, this is not a very complex rogue-like. While there are elements of tower defense, resource management, and levelled characters, there is little learning curve, meaningful decisions, or stat mongering in the game.In short, it's much closer to a mobile game for PC than it is to NetHack. Which is absolutely fine, just something to keep in mind before purchasing.POSITIVES:- Immediately accessible from the first level- Meaningful replayability via different starting conditions and Endless Mode- Enjoyable world characterization - Crisp assembly- FunSOMEWHAT NEGATIVES:- Fairly easy. I beat the hardest starting difficulty in three tries, and each scenario in one or two- RPG elements are a little dull- Individual levels often end anti-climatically- Exploration lacks variety- No voice actingBOTTOME LINE:This is a great little game that's perfect for killing idle hours. If the description intrigues you, it delivers. (But just don't expect a game of great depth.) A sequal would be fantastic.---PLEASE NOTE BEFORE PLAYING:This game comes with a free DLC that adds four Team Fortress characters to the game. This is pretty fun when you're used to the game, but it ruins the atmosphere to run across a Heavy or Pyro during your first couple playthroughs. I'd reccommend unchecking the DLC box on the game's page in your library before launching, and turning it on after a couple hours to see if you like it.			"

												This is an amazing game.I've put over a hundred hours in so far, and there's no end in sight. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME HIGHLY ENOUGH!!! It's still being supported and actively expanded by the developer, which is always nice. The latest expansion pack with the Rescue Team is still a mystery to me. I haven't explored all the content, or discovered the storyline reasons for each character's presence. But I expect good, high quality content, which is what I've received with this game so far.My only issue with this game is that it's STILL buggy as hell. It WILL regularly crash on you and/or devour your saves and leave you with only a fading memory of those 11 floors you and your buddy put in on Easy mode, escaping death by a fingernail's breadth. Then *POOF* the game takes a crap on you. This WILL happen. I personally think the game is worth putting up with this stuff, but I can see why it would put some people off. All this being said, this game has many hours of fun dungeon delving for you to enjoy. The randomization is sometimes cruel, but overall the game is reasonably well balanced. Some characters are quantitatively better than others, pure and simple. But there's enough variation in the character skills to make trying each one out something you'll want to try. Especially with the expansion content, there's significantly altered mechanics.Finally, PLEASE play this game in multiplayer a couple times. It's a fantastic experience that you won't forget. You and up to 3 friends will be pitted against the dungeon together, which is what friends are all about. When you do this, I recommend that you learn how to manually back up your own saves. It's just too painful to lose a game to a corrupt save, or a de-sync glitch, or any number of other things. Just don't use it to cheat, please.This game is one of my top five favorite plays right now. I recommend you try it too!			"

								""Dungeon of the Endless is a pretty interesting game, certainly one I look forward to playing more of. It is in Alpha as I write this and must say I am impressed not only with the design but the over all polish for an alpha. A game that introduces a dungeon crawl-esque gameplay tied into a tower defense is certainly an intriguing combination and as you begin to play you realise that yes, they certainly can go together in a rather intense strategic fashion. Looking forward to more features and I tip my hat to the developers for including the community as they do so often, and have proven so with Endless Space.""			"

												Fun, simple, but very hard dungeon exploration/survival/tower defense game. You have maxium of 4 heroes that explore dungeon level by level, trying to find elevator to the next level. Dungeon is built out of rooms, and uou open up doors which represent turns. Each turn you gain resources that you use to build modules and towers, research new things, level up and heal heroes. While exploring, you encounter hordes of monsters spawning out of darkness, which will try to kill you and your core, which you need to protect to get out of the dungeon.Like all Endless games, this game as well is meant to be replayed again and again, with different settings, like characters or core-mechanics that you unlock by playing the game.For a casual scrub like me, the game is definitely too hard on easy difficulty, but challenging enough on ""Too Easy"" difficulty.Even though I haven't been able to beat the game on easy difficulty, I recommend it. It looks good, it sounds good, and it's fun to play. There is also multiplayer which is big bonus for a co-op fan like me!			"

												It's time to toss in my two cents.At first I was like - Dungeon of the Endless gets me some free stuff for other games I own from Amplitude Studios, and I get to support them. Cool.Then I played it and lost a lot. I suck at Rogue-like games. So I put it away.A few months pass, and a Steam friend of mine invites me to play with him via MP (he's in France). 5 hours later, and I see the allure, but I still suck in SP. SO, DotE gets shelved again. A few more months pass and I need to write a Friday eXcurision for eXplorminate and here is the product (http://explorminate.net/2015/09/11/friday-excursion-dungeon-of-the-endless/). That results in me playing the iPAD version, and I finally learn how to play the game.So, how is the game? FUN. But it's hard, and brutal, but if you plan ahead and prepare, you can do fine on the Very Easy level, which is actually normal to hard. Easy is anything but, and don't get me started on the hard mode (you need a special pod for that). On to the review!!!You start the game as a survivor of a crashed escape pod on Auriga where the Endless were conducting experiemnts on live subjects in a crazy torture lab/arena. THe planet is like Mortal Kombat world and this is where the combatants are made.  Anyways, as you try to escape the labs to the surface, you face monsters and random events every time you open a door...  Why do you open doors? to search for the escape elevator. Each time you open the door, you get resources that you can use to upgrade your heroes, power and buildup your rooms, and investigate tech to further your modules.You repeat the above for 12 floors until you find the exit, and all the while, you'll be attacked by hordes of monsters.Let me repeat this point - the game is BRUTAL in SP, and equally BRUTAL in MP, but at least there, you get to lose together with your friends.I recommend this title, because it fantastic, and Amplitude Studios has just released a 3rd, that's right, count it.  1.. 2... 3... free dlc adding content.Have fun dying, I know I did.

Early Access Review
								Fantastic art direction - mediocre gameplay.A game that (currently) isn't the sum of its parts. All the elements are there, apart from something compelling to do when you play it. The concept is original enough, but the execution is in turns tedious, repetitive and unfair. Playing simply involves repeating the same actions, stage after stage, and hoping the RNG doesn't screw you too badly.Unlike true Rogue-likes such as FTL and Binding of Isaac, this is essentially a very pretty, but basic, tower defence game with occasional difficulty spikes, or loot drops, as its 'random' element. None of these are compelling like Spelunky's altars or shopkeepers, or FTL's story choices, but simple occasional resource gifts or monster waves.The problem here is that it misjudges what makes tower defence fun - accurately managing those resources. By tying those into the RNG (level layout strongly dictates your defences and resource gathering) your strategy is always a slave to the RNG, and can often be ruined simply by an obnoxious layout simply starving you of resources, or forcing you to defend more points than is possible.This makes the game a case of going through the motions, repeating an optimal strategy with little breathing room for experimentation, until you luck into a good run or are forced into an unfair loss. All 10 stages play exactly the same, but just get larger and contain more damaging enemies. Once you've finished stage 1, you've essentially seen the entire game.A shame, as every other element is dripping with style and polish, and the mixture of TD, dungeon crawling and Rouge-like works as a proof of concept, but unfortunately all you get here is simply a marriage of extremely shallow reprentations of all three genres.6/10			"

												Man this game can get old if your just in it for single player but if you play multiplayer and can understand the mechanics you can have some epic games. My last one as I'm writting this review was intense as a 3 man team we made it to floor 8 or 9 i forget which one but due to a horde of monsters attacking in concentration the other 2 were wiped out.I then quietly mourned thier loss and moved on my odds of survival were low but I had a monster on my side as sasha so kept pressing onwards. Through luck i managed to make it to second last floor and nearly die to a giant horde attacking me as a ran towards the elevator. The last floor i had made it. the first 8 doors left me with barely enough dust to power a room. I can't do much anymore i can mearly hope i can find the exit as i open the 11th door i see the exit. Half crazed half dying from laughter I grab the crystal and make a mad dash for the exit. healing myself many times. Suddenly I could see sunlight. I had survived.Honestly this game is hard but winning means something when you do do it			"

OverviewThis game works with a really nice concept, you are at a wrecked space ship and need to survive through some floors on each, taking care of monsters, characters and resources. You (if alone), can start the game with two characters, and while the game progresses you get the possibility to get up to four characters wich can be abbandoned mid-way. As for MP each person gets 1 starter.  The game is rogue-like so there's no save, everyone dies is game-over. No save estate nor last floor respawn, so you were warned. I should also say that this game is hard, really friggin' hard.Graphics - 8/10It's pixel-art-styled, it's simple but it deliver the job well, the monsters don't get repetitive, as there are a bunch of different ones(and some that are just a color change but ok).Gameplay, Music - 8.5/10The gameplay is really simple, so I found no problems with it, except of course some bugs and a bit of weird things on selecting each hero.Did not pay much attention to the music, the sound fx were high as hell and you just start paying too much attention to the game that you mostly ignore it.(Well played devs, well played)Multi-Player - 8.2/10There must be a separated part for this because:1- SP gets a little boring fast if you're not a big fan of this kind of game;2- It's really good as it had just a bit of lag during it;3- As for most of the games, MP makes it all better, if you have a friend that is, chatting on the console in the middle of a hord would be kinda tough.The VeredictThe game's really great and you should really give it a go, even if you need to wait for a sale. If you have a friend or 2 that also enjoy this kind of game than you shoud really buy it, you won't regret at all.A final score of 8 - Give the damn thing a try already!So many typos were made...

												I've read through the reviews, and all the people that have reviewed it negatively are just butthurt that it's incredibly difficult and they can't beat it. I won't lie, you probably won't be able to beat it. I've never even beaten a playthrough and it's still one of my favorite games of all time. If you're up for a challenge play this, if not you can always play something more casual.			"

												At 12:30 p.m. we discover this game and start downloading it, and at 12:40 p.m. download finishes and my friend and I have our lifes changed... First thing we did was spent over a minute on trying to walk and interact with things. we fingure out we open doors we place down modules we kill monsters we find the exit. I run to grab the shinny yellow power thing, I start running, I make it to the exit thinking my friend would just teleport along... he doesn't... I am alone... I get to next floor... I open two doors and die... 1:03 p.m. we start again... going through each floor, making it to the end... at that moment it was 6:47 p.m. 10 out of 10 would spend my day freaking out again			"

												I really liked the idea of the game and it was really fun for me to work out the mechanics but there are some bugs in single player game. When my crystal gets destroyed game wont shut down and ı am stuck in the same floor and when a hero of mine tries to carry the crystal the monsters cant kill him and the game wont end. I am not sure if it is a bug but it is annoying because in order to start over again i need to abandon the game and the unlockable features of the game wont be saved please fix this or give me an explanation for this problem.

OverviewThis game works with a really nice concept, you are at a wrecked space ship and need to survive through some floors on each, taking care of monsters, characters and resources. You (if alone), can start the game with two characters, and while the game progresses you get the possibility to get up to four characters wich can be abbandoned mid-way. As for MP each person gets 1 starter.  The game is rogue-like so there's no save, everyone dies is game-over. No save estate nor last floor respawn, so you were warned. I should also say that this game is hard, really friggin' hard.Graphics - 8/10It's pixel-art-styled, it's simple but it deliver the job well, the monsters don't get repetitive, as there are a bunch of different ones(and some that are just a color change but ok).Gameplay, Music - 8.5/10The gameplay is really simple, so I found no problems with it, except of course some bugs and a bit of weird things on selecting each hero.Did not pay much attention to the music, the sound fx were high as hell and you just start paying too much attention to the game that you mostly ignore it.(Well played devs, well played)Multi-Player - 8.2/10There must be a separated part for this because:1- SP gets a little boring fast if you're not a big fan of this kind of game;2- It's really good as it had just a bit of lag during it;3- As for most of the games, MP makes it all better, if you have a friend that is, chatting on the console in the middle of a hord would be kinda tough.The VeredictThe game's really great and you should really give it a go, even if you need to wait for a sale. If you have a friend or 2 that also enjoy this kind of game than you shoud really buy it, you won't regret at all.A final score of 8 - Give the damn thing a try already!So many typos were made...

												The idea behind this game is really nice. Towerdefense, RPG and FTL-like tactics in a neat package. It just doesn't get it strictly right. And it's quite complicate and unintuitive to start with. Loads of info is thrown at the player without warning. The tutorial is a joke, especially for a game of this complexity.Due to the complexity it is even a worse time sink than a lot of rogue-likes. A playthrough takes several hours, my first longer game took 3.5 hours and i ""only"" made it to the 9th level of 12 or 14 on ""very easy"". After that the game ramped up the difficulty even more. I encountered a level that went down hard on my ♥♥♥, as door-opening monsters spawned, which freed all other monsters... There was nothing i could do for my crew but heal them until they got overrun.All in all for the price of 4 bucks it's a great game. Just be prepared that it's far more complex and time-consuming than FTL. I'm not sure it really needed that level of complexity. If you're looking for a more casual game, don't even glimpse at ""Dungeon of the Endless""!			"

												I don't remember what exactly prompted me to buy this, but I'm sure it had something to do with the $2.99 pricetag.I was lucky enough to have a couple of friends online that night who had played a couple hours of the game some time before. The 3 of us then spent the next 3 hours playing through one full round (12 levels). It was an absolute blast. I later tried playing by myself, and managed my way through on the second attempt. Even by myself I had fun running around the various floors defending my crystal. It should be noted that this game is infinitely more entertaining and playable with friends (voice chat will be a necessity). Parties of 2 or 4 people are best, but 3 works fine too. The graphics for this game are as they appear in the screenshots; if this artstyle suits you, you'll love the game. If it bothers you, picking another rougelike might be better for you. For me, I like the way it looks, and feel it works well with the genre. It sometimes makes clarity in gameplay a bit muddy, but rarely is it a serious problem. The soundtrack goes hand in hand with the artstyle, and is simplistic and electronic. Thus far I haven't been bored by it, but I'm sure I'll end up replacing the music with my own before too long. I give this game an 8/10. I've had it 3 days and spent a LOT of my free time on it already. I'm not normally a huge fan of rougelikes, but the way it integrates so well with the tower defence, resource management, and RPG elements makes it SUCH a blast. Singleplayer is fun, but multiplayer with friends is infinitely better. Snag it up while it's on sale, and it'll be worth so much more than the $3 that you spent on it.			"

												I purchased Dungeon of the Endless  bundled with its DLC. I am enjoying my time  playing this game and I think it's worth the money. Even if you're not a fan of tower defense games like myself, this game puts enough of a twist on the genre to make it interesting, fun, and addicting. The game's difficulty spikes seem to resemble that of a roller coaster, up and down. However, learning the mechanics of DOTE gives you a 1UP over this unpredictability.			"

Early Access Review
								Even after I bought this game, and invested a few hours into it, these previews inspire me to want to play it even more.  So if I had to sum up this review into 3 words, it would be this:  Buy this game.Luckily, I don't, so I won't!.... Maybe I shoulda saved that for the tl;dr.  And yes, there is a tl;dr, so scroll down if you hate words.So after like a 30 second little intro, which you can totally skip, you get thrown straight into the game.  Which is nice because when you die, restarting takes like 0(thats a zero) time at all.  And oh yes, there will be much death.Now normally, when you play a game, and you die a lot, you aren't usually having a lot of fun.  Well thats totally not the case in this game.  Although the game is still in early access, that means it might be 30% completed if we're lucky, it still manages to entertain.When you die, you start over, and you take what you learned and apply it to the new run.  In all honesty, I have only made it past the 5th floor once.  And... the 4th floor once....  And the 3rd floor twice... on the easiest game setting.   XDWhen you start the game you pick two heroes you want to take with you, considering right now you only have 3 to choose from, it's not that hard of a choice.  As you progress through the game you'll meet other heroes that can you hire with food, so try to keep a surplus at all times because you don't want to miss out on adding a massochistic marine, or a crazy short guy with a sword twice his size to your team.  I've only managed to unlock two characters so far personally.Other things you will run across are artifacts which for research points, you can add new modules to your list of goodies, or even upgrade existing ones.  Really awesome, hope to find these early on in a level.  In rare cases, you can even find two in the same level, which when that happens, is like winning the god damned lotto.And without further ado, lets get down to the nitty gritty of this review.The Good:  This is the most awesome sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game I have ever played.The So-So:  This is the only sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game I have ever played.The Bad:  It is not a *multiplayer* sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game.(yet)Lets expand on the Bad:  There is no multiplayer, there is no story, there is no tech tree, and thus is no substance.Lets expand on the So-So:  Mulstiplayer is grayed out, the tech tree is grayed out, the story has not been added, the substance does not exist yet.Lets expand on the Good:  There WILL be multi-player, there WILL be a story and quests, there WILL be a tech tree like thingy; and what does this add to this already awesome sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game?  The most badass thing I have bought in years, duh!All in all, even if you don't like sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl games(You sick of me saying this yet?  I'm not!), you'll still probably like this one.Oh, and incase you are wondering why I didn't review things like music, graphics, gameplay, or anything else like that, that normal people review, well lemme sum it up for you.Graphics:  It's pixelated.  What more do you expect?Music:  It's very ambiant, changes when things happen, all in all, not the best or the worst, though not sure how it could be better.Gameplay:  It's in Early Access, gameplay is subject to change.  Duh.So to sum it all up, for those of you who hate words, I present:The TL;DR: Buy this game.[Hint] I said it earlier in this review.Sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game!

The dev has frequent updates and from what I've seen during my time involved with the community, they are fairly open to feedback, which is always great! 10/10  The dungeons aren't Endless Though, the game can end.

								If I could think of a game like this, I would say FTL...Of the little time i've played, its pretty fun right now.Just, really, really random so its hard to expect anything.What you do is search a dungeon for the exit, protect your crystal, and bring it to the exit.The thing is, when you explore a room, a random event may occur, like npcs, shops, or enemy encounters.In order to protect ya crystal, you gotta power rooms up with the crystal's energy (Which can some get gained by fighting. In rooms you farm resources, set up defenses, etc.But the ""Time"" based method in generating things and researching is by the doors you open.So once you open all of the doors, your somewhat dead and have to wait for waves of enemies to spawn.Also when your carrying your crystal, the rooms you have powered turn off slowly.But, if any doubt, try FTL. The game play is pretty similar.Overall, Great game, that needs more developement but is great at this state for tactical-ish turn based stuffz			"

								With out a doubt one of the best games that I purchased this year.  It's a rogue-like and it can be hard and unforgiving at time but that makes it all the more sadistically fun.  The RPG elements including character leveling, equipment, and individual abilities unique to each hero, mesh well and ensures multiple playthroughs which can be very unique depending on which heros the player is using.  As your heros open doors of the dungeon they accumulate resouces which are used to build offencive and defensive turrets in rooms,  power rooms and constructed turrets or generators in rooms,  to level characters and to purchase turret and character upgrades and equipment.   The combination of managing all these elements might first sound complex  but the game does a great job at intragating all the features togather well in a way that makes sense and also makes you think tactically the further you get in the dungeon.    Though the game is stll in development  it  has been updated regularly in the six or so months that I have owned it and alot of new content has been added.  At my last playthrough there were eight levels to the dungeon implemented and over ten heros (though I have only unlocked 5 or so) with more being planned as the game is updated and gets closer to offical release.

								The core ideas behind Dungeon of the Endless are on the right track and the promise of content to come should turn this into a masterpiece.The curent look and feel of this alpha indicate a high level of care in the game's development - this is a surprisngly polished release and is very much playable (and re-playable). What I really liked:- The graphics are great (and I'm not a pixel graphics fanboy) - The dungeon generation has been unique and fairly unpredictable each time I re-rolled.- The heroes are well individualized and you need to adapt your strategy to accomodate their strenghts and weaknesses.- The gameplay can be challenging and unforgiving however it doesn't feel frustrating.- I haven't come accross any obvious 'spam this item to win' holes.- The 'chance' factor works really well with what the game tries to achieve and it forces you to re-think your strategy.- There's no redundant micromanagement of heroes.- No redundant micropositioning of turrets either.- Mobs aren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.- No game-crippling bugs that I have encountered (and for an alpha this fresh, that's really surprising)- Game has potential to become virtually endless in terms of replayability (assuming things go well dev wise).What I didn't really like:- Some turrets aren't really useful enough, or rather can be happily ignored throughout the entire game without you missing their utility. I'm referring specifically to the turrets that grant hero bonuses to armor, strength, or heal the hero.- When the world becomes larger it can get quite tedious to manage heroes on oposite sides of the map. Perhaps a minimap might be useful.- Switching between heroes can get a bit wonky and it's not always terribly obvious which one you're controling.- The 'you found the door, there it is!!!!!' pointers are insanely annoying. The obvious:- Currently not a whole lot of content is available - early alpha.- Game won't be for everyone and you might hate it.All in all, I really like this game and hope it manages to accomplish what it set out to do without needing to get dumbed down or glittered up.

								This game is in my opinion very hard. And sometimes very frustrating.Goal is pretty simple in theory. You open doors, get ressources for every door opened. You find exit, take crystal to exit. Monsters try to kill you, especially when you try to take the crystal with you.To help you, you can Upgrade rooms with ressource Harvesters, or defensive stuff.You have a team of up to 4 players, starting with 2. If you loose one he is completly gone. This was a reason for me to start over again sometimes (except these times I could recruit another one right away). Loosing Teammates, nevertheless is REALLY painful, since you can level them up.Losing them, means your ressource you spend on leveling up, are gone. And ressources are rare. especially later in the game.Maybe a a lot of stuff changes till release, but so far I like it. Even though it is so hard and frustrating sometimes :D			"

								Even in its current limited state, the core gameplay here is fantastic. I've already got my $10 worth out of this game, can't wait to see what it's like when it's complete.This isn't an action-heavy TD click-fest, and you won't be controlling your party of heroes in combat directly— you move them to a room and they auto-attack. Most of the strategy comes from deciding which order to open rooms, which rooms to keep powered to prevent spawns, and funneling everything else through deadly fortified chokepoints of doom. Once you've got that strategy down, you'll consistently beat the 3 levels on offer in the alpha.That being said, it is challenging, and I'm rally looking forward to later levels and added events that force tougher decisions. I think this game is going to come together nicely.			"

								I picked up this game when it was back in Early Alpha, and at the time it felt a bit feature-scant. However, they have since gone into Beta, and I can safely say that this is worth every cent.DotE is best summarized as a mix between a roguelike, turn-based strategy game, and a sort of tower defense. Your goal is to open doors in the dungeon so that you can find the exit and then you have to carry your power source (a crystal) to that exit without it getting destroyed by the various monsters that inhabit the dungeon. The learning curve is a bit steep at first, but once you figure out how everything works, this game becomes incredibly fun.There are some drawbacks, such as the technical glitches, occasional crashes (at least for me), and some balance issues, but the devs are highly involved in the community and are taking steps to actively address these issues - more than I can say for other Early Access games.You can find yourself sinking a lot of time into this game if you take the time to enjoy it. I highly recommend it.			"

								Mandatory usage of obvious terms like ""roguelike"" and ""tower defense"". What really makes this game fantastic (considering its current alpha-state) is the feeling of stepping into the unknown, the fact that opening any door is a risk to your heroes. This game makes you think and rethink your set up before making a potentially disastrous move. The RPG aspect is a blast too. Levelling up, buying rad new items and unlocking new skills for your heroes is great.The potential for this game is massive and I can't wait to see what it becomes.

												I don't want to sound like I'm exaggerating and I don't want to repeat too much of what everyone else has said... but this game is amazing.I could play this game until I died of starvation. This game is fun. It is relatively casual (except for how addictive it is), it is challenging, it is basically built to be replayed constantly, it is relatively simple yet surprisingly complex, it has multiplayer that doesn't take away from the experience and lets you have fun with friends, the music is what I would consider the upper echelon of music in games.I'm not a homer for this game, I bought it because it was in a bundle with Endless Space and Endless Legend that was reasonably priced and had no real intention of playing it. I knew nothing about it and have 0 stake in giving it a glowing rating but it is honestly just so immensely fun.If you have any interest in roguelikes I cannot recommend this game highly enough.Only complaint - Let players trade items in multiplayer!

												i played this for a while it was free for like 2 days left so i tryed it out LOVED IT but then after the 2 days i couldnt  play anymore and it turned out i had to buy it i love this game so i checked the price IT COSTS ALOT OF MONEY but we cant have everything for free so i rate this game pretty good 9.2 out of 10 there is this one game breaking glitch where around one of the final levels you can no longer move but i think they fixed it and love the game little hard but all games need challenges tip- EASY EQUALS HARD MODE TOO EASY EQUALS NORMAL MODE so yes i suggest you buy the game but i hope they lower the price down to atleast 8.99 or 9.49 would be a good cost for it i love this game alot please support it so this can expand its reaches even further also the lvling up system is pretty good you can lvl up automaticly by spending food there are few other resources other then food like industry science and dust they all have different uses unlike other games in this genre it will always surprise you with something new like maybe a room of monsters or a chest a another survivor tip- IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH FOOD IN MULTIPLAYER AND FIND A SURVIVOR KEEP EM ALIVE SO IF YOU DIE THEY CAN BE USED LIKE A EXTRA LIFE SO YOU WONT HAVE TO QUIT or a merchant and a few other things. everytime you open a new door it kinda counts as a new turn you get more resources (EXCEPT DUST YOU GET DUST FROM KILLING ENEMIES) and then getting to the exit is a stressful thing if there are unlit rooms they will flood out enemies tip-USE THE FASTEST PERSON YOU HAVE TO GET THE CYRSTAL YOU START WITH OR YOU WILL MOST LIKELY DIE so good luck on your journey and have a nice day			"

Dungeon of the Endless Quick Intro 
A Video of Dungeon of the Endless
By: Lauren

			First video! This is for my dad to see if he's interested in playing Dungeon of the Endless. I didn't realize I look so bored while playing games, but I swear it's super fun!		


You control up to 4 heroes with different skillsets that you can level up and equip with items you find in chests or from merchants. The goal is to find the elevator exit for each randomly generated floor, then grab your crystal and high tail it to the exit before the horde of aliens murder you.There's also a tower defense and resource management aspect to the game. You can plop down some mini turrets that either damage/debuff enemies, or buff your heroes. Opening a door to a different room is considered a turn, which grants you more resources, but also has a chance to spawn waves of enemies.There's a lot more to the game, but I recommend not looking at any guides since most of the fun comes from honing your strategy (dying over and over again) and finding out which playstyle works for you!Con:I would hold off on multiplayer until a save function is implemented. It looks like the developers are really responsive to the community, so it shouldn't be long =]. In the meantime, have fun in single player, still definitely worth the money.			"

Early Access Review
								If you are on the fence between buying this game, hopefully this will help. Dungeon of the Endless is currently in ALPHA, which means it isn't a full-release game yet. You're buying into a game that isn't finished, so know what you're buying before you go rage on the forums that it was a rip-off. Now into what I saw in the game: You start off with 2 randomized heroes, with their own stats and appearance. You'll begin the game by getting as much resources as you can while trying to find the exit of the dungeon. Every door you open has a risk/reward to it,  where you could find anything from a Hero/Merchant/Food Surplus/Industry Surplus/Treasure. If you don't find those, you'll meet the baddies who have different agendas. Some might rush to your crystal in hopes of destroying it, and others will just try to pummel your hero or devices in your previously explored rooms. Now it might seem like a simple task to just go room to room and find the exit, but you're also looking at waves of monsters spawning and trying to take everything out. The second you pick up that crystal, you've got a limited amount of time before the little baddies overtake your defences, so it then becomes a mad dash! You can level up your heroes, equipt them with items to make them stronger, you can heal them using the food you've acquired, or you can have them manage your food/industry systems. The more resources you get, the better modules you will be able to build if you find the right blueprints. Overall the game is a difficult arcade tower-defence mixed with action rpg elements, and a single run through of the alpha took me an hour, becuase i took the time to adventure into every single room. It's a fun game.			"

												This is how I start off 2015, by staying up ALL night, only to fail on the 10 level.  This game is hard, unexpected and ultimately it is food for the brain.Update #1:   18 hours into the game, straight up addicted, should be doing portfolio work; but this game saps the life from me in all the right places.

												I've read through the reviews, and all the people that have reviewed it negatively are just butthurt that it's incredibly difficult and they can't beat it. I won't lie, you probably won't be able to beat it. I've never even beaten a playthrough and it's still one of my favorite games of all time. If you're up for a challenge play this, if not you can always play something more casual.			"

												I don't remember what exactly prompted me to buy this, but I'm sure it had something to do with the $2.99 pricetag.I was lucky enough to have a couple of friends online that night who had played a couple hours of the game some time before. The 3 of us then spent the next 3 hours playing through one full round (12 levels). It was an absolute blast. I later tried playing by myself, and managed my way through on the second attempt. Even by myself I had fun running around the various floors defending my crystal. It should be noted that this game is infinitely more entertaining and playable with friends (voice chat will be a necessity). Parties of 2 or 4 people are best, but 3 works fine too. The graphics for this game are as they appear in the screenshots; if this artstyle suits you, you'll love the game. If it bothers you, picking another rougelike might be better for you. For me, I like the way it looks, and feel it works well with the genre. It sometimes makes clarity in gameplay a bit muddy, but rarely is it a serious problem. The soundtrack goes hand in hand with the artstyle, and is simplistic and electronic. Thus far I haven't been bored by it, but I'm sure I'll end up replacing the music with my own before too long. I give this game an 8/10. I've had it 3 days and spent a LOT of my free time on it already. I'm not normally a huge fan of rougelikes, but the way it integrates so well with the tower defence, resource management, and RPG elements makes it SUCH a blast. Singleplayer is fun, but multiplayer with friends is infinitely better. Snag it up while it's on sale, and it'll be worth so much more than the $3 that you spent on it.			"

								 Great game, so many different elements that make many genres great on their own all blended into a beautiful pixel smoothie.The game is obviously early access, and there are some difficulty issues, do not let the difficulties of TOO EASY and EASY fool you. It's more like ""HARD MODE"" and ""LOL GL"".    The dev has frequent updates and from what I've seen during my time involved with the community, they are fairly open to feedback, which is always great! 10/10  The dungeons aren't Endless Though, the game can end. So 5/10 for false advertisement.			"

												When I first tried to play this game, I didn't like it. It seemed too complicated and I didn't understand what I was supposed to be doing. I let it sit for a while and then came back to it, and ended up loving it. Once you get the hang of the controls and a feel for how things work, it's a super fun and addicting game. The variety of characters to choose from and unlock and the range of ships you can play through all create different challenges that give it a lot of replayability. The characters are cool, the environment is cool, the music is good, the ambient sounds are creepy (but good). A solid game, would definitely recommend.			"

												Very well made game, and quite fun. Graphics and sound are nice. Gameplay is almost perfect. However, it does have two issues that are difficult to ignore. Its well worth the money, so be sure to pick it up.Here are the two things that bother me....1)  Very low item count for a roguelike. There are enough items to get by, but it feels like there should be more. Part of a roguelike game is hoping you do get what you are looking for. I've finished the game three times so far, and it just seems like it should have around double the items so there is more of a variety.2)  Mob crowding. Especially late game. It really does turn into a fuster cluck to the point where you can't see the fighting. Even early on, when you enter a room, your heros get clumped together. I would rather see a triple powered mob then 3 smashed together. Sometimes it feels like 50 are crammed into a doorway. You can hardly tell what or how many are dieing.Thanks for a fun game. "

Early Access Review
								Even after I bought this game, and invested a few hours into it, these previews inspire me to want to play it even more.  So if I had to sum up this review into 3 words, it would be this:  Buy this game.Luckily, I don't, so I won't!.... Maybe I shoulda saved that for the tl;dr.  And yes, there is a tl;dr, so scroll down if you hate words.So after like a 30 second little intro, which you can totally skip, you get thrown straight into the game.  Which is nice because when you die, restarting takes like 0(thats a zero) time at all.  And oh yes, there will be much death.Now normally, when you play a game, and you die a lot, you aren't usually having a lot of fun.  Well thats totally not the case in this game.  Although the game is still in early access, that means it might be 30% completed if we're lucky, it still manages to entertain.When you die, you start over, and you take what you learned and apply it to the new run.  In all honesty, I have only made it past the 5th floor once.  And... the 4th floor once....  And the 3rd floor twice... on the easiest game setting.   XDWhen you start the game you pick two heroes you want to take with you, considering right now you only have 3 to choose from, it's not that hard of a choice.  As you progress through the game you'll meet other heroes that can you hire with food, so try to keep a surplus at all times because you don't want to miss out on adding a massochistic marine, or a crazy short guy with a sword twice his size to your team.  I've only managed to unlock two characters so far personally.Other things you will run across are artifacts which for research points, you can add new modules to your list of goodies, or even upgrade existing ones.  Really awesome, hope to find these early on in a level.  In rare cases, you can even find two in the same level, which when that happens, is like winning the god damned lotto.And without further ado, lets get down to the nitty gritty of this review.The Good:  This is the most awesome sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game I have ever played.The So-So:  This is the only sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game I have ever played.The Bad:  It is not a *multiplayer* sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game.(yet)Lets expand on the Bad:  There is no multiplayer, there is no story, there is no tech tree, and thus is no substance.Lets expand on the So-So:  Mulstiplayer is grayed out, the tech tree is grayed out, the story has not been added, the substance does not exist yet.Lets expand on the Good:  There WILL be multi-player, there WILL be a story and quests, there WILL be a tech tree like thingy; and what does this add to this already awesome sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game?  The most badass thing I have bought in years, duh!All in all, even if you don't like sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl games(You sick of me saying this yet?  I'm not!), you'll still probably like this one.Oh, and incase you are wondering why I didn't review things like music, graphics, gameplay, or anything else like that, that normal people review, well lemme sum it up for you.Graphics:  It's pixelated.  What more do you expect?Music:  It's very ambiant, changes when things happen, all in all, not the best or the worst, though not sure how it could be better.Gameplay:  It's in Early Access, gameplay is subject to change.  Duh.So to sum it all up, for those of you who hate words, I present:The TL;DR: Buy this game.[Hint] I said it earlier in this review.Sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game! ( because I couldn't think of a better way to end this review!)			"

Early Access Review
								The core ideas behind Dungeon of the Endless are on the right track and the promise of content to come should turn this into a masterpiece.The curent look and feel of this alpha indicate a high level of care in the game's development - this is a surprisngly polished release and is very much playable (and re-playable). What I really liked:- The graphics are great (and I'm not a pixel graphics fanboy) - The dungeon generation has been unique and fairly unpredictable each time I re-rolled.- The heroes are well individualized and you need to adapt your strategy to accomodate their strenghts and weaknesses.- The gameplay can be challenging and unforgiving however it doesn't feel frustrating.- I haven't come accross any obvious 'spam this item to win' holes.- The 'chance' factor works really well with what the game tries to achieve and it forces you to re-think your strategy.- There's no redundant micromanagement of heroes.- No redundant micropositioning of turrets either.- Mobs aren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.- No game-crippling bugs that I have encountered (and for an alpha this fresh, that's really surprising)- Game has potential to become virtually endless in terms of replayability (assuming things go well dev wise).What I didn't really like:- Some turrets aren't really useful enough, or rather can be happily ignored throughout the entire game without you missing their utility. I'm referring specifically to the turrets that grant hero bonuses to armor, strength, or heal the hero.- When the world becomes larger it can get quite tedious to manage heroes on oposite sides of the map. Perhaps a minimap might be useful.- Switching between heroes can get a bit wonky and it's not always terribly obvious which one you're controling.- The 'you found the door, there it is!!!!!' pointers are insanely annoying. The obvious:- Currently not a whole lot of content is available - early alpha.- Game won't be for everyone and you might hate it.All in all, I really like this game and hope it manages to accomplish what it set out to do without needing to get dumbed down or glittered up.

								This game is very simple in its design but is incredibly well thought out in its execution. Randomly generated dungeons, resource management, multiple player characters, there is an incredible amount of depth and tactical feel to this game. The graphics and soundtrack make for a rather nostalgic feel instead of being outdated or lacking in their preformance they throw us back to old school titles that we used to know and love. This game feels like the developers are taking their time slowly but surely perfecting it, a nice change of pace from the games of today. Indie developers seem to have what big game companies have lost they are putting their heart and souls into this project and it shows Dungeon is an incredible game even in its alpha stages it has amazing potential. Those of you who bought the founders packs or might have helped kickstart it i feel like your faith will not go unrewarded. I only hope that future versions of the game might include harder difficulties, and maybe some lines of dialouge between heroes nothing voiced mind you but a few texts expressing the characters state of mind feelings towards one another or just jokes or comments about the dungeons themselves would be interesting, expanding the lore might also be cool finding codexes or data logs strewn about that contain information on the creatures crew ship and planet would be a fun treat for people who love to immerse themselves into the game. Though changes like that would be nice the game already offers so much in its alpha stage that i only imagine the completed product will be nothing less than amazing I give the alpha version of this game a 9/10 and I would say that this is my most anticapated title pending release and i absolutley can't wait for the final version I recomend anyone who reads this grab the founders pack as soon as possible you will not be dissapointed.

Early Access Review
								After crashing on an unknown planet, Nurse Deena Ratchet and genetically engineered warrior Hikensha began working their way through the ship to hope for an escape. Along the way they recruited a young burglar named Golgy Phurtiver who, incidentally, thinks she's a spider of some sort. Things were going relatively well - Nurse Ratchet discovered a woman in stasis, who was revealed to be a bounty hunter named Sara Numas. They did not know that they were effectively recruiting Hikensha's replacement, however, who died tried to defend another survivor from the alien natives. The party marched upwards, exploring for every resource they could. Another survivor was revived from stasis, but the mercenary (who dubbed himself ""Butcher"") was eviscerated by what can only presumed to be giant mutant slugs when making casual conversation with a merchant. The three survivors, Deena, Golgy and Sara saved the merchant from the rampaging aliens, and quickly cleaned him out of his wares in exchange for the Dust they were using to power their various defenses, just before they moved on up to a new level of what was beginning to feel like a dungeon. For real though, Dungeon of the Endless does a lot of things right for a... roguelike, resource management 4X, RPG, platypus of a game. And as they're apparently working on multiplayer, I could see this becoming a Thing.			"

								Here's my elevator pitch for Dungeon of Endless:""It's a rogue-like, tower defense game with Left 4 Dead finales thrown in.""And it truly is an amagame of these things. It's like an rogue-like RPG in that you're exploring a randomly-generated dungeon and dealing with the enemies and other things you encounter there.The tower-defense element pulls heavily from real-time strategy and role-playing elements. There's a pretty meaty three-resource system that you engage. You build machines to generate more of the resources then use those resources to build all kinds of offensive and defensive weapons or to level up your heroes (each with their own unqiue attributes, powers and weapons to equip). Every time you open a door in the dungeon your machines produce the goods. There's also a chance of enemy waves spawning -- that's where the tower defense comes in. You need to build defenses to prevent them from running roughshod over your stuff (and eventually destroying your precious energy crystal). Smart, strategic exploration plays a big role here, creating choke points and making sure that enemies don't swarm you all at once is key to survival.Once you find the exit to the dungeon floor there's a final event where you must manually carry your power crystal from the start of the dungeon to the exit -- all the while fending off enemy's. That's where the Left 4 Dead allusion comes into play. These final runs can go horribly if you haven't powered and defended the path. Since I've been playing there's been constant adjustment to the economy and difficulty of the game -- this is the kind of fine tuning you want from a game that's in Alpha. But throughout I've had fun playing the game. Even when the tuning made the game insanely hard. Even when the game is broken Dungeon of Endless is fun.			"

												TL;DR || The game is a fun mix of dungeon crawling RPG and tower defense. Perma-death, random dungeon layouts, and a good selection of characters add to the replay value. Multiple heroes to unlock. Level 'em up. Gear 'em up. Meet new heroes while in the dungeon and have them join your party. Find ancient treasure. Research new tech. Die, lose it all, and happily start over again. The devs are a pretty swell bunch too!!!I think the art style is fantastic, and the same can be said for the sound design and soundtrack. The gameplay is quite fluid with a nice interface and can also be quite challenging with a good bit a strategy mixed in. Clear the dungeon room by room using your heroes, while setting up defenses to protect your ship's power core. Once you find the floor's exit, defend one of your heroes as he slowly carries the core to the elevator. You can power up rooms to prevent enemies from spawning in them and use that power to set up turrets and resource nodes; this helps you create a defensible path to the elevator, because once you touch that core, they don't stop coming.The developers are worth mentioning too. AMPLITUDE is hands down one of my favorite studios. They put out quality products and continue to provide support for their games beyond their initial release.If you'd like to see a bit of gameplay:

								I been playing for many hours and i have noticed 2 glitches sense i been playing! 1! there seems to be a glitch when you pick up the orb...your heros who don't have the orb will poop out and barely move! if you put the non-orb carrier's outside the exit your screwed because the enemys might end up going +20 on your heros killing them because the orb glitches them out! or 2! the monsters glitch out SOOO badly they get stuck in their room meaning...if the room with a box has mobs...all you got to do is run in shoot the mobs and take the box -.- the orb needs a massive fix because this becomes an issue in the long run because you will break your heros into 2 groups...scouts and tanks...or other words...path breakers and door openers and i noticed the only classes of heros that matter are the ones with guns because they don't die so easyly and you never need a melee person because theres 2 HEAVY's in the game that do massive jobs in protecting the orb at all casts you will notice them right off the bat...1 looks like sammy from metroid the  other looks like rambo in a way cuz his shirtless and carrys a shotgun them are the only heros i start out as and they never die and by never i mean never if well managed it seems only the gun heros are the only people who are good at protecting paths to the orb(so you know orb=crystal) there needs to be a balance between the melee and the guns because i find the melee classed heros useless i never recruite them unless i want to unlock them and i noticed theres nothing telling you how to play the game like i didn't know art's were used to give you turrets and upgrades of your 4 support slots i went thru 2 WHOLE games without knowing i even noticed there were no use of using the gear bonus one cuz all i ever needed was FOOD nothing else really did much food helped me recruite food helped me heal food helped me level up nothing else mattered cuz it would be a waste so there are many bonuses and disbonuses to the game it needs alot of twinking before i think it be perfect and i REALLY want to play multiplayer! but all in all i recommend this!

								If I could think of a game like this, I would say FTL...Of the little time i've played, its pretty fun right now.Just, really, really random so its hard to expect anything.What you do is search a dungeon for the exit, protect your crystal, and bring it to the exit.The thing is, when you explore a room, a random event may occur, like npcs, shops, or enemy encounters.In order to protect ya crystal, you gotta power rooms up with the crystal's energy (Which can some get gained by fighting. In rooms you farm resources, set up defenses, etc.But the ""Time"" based method in generating things and researching is by the doors you open.So once you open all of the doors, your somewhat dead and have to wait for waves of enemies to spawn.Also when your carrying your crystal, the rooms you have powered turn off slowly.But, if any doubt, try FTL. The game play is pretty similar.Overall, Great game, that needs more developement but is great at this state for tactical-ish turn based stuffz			"

								So I grabbed a copy of this because I loved Endless Space, am loving Endless Legend and thought Amplitude is a pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awesome developer. This game proves everyting I thought about Amplitude right. I got home and knew I had to go to sleep but wanted to take Dungeon of the Endless for a quick test drive. I told myself, It's 2:40, 20 minutes and I'll go lay down at 3. I opened it up and was facinated. Its a frakking amazing game. I love the progression. I can see the rough edges, I mean its in alpha so its expected, But I'm really excited for this game. I finally closed it believing that it was a latest 3:15 or so and noticed it was 4 am. This game is captivating. I can't wait untill I have a few hours to really sit down and have a go at it. It's so ♥♥♥♥ing good that I didn't even wait until after I slept some to write a review.- Skiiwolf			"

								If I didn't know this game was early access, I would hardly be able to tell.  This game is already amazing, with both replay value and some decent strategy/tower defense/RPG aspects woven together into a harmonious whole.  What's even better is that the creators are using player feedback on their already polished product to improve it further with every update unlike other games that push half-finished builds out and expect constructive feedback from their buggy product.  This game has restored my faith in the concept of Early Access, and I highly reccommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon of the Endless is an interesting new title by Amplitude Studios currently in Alpha development which spans several popular genres.For my full featured review with pictures and videos coming soon please visit http://progamereviews.com/review/dungeon-endless/You begin Dungeon of the Endless with two hero characters and a crystal in a small escape pod. The basic premise of the game is to explore each dungeon and find the exit. Each dungeon is comprised of interconnected randomly generated rooms. Many of these rooms contain mobs of monsters that attempt to end your game by either killing your heroes or your crystal. As you explore the dungeon's rooms you acquire resources and have the ability use these resources to deploy defenses. Game play is actually a hybrid of real time and turn based strategy in that you have the ability to pause live game play and issue commands if you so desire. The game can also be played in real time mode exclusively. Once the exit is located, your job is to transport the crystal safely there. If you make it you win the round and move on to the next level. If your heroes die, you lose. If your crystal’s dust level (essentially health, power and currency all in one) falls to zero, you lose. Piece of cake right? WRONG.Dungeon of the Endless has a lot of things going on. At its heart, it is a rouge like (hate that term) dungeon crawler. You explore a procedurally generated environment with a small group of  playable heroes. What that means is this: the dungeons and encounters are never exactly the same. Sure you’ll see similarities, but by and large the environments will never be exactly alike. Additionally, your band of motley heroes isn’t invincible. Once they die, they’re dead… FOREVER. Kiss all that experience and loot goodbye! Rogue like game play; check.So what else does the game offer? How about some resource management? In Dungeon of the Endless your success or failure is largely linked to your resource acquisition and management. There are four main resources to worry about: Dust (no you can't snort it), Industry, Food and Science. Every time you open a room you receive an amount of each resource except dust. Additionally, you can deploy resource modules in powered rooms (more on that later) that add a modifier to the amount of a particular resources obtained when subsequent doors are opened. For example, an Industry module will provide additional industry every time you open a new door. Heroes with the required skill can even operate the module and provide an additional, additional bonus to the resources. Phew, that sounds complicated. Of note here is that extra resources, except dust, are carried over to the next dungeon.Dungeon of the Endless also has Role Playing and Character Progression aspects. Even though the game features permadeath you have the ability to level up your hero's and outfit them with gear discovered in dungeons. Your heroes have stats which increase as their levels increase. In addition, as you level up your heroes they gain access to special combat skills.But wait, there's more...Dungeon of the Endless also offers tower defense like game play. As you explore each dungeon level you ""open up"" additional parts of the map. Each new room traversed is dark, which means it is currently not powered. These darkened rooms serve as spawn points for mobs of monsters which attack in waves and make a beeline toward your crystal. How do you stop these waves of monsters you ask? Well, you power some of these dark rooms with part of your limited supply of dust. Once powered, you then use your Industry resource to build defenses. As waves of enemies appear, your smartly placed defenses and heroes take them out. Sounds kinda tower defense like huh.One of Amplitude Studios goals is community involvement. Amplitude wants the players to take an active part in the game's development and it is facilitating this by utilizing a system called GAMES2GETHER . One of the biggest reasons to play an early access game is to participate in the evolution of a game. Plenty of Steam early access games claim to use player feedback to help shape the final product into what the community wants... and then promptly don't. Amplitude appears to actually be following through with it. By utilizing it's G2G Votes system, the community has the ability to vote on art and game design decisions. For example, the current vote is for creating a new playable character. There is also a standard forum where players can follow the games development and post their questions and comments. The jury is still out on how much the community will drive development however so we'll have to monitor the process and see how it goes.Like every other game out there, Dungeon of the Endless is not perfect. I'll cover what I feel are weak points for the game first. The game needs a lot more explanation. This is a reasonably complex game and the current tutorial slides just don't cut it. I found myself with more questions than answers after the tutorial and had to stumble into them myself. A proper tutorial level guiding the player through the games nuisances would help to acclimate players better. As this is just the alpha stage, i'm sure the developers will address this in the near future. The graphics are basic. Again, this is by design but worth noting anyway.Another issue is repetitiveness. Although the levels are procedurally generated they all look and feel essentially the same. This in addition to the fact that the basic game play remains the same can make the game feel a bit tedious after a while.  Is there an end to the game or is it truly endless? I don't actually know the answer to that question. But if the game had milestones or varied locations to make you feel like your progressing it might help. Its worth noting that in general I usually don't play rogue like games specifically for this reason. As an old school RPG and MMORPG player, I tend to become attached to my characters and devote a good amount of time carefully picking their skills and equipment. The permadeath aspect of these games is a turn off for me. I like to feel that i'm making progress towards a larger goal and I just didn't feel it with this game.All that being said, I still really like the game. Dungeon of the Endless is a fun and reasonably deep game. What's most impressive is the games complexity despite its current Alpha state. There's enough depth and strategy here already to keep you playing the game and checking back to see how it evolves. Also, at this point in my life, I tend to be gravitating towards games that i can play in small chunks. Dungeon of the Endless gives players the ability to save and pause games at any time. If your a new parent like me, trying to juggle work, parenthood, and everything else life throws at you, this is HUGE. For the price of entry, Dungeon of the Endless is definitely forth a look.			"

												I can honestly say I have never quite played a game quite like this before.  It is part turn-based sci-fi dungeon crawler, part tower defense, along with its own aspects.  Procedural generation ensures a fresh game every time and as many have said, the game is VERY unforgiving.  Despite dying repeatedly initially, the game still kept my interest, if for no other reason that it IS so unique. Now that I have recently have had time to spend some time getting more involved with the game, I find it quite engrossing.  I own several other ""Endless"" titles and this one is very different and unique, but equally as well made.  I highly recommend this game, particularly to fans of strategy.			"

								   What AMPLITUDE has here are most definitely the makings of a superb game.  The progression of opening doors to begin waves and shape the enemies' overall path is the perfect way to marriage the Tower Defense and Roguelike geres.  ""What you'll find behind the door"" is just random enough that you can experience ""garbage runs"", but it's balanced enough that a run is never doomed before it begins.   Risk and reward are balanced very well, too, often in the form of continuous decision making on the player's part: ""Do I hunker down in this position, or do I spread out my defenses to guard more resource production?"" ""Do I pay Dust (resource that lasts only one floor) to a Merchant for items, possibly overextend my resources until I'm done with the floor (and Dust is less precious) or play it safe and make sure I can live to see the next level?""   There may only be three floors to the game as of now, but Dungeon of the Endless is already worth the price of admission if you're a fan of the genres.  And I have no doubt it will only get better from here.			"

Balancing which rooms to power up and strategically covering both your expansion and the thrilling final escape to the elevator with your crystal. Upgrade tree is great branching out to offer different weapons, buffs for heroes and upgrades. Can certainly be frustrating when you've explored an entire floor and you've missed a few rooms and get rolled by strong monsters but that's the name of the game with roguelikes right? Learn through dying. Haven't played the multiplayer yet but really looking forward to see how that changes the dynamic.			"

								One more door. Just one more door.I am not a huge fan of tower defense games, but this little rogue-like has me hooked. Beyond the simple build-and-defend mechanic at the heart of every TD, DotE adds a compelling risk-reward element in the choice between doubling down and heading to the exit with the resources you've collected, or opening one more door in hopes of finding treasure or an ally at the risk of multiple waves of enemies threatening to destroy everything you have built. Striking that balance is key to your survival.Dungeon of the Endless is still in its early stages, but this little monster has a lot of potential. More items, more enemies, more levels, more non-combat encounters, story elements, heroic side quests, and party management mechanics are sure to come, but I would love to see competing parties of survivors taking resources (multiplayer plix?), the ability to relock doors (albeit either as limited use item or heroic ability), and different environments (with more incredible music added to what is already a killer soundtrack).I cannot wait to see how this game develops. I am officially pumped.			"

								Comparing this to other early access games i have participated in, This is by far THE most devloped and amazing game ever to be introduced early to steam. It brings back those cool graphics which I had the joys of growing up with as a kid. and gives it this Dark Souls II level of difficulty which I both hate and enjoy at the same time (its a love hate thing). But it combines simple elements of tower defence alongside exploration and your regular RPG character development and items etc whilst slamming it with some very interestingly fun and clever mechanics. As much as I hate this game for never letting me get passed the 8th floor : P I know it is commendable in the way that in no way should you ever feel you have control of the situation.Simply, 10/10FYI: if you have a short temper I recommend not getting this game especially if you have been known to break controllers over Dark Souls XD			"

												A fantastic combination of tower defense with rpg and randomized elements. Each new pod you unlock changes the feel and play of the game to a great degree, making multiple playthroughs worthwhile, challenging and fun. Highly recommended.There is a definite learning curve, and it can take a few hours to get yourself going in a groove to get the feel for each unique escape pod's rules for success. The tutorial is lacking, but the guides aren't. If you're up for a challenge and the twoer defense and rogue like aspects are interesting to you, grab this. BE WARNED: the rogue-like aspects can mean you hit a floor you will need to play perfectly to beat, and you can lose a lot of progress for making a bad gamble. [and to some degree, the game can bone you with a punishing floor and there isn't much you can do if you get no dust (a type of currency) for like 9 rooms straight].			"

												If you like FTL you'll like this game.  It has elements of a lot of different types of games:  4x, Rogue-like, Tower Defense, etc.    The goal is to escape the dungeon floor by floor.    Each floor starts the same way, you and a power source.    You need to explore until you find the exit.   Then you need to plan a way to move the power source to the exit.   Moving said power source spawns a neverending slew of monsters.   Monsters spawn from unpowered areas so you can set up an escape route.   All the while you need to balance leveling your team (Food), researching modules (Science) and building defenses or resource generating modules.   I'm 0 for 7 on ""Too Easy"" so expect a challenge.

												Insanely fun and challenging take on rogue likes. Tower defense elements are fun and challenging. Balancing which rooms to power up and strategically covering both your expansion and the thrilling final escape to the elevator with your crystal. Upgrade tree is great branching out to offer different weapons, buffs for heroes and upgrades. Can certainly be frustrating when you've explored an entire floor and you've missed a few rooms and get rolled by strong monsters but that's the name of the game with roguelikes right? Learn through dying. Haven't played the multiplayer yet but really looking forward to see how that changes the dynamic.			"

								Okay, so, this is early alpha.There are 3 levels of slightly frustrating real-time roguelike based around a squad, rooms, and basically defending your position while simultaneously trying to explore.It's decent as it is, but it's status as an alpha access game shows. It's like an underwear model without their underwear, I like what I see, but you just know something is missing. :VI'm eager to see how this develops.			"

								One more door. Just one more door.I am not a huge fan of tower defense games, but this little rogue-like has me hooked. Beyond the simple build-and-defend mechanic at the heart of every TD, DotE adds a compelling risk-reward element in the choice between doubling down and heading to the exit with the resources you've collected, or opening one more door in hopes of finding treasure or an ally at the risk of multiple waves of enemies threatening to destroy everything you have built. Striking that balance is key to your survival.Dungeon of the Endless is still in its early stages, but this little monster has a lot of potential. More items, more enemies, more levels, more non-combat encounters, story elements, heroic side quests, and party management mechanics are sure to come, but I would love to see competing parties of survivors taking resources (multiplayer plix?), the ability to relock doors (albeit either as limited use item or heroic ability), and different environments (with more incredible music added to what is already a killer soundtrack).I cannot wait to see how this game develops. I am officially pumped.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is very hard to define in today standard of games.The best way I found to define it is that it has an old-school soul: the art is great, the music is extremely fitting and the gameplay extremely innovative.That being said, the game still has its down points, unbalance is one of them. (watch out for those jumping fat men, URGH I HATE THOSE GUYS *rage quits*)Only being recently released as a 1.0 version, you can't really say the game's development is done. The devs are still working on new content and posting about it frequently.Also, you might want to play it with your friends, and you can, with up to 4 of them over network.tl;dr : Innovative game with plenty of eye-candy, really hard sometimes, has co-op.

								This game is very simple in its design but is incredibly well thought out in its execution. Randomly generated dungeons, resource management, multiple player characters, there is an incredible amount of depth and tactical feel to this game. The graphics and soundtrack make for a rather nostalgic feel instead of being outdated or lacking in their preformance they throw us back to old school titles that we used to know and love. This game feels like the developers are taking their time slowly but surely perfecting it, a nice change of pace from the games of today. Indie developers seem to have what big game companies have lost they are putting their heart and souls into this project and it shows Dungeon is an incredible game even in its alpha stages it has amazing potential. Those of you who bought the founders packs or might have helped kickstart it i feel like your faith will not go unrewarded. I only hope that future versions of the game might include harder difficulties, and maybe some lines of dialouge between heroes nothing voiced mind you but a few texts expressing the characters state of mind feelings towards one another or just jokes or comments about the dungeons themselves would be interesting, expanding the lore might also be cool finding codexes or data logs strewn about that contain information on the creatures crew ship and planet would be a fun treat for people who love to immerse themselves into the game. Though changes like that would be nice the game already offers so much in its alpha stage that i only imagine the completed product will be nothing less than amazing I give the alpha version of this game a 9/10 and I would say that this is my most anticapated title pending release and i absolutley can't wait for the final version I recomend anyone who reads this grab the founders pack as soon as possible you will not be dissapointed.

								Dungeon of the Endless.... (Personal valuation 8/10)I must say this game may be an Alpha Version still - but it plays itself like a Full game.Random generated Maps and diffrent Characters each time make this game a great game to play when you are bored.But its not an easy one.The goal in this game is to bring your Energy-Crystal to the escape point, which will make you reach the next level - and thereby map of the game.Sounds easy? Wrong. The rooms you walk trough with your two start characters contain treasures, supplies or evil monsters which try to destroy your Crystal.Your Crystal can power rooms so no enemies spawn inside and so you can build defenses or generators. Every few rooms, some enemies spawn in dark rooms to attack your crystal.Will you find the exit and carry the crystal there, or will your enemies destroy you and your crystal?			"

								Dungeon of the Endless is a little abstract at first, but once you get the mechanics it's a unique RTS experience. Each room means choices, that will subtly effect the outcome. You can move the heros from room to room but once there, they automatically do their thing, and you can pause at any time to accomplish this positioning. As difficulty increases, more and more waves of enemies spawn out of dark, unpowered rooms.  There's lots of dying, over and over. The game is pretty hard, and sometimes you'll die more from bad luck than anything you did, but that's part of the random fun you get with each play thru. Still in Alpha, this game is a solid investment in value.			"

Early Access Review
								(As of 0.1.1)It’s tough, and probably needs a little rebalancing as to where things spawn and how much, but being it's in alpha I'm extremely impressed. I made it through on my 5th or 6th try, at least as far as the early access would allow (level 4 I think?). I can tell I'm going to love this game though. The two negative things I have to say about it are that occasionally it'll seem a bit unfair and loot will only rarely spawn that you can use if you don’t have a diverse team (something you can't choose). Once I started a new game died after I opened the third door. There was nothing that I could have done to prevent this and was a clear case of the game killing me instead of me dying. Many times, starting out, you'll find that any gear you stumble across is only good to be sold since neither of your two people can use a pistol, for example  (despite one of them being able to use machine guns...?). Whether the latter issue is problem with the loot drops or the gear system is subjective I suppose.All that being said though, I love this game so far. I love the genre bending mechanics and the not-quite-shadowrun and not-quite-fallout world. I love the art and sound. I love the droplets of story you get with each random party and each piece of gear you stumble across. I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a tower defense game with rogue-like elements.  You control a squad of up to four characters as you try and make your way out of a 12-floor dungeon filled with monsters.  Those familiar with Amplitude's other games will recognize the resources you'll need to survive: industry for building, science for research, food for leveling up your squad members, and dust for powering rooms.  To generate these resources, you build modules, open doors, and fend off waves of monsters when they decide to attack your ""core"" (a giant crystal).  The rogue-like elements include perma-death (although you may find your dead character again in a later floor), random dungeon layouts, and randomness when it comes to opening doors.  Once you learn the game's mechanics, the game can get easy.  However, it is fun to play with friends and the ""unstable"" cast of characters makes things interesting as you learn about the lore.  The soundtrack and pixel art look of the game are excellent and extremely memorable.			"

												TL;DR || The game is a fun mix of dungeon crawling RPG and tower defense. Perma-death, random dungeon layouts, and a good selection of characters add to the replay value. Multiple heroes to unlock. Level 'em up. Gear 'em up. Meet new heroes while in the dungeon and have them join your party. Find ancient treasure. Research new tech. Die, lose it all, and happily start over again. The devs are a pretty swell bunch too!!!I think the art style is fantastic, and the same can be said for the sound design and soundtrack. The gameplay is quite fluid with a nice interface and can also be quite challenging with a good bit a strategy mixed in. Clear the dungeon room by room using your heroes, while setting up defenses to protect your ship's power core. Once you find the floor's exit, defend one of your heroes as he slowly carries the core to the elevator. You can power up rooms to prevent enemies from spawning in them and use that power to set up turrets and resource nodes; this helps you create a defensible path to the elevator, because once you touch that core, they don't stop coming.The developers are worth mentioning too. AMPLITUDE is hands down one of my favorite studios. They put out quality products and continue to provide support for their games beyond their initial release.If you'd like to see a bit of gameplay:

												I don't want to sound like I'm exaggerating and I don't want to repeat too much of what everyone else has said... but this game is amazing.I could play this game until I died of starvation. This game is fun. It is relatively casual (except for how addictive it is), it is challenging, it is basically built to be replayed constantly, it is relatively simple yet surprisingly complex, it has multiplayer that doesn't take away from the experience and lets you have fun with friends, the music is what I would consider the upper echelon of music in games.I'm not a homer for this game, I bought it because it was in a bundle with Endless Space and Endless Legend that was reasonably priced and had no real intention of playing it. I knew nothing about it and have 0 stake in giving it a glowing rating but it is honestly just so immensely fun.If you have any interest in roguelikes I cannot recommend this game highly enough.Only complaint - Let players trade items in multiplayer!

												A neat and fun game that has many unique details in it, and yet it's definitely not flawless! I down voted this game originally thinking that the creators completely failed in their idea, but here I am more than a year later to come back to this game, enjoying it way better than I used to.Still I have to point out these things that are, in my opinion, not right:A playthrough takes way too long for a Rogue-like. It can take 3 to 4 hours to beat it. This makes trying out new chars and tactics a bit tedious. There is still quite a narrow range of strategies to have success in a playthrough.There is no proper tutorial.The multiplayer is a mess.(The gameplay is simply not compatible for multiplayer, you're better off alone)The thing that changed my mind are the free DLC and the welcoming tweaks to the balancing. Random scenarios are more common and more ""friendly"", so now you actually feel lucky from time to time. A mistake early on can be resolved later (it didn´t used to be like this). But hey, it costs between 12 and 20€ so I can forgive the mentioned cons.So I'm safe to say now that, if you are into these types of games, you'll get entertainment worth your money.			"

												[I've just beat all 12 floors of the first dungeon solo and on ""Too Easy"", see below. Tried many different heroes. Pixel Edition.] Remarkable game. Didn't think I would enjoy pixelated graphics, but apparently it doesn't look ""bad"" just because it doesn't look ""realistic"". The details in animation and environment are stunning. The dreamy soundtrack and amazing artstyle craft a unique, otherwordly atmosphere to enjoy this marvellous strategy adventure in. I will say that the difficulty settings are misleading - there are only Too Easy and Easy. You better plan what you're doing carefully on Too Easy if you mean to make it to the surface. Taking on Easy will be a daunting task for sure. Encountered about three bugs - an Item Duplicating bug in Multiplayer (beneficial), a frozen Hero in Multiplayer (easily resolved by restarting the game) and an Item Vanishing bug in both Single- and Multiplayer (once each)(rather frustrating). The excitement of exploring what's behind the next door is what makes this game truly addictive to me. Will be upgrading to Crystal Edition now to unlock some more heroes and challenges, but all you really need to get into the game and see if you like it is in the Pixel Edition. 9/10 - would buy again.

What do I rate it? A significantly high 7/10.Why?In brief; it's an amazing dungeon crawler with a tower-defense aspect seamlessly and cleverly incorporated into the fighting aspect of the game between each round of opening a new random door. You could trawl the floors for hours and spend even longer over-thinking your strategic moves between rooms. After the fourth or fifth floor, you begin to feel a familiarity building and the game slowly becomes a little repetitive. Discovering the same rooms you did two floors ago - like a treasure room, banquet surprise (food bonus), scrap parts (factory parts) and yadda yadda. So although the maps are all unique and no path is the same as the last map, you begin to build a familiarity with the small number of different custom rooms you could venture into, which to an extent, makes you feel like there's nothing new to discover and you've seen everything already. Just in a different order between the floors you take.Multiplayer is nonexistent online. I've tried searching for public matches and to no avail found any. So the multiplayer aspect would only be feesible if you had friends who also the game to play with and don't mind spending a vast amount of time on a playthrough that you can't save or return too. As of yet anyway. Overall...?Yes. It's a game that will entertain you for hours if you enjoy dungeon crawlers. Do not buy for the mulitplayer aspect, unless someone else owns the game and can be relied upon to play with you for hours at a time to even attempt to finish a playthrough. Atmospherics, music and gameplay is fairly good. Overal; buy this game when it's on sale. I wouldn't say it's worth the retail mark-up and it definitely needs a lot of rough edges smoothing out.

												The best implementation of a co-op Roguelike that I've seen. It mixes turn-based elements and real-time play, so that it's not one constant unbroken action sequence - you get downtime after each room unless you get overrun. The premise is simple: Open doors to explore the level, and beware of enemy spawns in unpowered rooms after you open each door. Find the exit, and carry your crystal from the entry point to it - but as soon as you pick it up, monsters will spawn until you escape.The lowest difficulty mode is tough, but reasonable - and there's one more above that if you're looking for a serious challenge. The descriptions of the items are humorous, the game is easy to understand, and offers a good challenge without being punishing. And it's fun on your own, but even moreso with up to three friends you can collaborate with. Highly recommended if you like Roguelikes and want to get your friends in on the action.			"

												A fantastic combination of tower defense with rpg and randomized elements. Each new pod you unlock changes the feel and play of the game to a great degree, making multiple playthroughs worthwhile, challenging and fun. Highly recommended.There is a definite learning curve, and it can take a few hours to get yourself going in a groove to get the feel for each unique escape pod's rules for success. The tutorial is lacking, but the guides aren't. If you're up for a challenge and the twoer defense and rogue like aspects are interesting to you, grab this. BE WARNED: the rogue-like aspects can mean you hit a floor you will need to play perfectly to beat, and you can lose a lot of progress for making a bad gamble. [and to some degree, the game can bone you with a punishing floor and there isn't much you can do if you get no dust (a type of currency) for like 9 rooms straight].			"

												If you like FTL you'll like this game.  It has elements of a lot of different types of games:  4x, Rogue-like, Tower Defense, etc.    The goal is to escape the dungeon floor by floor.    Each floor starts the same way, you and a power source.    You need to explore until you find the exit.   Then you need to plan a way to move the power source to the exit.   Moving said power source spawns a neverending slew of monsters.   Monsters spawn from unpowered areas so you can set up an escape route.   All the while you need to balance leveling your team (Food), researching modules (Science) and building defenses or resource generating modules.   I'm 0 for 7 on ""Too Easy"" so expect a challenge.

												I picked this up in a pack along with Endless Legend and Space because I wanted to get into a new 4x game. This game wasn't on my radar before and I didn't really expect anything from it. However what I found was a surprisingly addictive roguelike that borrowed elements from a dozen other genres put together into a deceptively complex whole. I've only beaten the game once on ""easy"" (actually the game's hard difficulty) but doing that took nearly a dozen attempts worth of familiarizing myself with the mechanics and each time felt unique and ""worth"" it.The game's art and music style are very nice and the heroes are interesting, if not in terms of personality at least what they bring to the table in terms of options available to you each run. I feel like they'd work well in a more fully fleshed out RPG setting with expanded mechanics.It would be nice if there was some kind of persistence between tries outside of which heroes you have unlocked to start with as I do feel that is a barrier to replayability currently. However even with that said I feel like this game is more than worth the admission price. One of the most surprisingly enjoyable games I've played recently.			"

												This clever, nicely-paced game isn't quite FTL, but it's worth mentiong in the same sentence. FTL's basic gameplay is quite repetitive, but there are interesting choices to be made at the strategic level, as you find out what modules are on offer.  DOTE's basic gameplay has a fair amount of variation, but the number of viable strategies feels a lot more limited.  There's definitely a real learning curve, and unlocking character stories is quite satisfying.  However, DOTE feels much more like a series of tactical and operational puzzles than it gives a feeling of strategy.  I may be saying that because I haven't worked out the tactical puzzles yet (and am therefore blind to strategy) but there's a strong feeling of 'starting again' with each new floor that drains my sense of satisfaction and progression.If you like exploring mazes and unlocking things, you'll get a ton of enjoyment out of DOTE.  That's not quite my thing, but I still enjoyed it for quite a few hours.			"

Guide your chosen heroes to their gruesome death again and again.  Just when it feel like it's getting easier and you have control of the situation, the RNG gods will test your defenses and most of the time crush them.  Do you make the risky play or the safe one?  Horde resources and build stronger defenses?  Make a run for the end of the level or open another door in search of resources?  Beautifully polished with endearing graphics and captivating music.  Oozing character and dark humour.  HIGHLY recommended.			"

								For all those Warcraft3 lovers out there, who enjoyed tower and hero defenses just as much as i did:THIS IS YOUR GAME.Once you understood the mechanics of this game (e.g. powered / unpowered rooms or defense / roaming hero) it becomes quite addictive and very tactical.The cool part (compared to wc3 TDs) is that between your turns, you have endless time to improve your heros and roosm itself. PRO:-The variaty of items and champsis not as rich as in wc3 or dota, but added to the concept of tower defense you end up having troubles to decide which tactical way to go and which item/champ comps are suiting you best.-DotE is rarly based on random events (exept for the tech-tree and the item drop). At the beginning it may seem so, but then you havent understood the mechanics yet.  CON:NO MICROMANAGING-You have no control of the Heros, except that you can tell them in which room they should move.-You also have no way of building a maze.			"

												It's an apt testimony to the skill and passion of the Amplitude folks that Dungeon of the Endless has become my go-to timewaster. The premise is simple: Your prison ship's been attacked and you've crash-landed on an uncharted planet. You and your motley band of inmates, ship staff and exotic natives must navigate the twelve floors of the mysterious dungeon you've found yourself in by finding the elevator on each floor and using the ""crystal"" generator from your escape pod to power it and move to the next level up. That crystal is also needed to power the rooms of the dungeon, providing a variety of resources conducive to your survival, but it is limited by its supply of ""dust"", and each room left unpowered has a chance to spawn a wave of hostile fauna whenever you open a new door on that floor.The gameplay is an elegant combination of roguelike, tower defence and classic RPG mechanics. It's both accessible and challenging, with a bit less of the luck factor of, say, FTL (you'll rarely be thrown into randomly unsurvivable situations) and more strategic decisions to make rather than a roll of the dice. While plotting your route through the dungeon, protecting the crystal is your primary concern. You'll have a range of modules to install in a dungeon, from resource generators to defensive weaponry, and as your power demand starts to exceed supply you'll have to get clever with which parts of the dungeon you keep powered and where you open new doors. Your heroes' abilities and attributes vary widely. Some are slow but powerful tanks, well-suited to holding a static position; others are technically-minded and can operate or repair the modules you build; others still are nimble speedsters ideal for responding to trouble spots or running the crystal to the elevator. Managing your heroes is therefore crucial to success.The understated soundtrack and the pseudo-pixellated, hand-painted graphics are both surpassingly beautiful, and taken with the game lore (which frequently ties in with that of Amplitude's other titles, Endless Space and Endless Legend) they create a truly unique atmosphere and sense of immersion. The heroes will treat you to some fun banter occasionally, and are great sources of emergent stories. The tale of how you brave robotic swordsman sacrificed himself keeping a horde of nasties from his beloved crystal carrier; or how two of your most dissimilar dungeon explorers form an unstoppable monster-slaying, best-buddy team; are experiences that remain with you long after their runs have ended. Some combinations of characters even have unique backstories of their own, which unfold as they ascend the floors with sometimes-shocking outcomes that I won't spoil here. Simply put, the game oozes personality.Whether you're a fan of the genre, or simply someone who appreciates an old-school challenge or a lovingly-made game, I can't recommend Dungeon of the Endless enough. Keep your eyes on Amplitude, because they've just had an amazing year. "

												A charming party roguelike and tower defence mashup. The basic idea is exploring rooms, protecting your generator from incoming mobs and then carrying your generator through the maze to the next level before the mobs get you. Works well. There's also manufacturing the resources familiar from Endless Space, but very simple. It can be harshly random in the manner roguelikes tend to be, but the game provides easy starting difficulties to compensate. For the replayability there's unlockable characters and game modes (landing pods).I can't resist making comparisons with SotS: The Pit even though these are fairly different games, The Pit being pure Roguelike. Both are still games with similar theme set in same respective universes as previous 4X space strategy games. Specifically, the different approach to the lore interests me. SotS has well constructed universe that is often explained with lots of text. Endless seems more haphazardly build, focusing more on overall feel rather than details. Filling in the blanks is left to the player if he wants them filled. I would say SotS is more like a novel while Endless is more like a painting of a landscape or and instrumental piece of music.

Early Access Review
								It's alpha as all hell, the skill system needs to be implemented STAT, and there needs to be more variety to the core gameplay. While I understand that there needs to be a final, kill all failure (losing all dust), but make that a secondary worry, with the first being character survival and exploration. I say this mainly because I shouldn't need to step through a door, and have an inane worry of enemies flooding towards the crystal. That should be, if anything, a worst case scenario. While speaking of the crystal, implement more ways to obtain dust than unknowingly entering a room with a dust supply. It's a good thing this game is in bare-bones alpha, and still has much too look forward to. However, these are all minor complaints that WILL be filtered out or diverted in Dungeon's slow alpha-to-beta building process. The game already is good for just playing and relaxing. It doesn't require so much focus, you can't have other things at hand/in mind. Furthermore, I feel the game leaves plenty of room for an engaging story and style. People who played/enjoyed Endless Space, or more specifically, its lore will find this game intriguing enough. Perhaps wait 'til beta? I recommend it anyway but, don't jump on this bandwagon if you aren't planning on giving it time.  "

												An impressive game from the makers of Endless Legend and Endless Space, the links between the games are clear in the simple resources used in each, and the basic premises the games generally hold, as well as the subtle hints that ALL the games have links with one another that tease their fans; and the enticingly different games of each genre (if you can even define an exact genre for this one!) make their games distinctive and unique, a fresh breeze in genres that are frequently carbon copies of one design or another.Dungeon of the Endless does more than their previous efforts though - this time, it's not just a fresh take on a type of game, they've conjoined multiple genres and come up with something totally different. I would completely recommend it - it's both casually enjoyable, and surprisingly addictive. The simple graphics are not off-putting in the slightest, a testiment to the designers that they were aiming for gameplay far more than scoring 10/10 for being one-up on other developers (and the gorgeous graphics in their other games shows that they can definately deliver on that when they choose to)More than that though, they master the roguelike genre by giving you multiple unlockable bonuses for replaying, as well as gradually building your ability with the game; but not to a point where a seasoned, experienced player would always score FAR better than a new starter to it, so long as the new starter was prepared to learn from them.It's also fantastic for multiplayer, far more than many of the type, and the multiplayer is a totally different experience, one I'd recommend for anyone - though they may want to wait for the next release before doing it seriously with other people (save and load for multiplayer, bug-fixes, etc) - but I'd hasten to add that the solo play is hardly lacking either.Even when you think you've compeltely mastered an approach, a run of bad luck can leave you in a seriously dangerous position; and if the standard play begins to bore, switching the capsule type or the characters you play with totally changes how the game plays. A big thumbs up from me, and it further increases the respect I have for Ampitude's games as a whole.One last mention - they also have a quirky humour that's entirely their own, whether it comes to the fake latin-esque drugs on the infirmary pod to the in-game item descriptions and names; or simply in the tiny hints about their games and the secrets in them; or even in the lift conversations that unlock secrets in character biographies; all the hints and text are small and subtle, not requiring you to be involved; but if you want to put in the time to seek out their secrets, it's a satisfying reward for it too.A big congratulations from an experienced gamer to the developers - it's a lovely piece of work and makes me excited to see their next!

Early Access Review
								(As of version Alpha 0.2.1) I picked up this game on a whim - it had the specs: indie, sci-fi, strategy, and fun art-direction.When I first picked it up, only the bare mechanics were in place. You took your heroes from room to room and tried to fight back the hordes going after your crystal. It was compelling then and with the features they continue to add, the game keeps getting more addictive. The idea is that a prison space ship crashes on an unknown planet. You need to direct your 'heroes' (guards and/or prisoners) to find the exit of the dungeon that they're stuck in. Each room will have doors. Every time you open a door you discover a new room which may have an item, a resource, or monsters. As you open more doors, you collect resourses and power which you can use to power/light-up rooms. Monsters will not appear in powered rooms while they could potentially show up in un-powered rooms. There are two phases to each level. The first phase is strategic exploration and tower defence: you can install turrets in your powered rooms to help your heroes fight the monsters. The second phase requires you to bring your crystal to the exit. It's a bit of a mad dash to the finish line. As you leave a room with the crystal, that room loses it's power supply. The two phases keep the levels fresh and keeps you planning ahead. If you enjoy strategy games, tower defence games, sci-fi, indie, elements of RPG, or like good pixel art then this game is for you! Even better, as they're still developing the game, more an more features are being added!			"

												The only question I have is why I can't murder other heroes to loot them. The rest of my questions have all been killed out of me.I didn't think I'd like a roguelike this much. Maybe this and FTL have a secret hold on me. When it comes down to what you like about them, the challenge or the exploration, I think I like this game better as the challenge doesn't rely entirely on totallyrandom generation. Imagine if you could improve your ship in FTL without needingit all to come from shops or random encounters, but also gave you the options of directly influencing the parts of your ship with scrap, reinforcing the hull or weapons by themselves. That's what the heroesin this game fillthe gap on. Mixing it with tower defense makes this game engaging as you try tokeep heroes inbetween monsters and your crystal ala Dungeon Defenders, and executes it with the power sent to each grid. Managing these, your heroes and your defense network makes the game engaging.I would like to see more ships added. I enjoythe fact you can have certain gains and deficits granted by each pod, but if the developer doesn't make some whacky options available, or powerful ones, then the gimmick is short lived. I may be the only one who wants to see strange and fantastic options anymore, though. The excitement of seeing the doors open (as this is a door opening simulator, not a monster defense game as one would assume) is sadly reduced once you've run the gambit of monsters. I would like to see more happen.Gameplay: 9/10 Polished, well executed, and lacking in only the slightest of refinements. The stats lack descriptions and the tutorial hucks you in after a basic example.Story: 7/10 Must unlockthe characters and have them gab at one another for the story, but then again, that isn't what you came to do in this game, was it?Graphics: 8/10 Very pretty in game environments, monsters are varied but fit thesame subcategories, heroes continue to surpirse me in some ways. But the lit rooms sometimes offer little more than the dark ones did other than lack of gnawing death.Sound 9/10: As with games of this nature, sound effects are re-used oftenbut it doesn't grate the ears. Music is appropriate, well done, and generally pleasing.Overall: 9/10: Would open more doors.			"

												If you're into the rogue-like genre then this is a must get. There's a wide variety of characters and a lot of micro managing so I hope you're somewhat good with strategy games. You juggle three different resources and level up your characters to reach the end. There is a multiplayer aspect of the game that's quite interesting, but there's also major desync issues. I've yet to actually reach the end on single or multiplayer, but at least single player won't kick you for lag issues or make it impossible for you to see what's going on in the game. I suggest you stick to the singleplayer until these problems are solved.EDIT: I just beat a run after 20 attempts. Losses don't feel like the game is screwing you over; every loss I suffered I knew was my own fault for not paying attention to something. Unlocking characters can be tedious but is simple enough. You have to find them in a run and recruit them. You must then keep them alive for the next 3 floors. Doing so will allow you to pick them at the start of your run.Visuals: 9/10Gameplay: 10/10Controls: 7/10Replayability: 10/10			"

												If you like FTL you'll like this game.  It has elements of a lot of different types of games:  4x, Rogue-like, Tower Defense, etc.    The goal is to escape the dungeon floor by floor.    Each floor starts the same way, you and a power source.    You need to explore until you find the exit.   Then you need to plan a way to move the power source to the exit.   Moving said power source spawns a neverending slew of monsters.   Monsters spawn from unpowered areas so you can set up an escape route.   All the while you need to balance leveling your team (Food), researching modules (Science) and building defenses or resource generating modules.   I'm 0 for 7 on ""Too Easy"" so expect a challenge.

												An engrossing adventure that I can't put down.  Each turn is a combination of excitement and dread as another door is opened.  Guide your chosen heroes to their gruesome death again and again.  Just when it feel like it's getting easier and you have control of the situation, the RNG gods will test your defenses and most of the time crush them.  Do you make the risky play or the safe one?  Horde resources and build stronger defenses?  Make a run for the end of the level or open another door in search of resources?  Beautifully polished with endearing graphics and captivating music.  Oozing character and dark humour.  HIGHLY recommended.			"

												This clever, nicely-paced game isn't quite FTL, but it's worth mentiong in the same sentence. FTL's basic gameplay is quite repetitive, but there are interesting choices to be made at the strategic level, as you find out what modules are on offer.  DOTE's basic gameplay has a fair amount of variation, but the number of viable strategies feels a lot more limited.  There's definitely a real learning curve, and unlocking character stories is quite satisfying.  However, DOTE feels much more like a series of tactical and operational puzzles than it gives a feeling of strategy.  I may be saying that because I haven't worked out the tactical puzzles yet (and am therefore blind to strategy) but there's a strong feeling of 'starting again' with each new floor that drains my sense of satisfaction and progression.If you like exploring mazes and unlocking things, you'll get a ton of enjoyment out of DOTE.  That's not quite my thing, but I still enjoyed it for quite a few hours.			"

												PROS-Diverse cast of misfits that you will lead to an inevitable demise.-Creates a wonderfully haunting sense of isolation through both the visual art style and the excellent soundtrack.-Somehow manages to blend tower defence, rts, rpg and roguelike elements together without failing at any of them.-Easy mode will ruthlessly murder your squad over and over again. -Different types of escape pods to unlock, each modifying how the game is played.-Pixellated pugs.NEUTRALS-This is definitely a roguelike, and sometimes you'll do as much as you can and still fail. Sometimes you will find the exit to the next floor in seven or eight rooms, sometimes it will be the last door on the floor. I find that being stretched thin and having to guard three fronts with a handful of turrets and heroes to be half the fun.CONS-An essential tactic for later in the game involves using heores in unpowered rooms in order to prevent enemy spawns. I'm not sure if this is mentioned anywhere in-game. I found out about it on the forums.I can't recommend this strongly enough. If you're a fan of any of the genres listed on the tags, do yourself a favour and pick this up.			"

												The best implementation of a co-op Roguelike that I've seen. It mixes turn-based elements and real-time play, so that it's not one constant unbroken action sequence - you get downtime after each room unless you get overrun. The premise is simple: Open doors to explore the level, and beware of enemy spawns in unpowered rooms after you open each door. Find the exit, and carry your crystal from the entry point to it - but as soon as you pick it up, monsters will spawn until you escape.The lowest difficulty mode is tough, but reasonable - and there's one more above that if you're looking for a serious challenge. The descriptions of the items are humorous, the game is easy to understand, and offers a good challenge without being punishing. And it's fun on your own, but even moreso with up to three friends you can collaborate with. Highly recommended if you like Roguelikes and want to get your friends in on the action.			"

What do I rate it? A significantly high 7/10.Why?In brief; it's an amazing dungeon crawler with a tower-defense aspect seamlessly and cleverly incorporated into the fighting aspect of the game between each round of opening a new random door. You could trawl the floors for hours and spend even longer over-thinking your strategic moves between rooms. After the fourth or fifth floor, you begin to feel a familiarity building and the game slowly becomes a little repetitive. Discovering the same rooms you did two floors ago - like a treasure room, banquet surprise (food bonus), scrap parts (factory parts) and yadda yadda. So although the maps are all unique and no path is the same as the last map, you begin to build a familiarity with the small number of different custom rooms you could venture into, which to an extent, makes you feel like there's nothing new to discover and you've seen everything already. Just in a different order between the floors you take.Multiplayer is nonexistent online. I've tried searching for public matches and to no avail found any. So the multiplayer aspect would only be feesible if you had friends who also the game to play with and don't mind spending a vast amount of time on a playthrough that you can't save or return too. As of yet anyway. Overall...?Yes. It's a game that will entertain you for hours if you enjoy dungeon crawlers. Do not buy for the mulitplayer aspect, unless someone else owns the game and can be relied upon to play with you for hours at a time to even attempt to finish a playthrough. Atmospherics, music and gameplay is fairly good. Overal; buy this game when it's on sale. I wouldn't say it's worth the retail mark-up and it definitely needs a lot of rough edges smoothing out. Such as bugs and incomplete fixes. But a very promising arcade style game.			"

												A very polished and very difficult dungeon crawler/roguelike/tower defense. The game flow is similar to Faster Than Light, but the mechanics are very different. So you basically do an action that advances the game, a random event is triggered (combat, loot, new hero, merchant, etc.), you have to react to it, manage your base and heroes according to the changes in the last round and then go for another round. The visuals are pretty nice and this is coming from someone who loathes gimmicky pixel art execution. Somehow the ""modern"" colors, lighting and 3D modeling of the dungeon blends really well with the 8-bit FX and character models.I would also add that DotE is a good example of Early Access done right - a solid concept, design and roadmap that materialized in a very stable and cohesive game.My only complaint is that none of the game's aspects is very complex, even if they seem to take a while to understand when put together. Character management is simplistic, combat is very basic, base management pretty much the same. The challenge actually comes from having to plan your moves well and using the least resources possible for the task, because one needs to stockpile for the toughest levels. Going too conservative on your resource usage results in an early loss, while not stockpiling enough results in a loss on the later levels.			"

												A fantastic combination of tower defense with rpg and randomized elements. Each new pod you unlock changes the feel and play of the game to a great degree, making multiple playthroughs worthwhile, challenging and fun. Highly recommended.There is a definite learning curve, and it can take a few hours to get yourself going in a groove to get the feel for each unique escape pod's rules for success. The tutorial is lacking, but the guides aren't. If you're up for a challenge and the twoer defense and rogue like aspects are interesting to you, grab this. BE WARNED: the rogue-like aspects can mean you hit a floor you will need to play perfectly to beat, and you can lose a lot of progress for making a bad gamble. [and to some degree, the game can bone you with a punishing floor and there isn't much you can do if you get no dust (a type of currency) for like 9 rooms straight].			"

												A really fun game with a steep learning curve. The sprite are well animated and the gameplay is really challenging. Towards the upper levels of the elevator you will often be challenged with defending multiple choke points, but don't worry as you can pause and unpause multiple times to help think out a reaction plan to the enemies. Really enjoyable and replayable!			"

								The game is preaty good so far , can be really challenging alot of time's but thats half the fun right their . Im a big fan of FTL so right when I saw this game I instintly loved it . Their should be a  difficulty button so you can switch between easy and hard added later on because sometimes I like to go for a hard run thru while other time's I like an easier run thru but for now im just waiting to see what is going to be added next .

												Some roguelikes like FTL are engrossing and addicting, others like Risk of Rain feel like a mouse wheel with no purpose.  Dungeon of the Endless is the best roguelike style game I've ever played.  It combines many of the emotional elements I love from other games, like Diablo 1 and Fallout with tower defense mechanics.  There are lots of details and a sense of progression that make me feel like I'm acheiving something, so when I die--and I die often-- I want to play again instead of find something more interesting to do.

												I would describe this game as incredible. The dark and pixelated art style is beautiful, and the gameplay no less so. an interesting time-passing mechanic forces you to plan every move carefully, and when you mess up, it can turn deadly. Every second I've played has been enjoyable.			"

												Similar to FTL, this is a game that turns many ignorant gamers off with its seemingly failed pixelated graphics. They do not realize it is a deliberate art that grows on players over time. A very addictive game that draws players in with the steady growth of crew members as they struggle to get out of the underground cave. As your crew get stronger, the challenge gets tougher as well, keeping you consistently on the edge of your seat at all times.			"

								Very original and interesting game. A super awesome mutant hybrid of rpg, rogue-like, tower defense, rts creates an end result that is incredibly fun and challenging. 10/10 as an 'early access' with more content than a lot of 'complete' games. Look forward to any more content in the future of this game but as it is right now, it's a blast!			"

Early Access Review
								(As of version Alpha 0.2.1) I picked up this game on a whim - it had the specs: indie, sci-fi, strategy, and fun art-direction.When I first picked it up, only the bare mechanics were in place. You took your heroes from room to room and tried to fight back the hordes going after your crystal. It was compelling then and with the features they continue to add, the game keeps getting more addictive. The idea is that a prison space ship crashes on an unknown planet. You need to direct your 'heroes' (guards and/or prisoners) to find the exit of the dungeon that they're stuck in. Each room will have doors. Every time you open a door you discover a new room which may have an item, a resource, or monsters. As you open more doors, you collect resourses and power which you can use to power/light-up rooms. Monsters will not appear in powered rooms while they could potentially show up in un-powered rooms. There are two phases to each level. The first phase is strategic exploration and tower defence: you can install turrets in your powered rooms to help your heroes fight the monsters. The second phase requires you to bring your crystal to the exit. It's a bit of a mad dash to the finish line. As you leave a room with the crystal, that room loses it's power supply. The two phases keep the levels fresh and keeps you planning ahead. If you enjoy strategy games, tower defence games, sci-fi, indie, elements of RPG, or like good pixel art then this game is for you! Even better, as they're still developing the game, more an more features are being added!			"

												The only question I have is why I can't murder other heroes to loot them. The rest of my questions have all been killed out of me.I didn't think I'd like a roguelike this much. Maybe this and FTL have a secret hold on me. When it comes down to what you like about them, the challenge or the exploration, I think I like this game better as the challenge doesn't rely entirely on totallyrandom generation. Imagine if you could improve your ship in FTL without needingit all to come from shops or random encounters, but also gave you the options of directly influencing the parts of your ship with scrap, reinforcing the hull or weapons by themselves. That's what the heroesin this game fillthe gap on. Mixing it with tower defense makes this game engaging as you try tokeep heroes inbetween monsters and your crystal ala Dungeon Defenders, and executes it with the power sent to each grid. Managing these, your heroes and your defense network makes the game engaging.I would like to see more ships added. I enjoythe fact you can have certain gains and deficits granted by each pod, but if the developer doesn't make some whacky options available, or powerful ones, then the gimmick is short lived. I may be the only one who wants to see strange and fantastic options anymore, though. The excitement of seeing the doors open (as this is a door opening simulator, not a monster defense game as one would assume) is sadly reduced once you've run the gambit of monsters. I would like to see more happen.Gameplay: 9/10 Polished, well executed, and lacking in only the slightest of refinements. The stats lack descriptions and the tutorial hucks you in after a basic example.Story: 7/10 Must unlockthe characters and have them gab at one another for the story, but then again, that isn't what you came to do in this game, was it?Graphics: 8/10 Very pretty in game environments, monsters are varied but fit thesame subcategories, heroes continue to surpirse me in some ways. But the lit rooms sometimes offer little more than the dark ones did other than lack of gnawing death.Sound 9/10: As with games of this nature, sound effects are re-used oftenbut it doesn't grate the ears. Music is appropriate, well done, and generally pleasing.Overall: 9/10: Would open more doors.			"

												If you're into the rogue-like genre then this is a must get. There's a wide variety of characters and a lot of micro managing so I hope you're somewhat good with strategy games. You juggle three different resources and level up your characters to reach the end. There is a multiplayer aspect of the game that's quite interesting, but there's also major desync issues. I've yet to actually reach the end on single or multiplayer, but at least single player won't kick you for lag issues or make it impossible for you to see what's going on in the game. I suggest you stick to the singleplayer until these problems are solved.EDIT: I just beat a run after 20 attempts. Losses don't feel like the game is screwing you over; every loss I suffered I knew was my own fault for not paying attention to something. Unlocking characters can be tedious but is simple enough. You have to find them in a run and recruit them. You must then keep them alive for the next 3 floors. Doing so will allow you to pick them at the start of your run.Visuals: 9/10Gameplay: 10/10Controls: 7/10Replayability: 10/10			"

								A very interesting take on a blend of roguelike with RPG elements and tower defence.At this Alfa stage (0.1.0) the game has 3 levels and many of the more interesting things like abilities/science are not yet implemented.However there is a lot here to be excited about, items, turrets and enemies are all here and more will be added.Be warned that it will take you about 2 hours to go through the game once at this point (0.1.0), but more content will come soon, and replayability is quite high.

												Holy fudgenuggets on a cheese biscuit, where do I even begin....Dungeon of the Endless (or as I call it, DotE) is a pixelated dungeon-crawler roguelike where you play as a ragtag group of people trying to escape from the pits of whatever kind of dungeon you fell into when your escape pod crashed. The thing about this game that makes it so much fun to play over and over again is... well, just about everything. Discovering new heroes, unlocking new ships, and discovering what each type of module does makes this game so much fun, and it's truly an enjoyable experience (also, the multiplayer is 10/10).So, if you're new at the game, let me close with this -  have fun, and please, for your sake, choose Sara and Gork for your first run. It's an amazing combo.			"

												When I first tried to play this game, I didn't like it. It seemed too complicated and I didn't understand what I was supposed to be doing. I let it sit for a while and then came back to it, and ended up loving it. Once you get the hang of the controls and a feel for how things work, it's a super fun and addicting game. The variety of characters to choose from and unlock and the range of ships you can play through all create different challenges that give it a lot of replayability. The characters are cool, the environment is cool, the music is good, the ambient sounds are creepy (but good). A solid game, would definitely recommend.			"
