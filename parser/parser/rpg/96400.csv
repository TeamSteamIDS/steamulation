												Not only did the Devs REMOVE controller/gamepad support, but they abandoned any support for this game directly after this final act of stupidity.Keyboards controls need work (hence the need for controller support), no cloud saving, broken 'matchmaking' and poorly paced co-op (unless you play every second with your dedicated co-op partners, because you can only have 1 character). Good game, good potential, not worth the money unless you have a dedicated group of friends, and a modded contrller profile. (on sale also helps)			"

												The PC version has sharper graphics than the Xbox360 version, but they removed both local co-op play, and all gamepad support. Had I realized these two features were missing, I definitely would not have bought this game. But it didn't occur to me to actually research whether they were removing features for the PC version... I learned a lesson there.From the devs on their forums: ""Regarding gamepads - the game plays waaaay better with mouse/keyboard so we elected to not support gamepads.""The lack of local co-op means you can only play multiplayer online, despite the original game being designed around having up to four players sitting around a TV at once. That feature is probably gone due to the PC version's controls. They added a keyboard+mouse control scheme, but completely removed any option to even use a gamepad. The keyboard controls aren't especially bad or really hard to use, but for an arcade-style shooter/platformer, gamepad is what I'm always going to prefer.			"

												Even if it's unbalanced, it's still a lot of fun to play either alone or with friends and there's a ton of content here for a downloadable game, enough that most people will likely never actually finish it all (either due to quantity or difficulty). Hunting for loot is addictive and the game itself is filled with humor. Much of the loot is silly in nature and every item has a description with some kind of joke or pop culture reference in it (the series of freeze rays contains modified lyrics to ""Ice, Ice, Baby,"" for example), so there feels like there's always another neat treasure to uncover, even if it's an item you'll never actually use.Shoot Many Robots succeeds in being highly fun. Apart from some minor annoyances in the inventory system and difficulty balance, its challenge, sense of humor and deep customization options make for a great game with long legs and huge potential for future expansion with DLC. Old school shooter fans should take heed. "

												I hop in my sweet RV, grab the gear I have and head out on the road to stop the massive invasion of robots before it’s too late. While battling the pesky pieces of scrap I come across many more weapons and gear to help me become more destructive and cause lots of more mayhem. This is my long mission of harder and harder destinations to save humanity and rid the world of worthless scrap metal.Shoot Many Robots is a 2D shooter, with 4player co-op where you try to survive thousands of drive you crazy robots, while leveling up, collecting bolts to buy bigger and better weapons and gear to help you throughout this difficult task. There are three difficulties to make your way through which have an assortment of levels you earn a star rating. There is only a small variety in the stages in the whole game so you will be seeing the same scenery a lot but just under harder conditions. Stage types are get to the end of stage with only flag at end or some with a boss, and survival style where you go through rounds.Graphics and design wise I really liked it. It was filled with humorous gear like a baby stroller that you carried on your back, a gun holster with no pants, or a space helmet. Each one had certain attributes to help or hurt you. Guns ranged between the standard fare of machine guns, flame throwers, pistols, and rocket launchers. You were able to equip a main weapon, secondary, head, backpack, and pants. This gives you lots of variety and can turn out pretty funny.Gameplay was fantastic and very challenging. I made it through all the normal and hard difficulties but had to give up after a few insane levels since those are made for co-op play. There is no story to worry about just one you create. I only had two issues with this game which was the dead online community and no controller support. It takes some getting used to paying with keyboard & mouse.I recommend playing this game as it can be a lot of fun especially if you have some friends to play it with. If you don’t own it yet you can find it pretty cheap quite often too so don’t miss out on this one.Bear Rating 8/10 "

												So Shoot Many Robots is a game where you play as a drunk hillbilly commiting mass robot genocide with his also drunk, also hillbilly heterosexual life partners. I'd end it there but let's go over some other stuff.PROS:* Large selection of weapons and armor (hats, shirts, and pants) lets you diversify your loadout* Primary weapon ammo is infinite, so that's all the more reason to spam M1 and mow everything down.* Secondary weapons are actually useful, their power only slightly nullified by having limited ammo.* Powerups are pretty useful and come by fairly often so that fights aren't too challenging if you prepared your gear right.* When gear crates drop, they don't disappear, so if you're getting swarmed you can just take them out and then grab it. Just be sure to hit a checkpoint after you pick the crate.* You can put on fishnets and said fishnets are endgame gear that boost your power by like 200 or whatever jesus christCONS:* Besides actively seeking other people out, this game has kinda nobody playing it. This makes my antisocial tendencies burn.* Finding gear in the form of crates, especially lategame, is a chore. Apparently there are specific loot tables for each level, but that doesn't really help.* Insane difficulty has, true to it's name, an insane difficulty ramp up from the previous levels. You better be prepared and bring along some friends for the ride.All in all, good game. Buy it. Right now. Game requires no pants to play.			"

												I remember playing this game on xbox 360. A nice light hearted run and gun that you can enjoy with your friends while you share a beer or two. So when I found it on steam I immediately bought it, making the foolish assumption that it would support controller. It did not. I tried 3 different softwares to make my controller work with this game. But thanks to the cumbersome control layout on PC, none of them worked very well. The devs have paid no attention to this since the start and as a result I'd call it abandonware. They either have no idea how many sales they missed out on because of this, or they just don't care. Demiurge studios. Remember that name and the next time you're about to purchase a game by them, do consider if you'd instead get more joy out of watching your money swirling down the toilet instead.			"

												Shoot Many Robots is one of the most self-explanatory game titles I've ever run into.  You do missions and your goal is to shoot robots.  While that sounds rather simplistic, there's a lot of variety in the game to keep you going.  There's a good amount of enemy variety and a mechanic that lets you punch to reflect projectiles.  Robots drop money which you use to buy upgrades, and new upgrade unlocks can be found randomly in levels, from various pieces of clothing to new crazy weapons.  You can end up in some pretty wacky outfits, like a giant sombrero with fishnet stockings and fairy wings.There are a good variety of levels, from standard platforming levels to enclosed survival levels, with some decent variety in both types.  Playing with friends is recommended as you can easily get overwhelmed, especially in the later levels.  While generally well-paced, I find the balance to be skewed on the later levels on insane difficulty.  The problem is, you need the very best gear to complete these levels, yet you can only find those items on the very same levels.  It puts you in a very tough position.Overall, I very much enjoyed this game.  It's great for quick coop fun, just make sure you don't play with anyone with a flaky or laggy internet connection, because one person lagging will cause everyone to in the game's synchronous peer-to-peer networking model.

												The best way to describe this game is Metal Slug with 3D graphics and a loot system similar to Diablo however better in many ways.  Each thing you can equip not only changes the appearance of your character but also has meaningful statistics.  We are not talking about 2% to crits we are actually talking Meaningful upgrades.The graphics really surprised me,  I thought i'd seen great polygon powered 2D graphics but this is easily the best.This was quite a surprise and I love it.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes games with tons of loot with contra/metal slug style gameplay. "

												This might be too obscure of a reference, but like, this game is to Contra or Metal Slug as Jets'n'Guns Gold is to Gradius or Life Force. Basically, same type of gameplay, but a meta-system of upgrades and leveling which feels unnecessary to the original gameplay it is an homage to, and which allows you to grind your way through the game.Now, I love grinding. I beat 7th Saga. The US version. five times. Once with a single character, alone. So if anyone knows grinding, it's me. But grinding in RPGs can be fun because RPGs are designed around grinding. Side-scrolling platformer-shooters are not. They're designed around memorization -- memorizing enemy patterns and when exactly they'll appear in the stage is supposed to be the equivalent of grinding here. But this game doesn't require much memorization, it just requires that you are tuff enuff to walk your way through everything.Nonetheless, I enjoyed this game. I don't think it's a very good game, but it's an enjoyable game, especially when played with a friend, or played casually. So against my better judgement, against everything I know about how games and gameplay work, I'll give it a thumbs up, just because there's nothing particularly terrible about this game. It's not in the company of the games I give negative reviews to. But it's also not quite at home with the games I give positive reviews to. It's more in Final Fantasy: The After Years territory -- a game to play after you already played all the good games in a genre, and want even more games in that genre and have to start getting into the mediocre ones.

												Shoot Many Robots is a fairly fun arcade shooter that seems to have gone more or less completely ignored, which is sad. I will warn people before they buy it, though, that despite looking like it has free aiming, it's really more like janky 16-way aiming.Also after playing it through to the end of the second difficulty with Umb, I had to revise my opinion because the game's difficulty scaled up and fun scaled down to the point where I can only say bad things about it.

												Shoot Many Robots is a simple arcade platform shooter that doesn't take itself too seriously. it provides some decent entertainment although it's dependency on multi-player and grind will shorten it's lifespan greatly.The concept is quite simple. You have a character with a gun in a 2D world. You can jump and shoot and move forwards and backwards. Once you understand this basic functionality the game starts spawning enemies, lots of enemies. The games experience/money system depends on you maxing out your kill chain and keeping it maxed for as long as possible.In between missions you will get a chance to buy stat improving equipment and new weapons, most of it which has some of the most ridiculous models you can think off. The ballerina skirt in particular comes to mind.That is pretty much all there is to it. There are some slightly more advanced moves such as sliding and slamming into the ground that is unlocked with certain equipment but neither are really necessary unless you are going for high scores.The multi-player dependency I mentioned is where the quality starts to decline, the game is made for 4 player coop but there is no system for playing with anyone outside your friends list and unless you can find someone to play with the game will quickly become stale.Another problem is the fact that you max out both equipment and experience long before you've actually finished the game leaving you little reason to continue playing beyond a need for high scores.All in all Shoot Many Robots is a fun little game and nothing more than that, if you have a couple of friends to play with it can be a great way to coop a little without the risk of a teammate ruining your day, for someone that plans to play it by yourself it is not a game to recommend however.

												Solid coop hit from XBLA back when that was a thing.Your junkyard gets invaded by killer robots, and being the redneck socialite you are, naturally your first reaction is to shoot everything that isn't human. Great gameplay, terrible story. Very high on the replayability list and coop is absolutely the place to be in a game such as this.Extremely varied and wacky ""upgrades"" make for a fun, refreshing and allround extremely entertaining coop sidescroller.If i recall ight, even the soundtrack was a blast.

												It starts off giving you a good ""metal slug"" feeling, where the game is challenging yet fun and plenty of stuff to blow up, but as you level up it gets increasingly harder to the point it becomes impossible.Drop rates for inventory items is unesplicably and unreasonably low for a simple game like this, letting you stuck in a situation where you can't progress in the campaign because the enemies are just too strong and you are forced to play older missions over and over again hoping for some good item that could help you.I did almost 30 games without ever finding a new item.This totally kills the game, turning a somewhat fun experience into a frustrating repetitive and insanely hard gameplay.2/10 Removing from PC			"

												So for what reason you choose youre stuck at home, snowed in, got a few days of time to kill and youve beaten your latest AAA game. Lets consider your options!	 go to sleep, always good to get rest never hurts to take a nap, but that wastes time and you could be doing ANYTHING more productive. You could go outside, depending on weather and your idea of what is good, bad could be a great idea, i dont like the cold, myself Buy a cheap sidescroller and kill lots of time and shoot many robots.I chose the last of those three, and i was not dissapointed. The game has plenty of crude humor and lots challange without being one of those ""the enemy cheats  to make it harder games""The game has its pros and cons, like any game, considering the name of the game, it is grindy, lots of robots, lots of shooting and plenty of explosions.The game has a large variety hats, guns, primary and secondary, chest equipment and lots of suspect pants options,(including no pants at all.) there is a good amount of chaos in later levels requiring a keen eye for gaps and a readiness to jump/slide/punch. The leveling system is simple and really doesnt take long to level up.When it comes to the negative, i like to keep it simple and factual. (with more bullets) No controller support,  going for certain types of weapons is difficult since it's always random on two levels if a weapon drops and if its the one you want,  aiming up can feel off center and sometimes the aiming seems to get stuck at certain angles the stages and final bosses are recycled in each area which is slightly dissapointing but they seem to be more for closure purpose than any actual substance.In closing, this game is a fantastic time killer or outlet for frustrations, lots of explosions lots of weapons with which to cause them. If you enjoy side scrollers, or shooter games, certainly worth a look, Here's hoping you enjoy yourself! "

												A very good happy-triggerin' Side-scrolling shoot em' up. it reminds me of borderlands 2D with more ennemies. Alot of customization; weapons, secondary weapons, HATS(!!!!!!...oh god)Armors, Pants, backpack which gets you plenty of stats such as; attack%+, crit%+,higher jumps, longer hangtimes, farther slides, more hp and such.features 3 diffculty, a score system, leaderboards, and stuff.A must own if you're playing this Co-op.Downside is that, achievements(so far) are easy and lazyNo in-game chat(what the ♥♥♥♥?) The game is mic-able though.Overall:7.5/10(single player)8.5/10(multiplayer)			"

												This game is a complex euphamism for societies self destructive cycles. The robots represent the government, corporations and education, and the player stands for the budgets ( varying depending on the amount of players, the colors are important). When the player ""shoots many robots"" they are implying embezzlement in the system (of government, schooling systems, etc.). If there are two players (green and blue) it is the taint of the bloated paycheques of the corrupted police force. Adding a third player (red) with these first two factors shows the unheeded violence the police are payed to carry out for the government under the veil of ""keeping the peace"". The fourth yellow player is chaos. The chaos that the government funds and keeps cycling through our society to make sure we keep drinking their government water and buying their chosen government brands in their controlled, corrupt society.-Has good customization-Fun multiplayer-Very satisfying gameplayWould reccomend.

												This game was originally developed for Xbox360/PS3 and was later ported to the PC. Shoot Many Robots is a ""run-and-gun"" shooter like the fairly well known abandonware ""Abuse"". Surprisingly even though it was developed for the console it does not appear to support USB controllers although as a PC gamer I'd prefer the keyboard/mouse on a run-and-gun game. It would still be nice to have the option for a controller.Shoot Many Robots can be experienced both as a single player game as as a coop game online. Sadly along with the lack of USB controller support this game does not support local coop. Dispite these shortcomings the game is fun and reasonably well put together. There are a lot of different weapons and items available to unlock. The game is pretty easy to pick up but pairing items with weapons provides some interest. The gameplay can be a bit repetitive as there are only a handful of settings, enemies and bosses which get recycled throughout the game. Upon writing this review I have put in just under 6 hours of gametime and I have only played single-player. I would recommend this game, but don't expect anything lifechanging.

												An okay shoot'em'up platformer which can be fun in co-op mode.Warning: It has it's downsides! It will be very repetitive after a while. Also a massive grind if you want to unlock everything. You also need perfect gear to be able to beat the game on insane. The story... well, let's say it's non existing. The stlye itself is very primitive as well.The biggest issue I had with the game is how aiming works. Basically you can feel the effect of the game being made for consoles as the aim appears to ""lock"", almost like a D-Pad mode. This makes aiming frustrating and incapacitates sniper and low speed weapons a bit. It's best to have some AoE and faster attackspeed.One note regarding launch options - you must set the following launch option to avoid some ugly facebook integration that causes game crashes: -no_duckduckDo this by1. going into your library,2. right clicking the game in your list,3. select properties,4. click on ""Launch options"" and paste the following in there:-no_duckduck			"

												This game has seen better days, and while it still is a decent little title, the fact that most of the commnuity moved on to new things pretty much taken out a very major chunk of the game with it.Shoot Many Robots is a 2D shoot-em-up with minor platforming elements where you play the role of a hillbilly trying to survive during a robot uprising. When you begin, you have nothing but a nailgun and the shirt on your back, and hardly any combat experience whatsoever. But as you play through the game, you'll gain XP and gather up loot drops to make your avatar dish out more pain with a selection of snazzy weapons and outfit pieces. You'll also come across stronger robots as well, as well as a handful of new models that'll make surviving harder, unless you took the time to replay older levels to level up and hopefully get better loot drops.In the beginning, the game is quite a fun little romp, taking on robot hords while collecting new toys along the way, taking on each chapter with a brave heart and a itchy trigger finger before facing the final boss (Who will kick your butt if you don't move quickly). However, that is only for Normal Mode. Hard and beyond are not so much fun as they are a frustrating, soul crushing journey that'll make you wonder ""What was I thinking?""Remember what I said earlier about how when the commuity took something with it when most of them moved on? See, when playing Normal Mode, that is pretty much the ""Single Player mode"" of the game. Anything higher, however, and you WILL need a partner or 3 if you are ever going to have the slightest hope of beating the higher levels, let alone survive to even beat one chapter of the higher levels. Back then, there were plenty of people to game with, but nowadays it is generally empty, meaning unless you have a pack of friends with you, you won't be able to take on the higher chapters unless you did some SERIOUS grinding, and got some really powerful loot to boot.Speaking of which, there are a few issues with the loot itself. In the case of weapons, while there is a nice gallery of weapons to pick from, a lot of them are mostly just upgraded versions of older weapons. If you took out all the upgraded weapons, you would be left with a much smaller selection of guns to pick from, albit still plentiful enough to give you plenty to experiment with. However, depending on your situation, certain weapons are outright useless compared to others. Playing by yourself, you want to have a high rate of fire, something that tommyguns and flamethrowers can offer. Other weapons, like a battleship cannon or various shotguns, tend to falter in singleplayer because they are more aimed at support roles rather than solo roles, which is disappointing.What is also disappointing is the fact that outfits are not just for looks, but have some powerful stats to make your game much easier. This stinks, because if you wanted to make a Rambo lookalike, you might end up holding yourself back, and at some point you'll find it impossible to progress unless you dress up as a princess complete with fairy wings. In TF2, you had the freedom to wear any items you wanted without worrying about stats, allowing you to make your own personal avatar. Here, you can't make something that suits your personality, and rather must conform to what outfits give you the best bonuses. Weapons are not the only thing that repeats either. Levels tend to be reused quite a bit, let alone the enemies. While they do get new models as you progess, just like with the guns, they are still pretty much the same enemies. It even goes so far as to reuse the bosses you fight. Due to the minor RPG nature of the game, don't be surprised if you end up having to revisit the same chapters to grind for money, XP and loot drops before being able to progress just a tiny bit further in the game. In general, this game is far from perfect. While Normal mode is a blast to play, anything higher than Normal you'll probably never get to enjoy unless you gather up a well trained party to play with and have the best gear money (or in this case, bolts) can buy. On the other hand, if you are looking for a simple game where you mow down hords of robots with a gatling gun, freeze ray, or even gnome missle launchers, I suggest you get it on sale. It is not great, but I still think it is worth experiencing at least the first 1/3 of the game. And if you have friends, then congrats, you might be able to go deeper into the game and see just how far you can go before you hit a wall of rusty steel.			"

												Shoot Many Robots wants you to... well... shoot many robots.  It's a straightforward action title where you just have to kill a seemingly endless wave of robots. I do not consider it anything special. Games like these have been done to death.While killing these many, many robots, you're being awarded XP. Having enough XP will level up your character, allowing you to buy new gear and weapons. These new weapons and gear have different stats, and it's fun to combine these items. It's a cool idea and it's not just a visual thing.One thing that frustrated me was that, while playing, the game automatically changes weapons every now and then. No, not when running out of ammo (it does, but that isn't the issue here). Out of nowhere. It's quite annoying.Frustrating things aside; if you're looking for a mindless action title Shoot Many Robots might just be your cup of tea. It has pretty graphics ![Rating: 68/100]			"

												A fun little side-scrolling shooter with sufficient mechanics and its own personality. You use WASD to move, mouse to aim, space to jump. You know the drill.The goods:The mechanics feel pretty good for the most part.Lots of ways to customize your character & play style through gear acquisition.The graphics are sufficient for the game's price point and age.The music and sound define the game's attitude very well and contribute to overall immersion.The bads:The enemy variety is a tad lacking and becomes a bit repetitious.The game's formula doesn't really change up to much. It's either walk to the right and shoot everything with one of your two guns or jump around this little area and shoot everything with one of your two guns.There's no longer a player base. This may not be an issue if you already have a group of RL friends who'll be accompanying you.The humor/character/personality of this game is a bit sophomoric. It feels like it's targeted at pre-teen children. ""Look, I'm drinking beer to regain health! How edgy and/or hilarious!""The game is a grind. You have to defeat stages to acquire nuts to spend on gear. You have to gain levels to unlock the ability to buy the gear. Additionally, you will be replaying stages multiple times that are likely to grow stale by the end of the first time you play through them.Overall, I do like the concept of this game and its core gameplay. However, the overall level design and variations on gameplay are really nowhere to be found, and it severely punishes the game's longevity. I think playing with friends would help in that regard, but is there any game that doesn't hold true for? I give it a 65/100. I'm really close to recommending this game; I don't think it'd take much more content to make it loads of fun given it has such a strong gameplay foundation. But as is, I don't think I'd play it again outside of the <6 hours I already spent on it.			"

												Ok, I have to be mean!  This game is port from XBOX360.  It's available in XBOX LIVE.  It's a great game...on XBOX.  Here on Steam the DEV's have basically told all of us PC gamers to go ****-off.  I have watched this game for years, and still NO CONTROLLER SUPPORT!   They already had to do it for the XBOX, but putting in the small ammount of extra time it would have taken to add controller support was just to much for them.  I have played the game with just mouse and keyboard, it's still a kinda fun game, even with out a controller!  But it would have been way better if I had been able to play it console style with my GAME CONTROLLER!!    This state of this game is not Steam's fault.  The DEV's of this game just took a successful game from XBOX LIVE,  and dropped it with as little effort and attention as they could get away with.    it is playable but dissapointing if you had any hopes of ever seeing on PC with game controler support!   It's not like it's even that hrad to do.  Windows has had a game controller wizard for at least the last 5 windows OS's,  maybe longer than that!			"

												The Good is that it's hilarious, frantic, and fun. The bad is some of the frustrating design flaws, such as being dependent on hitting back enemy bullets when the screen is covered in enemies, obstructing your view of the tiny red bullet which does the absolute most damage out of any enemy attack in the game while also making the player depend also on random chance to get weapon drops to even survive in later levels. The odds are you get a useless currency bonus and rarely a useful weapon.Fun, but incredibly flawed and frustrating.			"

												It's fun. I haven't had this much fun in a side scroller since Contra or Metal Slug. It doesn't exactly revamp the genre, but it does have a fun redneck style atmosphere. The game got a few chuckles with some of the missions and item descriptions. Not much else to say. The character customization is decent, the levels are fun but can get a little old, there is a lack of a lobby which is very very annoying and probably the biggest flaw with the game. It gets to be a bit of a cluster♥♥♥♥ with all the enemeis shooting you at once so it can be a little hard to see, but maybe that's just me. Anyways, it's a welcome new edition to side scrollers, and if you like the genre you'll probably like this. 7.5/10.			"

When you do get to put the game on low, you still wonder what the hell is going on. Maybe someone is using your computer to mine bitcoins. 2. No kind of content. The game is revolved around 5 different weapons and the same maps over and over again.3. No replay value. Conclusion: This is a complete waste of 10 dollars. Looks like the devs were looking for a quick buck. It's  quite a shame, really. This game had so much potential.			"

												Imagine going down to your local arcade and playing the hell out of your favorite fighter cabinet.  You know the one, the one with the sick ♥♥♥ joystick/button setup that we all wanted in our homes but could never get as kids because we were idiots and didn't realize how easy ripping people off and selling drugs was to get money to buy one.  Could have been Mortal Kombat, could have been Killer Instinct, could have been a Street Fighter variation, but you know which god damn cabinet I'm talking about, and you distinctly remember thinking how awesome those four/six/eight buttons were, the ones that made our at-home controllers seem like trainer controllers, and reminded us that there was some big, bad mother♥♥♥♥ around the corner that had that button layout down pat, and knew all of their characters special moves and combos, and knew exactly how to defend against whatever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you brought to the table with two punk ♥♥♥ quarters.Now imagine ripping off your first chump.  We'll say it's your 9th grade English teacher, Mrs. Mullins.  She was always a ♥♥♥♥♥ anyways.  Well, you sold her some dog turd grass mixed with oregano for $20, and know you've got a pocket full of quarters weighing your pants down so hard that you strut a ♥♥♥♥in Sante Fe lean all the way to the arcade, excited beyond belief at the infinite tries you have to learn all the combos, special moves, fatalities, and become one of the cabinet ghost stories, a legend of the arcade.So you walk up to your favorite cabinet, and instead of that incredible joystick/37 button setup, it's one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ balls sunk into the countertop for those stupid bowling or golf games that you find in bars and gas stations, and the game expects you to continue as normal with just some half sphere, blandly and blankly gazing into your soul.  This game is exactly like that.  Don't buy it.			"

												Cheap ugly sub-par 2D run'n'gun shooter that tries really hard to be 2D borderlads. The best part of it was local coop. It was unbalanced dull mess of a game that was saved by it's loot system (crappy but working) and multiplayer for drunk parties.But. This is PC. And devs are complete idiots (that's why Demiurge studios are outsource company that does others laundry, SMR is the only fully-their game). They've cut both local coop and gamepad support because 'it's better that way' (I'm not kidding, that's official statement). Guess what's left: cheap ugly sub-par 2D run'n'gun shooter no one plays and nor should you.Play console version instead if you really want. Because why play crippled and cut version?			"

												Take a wild guess what you do in this game...Double jump only works half the time which is a massive problem on some fights. The last factory boss on hard mode took me six aggravating tries because double jump only worked some of the time and I kept dying in the fire since double jump is how you get to the platforms. I want to say ♥♥♥♥ this game and not even review it because of that. It is a horrible, unacceptable problem.A pretty fun game for one playthrough on normal and one on hard, however it is not good enough to bother with insane mode. Besides, the only reason hard was harder than normal was because they make you take massive dmg with each hit and make the enemies take more dmg. It requires no extra skill on the players part, just more jumping and more firing and better gear that gives more +dmg bonus. Both normal and hard modes were pretty easy besides the problems I am about to spit like a rapper spitting some dope ♥♥♥ rhymes.At the end of normal, the last boss fight almost ruined it for me, and sorta actually does because you don't fight the boss. You just run from him then it's the end of the game. The last boss was horrible: I ran right and got to a box pyramid which it gives you about 3 seconds to ascend it or the boss charges and 1-shots you. After about ten tries I got it but then it still gets worse. You have to ascend more jumping platforming while he is chasing you up and one milimeter of a misstep means death. After about 20 highly aggravating unfun tries I beat it. But it sucked so badly because during the regular game, not including the survival stages, I died only once. It does not surprise me though because I do not think I have ever seen a single indie game in my life get a final boss fight right.The games biggest flaw, besides mind jarringly generic guitar rock music that made me want to rip my ears off and run them over with a monster truck, is that it is probably the biggest cop-out offender of a game I have ever seen. It recycles levels and bosses over and over again and one boss fight even copped out so badly it just made the boss explode when I got to him then the level ended in victory. The last boss fight is easily a contender for the biggest cop-out in video game history. After about 4-5 hours of gameplay and killing what seems like tens of thousands of robots, the boss chases you and you run to the right and up then the boss dies and you beat the game. That's what they give you for a last boss lol.There are three difficulty levels: normal, hard, and insane. I have beaten normal and hard and since hard was the exact same levels as normal, I am going to pass on seeing them again. However although it has been uninstalled and I will never play it again, it was well worth the cheap sale price I paid for the amount of fun I had with it overall. Not including double jump being broken sometimes.Other than all of this ignorance, I had a lot of fun up until the last boss fight. If that part didn't suck so horribly and the game didn't cop-out a lot and recycle everything, and double jump didn't work only half the time, I would give this a 8/10. As it is, 6/10, mainly because of double jump not working right and being such a massive problem.			"

												5/10The game itself is quite okay, feels a bit like Left 4 Dead and Metal Slug.But it only has like 5 different maps and you get to play through each one of them for at least 15 times. Even the ""special enemy waves"" show up at the same spots.So yeah, it's repetitive as hell.Especially when you want to find all items which are scattered around in special boxes that are dropped by enemies or hidden inside steel boxes.But that's not enough, once you've found an item (weapon or head-, torso- or leg-gear) you also have to buy it with nuts (the game's currency) AND you need to have a certain character level.This game may be fun in multiplayer for 2 or 3 times, but it's really unrewarding and way too dull. If you're really bored and don't mind playing through the same levels again and again, just to get a different text at the end of the campaigns (normal, hard, insane), then give it a shot.But play it with a friend or it will feel like staring at a wall for 5 hours.

												This a fantastic game to play with your friends. Hundreds of items offer different playstyles allowing for multiple playthroughs. The game has a rather dull, but funny storyline and instead puts emphasis on the core shooting mechanics similar to that of a typical shoot 'em up and this is what makes the game good; the mechanics. With all that said it is imortant to know that this is a boring singleplayer game and should only be played co-operatively with your friends for many great laughs.tl;dr: Tons of fun to play with friends, boring without friends.

												Shoot Many Robots is a side scrolling platform shooter. It succeeds in throwing thousands of robots at you in many levels that are varied with stubborn personalities. You can shoot (oh, really?), punch and slam your enemies. Its mindless fun with a host of items you pick up along the way. Customise your gun, secondary gun, helmet, body armour and pants . . . yes, even your pants! There's heaps of really cool unlocks and each have different stats, theme which alter the gameplay. There's four-player cop-op which is complete chaos and amazingly fun! Just watch out for the lag if your friend has a slow connection. It's a good game, but what stops Shoot Many Robots being a AAA title is the lack of enemy types and stale survival and boss levels which are quite average and repetitive. Don't let this stop you, with 3 difficulty levels, it's addictively fun with friends, don't pass this up when it's on sale!			"

												SMR is a 2.5D scrolling shooting game that's very reminiscent of the classic Metal Slug games of old. Except now you can go in co-op mode with three other players too.The range of weapons and equipment available for your character is not only extensive, but very funny to choose from. I can safely say that in 32-years of gaming, I've NEVER equipped a main character with a battleship cannon while wearing an astronaut's helmet and a tutu at the same time!Graphically, it's very pleasing on the eye and the attached video doesn't really do the game the justice it deserves. For its price, buy it - just for the mindless fun the game provides. Definitely 8.5/10 for me.			"

												Too easy for it's own good? I basically walked through the first playthrough holding the mouse button and getting max ratings. Challenge was basically beating my friend's leaderboards. Quite some guns to try though, but after a while the appeal wears off. Mostly when you get the upgraded version of the automatic rifle that shoots in a slightly different pattern. Or when the next helmet you can get only does 30% more damage, or gives you two more health pickups, or when it's yet another one with the ""Slam"" hability, or any combination of the above. The enemies have some variety, but they never stray from... well, point your cursor at then until they explode, with the occasional punching back bulelts. Feels like you should be playing with friends to have some fun, but then it'd be even easier(plus, I don't see anyone playing this anymore). Lost its appeal just as Hard mode unlocked, which is a shame.			"

												Shoot Many Robots is a side scrolling platform shooter. It succeeds in throwing thousands of robots at you in many levels that are varied with stubborn personalities. You can shoot (oh, really?), punch and slam your enemies. Its mindless fun with a host of items you pick up along the way. Customise your gun, secondary gun, helmet, body armour and pants . . . yes, even your pants! There's heaps of really cool unlocks and each have different stats, theme which alter the gameplay.

It doesn't support a controller, and the keyboard controls are a little awkward, but it doesn't ruin the experience - just gives you a learning curve.  Your character levels up and you get to use dead robot parts you collect to buy new weapons.  The weapons were very clever and fun to wield.

												Pro:  This game is simple mechanically but is loads of fun, especially on coop mode with friends.  It also has decent replayability: even once you've beaten all the areas with maximum stars, there's still several difficulty levels to work on, and there's always the excitement of looking for new hilarious gear and weaponry or collecting nuts to buy something you've already unlocked.  I still go back and play this game periodically when I'm in the mood to just murder some pixels.Con: Some of the robots in this game are adorable and I really don't want to kill them.  There should be a robot mode where I get to kill the mans instead.			"

There is not a whole lot of sophistication to a game where you play as a redneck who drinks beer to restore health and uses some of the most bizarre, duct-taped-together weaponry in the history of video games.

												Consider this aptly named indie shooter the side-scrolling equivalent of Borderlands. Of course, some would argue that -- unlike Borderlands -- this game lacks an open world, skill trees, and character classes.  However, anyone being honest with themselves realizes Borderlands is extremely lacking in those areas and essentially boils down to a shooter with a lot of wacky guns, thus the comparison.  Moreover, whereas gun effects felt fairly shallow in Borderlands here the carnage you deal with the variety of weapons varies noticeably.  Additionally you can outfit your character with different hats, belts, and pants that augment various effects like sliding, health, bullet damage, jump height, etc.  A very fun budget game delivering visceral robot shooting satisfcation that you'll find yourself returning to for an hour here or there.

												I played this game with Nick at PAX East 2011 because we saw that sign hovering above us telling us that our desires had been answered. Finally, a training simulator for the coming robot uprising. I, for one, do not welcome our new robot masters. I may pretend to be on their side for now, but once they start trying to shoot/slice me, I will ♥♥♥♥ their ♥♥♥♥ up like no tomorrow. I'd prefer to have a less violent relationship with our hard-working metal friends, like Geordi and Data on Star Trek The Next Generation. How many times did Data try to replace Geordi's brain with tiny robots? At least once. But the point is in spite of Data's uppity ♥♥♥♥, Geordi forgave him and they remained best friends. In space. ♥♥♥♥ man, Geordi is like a ♥♥♥♥ing saint. Data tried to kill him, and Geordi forgave him. Data won a game of poker, and Geordi didn't even once try to shoot that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a machine gun while wearing a tutu and fairy wings.			"

												Excellent game! I played this on the Xbox 360 when it went free with the Xbox Live Gold deal, and really enjoyed it for a long time, then, I forgot all about it and went back to BF3, CoD, Titanfall... But then when my friend came over, we playe tons of FIFA 15, Ghosts, all that stuff, but after some time, we got bored. We looked in My Games, and saw Shoot Many Robots (he had played it a ton before too). So we played it for hours. I got so into it, that i checked if there was a PC version on Steam, and YES! there was! Hooray for me!This is a great game, very entertaining, not hard to play, nor to master (just purchase the right stuff), and it's just so packed full of action and shooting many robots that it's just a wonderful game for the person that doesn't have too much money nor games, but wants a new videogame to keep him/her entertained!Watch out though, it's really addicting!Have a nice day and I hope this review wasn't too long, I hope I've helped you out on your decision of purchasing (DO IT!)

Humor reinforces the gameplay, and the wide variety of guns and upgrades creates new playstyles as you progress and unlock increasingly powerful gear. I've gotten 50+ hours out of this game from one playthrough and it's always fun to jump back into every now and then. The multiplayer system is a little sub-par, I will admit, as the servers are slow and unattended. However, this game made for many hours of enjoyable, mindless shooty fun in singleplayer.			"

												Shoot Many Robots is a co-op platform shooter with looting mechanics and plays very much like Contra or the Metal Slug series.In addition, you will be able to customize your character with many pieces of clothing or weapons that can improve your shooting damage, make you jump higher etc. The loot drops are randomized and as such, it encourages you to replay the levels to try to obtain more rare loots.The graphics aren't mind blowing, but they do the job well. Music is a mix of western country style rock. Control is smooth although the jumping style might take some time to be accustomed with.The main problem encountered was the constant network disconnections. Sometimes, it works smoothly, at other times i get disconnected more then 10 times in a co-op game which can be very frustrating. If this game was more stable, i'd have given it a higher score.Overall Rating: 6.0 / 10If you can stand the frequent and erratic network disconnections, this is a decent co-op platform shooter.			"

												Pro:  This game is simple mechanically but is loads of fun, especially on coop mode with friends.  It also has decent replayability: even once you've beaten all the areas with maximum stars, there's still several difficulty levels to work on, and there's always the excitement of looking for new hilarious gear and weaponry or collecting nuts to buy something you've already unlocked.  I still go back and play this game periodically when I'm in the mood to just murder some pixels.Con: Some of the robots in this game are adorable and I really don't want to kill them.  There should be a robot mode where I get to kill the mans instead.			"

												The only hope against a robocalypse is rednecks. While that doesn't sound interesting, it's definitely a fun bullet-hell experience. A side-scrolling shooter that's reminiscent of Contra; Shoot Many Robots is a great game with a metric butt-load of customization. You level up, get new pants, boots, hats, shirts, weapons, backpacks, and abilities and almost all of them are unbelievable. You can wear a baby-backpack, a fruitf***er from Penny Arcade on your head, a shark-fin on your back, and other wild and crazy things. Defintely worth a purchase, it's also a blast to play with friends.+ Fun co-op+ Has an old-school feel to it+ Mature humor for immature people+ Robot killing in an era filled with zombies in entertainment+ Weapons+ All those outfit items+ Soundtrack- Trailer trash saves the world- Sometimes proves too difficult, even with friends- Graphics don't seem all that polished			"

												Consider this aptly named indie shooter the side-scrolling equivalent of Borderlands. Of course, some would argue that -- unlike Borderlands -- this game lacks an open world, skill trees, and character classes.  However, anyone being honest with themselves realizes Borderlands is extremely lacking in those areas and essentially boils down to a shooter with a lot of wacky guns, thus the comparison.  Moreover, whereas gun effects felt fairly shallow in Borderlands here the carnage you deal with the variety of weapons varies noticeably.  Additionally you can outfit your character with different hats, belts, and pants that augment various effects like sliding, health, bullet damage, jump height, etc.  A very fun budget game delivering visceral robot shooting satisfcation that you'll find yourself returning to for an hour here or there.

												I really enjoy playing this game with friends. It is still enjoyable single player but less enjoyable. I do liek the wide array of customization available but find it annoying when I unlock guns or appearal that a 5 levels ahead of me and when I am at a higher level unlocking gear that is 5 level below me. The maps are great to start with but reapeat after a mid point in game the only change is the enemies are more difficult. Over all I do enjoy this game and will continue to play it. I do recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fast paces shooter games but dont have hours to dedicate to a game. This game can be played for 10 minutes a day and the player can still achieve something.			"

												Shoot Many Robots is a side scrolling platform shooter. It succeeds in throwing thousands of robots at you in many levels that are varied with stubborn personalities. You can shoot (oh, really?), punch and slam your enemies. Its mindless fun with a host of items you pick up along the way. Customise your gun, secondary gun, helmet, body armour and pants . . . yes, even your pants! There's heaps of really cool unlocks and each have different stats, theme which alter the gameplay. There's four-player cop-op which is complete chaos and amazingly fun! Just watch out for the lag if your friend has a slow connection. It's a good game, but what stops Shoot Many Robots being a AAA title is the lack of enemy types and stale survival and boss levels which are quite average and repetitive. Don't let this stop you, with 3 difficulty levels, it's addictively fun with friends, don't pass this up when it's on sale!			"

												This a fantastic game to play with your friends. Hundreds of items offer different playstyles allowing for multiple playthroughs. The game has a rather dull, but funny storyline and instead puts emphasis on the core shooting mechanics similar to that of a typical shoot 'em up and this is what makes the game good; the mechanics. With all that said it is imortant to know that this is a boring singleplayer game and should only be played co-operatively with your friends for many great laughs.tl;dr: Tons of fun to play with friends, boring without friends.

Will it be short lived fun?  Absolutely, but it is fun wacky carnage while it lasts.  Solo would be boring, but buy a four pack,  grab some friends, and shoot many robots!			"

												This game is fantastic!  Any fans of games like metal slug or any 2D sidescroller shoot-em-up should pick this game up ASAP!!  I had to force myself to stop playing to write this to let people know that I'm not disappointed by this game, and would definitely recommend a playthrough.  As someone who loves metal slug, this game does justice to the genre, especially since you can customize your character exactly how you want to play them.  Unlocking will probably become a little tedious later, but the nonstop action in the stages I've played thus far have been amazing!  Items unlock randomly as you kill robots, and you get currency by killing robots, so it's not like you have to go out of your way to unlock anything, just play the game!  The game runs really smoothly for me, and the only times I've noticed any slowdown whatsoever is when there's something like 30+ robots on the screen at the same time as me blowing everything up, and it's nothing to complain about.  GOOD GAME IMO			"

												I've changed my review a bit for this game, because I have a problem recommending this.I like this game; I really do. But there are two versions of this game - the console version (which as far as I know was released for Xbox 360), and the PC version. The core difference is how they market them.To be clear, I do recommend this game - but specifically the console version; not the PC version.Console's big pull for sales is multiplayer games, especially party games, and how the console version was marketed included local co-op and a pay store for additional weapons. For the PC version, they changed it so that every weapon is now fully unlockable by playing the game (no pay store), but removed two things that work better on console vs PC: the local co-op and the controller support. Instead, they optimized the game for mouse and keyboard.I personally felt more comfortable with the controller, and I'm a little irked that they removed controller support completely. I understand that controllers aren't a dominant accessory for PC gamers, but generally PC games that can be made controller compatiable have either partial or full controller support, either due to the fact that they'll be ported to console now or in the future, or for additional accessibility. To remove it entirely doesn't seem like a smart direction.As a game itself, it has a lot of content. I think of it like if Castle Crashers had less of a story, but more items. The cover art and the title basically cover the story and the journey: redneck doomsday survivors battle out bad robots and to survive, they need to shoot many robots.Almost everything on your character is changeable, allowing you to upgrade almost everything, or change it out for a different play style that better fits your style, or fits the level.You can play the game single-player, but it works better as Co-op. At the time that I originally wrote this review, I wasn't able to find any other players. To get the most out of the PC version, you'll need a friend to buy a copy as well.I highly recommend this game, but as a console experience. If the developers decide to re-implement controller support and/or local co-op, I'd be glad to recommend the PC version.			"

												Consider this aptly named indie shooter the side-scrolling equivalent of Borderlands. Of course, some would argue that -- unlike Borderlands -- this game lacks an open world, skill trees, and character classes.  However, anyone being honest with themselves realizes Borderlands is extremely lacking in those areas and essentially boils down to a shooter with a lot of wacky guns, thus the comparison.  Moreover, whereas gun effects felt fairly shallow in Borderlands here the carnage you deal with the variety of weapons varies noticeably.  Additionally you can outfit your character with different hats, belts, and pants that augment various effects like sliding, health, bullet damage, jump height, etc.  A very fun budget game delivering visceral robot shooting satisfcation that you'll find yourself returning to for an hour here or there.

												A Metal Slug style 2D shooter centered around collecting nuts dropped from enemy robots. Kill robots using a unlimited ammo primary, limited ammo, but powerful secondary, and a melee attack that can reflect red bullets (that look like red pop rockets). The more robots killed in quick secession boosts or maintains a multiplier meter that increases the nuts gained (which also increases level score, in the form of stars, to unlock harder levels) used to purchase better weapons and gear. The game is very simplistic and repetitive, and I can only suggest buying for multiplayer with friends (or using Facebook app DuckDuck to play with randoms).			"
