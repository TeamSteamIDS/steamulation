												Solid little tactical strategy game.That said, gets repetitive FAST and, in my opinion, in no way justifies the price tag. Pick up on discount only.Also, if you're a completionist, don't pick up AT ALL. There are some achievements that are ridiculously grindy, requiring hundreds of hours of gameplay from a game with like 20 hours game MAX.			"

												If you, like me, are a fan of the genre (tactical turn-based squad strategy games) then this is definitely a gem!Similar games: SWAT 2, Jagged Alliance, XCom-series, Deadline, Door Kickers, Arma TacticsHowever! In comparison to most of them, this game lacks alot of complexity, depth, the missions in this game are quite small. It is rather a small game focused on the encounters, plan your attack and execute it.The tutorial was very easy to understand, the game interface is simple and intuitive.The sheer amount of equipment available makes it interesting to replay missions, being able to try new tactics to finish them.Graphics are quite nice.Sound/music is good.Character customization feels adequate.Good weapon customizations.I understand that the game is converted from mobile, which seems like a good job, however some more hotkeys would be lovely.(Check my profile for screenshots)Reminds me in a good way of classics like SWAT 2.Finally someone who is able to revive the genre! This game coupled with Door Kickers are the only hope left.			"

												As with all iOS games sold to the PC, the lack of actual complexity becomes a glaring issue quick. For what its worth, the game couldn't have been named more aptly. Its a good breach and clear simulator, but has barely any game worth mentioning outside of it. Which is a pity, for the combat is fun and functional, without ever feeling too micromanaging which is often a problem with turn based squad tactics. If devs would actually take a game like this, and flesh it out with an actual economy, politics, base-management, an overall objective or even an open-world perhaps. Basically anything resembling a game outside of the combat simulator, this would actually become a quite good. As with pretty much all games you can play with your thumb on a tablet, this is a waste for PC. Do not buy at full price.			"

												10's across the board. I have to say I wasn't too sure about this game, it looked interesting but it seemed like I would get bored with it pretty quickly, I even considered pirating it first, but then bought it on impulse and omg was it worth it.It is so much fun, stacking up and breaching rooms honestly never gets old. If you're like me and are an avid Arma player, Tactical Shooter and Strategy Fan, this game is right down your alley. It reminds me a lot of the old Police Quest: SWAT games. I hope to see a Breach and Clear 2 someday with the ability to Rope down from a ceiling or helicopter, use a seperate sniper team as support, as well as the ability to use chagres on walls, and also stack up multiple times during a mission. That being said I still love this game and see a lot of potential for future titles.PS. The music is fantastic.			"

												This game is basically Frozen Synapse, except with detailed graphics and soldiers that are modelled after real-life counterterrorism squads. This is not inherently a bad thing, but it should be noted that this game does a few things differently:Firstly, you have less control over your soldiers than you do in Synapse. Sometimes your soldiers will feel like doing things that you didn't tell them to do. This can sometimes be good, other times bad. For example, I sighed relief when one of my soldiers was smart enough to turn around and shoot at an enemy that had flanked him, but other times I wished that he would keep his original target and let his buddies take care of the bad guys creeping up on him.Secondly, there is no way to order your soldiers to wait. This can be a problem if you want to synchronize time-sensitive manuevers (for example, rushing into a room after your teammate's flashbang has blown). You can order your soldier to walk in a little circle to burn time, but that's not always viable when you're pinned down by enemies. This means that the tactical aspect is a little watered-down compared to Synapse.Thirdly, this game has character progression. Soldiers accumulate experience, gear, and level-up. This process is fairly enjoyable, and there is also an extensive character customization system which allows you to pick your soldiers' clothes, hats, weapons, accessories, etc (there are no female characters are available though, which is somewhat disappointing). Synapse had none of this. Fourthly, there is no ""preview"" feature. This is unfortunate, because planning attacks before you finalize your turn is an extremely useful feature in Synapse. In Breach & Clear, you just kinda have to visualize everything beforehand and roll the dice. Sometimes this is fine, as this game is far more forgiving than Synapse is - You won't die in one hit if you make a mistake, for example, as all your soldiers have health and evasion stats that help them survive longer.Lastly, there is no multiplayer. At all. Which sucks. This game seems perfect for playing with your friends, but instead you only have the option of playing against the lackluster AI.So, I'm kinda torn on Breach & Clear. It does some things right, but it is also lacking in other ways. Frozen Synapse is a superior game overall, but it isn't going to give military genre fans their fix of atmosphere the way this game will.In this respect, that's where this game does right - It does deliver a solid tactical experience against a backdrop of beautifully rendered (and diverse) hand-crafted maps.So really, my choice to recommend this game comes down to the question of whether I had fun playing the game or not. At the end of the day, my answer is yes - I definitely did have fun playing Breach & Clear. I'm just glad that I didn't pay full price. I'd recommend you do the same.			"

												Recommended, but only if you really like the genre - turn based tactical. I do like the game, and I will probably get 10-20 hours of gameplay out of it, but I can already spot some problems.- Poor weapon variety. There's lots of AR-15 and M4 varieties, with similar stats, but no AK-47 (despite that you can play as spetznaz) or weapons of other origin than US/west Europe.- Poor gear variety. With a few exceptions, you can add something that adds a single value. For almost the same price, you can get a bonus of 5, 10 or 15. Why would anyone ever buy the +5 gear?- Poor mission variety. 35 SMALL maps. 3 different missions on each (hunt, defuse, extraction).- Bland AI. Nothing surprising about it's moves.- No sidearms, no magazine count, no reloads.- Poor use of grenades. If you want to use a flashbang, then use it on turn 1 and move into the room on turn 2. There's no way to tell your squad to wait until after the detonation before they move in. Which leads to the next point...- Poor ways to coordinate your movements. You can't tell op 1 to wait until op 2 arrives and then move together, unless you wait a full round. Which might hurt your score.- Poor damage model. Everyone always fight to the death. Injuries have no negative effect, armor only adds HP.None of this is game-breaking, but my impression is that they should have added more features and more complexity to the game, and definitely bigger/more maps. At the 15 euro pricetag, I recon you get your moneys' worth but only if you are really itching for this type of game.			"

												Breach & Clear is an interesting marriage of Frozen Synapse's hybrid turn-based/real-time style of tactics gameplay with XCOM: Enemy Unknown’s customizable class-based soldiers and carefully-constructed mission levels, then given a Counter-Strike terrorists-vs.-special-forces makeover - right down to the almighty flashbang grenade.Upon first starting up the game, the player will be greeted by a series of screens to set up their first squad.  They can choose from a variety of different special forces outfits from around the world, from the American Navy SEALS to the German Kommando Spezialkräfte, among others.The player can choose the faces, names, and soldier classes for each member of their 4-man squad.  Each of the six classes has a unique role to play with their special abilities and passive traits, and having to choose which to bring and which to forego should be carefully considered, as it will significantly affect how you approach different situations from that point on.Every mission starts by selecting which entry points to place the soldiers at before they storm the room, or otherwise enter the combat area.  Enemies inside rooms that have no open doors cannot be seen (conversely, every enemy in an outdoor area can be seen), meaning you will sometimes be storming a building blind.  As such, the player has to carefully survey the map layout, note cover near to every door, and account for every angle an enemy might be waiting at before breaching the entrance.  Sometimes it might even be favorable to split your team into two groups of two as opposed to keeping all four together.At the start of each turn, the player will issue orders to all four of their soldiers during a “planning phase” - where to move (and along what path - an option XCOM sorely neglected), what direction to face, what inventory equipment or special abilities to use.  When everything is set, all four men will simultaneously execute your orders in real-time during an “action phase”, as will the enemies act.  Some of the enemies’ actions are proactive, and some are reactionary - especially in response to any grenades you throw.  This is unlike Frozen Synapse, where the enemy soldiers will follow their turn’s orders to a T regardless of what yours do.This also leads to an important interesting factor introduced in Breach & Clear that XCOM notably fails to consider: noise.  Guns are loud, and if you hear a bunch going off in the next room, most militiamen would go check out what’s going on.  Every gun you give your soldiers and some modifications you can apply to said guns have a “noise” trait which affects how loud the weapon is.  The louder the guns in your squad, the more likely an unseen enemy in another room will come and investigate.  This can lead to some real “Oh shi-” panic moments if your men are caught flanked or out of cover when this happens, especially in areas with many closed doors and little cover - such as the living quarters on a cargo ship.  To account for this, the player must carefully position their soldiers to cover the squad’s flanks at all times, or trade in some lethality for low-profile, silenced guns.There is a half cover/full cover system similar to the one in XCOM: different objects in the environment will either provide moderate or significant protection to the soldier behind it, depending on the object’s size.  There is one notable difference to XCOM’s implementation, especially on the higher difficulties: barring sniper rifles, soldiers shooting at each other from cover to cover will often have a very hard time actually scoring hits.  This forces the player to use all of the tools at their disposal to outmaneuver the enemy and gain flanking shots, rather than simply relying on a boosted aim stat.  This really strengthens the tactical depth of an otherwise relatively simple set of mechanics, which is great - it makes the fundamentals easy to grasp, but achieving victory is a very deliberate process that rewards planning and smart execution.The soldier progression and customization system adds that XCOM-like personal attachment to your men.  As the player completes missions, they will unlock items for your men to use.  These items range from weapons and attachments to body armor and helmets to cosmetic-only elements like camouflage and sunglasses.  Each man can also be kitted out with two inventory items - typically a grenade of some kind or a medkit, or a revival defibrillator if your squad lacks a medic.Completing missions will also earn each soldier XP.  As they level up, they will unlock new class-specific passive bonuses and, eventually, a powerful special ability that can only be used once per mission (for example, a Fireteam Leader can provide a “morale boost” that grants a large stat bonus to the entire squad for one turn).Leveling up soldiers also allows the player to choose what stats to upgrade on a given soldier, whether it be how fast they can acquire targets, how far they can run in a turn, the effectiveness of their class bonus, etc.  This lets the player choose whether they want to make a squad of jacks-of-all-trades, or to specialize their soldiers to excel at certain things at the expense of others.  For example, Breachers (the grenade-tossing class that often leads the charge) might find specializing in health and target acquisition useful so that he can more effectively fight as he crosses open ground.With the variety of mission environments offered by the game’s numerous mini-campaigns, collecting a range of gear - sniper rifles, machine guns, loud and silenced weapons, fast-but-light and slow-but-sturdy body armor, etc. - is important to maintaining a flexible force, especially considering that every level can be played in three different scenarios with varying levels of enemy numbers and emphasis on speed.  Overall, the persistent soldier system and surprising amount of content offers a considerable amount of gameplay for such a small title.Despite all these features, Breach & Clear is not without its flaws.  The relative simplicity of the movement system compared to the one in Frozen Synapse - mainly the lack of an option to tell a soldier to wait a couple seconds before moving - can sometimes make synchronizing your soldiers’ actions difficult.  This is especially noticeable when attempting to follow a flashbang grenade into a room; it won’t stun your own soldiers, but it will give the enemy a moment to pepper your men with bullets as they enter before the grenade goes off.Additionally (and this was an enormous gripe that I had with XCOM: Enemy Unknown, too), all the voiceovers are in a standard American English dialect, regardless of which international commando outfit your soldiers belong to.  Not only, but the vast majority of weapons in the game are ones used by the United States and Canada, despite the wide international breadth of options for the men themselves.  This can likely be attributed to the game originally launching with only American and Canadian task groups, with the others being added only later.  Given the size of the team making the game (spoiler alert: it’s pretty small), this is somewhat understandable, but it's still disappointing that I can't arm my Spetsnaz team with the latest Kalash AK-12s and have them bark responses in their native tongue - or at least in a cheesy Russian accent.These blemishes, however, are relatively minor stumbles on what is, at its core, a very satisfying experience.  While the soldier progression system isn't quite as fleshed out as XCOM's, and the unit movement system not quite as intricate as Frozen Synapse's, the two fused together with the game’s own handful of unique features make a very fun and surprisingly deep tactics game that is both easy to pick up and complex to conquer.  For only $15, I would consider Breach & Clear worth checking out for any fan of tactics or small-scale strategy.			"

												2 out of 6 stars. Not recommended.The game just feels unfinished. It seems to have had a few good ideas that never got implemented or got abandoned later. It lacks a lot of essential features of a tactical combat game and some features (breaching charges, flashbangs, no reloading weapons) are implemented in a very sloppy, bad and pointless manner. The game is also short, missions lack variety.Overall the game feels rushed, sloppy and incomplete. I had to check back the store page to make sure its not an early access alpha game. This game had potential, but I'm very disappoint that the devs released it in its current state.If you want a tactical close combat game, go play good old SWAT3 or ""Door Kickers"" which is available on steam and a much better game on the same topic.For a more in-depth review, check the pros and cons list.Cons:- Worst of all, you cannot coordinate and time the moves of your squad mates with one another. You can forget about simultaneous entry into a room from two doors. You can forget about a SWAT-style ""throw in flashbang and then whole squad moves in once it goes off"". This is a real game killer which makes the game lose a lot of tactical depth. - The above point also makes a few weapons (like said flashbangs) useless. You will be using frag grenades 99% of the time. Things like door wedges that were vital in a game like SWAT3 when used properly? You have these here, but the maps are so small and simple and the action so fast and so straightforward that you will never really have a need to use them.The game has a lot of guns, but most of them are unbalanced or useless.- Short and repetitive. There are just 7 maps (Afghanistan, Turkey, China, Germany, Mexico, Russia, Colombia) and 5 missions in each, which gives 35 missions in total. It sounds like a lot, but it is not. Each mission takes just around 05.-3 minutes to beat. These are really very simple missions, forget about complex missions like SWAT3 had. There is also a bomb-difusal mode and a ""evacuate your squad from the site"" more, which sadly take place on the same mission maps as the regular mode. The maps are also uninspired and feel bland, no real mission briefing worth mentioning. No memorable locations.  I think only the china map feels any novel and that's because it takes place on a freighter. The maps just feel laz and unfinished, though the graphics are often pretty ok for a tactical game. - AI is forgettable. I have not seen it do anything outlandishly stupid, but it is static, lazy and fails to ever surprise anyone. - No snake camera or anything of this sort. Most of the time you just need to go into a room and ""spray&pray"".- No CS gas. The game has an option to buy gasmasks for the squad, but its decorative only. Seems like a feature the devs decided to abandon.- No formations. No prone stances, no crouching etc.- No hostage rescue missions.- No arrests or wounds. Opfor will always fight to the death.- No secondary handguns for your team. You just have your main assault rifle and that's that.- While weapons have a rate of fire, they do not have a magazine size and there are no reloads. Very unrealistic and sloppy. Again, this just makes the game feel very rushed.- The cover system (while it has a very clear and good UI) is very hit and miss as far as gameplay goes. Example: I have a wall behind my back, nothing in front between me and my opponent, but the game treats me as being in hard cover because of that wall BEHIND my back. - There are several SF units to choose from, including spetsnaz. But sadly these do not have accurate gearfor the most part and spetsnaz comes with no Russian weapons whatsoever (despite AI opfor sometimes using russian weapons). So yeah, again feels sloppy and unfinished. - Breaching charges are very poorly implemented, you can only use them on the initial entry door at the start of the mission, not for doors withing the buildings. Same with lockpicks, just usable on main door. That is just absurd. Pros: - I like the ""plan moves than have a few seconds go in real time"" mechanic. The game itself is played in turns. You plan your moves, then the actual action occurs which takes several seconds of real time. Then the action pauses, you can again plan moves, then the action real time segment continues etc. This allows for tactics, while the actual turn being played in real time does depict the chaos and ""split second"" nature of close quarters combat. - The whole option of customizing your weapon right down to scopes, grips etc is fun, but again feels unfinished.

												I write these impressions as someone who's played the game on IOS and now a little on PC. Perhaps the closest analog to Breach & Clear would be Frozen Synapse's asynchronous turn-based tactical combat, with a dash of XCOM's classes and SOCOM's aesthetic. Each mission places you in control of a small squad (each country has a small perk, i.e. SEALS have faster reactions). Your team consists of different classes, each with special abilities. For example the medic can heal a soldier or heal himself, the Fireteam Leader can draw all enemy fire to him, the Weapons Sergent can lay down suppressing fire, Intelligence can jam doors. As you level up, your troops unlock new abilities. Your weapons are equally customizable, from optics to grips to gas systems. Limited use gear like flash bangs and snake cams provide more strategic options.Gameplay wise, Breach and Clear is all about the tactics. Place waypoints, aim line of sights, move to cover, cover your angles. Since enemy placement is randomized, you can never rely on one tactic for each level, instead always playing smart and considering how best to approach a room without leaving a blind spot that could bite you in the ♥♥♥. Don't do that, don't plan well, and your men will die. Your missions will take you across the globe, from Afghanistan and Russia to China and Germany, from simply taking down enemies to defusing bombs and reaching extraction points. Each requires you to play a bit different. The tactics to breaching a room is different than setting up to defend an area while defusing an explosive or moving to the extraction area. While Frozen Synapse is certainly more complex, I actually prefer the realistic special ops aesthetic and the laser focus on close quarters combat and breaching compared to FS's sci-fi virtual style. And this isn't some crappy port either. The game runs silky smooth, the controls feel great, and the visuals have definitely gotten a nice upgrade. Setting up waypoints and firing angles feels even better with a mouse than touchscreen.Visually it's not Crysis or Battlefield, but neither was Frozen Synapse. And Breach & Clear makes up for its visuals with cool little touches such as your troopers realistically leaning around cover to fireI'd definitely recommend Breach & Clear if you enjoy tactical gameplay with a realistic edge.Edit: PC additions include new weapons and maps, improved visuals, a permadeath setting, and probably some other stuff I'm not aware ofWill update the review once I've played more, tried out permadeath			"

												Not bad, but it feels so unfinished, it pegs itself out to be a military training tool during the games intro sequence and it isn't, it's an unfinished game. Don't buy the DLC either, it sucks in every possible way, unless you like having green blobs and red blobs moving about a blue screen.The gameplay is entertaining enough, you can set field of view and there is a bit of a tactical element but you can't prioratize targets, you can't tell your men to throw a grenade then move in after it goes off (leading to several instances where one man has thrown a grenade and the other instead of waiting then moving has charged in and blown himself up) and you can't use any form of snake camera to peak through doors. Purchasing weapons is stupid. first you complete missions in the fastest time possible to unlock the 4 star rating, then you need several thousand £££ to buy the gun and the accessories like scope, suppresor, light ect. with the most expensive accessory being superior to the others in every way leading you to wonder why they included the possiblity you'd buy one of the ♥♥♥♥♥ier ones. The stats for the guns vary wildly, with the FN P90 being far far less accurate than a shotgun which is more accurate than the first few assault rifles you unlock and the TAR21 being as accurate as a sniper rifle.The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and comes in one variety, so long as you set your field of view to point at them, even on the hardest difficulty, you will win relativley easily.The levels begin to all feel the same and use the same level design for all three modes of play. this is only broken up by the fact a harder difficulty means more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies and enemy placement is slighlty random (you play the same level more than oce and you know there will be 2 enemies in that room somewhere but are they stood near the coffee table or that bookcase 4ft away) There are enough levels that this isn't a problem though.The tips that appear during loading screens sometimes seem to refer to elements of the game that don't even exist, stating their is a ranger training mode that all teams can participate in when thier isn't. When it doesn't gives these tips it provides out of date or incorrect ""facts"" about the military groups you  can play as.And to top it all off this game is no longer being developed so all these problems will remain, have fun getting used to them.

												First and foremost, I got this game for like 3,74€ or whatever, and for that price it's right on the mark. The normal price of 15€, however, is way, way out there for a product like this. That's why the thumb down. The female voice in the opening sequence is talking about how this is ""the most advanced tactical simulator which revolutionised the world of urban combat and is used throughout the world for training puposes in various military forces"" etc. Well that's just utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, like claiming Paranormal Activity is actually composed of real life footage. I would describe this piece of software as a ""silly little game"", rather than a tactical simulator, and if this is ""most advanced"" I really wouldn't want to see what the less advanced versions look like.Basically you have a team of four dudes (why is it always four? the SAS apparently assaulted the Iranian Embassy in London with some 30 soldiers, against six terrorists. The Russian military assaulted the Moscow theatre in 2002 with some 200 men if I remember correctly...), who you will use to clear rooms of enemies in scenarios which last about 2-15min of real time, and some 7-40 seconds of game time (talk about blitzkrieg! :D) There aren't any terribly complicated tactics or techniques involved, you can tell your men to walk from waypoint to waypoint, stay still, or throw a flashbang or a granade. Firing at enemies is automatic. You give commands to your men simultaneously while the game is paused, and then press OK and the gametime advances by some 5 seconds or so, during which you have no control over what happens. After the 5 secs it's another order-giving turn in pausemode, and so on. There is no command to wait for two seconds and go, which means that when you're about to assault a room you either throw in a flashbang first and wait until the next turn to go in, by which time the effect of the band has already worn away. Or, you can charge in right away with another soldier while another man is deploying the bang, which means that the guy assaulting the room has already dispatched all the baddies and maybe taken some damage himself by the time the flashbang goes off.Completing the missions give you experience which improves your soldiers, and money which you can use to buy new gear and weapons. Some of the gear is strictly cosmetic, and has no impact on gameplay, such as sunglasses or uniforms in funny camos. For some reason one of the bulletproof vests is by far the best, with a +145 bonus to health (or something like that), while all the others have something like +20 bonus to health. And the superarmour is not even the most expensive one, and it has no drawbacks... :D and yeah, in the true videogame fashion, the soldiers have a simple numerical value of health, which means that it doesn't matter how much lead they eat during a mission, if they finish with at least 1 health left they are ok in the next mission. Incredibly advanced and realistic.So yeah, all in all, it's a casual little tactics game, with hardly any real substance and very little flavour or immersion. Maybe the devs made the opening video first, and actually intended to make a realistic tactics simulator, but once they had the graphics somewhat ready they just thought ""f*ck it, anyone fancy a pint? Just wrap it up and publish it on Steam."" I'm glad I only paid that four Euros for it.			"

												Can you imagine directing Seal Team 6 in their takedown of Osama Bin Laden? Well, now you can perform similar types of missions on a much smaller scale with a lot less meaning. All you need is Breach & Clear, which is a tactical strategy game along the lines of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but with a focus on realism. You take command of US Navy Seals, US Army Rangers, Canada’s JFT2, and other highly trained military squads in global missions. Before you even begin the game, there are a number of decisions for you to make, including which of the real-life elite military groups to purchase and play as (US Navy Seals, US Army Special Forces, US Army Rangers, Canada’s JTF2, etc.), what to name your squad members, what their physical attributes should be, and which class each should represent. The chosen classification will bestow the given individual with a related special ability, with more earned as each person levels up through experience. You can also outfit each soldier with unique weaponry, attachments, uniforms, helmets, and the like. Better  equipment can be unlocked and purchased as you progress through the campaign. There are several locations to play, but Afghanistan is the only one unlocked from the start, so you’ll begin there.You are presented with a top-down/isometric viewpoint of a set of rooms wherein enemies are hiding out, invisible to your omniscient eye. Your goal, as the game’s title suggests, is to breach the location and clear it of all hostiles. Most maps have multiple breach points, so you can select where you want your soldiers to enter and how. Each round involves a planning phase and an action phase, much like Frozen Synapse or any of the Rainbow Six titles. For each soldier, you select where you want him to move to, as indicated by circles that appear upon an invisible gridded floor.Additionally, you determine each soldier’s vision cone at each waypoint, of which you can have several in a single turn. This ability allows you to own every angle, as the saying goes. Buttons are available to allow each soldier to use his special ability, too, such as laying down suppressive fire, tossing grenades, and more. When you are satisfied with your plan, tap the Breach button to watch the action play out. Soldiers will engage enemies automatically when one is spotted or they are fired upon, allowing you to see the enemy location from that point forward.  Any soldier standing next to an object is considered to be in cover, with the protection aiding them in surviving a firefight.The action phase lasts a few seconds before you are allowed to adjust your strategy in a new planning phase. The level ends when all members of one side have been killed. If you are successful, you can earn stars, experience, and money. Stars are used to unlock access to gear, weapons, consumables, etc. Experience offers you 5 points to add to each soldier’s stats at each new experience level, which can be used to boost health, accuracy, reaction, speed, etc. Money is used to purchase the items that you’ve unlocked. Each scenario can be played in multiple difficulty levels, with each offering stars to earn. You’ll want to replay each mission several times to nab the stars needed to unlock everything that you can. The gameplay is engaging and it gives you a lot of control over what happens and how you conduct your business. The focus on where to move, when to move, and where to train your focus are the essence of the game, and I applaud the devs for not trying to add too many options that could overwhelm the player.Graphically, the game looks terrific, with an impressive level of detail if you really drill down. The choice to use real military units and real weapons is commendable, as it offers a great sense of authenticity that’s lacking in similar titles. The sheer number of weapon/attachment/uniform combinations available for each soldier is dizzying. The environments have plenty of places to utilize cover and nooks in which to hide. Character animations and movements are great, and you’ll really need to act responsibly to escape unscathed. Switching between a top-down and isometric viewpoint is only a button away, and dragging to pan, twisting to rotate, and pinching to zoom ensure you’ll always have a great angle on the action.All of these options and deep levels of gameplay are all well and good, but they happen to be in service of a game that quickly becomes repetitive. With the exception of the level designs, which are really well done, every level is played exactly the same. You choose your tactics, choose your positions, choose your path, hit the Breach button, and then watch the action unfold. There is very little variation to the gameplay, and after a while you might find yourself getting kind of bored. The lack of any kind of story to put anything in context here just adds to the problem. You have no idea as to why you’re doing any of this, who you’re fighting or even who your soldiers are. The one thing the game does extremely well however is its marketplace. Here you will find a plethora of guns, lights, grips, IR devices, suppressors, and gas systems which you can buy and equip on your weapons. You can also buy various gear that you can outfit on your squad and some of the clothing will even give you a stat boost. If you are the kind of person that loves to collect items like this, then you will find reason to keep going back into missions to earn some more cash.Breach and Clear provides a strategic RPG-style look into the world of Special Operations that provides an unusual spin on both the Strategic RPG genre and the military gaming world. Breach and Clear is a solid title worth playing.			"

												It's not bad, but it's not the best Strategy Game I've played.Graphics and animations are acceptable, nothing too fancy. Gameplay and mechanics are easy to pick up with a ""straight to the point"" tutorial that teaches you what you need to know for first time players, and the experience and customization systems are fairly decent.How does the game play?It's a ""Pre-Planning"" style strategy game that's broken up into ""Phases"", Similar UFO or Frozen Synopsy. Simply put, you start each Phase by giving your soldiers orders, either to move from one location to another, deploy a grenade or equipment, etc. Once you have a pre-planned set of actions and routes set, you hit the ""Breach"" or ""Exicute"" button to watch it play it. It's a fairly basic system and it works fairly well, but the only problem I find with it is that the game's intro boasts about how this is supposedly a ""Realistic Tactics Simulator"" but if your soldiers are suddenly engaged by a new threat, rather than react accordingly or like in UFO halt their last action and pause for you to give them a new order to finish their phase, they just continue to follow the path set out for them. so if you give a soldier or soldiers to breach and clear a room and there's a wall of enemies on the other side waiting, your soldiers are going to continue walking into the hailstorm of bullets and taking hits instead of doing the more ""realistic"" thing and withdrawing back to cover.Aside from that though, it's a decent game. Would I recommend it? Sure, I can definely say that if you like turn based tactic games, give it a try. Personally I think another game like ""Door Kickers"" is a bit more ""realistic"" in terms of CQC Tactics, but this game is decent enough on its own.Overall Personal rating: Fair/Average. Nothing Too special about it, but can't find much bad about it either.			"

												This is definitely a fun little game to play for a while here and there. It has a respectable selection of maps and difficulties, and has a good concept of strategy. It is nothing spectacular, but it is certainly enjoyable for short amounts of time now and then, but it does get a little repetitive after a time.			"

												This game tries to come across serious, but when you play it, it tries to be playful and funny. The game's intro tries to tell you that it could be used for special forces to practice their tactics but has an unlock system which allows you to unlock gold plated weapons that do more damage than the non-gold ones.The interface doesn't feel great and you can't string complex tactics together; for example you can't throw a flashbang and have the team wait for the flashbang to go off before moving.I also didn't have fun playing this game; I found it more frustrating than anything. I had a lot more fun playing 'Door Kickers'.			"

												The game like Frozen Synapse or Door kickers but much more limited than these.Pros (if you consider them as such):* fancier graphics* soldier personalization like choosing skin color and camouflage pattern* variety of weapon parts to upgrade (but most modifications are just different pictures of the same part with the same stats)Cons:* unhandy controls -- I all the way struggled to understand what my soldier is going to do* lack of control -- forget sync ups or waits which you loved in Door Kickers and Frozen Synapse* huge size and resource consumption (relevant for laptop owners)If you like this kind of games and get it free or cheap you can try it but better go for Door Kickers which is really a gem.

												So yes, way better than I thought it was going to be.  XCOM meets Rainbow Six is a fair remark here.  It's not nearly as complex or involved as either of those titles but can be just as fun. I am writing this review approx 3 hours into gameplay and I enjoying every minute so far.  I am playing on Normal mode with Permadeath enabled for the extra tension during the missions.  (note even with perma death you are given ONE chance to revive a killed soldier, you also get increased XP from missions).Each completed mission is given a rating of 1 to 4 stars and you earn cash and XP based on your performance.  As each team member levels you get points to spend on some basic skills/attributes such as response, accuracy, health etc.  and much like XCOM each operator will become specialised in a particular role and have a unique attribute to suit.  You also have different types of missions to choose from such as bomb disposal or terrorsit hunt.  These missions take place in maps accross the world each area with its own unique styling.You use your cash to buy improved weapons and gear which also affect certain attributes such as accuracy bonus with weapon optics. So there is a mini review for a game I only decided to play as an after thought. I might actually complete it!			"

												""Yes"", because there is no ""I don't know"".Breach and Clear is a tactical, turn based, isometric... I dunno, shooter? Can you put this into the strategy category? Who knows, let's go with thing. So it's a tactical turn based isometric thing, yeah got a nice ring to it. Now when going into the game I have to tell you, unless you are as excited about the prospect of breaking doors and killing people as I was, which pretty much sums up the game by the way, you won't be impressed. Graphics are... dated, soundtrack-- well I would comment on it by I was listening to my own music while playing so I really don't remember, I am sure it was alright. The options menu also was lack luster, it sure wouldn't impress TB much. But enough from the technical side of things, honestly there is not much to say about it anyway as you might have noticed.In B&C you start off by forming a squad, you can choose between one of 7 types of special forces from all around the world, and when I say all around the world I mean half of them are from the US/Canada. Anyway, you pick your special forces and create your teammates, each one of them can have different specialities like Breacher, Fireteam Leader etc. Note, that, depending on your type of Special Forces the stats of your soldiers will change.I have to say that when I started the game it was really fun, it felt quite cool to get your team through a mission, though I suppose that they weren't all too challenging in the first place. The game feels tactical, and as you progress through the missions the better your soldiers and your equipment gets, which allows for a different approach while breaching.But here is where the problem of this game lies, it's easy as hell, at least on normal difficulty with perma death. Why? I hear you ask, well first off, perma death doesn't mean anything since you can quit the mission if your soldier died, and oh hello, here he is again. But more importantly, the progression system of B&C is flawed, the higher the level of a solder, the stronger he gets, makes sense right? Think again, since a single mid to high level soldier could probably clear out levels alone without too much trouble. Another criticism I have is that I didn't care much about the soldiers, when I played XCOM: Enemy Unknown and a soldier died, I was devastated, maybe if perma death would work I wouldn't have that issue, but as it stands I do. Not that this is game breaking but it was something I felt was missing.So, what is my conclussion? Well, like I said, I don't know. This is a solid game that can be fun, however I think it got weaker as it went on especially since the two, secondary modes B&C has, Bomb Defusal and escape plan felt kinda boring compared to terrorist hunt(the ""kill everyone"" mode). Did I enjoy my time with Breach and Clear? Yeah, most of it at least. Is it a great tactical experience? Meh...TL;DRGraphics: DatedSound: Ok? No idea, wasn't listening.Options Menu: That don't impressa me much.Gameplay: Solid and simple gameplay, easy to graps. Good fun....Flaws: ....at first, then your soldiers get OP and it gets boring.Notes: Probably a good idea to turn down the volume a bit. Shots are loud.Verdict: Buy it on sale. Then you'll get your money's worth for sure.Price: 14,99€Devs: Mighty Rabbit Studios ,	Gun.

												Breach & Clear is a tactical turn-based squad strategy game. At the beginning it is pretty easy, but on the hard difficulty its a real challange and needs good strategy. The grafics are not the best, but they are good enoth for a game like this. You can completely design your own squad. From their Skills to their weaponcolor/Cloth/Weapons. I would really recommend this game and if you wanna complete all the challanges with 4 stars than you will have to investiage a ton of hours in it ;()  "

												Firstly it's important to note that contrary to its advertising and the game's intro, Breach & Clear is not a simulation. The game has more in common with call of duty scenarios than real life counter terrorism operations. Soldiers acquire perks and weapons are only effective a fraction of the range of their real life counter parts. It would also be hard to argue that the soldier classes bear much in common with real life soldier roles instead displaying strange attributes like the intelligence specialist's ability to disappear. The combat itself is fast paced and interesting. It doesn't often feel cheap except when your squad isn't leveled enough to tackle a map. There aren't any game breaking flaws in the combat system  which is more than most tactical level turn based combat games can boost. The game offers incentives to use fire and movement realistically and the ability to flank and suppress means the player has to keep their team on the move. Perma death thankfully can be enabled which gives a lot more weight to the player's decisions. The game uses a WEGO system for the turns but you'll hardly notice because the AI doesn't move around much. Enemy classes don't offer huge variation but they do provide enough to allow the designers to create some interesting tactical puzzles. Heavily armoured soldiers can cause your team serious trouble if they can close with them and snipers obviously operate at the other end of the spectrum. The graphics are quite nice with your soldiers displaying the weapons and gear you issued them with. Everything is clear and easy to interpret except some more obvious fog of war would be nice so players would be provided with some idea of which areas had been cleared. The spotting system is balls, soldiers can see through walls and some items completely negate the fog of war completely. This game certainly could have taken a few lessons from the original Xcom in that department. The level design is often pretty good but the game's original platform holds it back. Maps are too small and quite clearly were designed with short playtimes in mind. They get better as the game goes on but it feels a bit strange that multi story buildings are absent and the game's attempts to emulate this by making assaults on large buildings take up multiple missions doesn't really feel convincing. The game modes provided are Terrorist hunt, bomb diffusal and escape which are all pretty much self explanatory. They all change up the maps slightly but in the long term aren't enough to keep things from going stale. Bomb diffusal maps feature the ever annoying enemy reinforcement spawns that are the bane of several srpgs but within the context of this game they work extremely well and give the mode a bit more tension. The game tries to keep the player's interest by offering what seems at first to be extensive customization options, but realistically half the weapons and gear offered aren't ever really going to come in useful. The outfitting screen could also do with some work as no indication is given how prospective weapon and gear purchases differ from what is already equipped(unless you click back through some menus). Unequipping all the modifications off a weapon can be quite tedious as well. Besides tactical combat, the game doesn't offer much else and what's there feels somewhat lacking. The potential of the system is never fully explored because the maps never really get that big and the squad size stays at four men. Insertion methods never change with rappling and helicopter assaults never making an appearance. This lack of variation results in the game getting a bit stale after a while. It can feel a bit half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at times too with some design choices(no ability to use smoke is the most glaring one)leading to the player's units taking unavoidable damage in some situations. That said fire and movement in the title generally works well and dumb tactics are often punished. The market isn't exactly swimming in squad level turn based strategy games so this is a welcome addition.			"

 Breach & Clear 	 Pros: + Nifty Gear+ Loads Of Maps+ Three Game Modes: Terrorist Hunt, Bomb Defusal, Escape Plan+ Has a smooth flow to the game. Cons: - Gets Old- Never was a huge fan of the top down or turn-based style in general. Review I have mixed feelings about this game. Breach & Clear is a tactical, top down, turn-based game which you take control of a four squad team. You buy their guns and all the attachments for their guns and the uniforms for them. You actually get really attached to your squad. Seeing them start out with all the same gun, all the guys had almost all the same skills and nothing really separates them from each other, and you are only able to win on easy. After sometime you are then able to buy each of them their own type of gun and special attachments to fit their style. Seeing them grow as a soldier and grow as a squad. It really hurts when one of them get shot down when your on permadeath mode. The game does get old once you have almost all the best gear and it kind of feels like grinding. If you are into these types of games I suggest buying it on sale.This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curationIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

												If this game was in open alpha, I would surely have given it thumbs up. It features a plausible game mechanics, dated but nice  graphics; the missions are fast-paced and action-loaded. However, as with many games that try to avoid micro-management, the developers seemed to forget at times that the game is intended to be played by a human being. There is a ton of interface constraints which I cannot help but call stupid, like being able to throw grenades only at the beginning of the turn, excluding any movement for that soldier, or being unable to command soldiers to wait for a specific number of seconds to ensure simultaneous action. Another issue is balance. To name just one example, the UAV is like a legit cheat which shows all position and movements of all enemies throughout the mission, even inside buildings, which renders the recon class absolutely pointless.But the most glaring disadvantage is the lack of tactical possibilities. I mean, in a tactical strategy, where are the smoke grenades? Where are those nifty hi-tech gadgets like motion scanners? They would be a lot more fun to use than the aforementioned UAV. The scarcity of the tools offered to the player quickly makes the missions monotonous - Breach & Clear, Rinse & Repeat - making the game suitable to kill off half an hour from time to time, but not more.These are all correctable flaws, and it's a pity that the developers released Breach & Clear too quickly, without testing not only stability but also playability. The should have invested more effort into their product.			"

												I really recommend this game, especially for the sale price. It is alot of fun and im not even done with it I just had to make a review for it as it is alot of fun. If you enjoy xcom, but you don't really like the aliens this is the game for you.You choose your squad type from a selection of real squads and you make 4 characters which you can choose different types for like Medic,Breacher,Fireteam leader, etc. and there are 3 gamemodes but my personal favourite is ""Terroris Hunt"" where you have to breach into a building and clear all the enemy's. This game has leveling for your troops and when they level you get to allocate points to stats and also at some certain levels you can unlock abilities for your troops.The loadout customisation is also very good as you go through missions and earn money that you can spend in the maketplace and buy item's like helmets,vest and weapons, as for weapons you can also but addons for weapons like silencers, sights, flashlights and more that all add stats to your chatacter.This game is definately alot of fun and especially for the sale price I really recommend that you get it. And if you do. enjoy :)			"

												First to get this out of the way: No, this is not like X-Com.Yes, both are somewhat turn-based strategy games, but they play vastly differently as in Breach & Clear you plan a turn for your entire 4-men team and then everybody executes these moves at the same time. Including you and the bad guysThat's not a bad thing, however. In fact, it's a pretty neat concept, although not entirely new.  It's always nice to see some varitey in the genre, and only few games handle their turns the way B&C does.Hoewever, where B&C doesn't manage to hit the spot is the challenge.In B&C most missions are either too easy or too hard.If a mission is too easy, you simply ignore all the little intricacies the game has to offer, so for example you rarely if ever set waypoints or plan your men's field of view. Instead, you just charge in, gunning down every enemy on the way.If a mission is too hard, this is often the game's fault, when the random generator for example places one of your men right in a room with four foes nearby, leaving him no chance for survival.I still had fun with the game, but overall I can't recommend it wholeheartedly. There are just too many good (and better) strategy games out there.			"

												I've barely got my hands on the game, but absolutely love it so far. I found this game really suits me for cuople of reasons. One is that it's not overly complicated. You can easily learn and master the controls and fundamental gameplay in minutes after the tutorial. Each missions are not too long, just enough for my rather short concentration. Now, that does not mean this game is shallow. It will give you quite a bit of options you can take, as well as tactical challenges you will need to work around.Second is the Stats/Gear system. You can build your own squad with operators with different class, stats, and gear. Since there are 6 classes and only 4 operators can be in a single squad, you will need to adjust your strategy depending on what kind of operator is available.The third is the overall ""tacticoolness"". If you are firearms/military enthusiast, you will probably appeciriate this game. Most of gears and wepons dipicted in game is realistic, as well as appropriate. Authentic weapons and tactical gears from manufacturers such as Surefire, LaRue, First Spear, LBT, etc... are availble at your operators disposal and you can kit up your team of real-life global warfighters, ranging from 75th Ranger Reg., German KSK, Canadian JTF2, Russian Spetznaz, and everyones favorite, SEAL/DEVGRU. You can outfit Army SOF with BALCS and DCU, give the seals JPC and Airframe helmets. Sadly there are not too many variations at the moment. I hope the devs add more choice of weapons and gears.Some ways, this game really reminds me of Medal of Honor: Warfighter. Gameplay aside, you can feel that the creators of both gmaes defnitely put a lot of effort into military authenticity. However, the gameplay is enjoyable, but ordinally and really not outstanding. Overall, I reccomend this game to anyone looking for casual tactical game and like guns and operators operating operationally.			"

												Very good strategy game, missions are very short, but there are about 50 of them. So about 3-4 hours, then doubled, because there is a room clearing mode, and a defuse mode. Xcom it is not, but it is lots of fun in its own right. Make a team of your least favorite people from your school, give them the worst posible equipment, then send them in on the hardest mission!

												Breach & Clear is the kind of game that is easy to learn, but takes some serious skill to master. While you will spend a lot of time staring at the different locations to put your limited team, once you end the turn and the action starts it's over in a flash. Getting sub 15 second clear times on multiple room levels is one of the fuzziest feelings I've gotten playing a turn based game and the game does a good job of trying to teach you the idea of efficiency of movement.If you, like me, grew up playing the OLD Rainbow Six games, then this will feel very familiar, as you plan out the movements of your team every turn and then they rush to execute that plan. Play with Permadeath on, it adds an element of stress in the later levels when there's some very hard to handle corner and hall combinations that the enemy will easily take advantage of even on the easier AI settings. Great game, 9/10.			"

												B&C is alot like XCom, a bit like Frozen Synapse, a bunch of squad based loadout marketplace and RPG elements and fairly quick missions. There is quite a bit of customization for your weapons, gear giving buffs and negatives to stats. The game also features a lot of real world high-end small arms.There is currently about dozen different level sets, all with unique tilesets and progressively varying terrain and baddies. several different difficulty settings, a lot of replay value I've also found thus far.Mission rewards are dependent on performance, basic indicators. Hardcore & Softcore character deaths are avialable- Die forever or just for the mission depending on how you want your squad to be.Several country SF are avialable for squad creation (more then one squad avialable at a time), each seem to get their countries rifle/basic eqp. of choice in the beginning, which is good attention to detail.If you really liked the core combat system of Xcom, and can for-go all the base building as well as Sci-Fi elements and go for just character customization and being in the current era. I do also recommend it if it goes on sale and any one likes a good RPG-TurnBased-SquadCombat game.			"

												this is a great game, for about the first couple hours; then quickly becomes a repetitive chore to grind through missions to unlock new weapons and gear, and even then after you unlock everything, theres nothing left to do besides play through levels with overly repetive mechanics. the developers promised to proivide steady updates to and improvements to the gaem as well as listen to community response for new ideas to implement, yet with nearly every idea shutdown or ""already in the works"", and month since a developers has responded to a comment, nothing has progressed besides a poorly implemented Spetnaz squad using incorrect weapons and a silly look to them. the developers dont care enough to continue to improve upon their game by adding new ideas and listening to the community, instead they seemed to just want to cash in on lofty goals that they never planned to meet.

												its a good game but sadly it gets repetitive and boring really quick, you creat and play with your fav swat team from different special forces like navy or spetsnaz, there is 3 mods in the game ( terrorist hunting, defusing bombs and escorting you team out of the battlefield) in the same 7 locations yep thats right the same 7 locations, you will play and visit them soo much that you will get bored after 2 or 3h and of course no story mode just the 3 type of missions.leveling the team takes ages and 70% of the achievements are absurd and hard to get, for exemple ""KILL 53,594 enemies"" that's one insane achievement and as prove 0.3% of people have it, you can kill like max 20 enemies per mission so i will let you do the math.the graphics are mediocre nothing outstanding , simple gameplay with basic tactics to use.in the end i recommend this game for those who like strategy games but in my opinion 14.99$ is too much , normally it shouldn't be over 9.99$ so grabe it on sales6/10			"

Interface looks like a direct port from mobile, without a single paradigm adapted to PC mouse and keyboard (except Ctrl+Z, that is): no RMB, camera rotates at fixed angles only, you can't edit given orders (you can only cancel them one by one starting with the last one), you give orders and you select soldirers with the same click (you can do it accidentally) etc...Interface is a real fun killer here. I battle with interface more than I battle with enemy.I would have recommended this game if not for its interface.Can't recommend it on PC, sorry.			"

												This is really quite good.  It rewards thinking, and just when you think you've got it under control, the difficulty spikes, and you have to reconsider what you were doing.I'd really like to be able to use the middle mouse button to drag the map around instead of the left; I'm constantly setting waypoints in places where I don't want to go.  An ability to change the order that your team uses for the inital breach would also be good - the only way I could find to stop my medic being first through the door was to create a whole new squad :(Annoyances aside, this is a less-stressful version of Doorkickers, with a reduced character count, which makes setting up your team just the way you like it more satisfying.  It's effectively turn based (plan 5 seconds, watch 5 seconds, repeat), and I find having a fixed duration turn more enjoyable than hovering my thumb over the space bar wondering whether I need to change plans or not.  The full price is fair, and on sale it's a great buy.			"

												I loved this game on iOS, and was excited to see it come to Android (I have an iPhone and a Nexus 7 2013). When it finally came out for Android, I bought it (a second time) only to find it was slow, poorly optimized, choppy, and hard to play. I gave them a pass, since it is hard to optimize for all the different Android devices out there. But I should have taken a hint. The PC version, from what I can tell, is the tablet version with mouse controls. Woohoo. Everything is way too large, the graphics are unchanged, textures are horrific. It also sucks to start over each time you change devices, as the game is very 'grindy' to get new stuff (expecially when you've beaten all the maps before and are just going through the motions). Overall, when a PC port comes out, at a higher price, I expect something new, not just a ported control scheme. I'd take a refund if I could, but this being Steam there's no chance of that.			"

You have a bite-sized mission structure that allows you play as much or as little as you want with no real commitment to a lengthy campaign.

												military strategy game with lots of potential and managed to do most of the things right too.pros-engrossing! -every time its a new experience. even though the maps are (seem to be) small there are many variables that can provide great replaybility. and after a few minutes you'll WANT to master every map or try it with different loadout or different classes in your squad or just turn up the difficulty level/perma death.music- not many tracks but enough to create that sense of urgency and tension.perma death- level up a soldier to level 15+ and then see him die hurts a lot.progression- unlike many other games where level progession is usually just about higher number in stats, here you can see the difference between leveled squad member and a rookie.  devs have done good job but*(see cons)cons-difficulty spikes- play a map 15 times with perfect strategy - spike the difficulty and see your team getting hammered! the AI literally becomes stupid (like wont shoot while moving when the enemy is strolling right in front of them, their range shortens, enemy AI become bullet sponges even when they have no armor and snipers just become invincible unless you are 4-5 paces away) every now and then you feel that enemy sucker punched you below the belt.absolutely no in-game help- there is one kinda useless tutorial. it teaches only the basic movements. there is no ingame notifications (even about features like market place, upgrading gear etc.) i saw the market 1st time i started the game after that the game never offered/mentioned that i can visit the market place and buy stuff in between maps(and game sucked me in so much that i completely forgot about it). i played 1st four maps(repeated a few times too) and when i came back to main menu i saw the marketplace. another example- i bought a sniper rifle (probably one of the costliest gun) and had no idea how to properly use it(no tutorial). when my 2 snipers died i decided to go back to assault rifle but couldn't sell the sniper :/ really disappointed coz snipers(enemy snipers too) are awesome in this game if used properly. yet another eg. i bought 4 suppressors and 2 different guns(2 each) only to realise that one gun model doesn't support silencer & it wasn't mentioned on the gun's profile page :( which is bad coz money is hard to get in this game AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT!no lone-wolf mode- every time a squad member dies the game forces you to go to squad menu(in main menu) to choose a replacement. only way to play lone wolf is to keep giving 'hold' command to rest 3 soldiers which is time consuming.2nd-tier perks - they just come wayyyyyy tooo late. you get them when you are rank 30 :( and reaching rank 30 is really time consuming. i have just one guy at level 17 and now the progress is really slow.only way to level him fast is to make him kill max. enemy which means putting him at high risk and sooner or later the enemy sucker punch them.(i have lost 2 level 15 guys already)inconsistant point awarding ?!- i am not 100% sure about it but i don't understand how points are awarded after each mission. and the difference here is not of 50-100 points.Overall i would recommend this game to every one who loves strategy military games. if you liked xcom or older rainbow 6 games pls give it a go.

Posted: January 31, 2016
												I walked into Breach & Clear hoping for some serious copy of former SWAT series. What I got was a sort of XCOM copy. Although the games tactics may appeal to you, some of the lack of attention to minor details may upset you. I got this game on extreme sale and would recommend you do too.Plain and simple, this game is no where near the level of what SWAT 3 or 4 was. Still to this day, there hasn't been a SWAT game that has managed to immerse the player as much as those two have. Breach & Clear is a top-down turn based swat action game where your main objective every time is still simply wipe every enemy out on the map. It's fun at first, but the lack of diverse objectives make the game redundant. At the very least, opponents do move about the map when you initiate contact. Meaning, if they are not taken out and you do not having any squad member watching your back, they may sneak up on you. Upon starting a level, the player can scope out what entrances are available and can tell each officer where to start. The game play itself is not bad. You are in control of four units in which you can tell them where to move and how to move. Choosing movement paths was decently done. Say for instance you would like to go down an open hallway as it can be a little tricky sending one unit at a time to deal with the danger. The system in place lets you choose multiple points on where the unit should go (so broken paths) and additionally, let's you choose which way to face. This latter fact is important in providing the appropriate cover for your units. If your unit is caught off guard due to not looking the right direction, there is a good chance he'll be shot and may go down. The movement itself can be modified as a unit can be told to walk slower to increase his accuracy and allow other units to catch up or overtake. Grenades and flash bangs are available to use upon purchase. Yes you heard me right, this police force has to replenish it's supplies after every run. Every time you use it, you're going to have to replace it if you want to use it again. There are some units that are able to throw and continue their movement while some units spend their turn throwing the ordinance. This dependence is directly related to the classes you choose. For instance, a fire team leader has the ability to draw fire, a weapons sergeant can use his suppress fire ability to possibly save a comrade in trouble, a breacher can throw a grenade and continue to move along his path instead of ending his turn, a medic (I'll leave this one up to your imagination) and a direct action soldier can go in quietly. Depending on how you want to go in, it's really up to you to choose what's the best combination. I use a fire team leader, a medic and two breachers just because I like making noise. Each individual can upgrade (level wise) as you progress. You can upgrade stats such as accuracy or speed to improve your character. As well, their weapons can be modified with special sights or with fore grips. What drives me extremely mental in the game is the fact there is a pause after every turn to tell you it's the next phase. I believe that could have been done by being a lot more subtle.The graphics themselves are okay. Their nothing extremely over the top or triple A, but simply okay. The player can maneuver the camera but it can never go exactly where you want it (or if your an explorer don't count on looking around too in-depth). What is nice is that sometimes the camera will go over the shoulder when shooting down suspects or going through a door. The sounds are okay as well. Gun shots sound more or less similar while there is no real dialogue going on. Honestly, it's an alright game if it's on sale. I'm not recommending it because truth be told, I'd rather play XCOM or UFO when I start playing this. I also don't like the fact it's turn based and how the equipment scheme was set up.RATING : 6.9/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ScreenShots  Be ready to see this after every move What a few downed enemies look like Multiple room breach with two separate teams at two different locations  Camera shifting angles Can you see where my units are exposed Multiple arrows showing my breach tactic Camera will often go to this angle when initial breach occurs "

												Awesome. Just........Awesome. If you like tactical military sims, this is a great purchase. A friend gifted me this as a birthday present, but I would probably have purchased it in any event. This game is defintely worth the 17 CDN, if you like turn based tactical games from the third person perspective. Games that are similar to this are Frozen Synapse, and XCom Enemy Unknown. Weapons are upgradeable, tactical gear and equiptment to make your soldiers more efficient on the battlefield are also upgradeable. Enemies toughness and difficulty scale nicely through the difficulty levels. Different nationalities garner different bonuses. I am playing Canada's JTF2 right now and am finding clearing a level without taking casualties a fun and rewarding experience. No crashes or bugs so far that I have found. The graphics are good for the type of game it is, and the sound is well done if a little sparse. Only two hours in but I will not be uninstalling this game for a long time. As of now I have not found anything about this game that I do not like. I will update this review in the event that I do. Recommended. 4/5 stars.+Updated Review at 11 hours of gameplay.+I am really enjoying this game. Absolutely worth the asking price, even more so if on sale. I would like to see a button that returns all unused items, from squads that are idle, to the main inventory, like in Xcom Enemy Within. Aside from that I have no complaints. Still 4/5 stars.			"

When you start the game you have to make a team right away, you can't change game options or anything else first.It's an ok game,  lacking depth.

												Bearing in mind that I bought this game hoping it would be like XCOM...This game's novelty wears off quickly. There are a limited number of maps and the player's missteps can be corrected by repeating the stage. This turns the game into nothing more than an achievement grind once you've learned the maps. PROs:It is very satisfying to enter a room blind and clear everyone in it in one turn. This is done by way of choosing a path for each member to take as well as controlling the areas where they are to look.When your team members level up you can increase their stats. These stats can increase things like the distance moved, accuracy, speed of acquisition, as well as class based skills.CONs:Limited number of maps and enemy placement turns this game into rote memorization.Quickly boring.Neither PRO or CON:Rogue-like in that some equipment became available only after a certain number of stars are achieved. Said stars are awarded based on mission success rating: 1-5.			"

The campaign has been extent to several include several countries (each of which have 4-5 missions) and the wealth of customization options for your squads is embarassingly vast. Buy this game for what it is, a fun, fast paced, tactical romp with great customization. Don't come in expecting something with the depth of XCOM and you will love it.

Being able to fully describe the game in 4 words says a lot about the game. There's nothing special here, nothing to demand your attention, nothing to make this title a ""must play"".If you are interested in tactics, and have at least some understanding and knowledge of Canada's JTF2, UK's SAS, or even the US Army Rangers, you will enjoy this game. The gameplay is quite short, 5 hours seems ok. I personally couldn't see myself getting past 10 or more hours.

Once you have decided that this game is for you, you will find it rather simple and lacking at the same time. Within my 5 hours, I've unlocked every mission from hostage to escape plan. Certainly the variations on gamemodes are nice to see, but the maps feel plain, small, and uninteresting. The maps could have done with more dynamic elements besides having doors that open and close.

Speaking of which, the equipment is also quite lacking. Even though you can play as Russia's Spetnaz, you for some reason can't buy AK-47 rifles? I found that the rifles JTF2 have are quite good, and anything besides them don't really change anything. Sure there are sniper rifles and what not, but besides 2 missions I found myself not using them. Skills and classes seem to become more irrelevant further into the game you get.The UI is slightly different then what you see in the store screenshots, but all in all, the game is average.			"

												Only cost $2 and at the time of writing already have over 2 hours played. Worth the money? ABSOLUTELYWould it be worth $20, prooobably not, it's a mobile port.  At least has WASD for the camera and a few PC graphical features, it is optimized perfectly well.  But it definitely feels clunky, not quite as in depth as Frozen Synapse but it's at least military so I dig that.The customisation is pretty average, lots of options that are very similar to each other, a bit surprised they didn't let loose and add heaps of models/skins/weapons for the PC version, hopefully there's mods out there that fix that.Good fun and feels incredibly satisfying when you pull off a perfect breach and clear without taking a hit.  Good game to pick up for the work PC or if you're travelling or even just bored on your main rig and want something a bit different. "

												Best turn-by-turn game I ever played. You are in another level of concentration when you play this game/simulator (not to realistic but gives an idea on how hard it can be), you are always looking for a way to kill the most enemies while keeping your soldiers out of harm, all, in one turn... This game is something else...Actually pretty easy to get used to the controls and understanding all that you can do (if you play the tutorial also...)Really nice graphics and a nice 3D, the top and in-perspective view are really well made.A nice difficulty on all levels, many types of teams to chose (JTF2, Navy Seals, SAS, etc), a nice variety of weapons, clothing, attachements, etc.3 game modes to satisfy everyone (Terrorist Hunt, Bomb defusal, Escape plan)I would recommand this game to anyone that like shooting games but is a bit tired of FPS in general. I would also recommand this to people that like ''Commander'' kind of games. I would not reommand this to people that dont understand weapons much (Like for the RoF, Dmg, Noise, etc), these factors directly influence how the mission will go, so be carefull...Recommandations: Take the JTF2 team to start, they have great stats for beginners, and later, maybe make another team with another type of background (yes, you can have many teams but not playing them at the same time)			"

Product received for free
												My friend gifted this to me a few years ago, after we were discussing its success on the mobile platform. It really didn't develop much past that. I'd buy it for the current sale price ($1.69 CDN) but I would not spend 16.99 on it.Pros:-Fun, easy gameplay-Satisfying seeing your custom units engage enemies-Different ways to build teams-Good on low-end computersCons:-Gameplay is limited in controls. Either you hold the entire turn, or walk to a certain point. If you have 2 people on either side of the door and want to make an entry without getting them both killed instantly, you need to make one take a few steps back and then move through the door, which hinders how far he can move in the turn.-Customization is good but needs fixing. A JPC does not offer as much protection as over vests in the game, and its just as heavy as some of the other vests.-Fix CADPAT uniforms.-Again, I get this is turned based, but why can't I tell them to wait 2 seconds before entering so the frag or flashbang can go off?That's basically as far as this goes. Again, development did not seem to continue after it made its transfer to the world of PC gaming. It's a fun game, but I'll stick to it on my phone.			"

												First of all let me say, I wouldn't pay the full price for this game.. But if you're a fan of turn-based tactical strategy games & it is on sale, this game is a must buy. I'd probably describe this game as a stripped down version of X-COM. Instead of killing aliens around the globe, you are put in ""raid"" type scenarios against terrorists. Unlike X-COM though, there is no real story, you just complete missions & earn a number of stars depending on your performance. As you gain stars you unlock more levels, gear, etc. You earn silver each time you complete a mission, which you can use to to buy the new gear. You can make more than one squad & you can chose what Branch they are, such as SAS, SEALs & Rangers, etc. You're men level up allowing you to allocate points to certain attributes & they gain perks relative to what they specialise in. At the end of the day, this game is a fun strategy game with a heap of levels & difficulties to play on. The graphics, sounds and controls are basic, but good & overall the game is a great time killer. So I would definitely recommend this game if its ON SALE. I would not recommend it at the full price of $15 which in my opinion is a joke.			"

YouTube™ Video: Breach and Clear Blind Playthrough- Part 1 

			Views: 65		

			An awesome Indie MOUT (Military Ops in Urban Terrain) strategy game. In the first episode, I enable permanent death and clear the first two missions.		

This game gets and deserves much of the praise that it gets.  It's a strategic doorkicking strategy game with enough content featuring 3 modes currently (Terrorist Hunt, Bomb Defusal, and Hostage Rescue/Escape).  You control 4 operatives from the Rangers, SEALs, SpecOps, Speznaz or other such organizations through each area in a series of phases where you issue commands.  The ""special"" element to this game is it's perspective concept and ""owning every corner"" by controlling the direction that your guys are looking as they enter and clear each room.  The shooting on it's own is fully automated if the soldiers are looking in the right direction but it does allow you to aim thrown grenades and medkits only work on nearby allies.  The enemies will react to noise and often charge out of rooms so covering doorways is still a concern (or you can use an intelligence soldier to wedge the door)Certain weapons get unlocked in the store as you achieve a certain number of stars but any completionist out there might want to revist the stages to aim for the 2100 stars achievement.  I found a certain amount of ""violence of action"" was required to 4 star the missions later on.The problems with this game lies in it's somewhat hollow customization options when it comes to the marketplace options as outfitting each unit feels more like equipping Stat-sticks rather than anything new an improved (especially when it comes to gear).  The consumables make the game much easier if you're willing to grind out a few of the previous levels to pick up a few defibilators (completely negating permanent death) and UAVs but for hardcore fans/gamers they might choose to avoid those completely to artificially amp the challenge.  The level up perks and stat increase from grinding experience makes the game a snap for anyone playing on harder difficulties but struggling with a particular stage.The other issue is that the gameplay itself feels tedious as you continue on through it's somewhat repetitive missions of pointing your guys at enemies and watching them do their thing.  The context for the missions is very thinly described on a mission brief but not integrated into the game very well (as you have to escape to the main menu between each mission in order to even read this excerpt).  I found very little keeping me attached to the story or my unit itself without some personal imagination on the ""terrorists"" we're hunting.  I'll still recommend the title for being a foray into something different but it's not without it's own set of issues.			"

												Over all I really enjoyed playing Breach & Clear but as with everything there are always things I would like to see changed or included in the future. The graphics are a port from a mobile game so the visuals do leave a little to be desired, and the stop and start gameplay can get a little annoying after a while. I would have liked to see the ability to view the whole mission from start to finish as a replay that you could save and upload to YouTube (or similar site) later. I also think that with the introduction of a level editor or multiplayer component of some kind, but hey that’s just me. But the biggest issue with the game is actually its price currently the mobile version of Breach & Clear is listed at $4.99 while the Steam version is listed at $14.99, currently it is on sale for $9.99.The games publisher has defended this price difference by noting that everything is included in this version of the game out of the box unlike its mobile counterpart, some fans are still finding this hard to swallow but if you haven't played Breach & Clear yet and don't like to game on mobile devices than it is worth playing especially while its still receiving a discounted rate.

												7/10 It is not X-Com and it is not Fallout Tactics. Here we have some new turn-based tactics game expirience. You plan all moves and action for your team, you end turn, and all action (yours and AI) goes at the same time. It is casual turn-based tactical game, do not expect some deep tactical expirience.Pros: 1. Nice gameplay2. Casual turn-based tactical game3. Weapons and squad customizationCons:1. Not very good controls2. Your tactic kinda limited3. Using UAV is almost cheating =)4. You can't customize vest and helms colors			"

												I really can't recommend this game to anyone who has played Frozen Synapse or any other Game like it before.Seriously,  it's an arcade shoot 'em up with elements of S.W.A.T. and Rainbow Six, nothing more. It's capable of getting you fun for about 5-8 hours but thats it. After some time, when you have managed to get your gear together and level'ed your soldiers up, you're just packing together and waltzing through the maps, spraying infinitive ammo all over the place. This whole game could be fun with proper mapping, a better AI and at least some story elements, but unfortunately, nothing of this will happen as mods or maps can't be installed. Might be the backside if you take a software that was released for another platform and set it up for sale on PC (Breach & Clear was developed for iOS) . If you like an arcade experience in this genre for every now and then, get your hands on it. If you have other intensions, like game play depth, tactical, realistical gameplay and at least some story, spend your bucks somewhere else.			"

												I would like to give this game a nice rating, but since I've bought & installed it, it hasn't worked. I've opened a ticket with their support but I'm awaiting a resonse for 2 days nows. I can't say I'm happy. I think this may end up as a waste of money. I don't even know how to go about getting a refund. So far their customer support is lacking. If things change, I'll update this post.Customer support finally came through. They solved my problem easily,. It took awhile,. but better late than never. For anyone having the input not supported issue, here's the solution:  1) Open the start menu, in the search bar type ""regedit"" and hit enter.2) In the registry editor go to: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mighty RabbitStudios\Breach & Clear3) Modify the following values (*make sure to switch from Hexadecimal toDecimal*):        - Set *fullscreen* to 0        - Set *Screenmanager Resolution Height* to 768        - Set *Screenmanager Resolution Width *to 1024        - Set *Screenmanager Is Fullscreen mode* to 0This will allow you to set the game to run as a small window - you can thenchange the settings in-game to whatever you prefer. Thanks,Breach & Clear The game is great! I wish I had more time to play it.			"

												Breach & Clear started out as a excellant, one of my favorite, iPad games.  I was a little concern about how well it would ""upgrade"" to the PC. I was concerned it would just be a rehash, but to my delight it is not. Full support for resoultions and proper mouse and keyboard controls.A very unique and tactical minded game, highly recommended. Build your squad, load your weapons and gear, and start the missions. As you complete missions you gain stars to unlock more missions and more game modes. Your squad also levels up, allowing you to distrubute points in different areas. And a nice replay feature after each mission.TIP: You gain stars for finishing missions, the better the score the more stars, stars are used to unlock more missions and modes. Don't be afraid to start at Easy level or Normal level, that will give you more stars because you can replay each mission at each level for a full set of stars.Get this game if you love tactical planning and excution. Great job GUN!			"

												This game is fantastic. I know saying ""This game is like X:Com"" seems to be thrown around a lot these days. I don't always agree with people when they compore games to X:Com but this game is spot-on. From the ability to manage full squads of people to customizing almost everyhting about them. You can also choose from a wide array of weapons and weapon attachments in a way that seems to pay homage to the loadout scheme in games like Call Of Duty. It's absolutely simple to learn and pickup. It's as if someone took Frozen Synapse/Call of Duty/ and X:Com and blended them toghether pretty damn seamlessly.If you are a fan of tactical shooters or military based games in gereral this game is a MUST OWN. I can say I was not expecting to have so much fun in the short ammount of time that I was available to play it.-Casey			"

You can make another squad after but it apparently costs in-game credits.The origins as a portable game show greatly as the controls are very simply and obviously designed to be played with a single finger, and there's been no effort made to make this more ideal for PC.If you like watered down mobile game ports, go for it.

												Squad-based breaching simulator where you use advanced tactics to eliminate multiple enemies in turns using the most elite warriors on earth. You create the 4-man squad using 6 different specialists (fireteam leader, breacher, medic, etc) and then take on 7 campaigns, (8 with dlc) each packed with 5 missions, in 3 different game modes. Terrorist hunt is pretty straightforward, bomb defusal comes with time limit, so it can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and in the escape plan you exfiltrate your squad. Each succesful mission grants you experience for your soldiers, money and silver stars to unlock new weapons and to create new squads. I enjoyed the game cause it has replayability value and comes with some challenge, but the weapons could be more optimized and there were some lame bugs to interfere with the gameplay.			"

												I was surprised.  I hate turn based games with a passion. The way this hooked me is the turn happens and real time commences with that fraction of a second of what happens next as the next turn. Everything grinds to a stop with your soldiers still carrying out their prior orders until the next breach is activated and the time returns to normal.  Each map has different approaches you need to take. You, the player, need to figure out the best tactics and weapons to bring to each fight for each one is drastically different. Do you want to go loud and draw them to a certain place and then come at them from behind with the rest of your team? Or do you want to be completely steathy taking out every single enemy without raising an alarm? It is a very fun game and it gets extremely hard. I have absolutely no idea how to counter some of these enemies in armor and with long range weapons.			"

												Breach and Clear is good for what it is, a squad level turn based strategy game(though it meshes real time mechanics into it). That's the short version.The long version is that this game does well to cover a market that really isn't thriving right now. For so long strategy games have been more about commanding large armies rather than smaller squad levels of highly specialized soldiers. The few that do attempt this are either outdated or poorly executed. Breach and Clear provides a breath of fresh air to a genre that seemed stuck for a long time.I will admit, the gameplay is rather simpe and somewhat repetitive, but still will suit true strategy/military genre fans out there. You are allowed to control 4 man squads of some of the world's best specialized combatants (American Special Forces, Army Rangers, Navy SEALs; German KSK; British S.A.S.; Russian Spetsnaz; Canadian JTF2). In this squad creation of whatever force you decided to pick(you cannot mix and match, if you pick Rangers, all four members of that squad are Rangers, but you can create multiple squads), you create four operators each with default skills and loadouts(the loadout is by default the M4A1 SOPMOD, the skills vary somewhat based on what kind of force you pick. Special Forces, for example, will have higher health stats by default). Upon creating a squad, each member of the team you create must be assigned a role, and depending on this role he will have special abilities and skills(the fireteam leader provides bonuses to his squad as well as being able to draw enemy fire, for example). As you complete missions, your soldiers will  earn experience, thus allowing them to upgrade certain stats, such as health, movement speed, accuracy, etc. Also, with each successful mission, you earn moeny to buy new gear and weapons for your operators(only qualm I have about the guns is that they are almost all American used weapons, most of which AR-15 derivatives, so there's not a whole lot of variation there).When you start a mission, you are given an aerial view of the area of operation(this is the main viewpoint for te entire game). This will allow you to examine the area before sending your guys in. Once content with what you see, you can select which entry points you want your guys to stack up on(most maps will have at least two entry points, though there are several that have just one). You can divide your team to tackle multiple entries and cover more ground, or you can keep your units together and lessen the risk of one of them going down. When you send the guys in, you have a movement stage, where you coordinate where you want your guys to go, what direction they cover, what actions they should do, etc. Once you got all that figured out, you can execute, and your guys will follow your orders to the best of their ability. Be mindful, when you activate this and they start moving, the enemy starts moving to, and will therefore react to your guys, this is where turn based strategy meshes with real time strategy. Assuming that your team is well equiped and your tactics are sound, you should be able to complete the missions without many casualties.So the gameplay, unfortunately, doesn't vary much. The same principle is applied over and over. But the gameplay is solid and once again those who enjoy this kind of commanding style will be pleased. Overall, I'd give it a solid B rating. Could be more varied in terms of gameplay mechanics, but what it does offer is well rounded and well executed.			"

												I find this game extremely addictive, as well as effective in the genre it tries to replicate. In the settings it allows you to set a ""Permadeath"" option where if your squad members die, they are gone forever. This allows players to get connected to their squad as they progress through their career. And the act of losing one in battle can not only effect players emotionally but also can effect the squad's dynamics as you lose the benifets that that experienced soldier had. I highly recommend this game to all who love hair-raising Turn-Based Stratagy games.			"

It would be better if ""after mission report"" was one unanimated screen which can be skipped in one click. Additional game modes seemed as if they are waste of time to me (replaying same map).It would be good if this game is supported by new maps and scenarios for the first game mode.NOTE : Buy when it is discounted.

What is Breach & Clear?Breach & Clear is a tactical top-down squad-based stratergy game. The goal of the game is split into 3 Types! You have the (Lets call it) Terrorist Elimination where you have to clear each room and area of terrorists; Bomb Defusal, where you try find the bomb hidden in one of many rooms and when you do find the bomb, you have 25.00 seconds (5.00 seconds per phase) to defuse the bomb and/or defend the bomb whilst 1-3 other soldiers defuse it; Then you have Escape Plan, Terrorists have attacked the building your sqaud was in (why they were in there is a mystery) and your 4 squad members are spread around the buildings and have to fight their way to the extraction point.Why SHOULD you buy it?Its Quite a fun game that only hardcore RTS or Hardcore Stratergy fans would fully enjoy. If you aren't a hardcore RTS/S Gamer. THEN BREACH AND CLEAR IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR YOU.What are the positives?Well, since the Mobile one is free and is tied down by in-app purchases. This is the best way to go. To get this game, it's most recommended to get it on sale. I've got a spare copy in my gift inventory just if the occasion arises to pull it out.It's also got cool unlockable weapons as you progress, Every campaign is just a certain amount of stars to unlock and not $1.99/£1.99 for single things.What are the negatives?Only the price, really. £10.99 may sound reasonable to a true hardcore fan but it's unreasonable since it's onsale almost all the time meaning that you should just pull out a stove, get your tent set and get camping. The game goes as low as £1.59 for most sales.The other ""drawback"" is that you have to think of how♥♥♥♥♥♥s gonna go down in the missions. One wrong step and you'll be raging or be mad due to the lack of skill you probably have or just how unlucky you are.Is Breach & Clear Collection worth it???Sorry, no. For one example, there is the price. For another example is how bad the other games are. And for the final example, the Original Breach and Clear is all you need as well as mod support. Random Banter: Why not add mod support?It'd be funny if we had mod support. Imagine this: BLEACH & CLEAR. The guy on the front would be replaced with a clorox bleach bottle. I mean c'mon! Who doesn't want to fight as Clorox Bleach and vs terrorist bleaches. That'd be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥epic. Or How about Warhammer crossing over. It'd be another fun game mod to see. I dunno if the game has mod support but I'm still waiting for the sequel ""BLEACH & CLEAR"".			"

												This is one of those games you play when you are just a little too smart for solitaire. While it is a fun game where missions only last a few minutes, it lacks the depth to make it one of those that keep you spellbound.PROS:Quick missions that are suited to filling small gaps of time.Semi-realistic in the urban-combat senario.Easy to get into without hassling about tutorials.CONS:The game becomes repetitive very quickly, so the boredom sets in sooner than with a really good game. The replayability factor is very low.Every person decides what entertainment is worth in a Dollar amount to them. Bear that in mind in figuring that you'll probably only play this about 3 days out of every year. If that often.To the uninitiated, this may seem a valuable training-aid in securing hostile urban territory. If that is what you think, it will be less painful to just shoot yourself. No 4-man team will ever insert to clear any but the smallest maps in this game.This is not the sparkling gem of all games, but it's not the worst out there either. Far more could have been done with the idea, but it seems almost like this game was developed by one guy during a couple of coffee-breaks. It could have been a lot better, though. I hadn't played this game for a couple of years, but I took two squads up to about L20, and now I'm done for the next few years. I also noticed that nothing new was done since I played last, so don't expect new content unless you build it yourself.While I would reccommend the game, I'd not do it at the $15.00 price tag. Personally, I don't think it should cost even a third of that price, but ultimately, you decide. I think $5.00 is a fair price, and the Frozen Synapse DLC should be thrown in free at that price. Just my $0.02.			"

												It's a fun game, and an enjoyable time killer. It's simple to learn, and if you play it like it's meant to be (you know who you are) it can be challenging with permanent deaths and the randomized placement enemies. That said, It feels like it's missing.... Things. The first thing I noticed was that there is no ""replay"" button, or theater mode. It seems like the game lends itself to such a thing, and there's none to be found. The next big thing would be the amount of maps/missions available. You'll be repeating the same ones over and over quite a bit levelling up your men (note: only men), and it gets a tad boring with no user made maps, or dlc maps to be seen.In the end, it's probably one of the best time killers I own.

												Breach and Clear is a turn-based strategy game in which you control four members of a squad of your own design. While there is no over-arching story, the game offers plenty of scenarios and challenges to overcome.Pros:  There's quite a bit of content: three types of gameplay (""Terrorist Hunt,"" ""Bomb Defusal,"" and ""Escape Plan"") across 35 settings (in seven campaign scenarios). That's 105 levels in the core game.  On top of that, there's a lot of replay value here, especially if you care about earning achievements, acquiring different gear, or improving your mission rating.  I've read that this is an import from iOS and Android. In no way does B&C feel like it;  it feels as if it was designed from the start for the PC. This, of course, is a very good thing. Many details, whether aesthetic (such as first-person perspective views using the first four number keys), or mechanical (such as the ability to drag and move paths that have already been placed) are welcome. Offers seven different, specialized squads to play, as well as dozens of weapons that open up as you progress.  Also offers several personnel types (Medic, Intelligence, Weapons Sergeant, et al), each with their own perks and preferences. Thoughtful (and occasionally complex) level design, coupled with a clever mix of random and strategic mob placement, offer serious challenges and extend the playability of the game. I spent nearly two hours, failed attempt after failed attempt, trying to take out Gus Fring's a cartel's meth drug lab; when I finally succeeded, it felt good.  There is the option of Permadeath (yay!), and even a ""Memorial"" area where you can view your fallen heroes. Nice touch.Cons:  The tutorial is so bare-bones that the game has an unfair reputation for being shallow, when it's simply that players are never taught correctly about the deeper features and functions available to them. The number of stars  (the game's rating system, from one to four stars) you get is, for the most part, entirely time-based. That is to say, losing team members obviously makes your rating go down, but it will also drop to a one star rating if you go past a certain time limit, no matter how well you did on the actual mission (even if everyone survives with health intact). This seems, to me, to be a bit unfair. Give me two stars at least for completing it with everyone alive. In the last campaign of the ""Terrorist Hunt"" mode (in Columbia), my soldiers simply refused to open doors, often walking right up to them but not bothering to swing it open (maybe they were busy setting up the Livestream). In any case, changing the rules this late in the game wasted valuable turns staring at the door's presumable lovely wood grain instead of killing whoever stood behind it (although this was inconsistent, even on the same map...some doors they'd open, others they wouldn't, so this was more likely a glitch than a design decision). Enemy AI can be wonky. If mobs are facing the opposite direction, they may not even notice you. I had my whole squad throw open a door and walk past an apparently deaf cartel member only two tiles away. Also, Snipers can often see through walls and high obstacles, but this mainly just affects corners. There is no real story to speak of. That's fine, but it would have been nice to have some kind of feeling of accomplishment at the finish line. ""A winner is you,"" or ""Conglaturation!"" Anything would have been nice, particularly because some campaigns promise a big finish and never follow through. For example, in the Columbian campaign, you are told you're chasing a major drug lord throughout his compound; the game leads you to believe there will be a massive shootout on the roof, complete with a helicopter waiting to take him away, only when you get there - no drug lord, no helicopter.   In ""Bomb Defusal"" mode, terrorists can suddenly appear behind you, coming through the door you've just breached! What the heck is that? You can't sell an item you already own unless you have enough money to buy another one. Makes no sense to me either, but apparently it does to one of the developers, so there it is. A few of the 64 Steam-specific achievements are just plain broken, and support is, from the forums on Steam and the developer's own website, most likely not coming.The Bottom Line:It may sound like I'm complaining, but I'm really only nitpicking. This is a solid effort that provides a lot of hours of fun. There's nothing here that a patch couldn't fix (not that I'm expecting one; it seems as if the devs have long since given up on supporting this). It's just that Breach and Clear is so close to being a really special, great game that it feels like a bit of a shame that the developers didn't feel the need to take better care of it after the birthing process. As it stands, though, B&C is a very, very good game, but one which requires some time, online research, and experimentation to truly see its depth. Recommended.			"

												I was fortunate enough to have this gifted to me - I had been eyeing it for a while now.If you are into squad-based tactics games, then this should suit your tastes. The tutorial covers the game mechanics very well, although the gameplay is a bit lacking in depth if you are used to more hardcore tactics games. As you plot waypoints for your 4 squad members, you can click on any gridpoint in their routes and switch where they are facing, effectively allowing you to cover maximum area and actually ""check corners"" as you move. The action points come in the form of your ""speed"" rating for each character, as seconds are passing throughout the stage. The game captures the intensity of what I would imagine a real ""breach and clear"" situation would be like pretty well. If your ""turn"" is over and bullets are still flying, the game will enter slow-motion and you will even see characters in the process of falling to the ground if they've died.The character level progression is pretty fast, and you can repeat/grind levels fairly easily.The length of the game is decent, there are 3 game modes (terrorist hunt/bomb defusal/escape) for each location, and each location consists of several stages. The customization in terms of gear is not too expansive, but still very nice. You will unlock weapons as you beat stages and earn ""star"" rating points (up to 4 per level), but all the other equipment is available to purchase immediately.Something I like to do over and over is click the ""replay"" button after I've planned out and executed my moves for the round, watching from different viewpoints.Aesthetics are nice, nothing too fancy. Using cover is easy as the shield feedback will immediately tell you what level of cover your character will have. The ""undo"" button allows you to cancel any waypoints/actions you may have planned out.Overall, the game is very fun if you are into this type of gameplay. Price-wise, I don't think you would miss out on too much if you wait for it to go on sale, however, I think it is worth the current price.			"

												I see many people writing about how this is a terrible PC port of a mobile game, or about how the gameplay gets repetitive or stale. At one hour into it so far, this game has become one of my top ten favorite strategy games for several reasons. Not only does it have a huge bevy of missions to choose from, it has a large section of gameplay devoted to customization as well as (optional, sadly) PERMADEATH - my favorite aspect in any ""hardcore"" game.The gameplay is easy to learn; I was able to figure out how to play in roughly 15 minutes. The problem comes with tactics - in true to life fashion, what can go wrong WILL go wrong, and the came is fairly unforgiving. On the base difficulty and the first mission, I still lost a squadmate after he got shot in the face for getting a little too hasty, which, ironically, is what cemented this game as a favorite of mine.If you like games that challenge you, like strategy, or enjoy blowing things up, I heavily recommend Breach and Clear as an excellent choice - especially during the Steam Summer Sale, while it's half off.

												Buy this game if you like X-Com, but want something that takes way less time to play. The level of detail is low, the sounds aren't very good, but despite all of that I still find it fun. There are lot of upgrades you can get for your squad mates and despite the game being very, very simple, I find myself replaying levels and changing the difficulty to get a new experience each time. I don't feel like this is a game I would pay 15 dollars for band be happy, but for <$10 I think you'll get 10 dollars worth of fun from this. It's always nice to have a game that you can jump in quickly and jump out quickly for when you need to kill 10 or 15 minutes.Final: If the game is on sale for less than 10 bucks I think it is worth it, the game isn't going to win any awards but it is a fun way to kill some time and the level up upgardes and customization makes you want to replay it.

												Hmm... the best way to describe this one is probably my favourite way to describe mediocre games.  Meh.  It wants to be a strategy game but I find the gameplay to be very flat.  With the character the control structure, waypoint system that's pretty dull and whatever this mess decided to call ""gameplay"" it just falls short.  It's like that army recruit learning to use grenades that pulls the pin, counts to three then throws the pin.  This may appeal to extremely casual players, or people who don't play more interesting, graphically superior and more tactically sound strategy games - and I guess that makes sense since this is really a mobile game ported to PC.  Oh, well, at least I got it on sale.  Don't fall for it.  The reviews that mentioned it was like other strategy games - them folks is crazy.  Absolutely crazy.I'd say don't waste more than 2 bucks on this game, all it did for me was breach and clear my wallet...			"

												While the concept is good, the actual execution is lacking. Many of the expected tactical options are either missing or only unlocked at higher levels, and it often comes down to either hiding and sniping behind cover or advancing straight at the enemy. The first few maps have an intenseness that is needed, but as you progress to bigger, more open maps, it becomes a chore to clear out the area and there is little in the way of breaching.			"

												It starts off as an amazing game, a game style that I have actually searched for. It remains a good game until you unlock everything, all stars, all guns, which can be done in a little under 15 hours. With the recent release of Breach and Clear: Deadline, this game has been forgotten, and it will remain as it is at its current state. It is a high quality game, but do not purchase unless it is at a discounted price, it is not worth $14.99. If you look in the news about this game, all the news is about Deadline, not the game they should be releasing news about.			"

												A simple tactical game. Dont go beyond that. Does not come close to its competitor Frozen Synapse, but delivers what  promises in parts, getting impossible not to compare each one.Despite having a description on page extremely tempting, promising a highly tactical and complex game, is hardly so.Strategies and options are simple, basically limiting the positioning of soldiers and their handling in each phase. You simply enter the room and see the shooting happen. You can break down doors, throw tactical devices like grenades and flashbangs, and choose which way to look. Nothing else. The game is an infinite looping entering the room, get lucky for the soldiers first shoot the enemies and start all over again.A typical game for mobile phones that was poorly ported to PC. It is very clear looking at the layouts and menus of the game, very badly adapted.Some soldiers have certain specific skills for each class, such as locking doors and having improved reaction time but also by the structure of the game such skills make little difference in the time of action.The graphics are typically mobile. Few animations make the game boring (like terrorists falling in the same position) and the sound effects are amateurs.Despite being a mobile game badly ported to PC it's a little amusing. There are options to purchase equipment and a wide customization possibilities. Probably as the game grow with their development (giving more respect to the pc's users) it can become better.Briefly comparing the competitor, are almost two different games. The complexity and tactical strategy are much deeper in Frozen Synapse.I'm not recommending the game, I suggest you wait more to spend your hard earned money and go for Frozen Synapse.Give a score 06/10 with a certain twinge of conscience.I hope you enjoy my review, any questions just ask in my profile.

												I do recommend this game but with two stipulations.The first is that you pretty much have to be either a completionist, or like me, just cycle through your games. This game does have replayability (To a certain extent). The drawback is that it get's repetitive quickly, espescially when your trying to save up for new guns or attachments.The second is more of a recommendation, buy the game while it is on sale (Currently 2.99, definitely worth it). Because of it's existant but faltering replayability (And the fact that you earn everything you need for a good squad fairly quickly) it does get old quickly and doesn't feel very fleshed out. So, my synopsis? The game is fun, but in kind of a flash-gamey way. Don't expect this to be the next game you no-life for the next year, but to get you through brief patches of boredom on occasion it should do alright. (7/10)(P.S. Just a side note, with 7 hours in the game atm I have two fully geared squads that are carrying among the most powerful and expensive weaponry/armor I can currently buy [One squad has all CTARs, the other has all P90s, both have every slot filled with the best attachments]. This game may be repetitive in it's design, but not too horribly grindy.)			"

TL;DR I invited my brother to try this game out one time, and he got a perfect score on his first try.Me:  ""Wow, not bad.""Him:  ""I just did what they taught me to do in Infantry School.""So I guess the game works pretty well.On to the ReviewBreach & Clear is probably the most fun I've ever had playing a strategy game, largely because its plan-the-next-few-seconds approach both allows the player take his/her time while planning the next move and provides the satisfaction of seeing a successful plan play out in real-time.Level design is nicely varied while still generally keeping the unwritten rules of play applicable (i.e. the lessons learned from successful/unsuccessful runs of previous missions will be useful in later missions).  I never did figure out exactly what the game used (other than completion speed) to determine the 1-4 star performance rating, but I almost always agreed with the rating it gave me.  I do wish that the game would allow the player to change the order in which their squad stacks up on doors, so that my medic wouldn't be taking point all the time while my direct-action guy sits in the back, but otherwise the movement and control of squad members is well-thought-out and intuitive.There is a ludicrously elaborate equipment customization system that I appreciate, and I also like that it unlocks more weapons based on the total number of stars you've acquired as mission ratings.  However, the number of stars required to unlock the guns, as well as the amount of money awarded for missions versus the amount that guns cost, is a bit unreasonable.  Even getting maximum ratings on all of the missions requires several runs through all of the missions in order to have enough stars to unlock the top-tier weapons, and even more runs to get the money to purchase them.  But again, this is a relatively minor complaint, and on the whole the system works well.In short, while it isn't perfect, Breach & Clear is a solid tactical strategy game with sound core mechanics and enough variety to keep it interesting.  Highly recommended.			"

												Great game, though with some flaws and some much needed upgrading in graphics, the interface, a sleeker and more efficient way to organize squad and gear,  plus more customization, I still recommend this game.  It's fun and challenging or casual and cool to see it all work out!  I want to see more patches and updates with graphics or animations.  This game is real awesome.			"

												Nice tactic strategy, where you assume role of special unit forces and deal with terrorist threat.Game has several modes, each bringing new variety to gameplay - not just classic ""clean the enemy"", but a bit more. There is nice variety of weapons, even though one can imagine much more of those. Each weapon has different range, damage output, noise output ... add this to different roles for each team member and you can build quite a lot of loadouts.Your team can be chosen from many different, not just regular SWAT unit, but US Seals, russian Spetsnaz, JTF and much more. Possibility to camouflage them from several different variants, name them as you like (glory to my SG team :) ) and hooray to battle.I find the game quite funny and relaxing, you might even spend a lot hours in a row, especially when you will be hunting for ""perfect game"" (no injury, as fewest rounds as possible) and so on. People who like to try different loadouts will love the game, most of the people would enjoy it for a bit at least.			"

Product received for free
												I must be honest and say that I was a bit sceptic when I looked at the pictures from the game, however I decided to try it out nonetheless, after I finished my old SWAT 4 game. (It is a pretty unfair comparement, which also made me give this game a chance regardless the bad impression from the pictures) And I must say Breach & Clear surprised me positively. You can chose what kind of gear, equipment and clothes your team is going to wear and use on the small missions throughout the game which is a plus in my oppinion. Besides the customization abilities you can pick how you wish to approach the enviroments and how to back your team up, you can even chose which role you wish to be (Medic, leader, breacher etc etc) not to forget you even can name - ALL - of your team members as you like, a nice little detail. Besides that you can pick which difficulty you wish the game to challenge you at range from easy to ""insane"" so theres a difficulty for new players and veterans who doens't play other kind of games, or just because you as a player want a nice challenge. I will upvote this game because it's actually quite fun and time consuming when you first get the hang of it. I will recomend this if you as myself like tactical games as SWAT, Police Quest etc etc. - If you're in doubt buy it.			"

												I didn't know this was an iOS game...until a few minutes after playing the game that is. I got this thinking it would be fun to play the Spetznaz, but as far as i can tell there is literally no reason to pick anyone but the American special forces because they all speak in American accented english, and the only thing worse to me than a baddly accented cast is one that isn't even accented at all. Hell, they could have plugged voice lines in to google translate and had the voice actors say their lines in broken Russian and German for all i care, i wouldn't have noticed and it would have made me happy to know they at least made them speak the right langauge.Now that all the hate is out of the way, for what irked me it was a simple and somewhat fun game for the twenty minutes i gave it. I wish it was fleshed out more, maybe an economy or base building, but since its not i can't really say its worth the $14 i paid for it. If your going ot port an iOS game to the PC, you have to not only change it to fit the controls, but to also fit the price your asking for, if it was a better version of the iOS game and not just the same than maybe, but since its the same they should have priced it like it is, as a fun little I-pad game you play now and then, not like a full game your meant to play for more than a few weeks just a few weeks before going ""Nope, not playing this again"" and deleting it from your computer because its not worth the hard drive space to keep it on there			"

												Don't get me wrong the game is fun but there are problems as well. I will update my review if they update their game. The attachments for the weapons are really unbalanced there is one vest you can buy that give your men something like +175 health while the others for the same price will give them +5-10. I don't know if you had to pay for this vest in the phone version or what? Plus many more weird things. When I select a different trigger the picture doesn't show it on the gun. Silencers lower damage come on in Call of Duty that makes sense but this is a simulator. Many weird things with the attachments.Weapons are weird as well. You can only buy two weapons at the beginning and even after unlocking a third the gun your guys start with is better... So I'm not sure wny they would give you an option to buy a new crappier one?Tool tips would be nice. There are 6 classes but you can see the differences while lining them up at the door. It would be nice if you could tell this. There are a lot of places more tooltips would come in handy.If you your walk up to a door they open it. I wish there was a way for them to sit next to it without opening it. Not a huge deal you just after to remember this when telling them where to go. They also need to put a restart put in the game. If you lose a couple guys you have to either finish the map, kill your other guys, or get out of the game to restart. As soon as your are done with the map you can restart so its not like they don't let you replay the maps.Overall this is a fun game. But I think if I could go back in time I would have waited to see if they patch it first.			"

												I saw this game featured on the Autumn sale and seemed like a decent game for the 5$ asking price.The best way to describe the gameplay is a mix of Frozen Synapse Lite and XCOM. Units move along a path you designate and face in specific directions, engaging any enemy they see. Unlike Frozen Synapse your units can take cover behind objects and units in cover are much more durable as in XCOM. There is a major emphasis on flanking and use of grenades to flush out enemies. The game offers three game modes based around the same set of maps. The first one is straight up Seek and Destroy where you move through a level and clear it of enemies. The second involves getting to and defusing explosives. And in the third mode your units start in the middle of the level and must fight their way clear.The game is not without issues and lacks polish in many areas. The game's mobile origins are very clear in the setup of the interface and the level-based progression system. One point in it's favour is a detailed options menu for controlling sound and game resolution. Something which many games lack, especially mobile ports.When you first start the game up it immediately forces you to create a team of soldiers. First by picking the unit they come from (Navy Seals, JTF2 etc) and a class for each character of the 4-man team. However since you haven't even done the tutorial yet you will have no idea what stats do and what classes mix well together. Annoyingly each class has a set of perks you can't even see until you make a squad and examine a soldier's stat page.Every soldier starts with a set of basic equipment matched roughly to what they would use in real life. You can upgrade each soldier by unlocking and then purchasing new equipment. Progression is linear in that later more expensive equipment is better in every way. Weapons can also be upgraded with components such as a new trigger or gas system to modify the statistics. However these upgrades can easily produce weapons that break the game or weapons that deal no damage at all. In all honesty whatever assault rifle your men start with is perfectly adequate and most of the specialist weapons like the light machine gun or shotgun are useless.Soldiers can also wear various clothing and body armour, but this is another area where the lack of polish shows. Hats can clip through hair and beards. No matter what they are equipped with your soldiers have a tan coloured pistol belt that probably won't match the other things they wear.The third mission type is extremely silly. The premise of having your men escape the level is good, but the implementation is terrible. Your men start scattered around the level with each man in a mexican standoff with 1-3 gunmen standing not 10 feet away. 90% of the time all you have to do to win the level is to hit the end turn button, watch your men gun down everything and then spend a couple turns moving them to the exit. Personally I just pretend this part of the game doesn't exist and stick to the first two mission types.--All in all I would recommend this game for sale price only. There is fun to be had, but don't get into it expecting Rainbow Six. The developers are working on a new game called Breach and Clear: DEADLINE which promises to be an improved version of the game built with the PC in mind instead of the mobile platform. Sales of this game can only help them in that endeavor.			"

												I miss the old strategic tactical games like SWAT 3 & 4 and so I though this purchase would be great for me. While game is presented as a hyper realistic tactical game, it feels like a flash game in it's execution. The UI is awful and you can't have your men synchronise their movements or time things specifically.There are many small bugbears I have with this game, you can't swap soldiers position in a single move, you can't throw grenades over cars, you can't really do things that would make this game in any way realistic...

												I bought this game because I like X-COM a lot and thought this might have been a good alternative before a new ""real"" PC TBS game came out and for once there were more than US units and British SAS, including one of my personal favorite : the German Kommando Spezialkräfte or KSK for short.So I ""created"" my unit, I use the word very loosely as there are not a lot of physical customization available for your soldiers, still better than what BF4 of COD do though, I entered the game and blazed through 3 environment, about 15 missions, with barely a scratch on my men, starting to think ""Ok this is starting to stink badly..."", only to finally start getting some pretty serious opposition in the next environments to the point where I finally had to start thinking how not to get my me killed... even though calling the enemies ""mentally challenged"" would make the COD AIs look like rocket scientists.So the game does offer a fair deal of challenge in later stages.But what about ""The Gear"" ? Yes with upper cases because that's what gives an 8 year old playing COD wetdreams. One word defines my whole experience on that : ""disappointment"". To explain it better the customizations options for clothing and apparel is giving a decent choice but : the plate carriers and chest rigs all look the same and the arsenal  comes straight from your average US armory. Why is it a problem ? Well, because the armory is an AR-15 based orgy (seriously, you got more than 20 variation on the M4/M16) and a couple things more ""original"" live a 1st version TAR-21 and SCARs seen thousands of time before... where are the real guns like, I don't know, Aks, HK416/417, FAMAS, G3 or even the base gun all KSK use : the G36K (and I found that many people think only the C exist)... I have more variaty in my own armory.Also : where the hell are the side arms ?Also one might think given the realistish approach the gun stats may have reflected their actual use in real life, but in fact is a linear progression where the next gun is better only by virtue of being unlocked later.Graphics and animation are less than appealing but as stated in many other reviews the game was mainly built for mobiles devices but given the price tag on this game I seriously cannot excuse the lack of work put in textures that seemed to have just been stretched and ludicrous animation (special mention for the pathetic door kicking at initial rounds).This is not acceptable at all for a 15$ game !In the end I had some hopes for this game but fact is this game does not just fail to deliver, it is simply a money grabbing operation on TBS amateurs such as myself and all the Kikoolols thinking they could become SAS by snapping their fingers (thanks Modern Warfare...).To sum it up : you want a real TBS game, just type X-COM in the search bar and save yourself.

												I haven't played too many turn-based strategy games, xcom, arma tactics, frozen synapse, skulls of the shogun... but I don't like this game better than any of the others. There is no background story around the various missions, the user interface isn't very polished, the movement system is limited, the character development not too interesting, the graphics just ok, and the maps quite small.This game is an interesting mix of various features found it other games, but that's the only thing I find likeable about the game. It's not a bad game if you really like turn-based strategy I guess, there is enough material to keep you busy for a while. But I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend.			"

												I'm only one hour into the game so this is not a real review.However, this is the kind of game i most certainly want to make a serious  review about.So untill then just know that if you like squad and turn-based strategy games then this is worth the full price and even more.True, not much strategy in this game imo but it's still a very addictive turn and squad managing game.

												Fun, but feels unfinished. Small bugs here and there - when in inventory you may equip items but they don't appear on the inventory screen. AI is DUMB, DUMB, DUMB!!!!Graphics are so-so - little in the way of effects and color. Textures are bland and there are no lighting effects. Everything feels very low resolution. Level design is somewhat boring. Nothing has really stuck out as a cool level. Figure out what doors to breach when and you can pass the level every time.			"

												Okay. First of all, this game is HIGHLY addictive, be warned.But, there's some major problems with this game I've found personally.After levelling up my whole squad to 35+ and unlocking most of the guns..the game lost my save files and causes me to start from square 1 with a whole new squad.I don't know if that is a common problem with other people, but this has happened 3 times to me. The first two I was only just into the game so was only slightly annoying, but when I lose 10+ hours of gameplay, it is infuriating.Secondly, many achievements do not unlock first time. Eg. achievement to finish a map under 5 seconds. It took me 8 attempts till it finally registered that I completed the achievement.Tl;dr - I would recommend to get the game. You will get addicted to it. You WILL get very annoyed. And you may possibly lose all your hours of progress and get even more annoyed.			"

												Check your corners.  This is a great game that forces you to think and plan out the moves.  Your operatives are good, but if you don't plan and think about your moves, they will get downed by a barely literate moron with an AK and an itchy trigger finger.  The game plays smoothly, has RPG elements, with an easy to use interface and missions of increasing complexity.  The wide variety of units in the game is also a plus, both specialist operatives and differing national groups.  I might be happy simply because JTF2 is in the game.The game has a lot of potential, and I recommend it for anyone who enjoyed the original Rainbow 6 and all the planning that happened before the mission.

												B&C is a tactical turn based  The game's realistic having some nice weapon models, sounds for the guns and RL Camos for your soldiers. As for graphics, it has nice graphics for a game originally developed on iPhone/Android smart phones. I also really like that it includes the JTF2 and the US Navy Seals! \m/ You'll enjoy this game, especially if you're a fan of the SWAT games. It's definitely worth the money, but if you don't like it's pricing, you could always wait and get it on sale.My rating:8/10Fun game.			"

												First of all, this is my first review, so if I wrote it in the wrong way, tell me how to write a proper review.Breach and clear is a turn based strategy game in which you control 4 spec ops troops and either eliminate all terrorists in the map, defuse the bomb, or get to the extraction point. There will not be multiple objectives in one mission.Pros:High Customisation. in guns you can attach lights, IR systems, sights, different triggers, and gas systems and muzzle attachments, note that you can't customize all of them on all guns. You can change the kind of armor they wear, helmets, etc.Not too hard (but not too easy)EXTREMELY enjoyableGood graphicsCons:Gameplay gets kind of dull, since there is very little plot (what you get is something like :A small group of terrorists have taken over a small american buisness in afganistan. Clear out the building)Extremely cheap voice acting (all the different special forces all have the same voice acting, Spetsnaz speaking english like americans, that doesn't sound right does it? Where are the SAS's british accents?)Voice acting lines are few and dull, when one of your guys is getting killed, I excpect him to say something like; I need support! Or something like that, instead, they say nothing.No multiplayer at all, I hope the devs are working on it, I'd also like a level editor or something like that.Overall I would say 8/10			"

There's no one way to beat each scenario, you can try different approaches each time and see which works best.

												This is a great Squad Tactics, turn based strategy. When you load up a game, it'll ask you to make a Squad. First you choose what kind of Special Forces you want your dudes to be: US Navy Seals, Germany's KSK, Canada’s JTF2, UK's SAS, and if you get the DLC, you can play as the Green Frozen Synapse guys too. After that, you choose each one of your 4 guys portrait/face, which is pretty limited, and their class, such as weapon expert, medic, direct assault, etc., which governs what kind of skills you can use in game and what kind of passives they have. You can name your squad too.Once you're in the game, you have your squad move through the level eliminating terrorists. If you've ever played Frozen Synapse, moving around and killing is like that, but less in-depth. Click where you want to move, and where you want him to face when he get's there. You can click along his path and have him look in a different direction when he get's there. You can also have them throw grenades and other equipment if you've purchased them(more on this in a bit). You do this with all 4 squad members, click 'breach', which starts the turn, and they'll all do their orders immediately, shooting at enemies that enter their line of site. A 'turn' is pretty much 5 seconds, and clicking Breach will have them carry out orders and shoot people for 5 seconds before time stops and you can issue another set of orders Some have skills and passives, like the Weapons Expert has 'Suppressive Fire', which does what it says. The Intelligence class can see all around them, a 360° range of vision for a fairly short distance, about 5 feet. Normally, a soldier has  the standard 40°-45° cone line of sight in front of them(no distance restrictions), simulating a person's eyesight. The Intelligence class has this stanard 45° cone, plus a much smaller 360° view, which extends maybe 10-ish feet. This is great for when an enemy is in a place you didn't expect. Normally a soldier will turn around by himself and shoot back at an enemy that shot him, but that's a precious few seconds of getting wailed on. The 360° view let's the Intelligence class immediately start to turn around the second he enters his range. You'll still get hit since you'll still have to turn around, but the chance of dying has been drastically lowered.After each mission you get money, experience, and a 1-4 Star rating depending on how well you did,  Experience will level up a soldier, and when he levels, you can put 5 points into one of their stats. Each class has some stats all on their own, like the Intelligence Class has a stat that increases his 360° view distance. All Classes have some similar stats though, like all have a 'Moving Speed(distance you can travel in one turn). 'Accuracy', 'Health', and 'Reaction', which is how long it takes for them to 'lock on' to the enemy and start shooting. All stats can be increased to 100, and each stat starts at around 45-55. The type of squad, such as US Seals/German KSK/UK SAS/etc, plays in here too. Each type has a beginning bonus to one of their stats. I believe either the US Rangers or Seals starts with their Accuracy at 75. Each squad type has a bonus, and that bonus can pretty much aid in your preferred play style.As for money, You get a $200-ish bonus for completing a mission for the first time, and I think $200 per Star(rating), at least on normal difficulty(4 modes). There are other bonuses and penalties that reward/subtract too. Anyway, in the main menu there's a Marketplace, where you can buy new clothes, armor, helmets, weapons, all sorts of weapon attachments, and consumable items. Most of these items will offer some sort stat boost, like scopes increasing accuracy and armor(vests) increasing health. This isn't Door Kickers btw, where buying the gun once unlocks it for free use with everyone else. If you want your 4 squad members to wield that shiny rifle, then you'll need to buy that shiny rifle 4 times. I wasn't  mocking Door Kickers btw. I love that game too. If you're short on cash, and there's a particular level you like, you can simply do that level a few times to earn money. Just keep in mind that you'll only really earn money for the amount of stars you get on that run(4 max). So at most, on normal difficulty at least, you can only get $800 max, and you'll probably have some of that subtracted due to taking damage or taking too long. The prices are not ridiculous btw. They're not expensive, but you won't be buying everything in the first hour(or week).There are a good number of missions to do, and lots of gear and weapons to get and play around with. I definitely recommend this game.			"

												I wish this game had physics. I wish the bad guys would fall over like real bad guys instead of just slump over. This game does not feel 100% realistic. Maybe 83% realistic. (Okay, 84%). This game feels like something from the year 1999. You shoot bad guys and they just sort of slump over and are stuck in whatever last frame of animation they end up in before your next turn starts. It doesn't feel authentic. The game is interesting but I get it, it's a simulator first and then a game. Like, the kind of simulator you would use to train at work if you were a Navy Seal or Special Ops-type. If those jobs meant working in an office. I recommend this game but Jagged Alliance and Frozen Synapse are 2 much MUCH better versions of this game.			"

												Here's my review for, Breach & Clear !! **Early Review (2h gametime)** (7.6 out of 10.0) Overall.Before you start reading (this review is kinda long) you can just take a look at my screenshots to see what this game is about.http://steamcommunity.com/id/xDMikeW2k14/screenshots/?appid=266130&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewallNow to my review :First Look: I didn't know what I'm about to witness of playing this game because I don't play simulator games so much. And especially tactical simulators.My first run was near 2 hours. I enjoyed this game and played the first mission, 5 times.This game has very much to offer in terms of difficulties,missions,equippments,replayability,roles and ofcourse the main reason we purchae this game - tactics.Gameplay: Gameplay is very simple once you get used to it (I got used to it very fast and the tutorial was short and clear).You have 4 characters, each one has same options and your role is to control them.Besides that, there is the map itself which has easy acess to it (all you need to do is to move the cameras to your like, and manovering the soldiers on the map.)Me as a hardcore tactical fan player I like to complete each mission on the best side so it took me around 15-20 minutes to complete a mission but after you do the same mission few times you do it faster and easier, and while still enjoying the mission. (8/10)Cons: 1) Repetetive. 2) Full Members each mission (Annoying thing is you can only use all 4 members and not 2 or 1 or 3.)Gameplay Styles: 1) Go loud and use breaching equippment / Loud weapons / Frag grenades etc2) Go quiet and use silencers / lock picks / Flashbangs etc3) Split your team through the rooms or work with all of them togather in each room.4) Enjoy your time in investing and planning each mission to your liking and your own tactical strategy.5) Difficulties - 5 Difficulties. (8.5/10)Graphics: Only saw one map so far but each room looks realistic with objects and tactical props (Walls/Big Closets etc that can block the A.I view so you can take cover behind them). (5/10)Cons: 1) Lack of FPS. I get this is a sim game but they did add fps moments but I'm not feeling it cuz it's only in start/end of the mission. it would be better if we could switch between FPS and Map-Look modes of the cameras but oh well I guess it will take the tactical-strategy element of this game.Equippment:What can I say about this one.. 4 Sections - Weapons , Gear , Headset , Consumeables.There is an in-game store (Buy/Sell items from the money you've earned in each mission).In each section there are many things to buy include Vests/Guns/Gun Parts/Suit Colours/Camos/Grenades etc..Some of them are locked, you need to unlock them as you progress through the game.There are also stats like Speed/Accuracy/Noise etc in some of the equippments. (7/10)Cons: A bit more organized menu would be better, and there are some items I don't think I will use.RPG Elements:I should talk about this one cuz there are 6-7 special op teams you can choose from.6 Roles to choose from and stick them to your soldier. (Not sure yet if each team has different roles or not)Stats in equippment items and Money to invest in equippment.Level up system to your soldiers. + XP.Choose how your soldier will look like, and colour your guns. (6/10)Enjoyment: (9/10) I'm sorry but this is one of the best tacticla simulators I've played.. I can invest all my time in this game figouring out different tactics/ways to approach into the enemy.Repetetive: (6/10) It is but still you enjoy playing this game.Replayability (9/10)Frustraiton (1/10) - Early review but as long as you know what you do in this game.. You're fine.Boredom (0/10) - Nothing so far.			"

You don't have to add al of them but just a suggestion. Anyways I love this game and I can't wait till the next update!			"

												Das Spiel ist eine gute Grundlage benötigt aber deutliche verbesserungen. Man kann auch sagen solide Basis, ausbaufähig. Im Grunde ist alles dabei was ein taktisches Spiel benötigt. Fangen wir mit dem offensichtlichen an:Grafik: Gemessen an den heutigen Grafikblendern mit bombastischen Effekten aber null Story kann das Spiel nicht mit halten. Die Frage ist jedoch ob es das überhaupt muss. Die Antwort ist nein. Das Spiel hat eine vollkommen ausreichende Grafik die natürlich auch vor dem Hintergrund betrachtet werden muss das das Spiel aus dem Mobile Umfeld geported wude. Sie ist recht schlicht aber dennoch vollkommen ausreichend um das nötige so darzustellen ohne das man gleich Augenschmerzen bekommt. Jedoch muss man sagen das es für Leute die nur auf aussehen Wert legen eine Fehlinvestition ist,Was sitzt neben den Augen? Richtig, die Ohren....Sound:Der Sound ist ebenso wie die Grafik recht simpel gehalten. Hier hätte ich mir einen etwas voluminöseren Sound gewünscht. Oft hören sich gerade die Waffen wie kleine Knallerbsen an. Die Umgebungsounds sind faktisch nicht vorhanden und auch sonst kommt nicht viel Abwechslung auf wenn man seine Operator durch die Level jagt. Um eine wirkliche immersion zu erschaffen und den Spieler eintauchen zu lassen in die Welt der SOF´s wäre eine tiefergehende Soundkulisse wünschenswert.Spielmechanik:Das Konzept dieses Spiels ist irgendwie rundenbasiertes point & click. Wer allerdings ein neues  JA erwartet wird wohl ein wenig entäuscht sein. Im Grunde hat man nicht allzu viele aktionen zur Auswahl. Der Vorteil darin liegt dann sicherlich das man recht schnell in das Spiel findet. Das Tutorial erklärt kurz, knackig ausreichend die Steuerung so das man nicht erst ein ewig langes Tutorial absolvieren muss um endlich loslegen zu können. Man merkt dem Spiel eben seine Herkunft an. Für den OC hätte man hier sicher noch einiges rausholen können. Z.B. kann man zu beginn eines Levels Zugangsladungen oder die Schrottflinte nutzen um Türen zu öffnen. Danach geht das nicht mehr, zumal auch alle Türen auf sind. Man hat zwar ein Dietrich aber keine Entry Tools wie das Haligan etc. Das Spiel wirkt dann oft ein wenig lieblos und gerade in Bezug auf den das Intro in dem es als das Trainingstool für Spezialeinheiten vorgstellt wird kommt man sich ein wenig veralbert vor. Das Ausrüsten der Operator ist manchmal ein wenig umständlich dafür kann man aber jeden Operator anders konfigurieren so das keiner aussieht wie der anderen usw. Jeder Charackter hat ein Levelsystem. Wenn man hoch Levelt bekommt man Fähigkeitspunkte mit denen man die Jungs trainieren kann. Zusätzlich werden alle paar Stufen spezielle Features freigeschaltetContent:Der Inhalt ist für den Preis vollkommen ok. Man hat eine gute Auswahl an Level und Ausrüstung. Alle Level kann man in 3 Modi spielen. Die Level sind in ""Kampangen"" verpackt die nach Ländern geordnet sind. Jedes Land hat 5 Level. Dabei sind u.a A-Stan, Deutschland, Mexiko, Komlumbien, China, Türkei. Die Level weisen verschiedene Schwierigkeitsgrade auf und haben unterschiedlich Ausmaße. Die Levelgröße hat auch Einfluss auf die Ausrüstung die Eingesetzt werden sollte Die Ausrüstung die man zur Verfügung hat unterteilt sich in Waffen, Waffenzubehör, Bekleidung, verbrauchbare Ausrüstung und Körperschutz. Hier gibt es dann auch nochmalige unterteilungen. Jedes Stück equipment kostet im Spiel verdientes Geld. Somit kann man mit der Zeit seine Chars immer bessere Ausrüstung kaufen usw. Die Operator kann man aus verschiedenen Gruppierungen nutzen. Jede Einheit hat ihre Vor- und Nachteile. Der Rest ist dann eben persönliche Vorliebe, Wie man sieht ist der Umfang durchaus angemessen für den Preis.Fazit:Das spiel ist für alle taktiker von interesse. Man sollte jedoch nicht zu viel erwarten denn es wird schnell eintönig da einfach zu wenig möglichkeiten bestehen. Vielleicht sehen wir im zweiten Teil, insofern es einen gibt, ein paar verbesserungen die hier eben noch fehlen. Noch wirkt das Spiel an vielen stellen zu steril und gleichmässig. Leider gibt es auch keine Informationen zwecks der Modbarkeit. Wir lassen uns überraschen. MFG			"

												Great turn based tactial game!  You can create a number of squads from different real life special forces units.  You earn money thru doing missions, and as you complete more missions you unlock more weapons to use.  The teams are fully customizable, and the soldiers level up with an RPG element.  Overall a deep game with lots of replay value for $10!			"

												I played the mobile version of this game because I couldn't wait for the PC version to come out.  Now that it has and I've played it, am I satisfied?  Oh yes.  Yes I am.This version is even better than the mobile one!Think of this as XCOM meets Rainbow 6.  You start by choosing your squad from amongst the world's best special forces.  Then you get to go into the missions, planning each stage, and then hitting a button to watch it all unfold in front of you.  Went by too fast?  Then just watch the instant replay.  The ability to improve the skills of your operators is also a nice touch.  Makes you really start to care about them and their welfare.Love the customization of weapons and armour, too.If anything, this game is priced too low.  Yes, I said too low.  I would have paid 30 bucks no problem.Well done, Mighty Rabbit!!			"

												10/10I loved the old Police Quest: Swat games, Jagged Alliance, XCOM, Door kickers, Dead State, Omerta, Shadowrun etc etc and I can say that by far this is my favorite plan-n-play style of game. The only thing that would make this game better in my eyes  would be the ability to pause anytime you want and change the tasked orders. (Like Door Kickers or Jagged Alliance 2 Back in Action) It's a bit more realistic when you can pause and give your squad new commands instead of watching them take 10 bullets in the back before dying because you forgot to set a squad member to check a corner or an enemy pops out of a door right after you pass it.

												In spite of this being ported from Ipad/android, it's a good game, more or less complex.  + Nice concurrent turn based close combat strategy (reminicent of Frozen Synapse) + Nice looking graphics, still light enough to run in any system. + Great tactical gameplay. - For game design reasons, you only use american guns, even when playing with german or russian squads. (No H&K, no Kalashnikov!!) This is built into the game, since guns are level-locked and unrealistically upgraded. Not a bad thing in itself, but game breaker if you are a gun nut like me. - It ""feels"" like a tablet game. Again, not necessarily a bad thing, but comes a little short in game mechanics compared to other PC tactical squad based games. (YES, I mean the old JA2) - Uninteresting, ""story"". Just same old ""kill the terrorist"" plot, no much background. Which isn't all that bad, but the combat mechanics are so fun, one can but wonder what a bigger game with similar combat will be like. EDIT: Wonder no more, breach and clear DEADLINE is out. 8/10 will clear the room again.			"

												I have been playn this game for a little while now. Wish I would have started play'n it alot sooner. Its awesome IMO. The game is easy to pick up and learn. Its all about loadouts and team tactics in a SRT/BC format. The DLC is kinda what ever but it is a must if you are going for 100% achievements. The game is highly replayable and has some semi tough difficulty settings. Silver (the game currency) is a little hard to make a ton but once you getr your first team/squad to all rank 30 its not to bad. The game also features a hardcore mode so when you die ....well your dead I for one like this feature in alot of games. So if your looking for a diamond in the rough its safe to say pick this game up.			"

												Very polished tactical shooter in vain of Frozen Synapse. Decent customization even though the weapon and gear models look too similar. The weapons are balanced and there are several nice levels which can be enjoyed in 3 modes: Terrorist hunt (kill everybody), Bomb Defusal, survival/escape. Graphics are decent but not eye-popping. Far from it, actually. The human models all look pretty much the same even if you select different characters. Mediocre at best and could have used a more vivid style and color palette. The gameplay itself is turn based tactical battles. about 70% of the maps are indoors and use tight corridors and covers to keep the action pumping and the rest are outdoors which focus more on tactical play and choosing the best ways to strike.Your squad of 4 (which you can create yourself and customize) level up as you gain more stars in missions and more XP. You also receive money to purchase new weapon upgrades and gear. You choose specifically which attribute to level up for each soldier (e.g. accuracy, speed, special ability, reaction etc.). This all helps to give the game longevity as well as harder difficulty settings which make the game much more demanding. I'd also like to note that the music is pretty cool.I only wish there was a ""Restart Level"" button in the pause menu because you need to go back to the main menu every time you choose to restart a level mid play.All in all, a great bargain game and I'd say it's worth the full price even though there aren't many maps to play around in (there are new ones in a DLC though). But if you liked Frozen Synapse or want to give the games a try I think you'll like what you find here.			"

												TL;DR get Doorkickers insteadFor five bucks more you could get Doorkickers which has better gameplay, way more unique levels+campaigns, more modes (hostage rescue, VIP escort, heists in addition to bomb defusal and just search and destroy), doesn't recycle maps nearly as much (to be fair Doorkickers does recycle some levels), an in game editor allowing you to create your own levels and mod support. This game is $4 on the Apple Store and the only difference (apart from it being on a PC rather than an Apple iPhone/Pad/whatever) it has in app purchases. Also, the developers have the guts to claim that real life Special Forces units use this as an educational tool for real life in the intro (

 ). So your telling me that this game, which started life as an iOS game, is considered the 'Most Advanced Training Tool Avaliable', over Vitural Battlespace 1 or 2 (which was developed specifically for militaries to train soldiers), or even ARMA or just actually getting of your♥♥♥♥♥♥and doing actual training? I admit I have no back ground in the military but I'd bet my entire bank account that the claims made in the intro video is complete B U L L S H I T. If it wasn't for this claim, I would have probably just kept the game as I bought it on sale, but if the Devs want to lie to my face like that, I'm taking a refund.  "

												Shallow and greatly unpractical gameplay. The PC version of this game looks like it was made for tablets. Coordinating your squad members' actions proved to be quite difficult and limited. Here are some features of the game:  Your tactical options for each soldier in a turn are:      -Moving the soldier (you can set multiple waypoints and also choose between moving quickly or carefully);      -Choosing on each waypoint where the soldier will be looking at;      -Telling the soldier to hold his position;      -Using the soldiers' special ability;      -Checking intel on the enemy.So far, your options are quite limited, but that is not inherently bad. Sometimes, a small array of options may be backed up by a great gaming experience. Now that's this game's undoing. The AI is almost as smart as real person... if said person was blindfolded and told to find a way out of a maze made of death lasers that made noise so they could still be avoided... and even so the person decided to run and hug death.Coordinating your team's actions proved to be quite the challenge when you can't even tell one of your soldiers to take another soldier's position; you can't tell them to hold fire or to focus one specific enemy; if you tell a soldier move up to a door, he will immediatelly open it! Now THAT'S some real tactical decision right there, phew. Did you make a mistake while placing one of your waypoints? No problem! You just need to press the undo button and remove every subsequent waypoint you had set untill you delete the single one that was wrong... and now place them all again! (I guess the game does that so you don't lose track of what you had in mind...)Every time you select a unit, your camera moves up to them, which is simply annoying. You then have to keep moving your camera all over the place because it seems like the game wants you to have full awareness of your team. ""Juarez? You selected Juarez? Here he is, look! Look closer! See? That's Juarez! Want him to move over there? Okay! Lawrence too? Good! But let us just take a look at him! Oh my, how well positioned he is right here! Now go move your camera back!""This game is quite good for on-the-go casual gaming, but definitely NOT for someone who's looking for some real squad-tactics game. The tactics you employ to win this game are basically, in order of priority: 1-Put soldier behind cover; 2- If enemy is still alive, throw grenade; 3-Win game.The soundtrack is good, it fits in nicely.The graphics are fine, nothing to complain about.The camera movement is ""meh"". In addition to what's been already mentioned above, sometimes the action camera is badly positioned and you can't really see what's going on, but that's not gamebreaking.The real problem is charging US$15 for a game that seems poorly optimised for PC and with little replay value. Frozen Synapse costs roughly less than two times this price but brings you four times more entertainment.Luckily I got this through Humble Bundle though, phew!			"

												I'm a really big fan of Full Spectrum Warrior games and found this pretty fun,  Way more basic from FSW but it is really fun and what I like about it, it is very replayable.  You can do each mission soo many different ways,  breach with all four of your team mates on one door or split them up on other door positions.  You can upgrade your loadout and change uniforms etc.  I really with FSW had this kind of option back in the day			"

												I thought this was a tactical squad combat game. To be a tactical squad combat game certain elements must be present. Such as the ability to change stance, from prone, to kneeling and standing, and receive modifiers to accuracy based on stance. Also select fire mode which also modifies accuracy versus rounds fired. This game has neither. Its very arcade. For those who played Brigade 7.62, or Jagged Alliance Back in Action, Soldiers at War, Soldiers of Anarchy, X com, Hired guns, Silent Storm etc... you will be disappointed. This is a 3D arcade game. Nothing more. My bad in a way for not researching more. But the pictures and vid files really make the game look detailed and tactical in a way similar to the games I listed above. But it is not, it only masquerades as a tactical 3rd person POV squad level game, oh did I mention it is very arcade?			"

												So I bought this game for $5. Played one full hour and am completely hooked! This game is Frozen Synapse with amazing graphics, in depth tactics, but minus the time manipulation.  The weapon customization is very good. There is a large amount of weapons and attachments to buy with the in game money. Along with gear and camo. Your team members gain XP, and through leveling up you can customize each character to play as you wish under specific skills. All in all this is the best $5 I have spent on a game in a very long time, and I give this game a high reccomendation to those of you that enjoy a fast pace turn by turn strategy game.			"

												I hate turn-based tactical games. But when they are done right (because most arent) they are great fun. Its a genre that requires special attention to many details. Breach and Clear does all of those details right...even in the weapons and gear customization sections; an entire section that I was happily pleased to find, use, and have it actually matter in the game.This was obtained for $6 on sale but I wouldnt be mad if I had paid full price. In conjunction with B&C I also purchased ""Recruits"", a aesthetically similar but substantially different game. I only mention that because I thought I was going to like Recruits much more than this. However, Breach and Clear is clearly winning right now. You dont have to love (or even like) turn-based tactical games to have fun with this. Highly recommended game that is from a genre I really dont like at all.

												A fun game to play around with for a few hours that has limited replayability. This is a tactical strategy game that has you take command of a 4-person team that ""breaches and clears"" small areas. You command each unit individually, controlling things like their exact movement patterns, which way they will face, equipment to use, and so on. Has a huge amount of superficial depth, meaning that there is a ton of stuff to the game that doesn't really seem to impact it all that much, like unit stats. My unit with the worst reaction time, worst accuracy, and using the weakest gun would regularly clear out rooms of 2-4 enemies effortlessly, while my unit specially designed to kill enemies would fail to kill a single enemy out in the open. Despite this, it's definitely worth picking up and playing around with if deeply discounted.			"

												I don't understand why there is so much positive reviews, I can only explain this with fact that there is not much games like this, so people have very low expectations and happy to have any kind of game like this.This game has same problem, as all recent attempts to make remake of Jagged Alliance, or Brigade E5/7.62 High Calibre series game. Maybe even worse. Much worse.Dull models, dull art, dull animation, dull and ugly UI, non intuitive controls/UI. White standard fonts without outlining, in the dull gray boxes. Upon realizing mechanics of this game, that in fact it's very bad turn based game with square grid, and not smart pause planing game like previously mentioned - you will just hate it.My recommendation - if you want recent good game in this genre, you better go and get Doorkickers, they maybe be 2D, and look like some silly casual arcade/puzzle in a first glance, but in the end, it's much better looking game and playable game. It has its own flaws, but at least it's playable and fun game. If you want smart-pause tactical 3D game, get latest Jagged Aliance remake - it suck because performance issue, because it's sometimes unpredictable when things that happen are non-intuitive and not really realistic (acting not according to real life logic), and annoying in general, yet it's still better game, you can have at least some fun. If you want turn-based square grid tactical game, go and get - XCOM: Enemy Unknown (yeah, shame that this game is absolutely not even close by quality to XCOM, i would like XCOM quality game but more serious with little bit more realism, and without aliens, but about special forces... but no luck, this game is not like this).Now thinking, even Rainbow Six (the original one) would be a better game (you can plan your actions, and then just watch how everything goes), and even maybe more reasonable tactical simulation (wtf is with this intro, saying that this game is used by military to train? is this a joke?)

												A more challenging version of xcomm. Tactical strategy, ""once said then done"", based. It reminds me of dragon age with the whole order thing. So basicly, you tell your squad what to do, from the path they will take to the direction they will look and once commands have been given, you ""breach"" which is what your press to actually see your orders (and reactions) in motion. Strengths*challenging, since its real time after breach has been pressed. *interesting stats concept: noise, speed, reaction time, special (passive skill according to class) etc...*Extremely fluid and fast paced maps. This is definetly the most refreshing point when compared to xcomm.. (Enough of those 3-5 initial useless movement turns....)Weaknesses*alot of useless gear with no clear reason of why it is more expensive than the other.*developers seems to have a crush on special forces and focuses on delivering more cosmetic (look alike) items than actual gameplay. Btw, all my team, wears jeans and shirt... Dont give a #@#$ about looking like swat or w/e*Stats and %s could be shown more often and clearer.. Again it seems the focus is elsewere (clothing...)* no true reason to make money after 5 game hours... in otherwords, no true reason aside (ughh) cosmetic, for you to work on improving via gear, your characters.

												Breach and Clear is not the kind of game you would expect it to be, walk into room, shoot things, kill things is what you would have expected to be doing with your time on Breach and Clear, but as soon as you begin the training mission it becomes very apararent that storm into a run guns blazing is not the only way to do things. You get to create a squad from seven different military forces (SAS, Seals, Spetznaz etc) and create the characters from scratch naming them and giving them a specific role within the team (medic, team leader, weapons sergeant etc) and as you play missions with them they earn XP and level up, you then earn points which you allocate to a specific skill tree on that character, relatively simple to anyone who has played a game about gear or character progression. The game is very user friendly, after playing the short 5 minute tutorial I felt like an expert, the key important features and commands you can issue to your squad are used repeatedly in the tutorial to get you used to them and the features that arne't reinforced are very easily and quickly learned, whether you want that soldier to go in that door or one soldier to throw a flashbang then the other storm the room and take out the hostiles, if you want to do it you can! Another feature that makes this game well worth the money (grab it for $3.50 now while you can) is the endless replayability, make new squads then replay each mission on the hardest difficulty experimenting with the different mechanics each time you play it!Overall Breach and Clear is quite frankly perfect, there is nothing wrong it in my eyes which earns it a 10/10			"

Breach & Clear has a good turn based system in place that uses indirect RNG to determine the efficiency of your squad beyond your own choices.I play this muted, because the sounds and music are atrocious.I play it on the top-down setting, and still have issues with the camera.I play this using only a mouse because the game's controls are the clunkiest I've ever been subjected to.I play it very casually because it loses my attention within a half hour.This is definitely not worth the $16.99 it's listed at. It's just barely worth the $2.54 I paid for it. With polish, it would be a fantastic casual tactics game, but as it stands, it feels like the developers don't care very much about their product or its consumers.The positive review I'm giving this is generous on my part.

												You have to create a squad from different classes of soldier. Sounds nice...They level up and that lets you customize even further your squad. Sounds even better...When a soldier dies you have to replace him for a Level 1 soldier, that totally breaks equilibria. Awuful.You can NEVER change your squad, except by forcing a soldier to die. Awufuler.			"

												I really want to like this game. I absolutely do. On paper, it seems to have everything I loved from games such as Jagged Alliance 2. Turn-based, tactical, team building and more but..the game feels so dry. So utterly not fun. The battles feel almost a little too easy, without any real involvement. It doesn't draw me in, it doesn't feel like it impacts or changes. It just rolls through missions, the same music playing all the same time. No real sense of 'world'.I've felt a greater sense of fun from old NES games.			"

												It's like SWAT but topdown. It brings good memories of tactical shooters. In a sesne this is a cross of XCOM with SWAT that turned out really good. At least that's what you'll feel at the beginning.The most accurate description of this game is simplified top-down Rainbow Six sim. It has planning phase and execution phase. The game has three different game mods and they are entertaining at the beginning. However once you levelled up and bought good gear the challenge is no longer there.It is a nice casual tactical sim, and breach and clear is very accurate name. All you do you breach and kill every poor soul around. There are no hostages to save, just a set of maps which become grounds for your tactical proving and killing skills.In the absence of other alternatives and no desire to install the good old SWAT or Rainbow Six this will do, but don't expect a serious challenge.Check out my other recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview "

												Basically, it's a simplified version of Frozen Synapse. It's tons of fun and very well polished for a mobile port. Most things in this game are done right, but there are a few huge flaws about that keep it from greatness. First off, there's no multiplayer mode... Really!? A turn-based strategy has no multiplayer gamemode!? Secondly, the camera controls are a bit wonky. You'll get accustomed to it, but it just feels off. Finally, there isn't a story. You're just dropped into singleplayer missions. There are 3 game modes and about about 95 missions in all, which will give you about 15 hours of game time, but they dont have much replayability, so once you play them, then they're done... I got it in the humble bundle and I can say it was easily worth that price. If you enjoy games like XCOM: Enemy Unknown, Frozen Synapse, or Jagged Alliance, then you have no excuse to not buy this game.So, lets review.Pros:+Great addicting gameplay+Large amount  of character and squad customization+Decent visuals for a mobile port+Good AI (on Hard and up)+Large amount of missionsCons:-No story-Wonky controls-No multiplayer (Seriously?!)-Missions can get repetitive-Is a mobile port Overall, I give this game a 7/10.

												Bottom line is, that this is a fun game.The downside is that it lacks complexity and gets old pretty quickly.  Sure, it's fun going through the missions and leveling up your team in their respective specializations and getting them new gear - but then what?It's completely satisfying watching your team burst through a door and open up a can of whoopass on some unsuspecting misfits.  One of my main complaints about the gameplay, which may be a bit strange, but here it is:  You can see almost everything.  The only thing I have to wonder about is where the enemies are standing and which direction they are facing.  Surely things could be more interesting if I had a kind of blueprint of the building, and some not-so-trustworthy intel about what objects and obstacles may be where.  There's no peeking through windows or tiny spy cameras to get a better idea of what's on the other side of a door - it's all just there and you know where everything is.  I like the game, but I also want there to be more variables.  I know my team can breach and clear a room in seconds and shoot at anything that isn't themselves.  I want to make more decisions than stack order, and which door to open first.			"

												Pretty fun game. I got it for 6 dollars but I'd definitely have paid the full 15 for it. The gear and gun customization is quite nice. Could be some more stuff to use but whatever. I like how the guys C-clamp their guns, they lean out and shoot from cover instead of stepping out, so there's proper tactics. Graphics aren't the best but the gameplay is there. Seems that sometimes my guys won't engage and sometimes die because of it, but I don't mind replaying the level to see what else I can do better anyway.For a mobile port (from what I've read), it's really good actually. I highly recommend this.			"

												This is one hell of a game. 10/10. I love the strategy it takes to play this game; you can't just hand this game over to anybody and expect them to do great, there is a big learning curve that comes easily and will allow you to control every aspect of your characters. Not only do you tell your soldiers where to move, but also what path to take to get there, and what direction to face every step of the way. The character skills customization really allows you to get attached to your favorite characters and mourn when they die, permanently. The perma-death is an option though so you can choose how hard this game is for you and how strategic you have to force yourself to be. The controls are simple, but some of them you have to learn for yourself that the tutorial does not cover, like how not to open the door when you approach it and how to choose your path. Every mission earns you money and experience based on difficulty, speed, and overall skill and you spend that money equipping your squad with new weapons, attachments for your weapons, face masks, helmets, armor, clothing, and even the equipment they bring into the field. There are always multiple ways to complete a mission, and there is no set way of doing anything, you choose it all. I highly recommend this game to those looking for a great squad-based tactical game, to the fans of the XCOM and Shadowrun games, and anyone else who wants a game like this. If you want a typical FPS, control over just one character, or skill-less combat then I do not recommend this game to you.			"

												I wasn't really expecting much from Breach & Clear, but I was pleasantly surprised.Imagine a cross between SWAT4 and something like X-COM, but faster paced - move yoyur guys around, make sure theyre pointing in the right direction and covering each other, etc. Very fast, fun and theres a significant ""oh no!"" when playing on permadeath mode and your highest ranked guy goes down.The controls are a little clunky, but nothing too bad, and when zoomed in close the graphics betray the games mobile origins, but its an excelent little tactical game, and something you can have a quick 5-10 min blast at.

												I need to state this now before i say anything else I do not Hate this game but i do think it has many Flaws.Overall the game for the price and the amount of time you do get sucked into as steam for me the hours played are glitched so i can assure i played far more then five hours. This game consists of mostly learning and adapting to learn how to react to various Situations. It also has a sorta xcom feel with the leveling and the fact its sorta turn based(Enemys react to everything as you do so every one is on overwatch.)To me this games most annoying problem Is its major lack of content which i feel could easily be fixed the arma 3 way(Not 15 overpriced DlCs)The glorius steam workshop.It also has a few interface issues and sometimes certain orders can keep your entire squad from moving due to them getting caught on each other.If you have the spare cash or its one sale for 1.99 which is the deal i bought it at it you should surely give the game a try.

												I bought this game on sale because it looked pretty interesting, and it turned out to be one of the best games i've gotten in months. I downloaded it around midnight and figured i'd play 15-20 minutes to see how it was, and it was 4AM before I knew it. The gameplay is turn based, but once you choose where you want your soldiers to go, it becomes almost real time until your soldiers and the enemy stop shooting. You can make 4 man squads from multiple different special forces from around the world. There's tons of weapon attachments to customize an almost equally large amount of weapons, along with gear, like clothing, vests, helmets, etc, and those give different stat boosts or penalties. It's a great game and I can't really find anything about this game I don't like. I would definitely recommend giving this a try.			"

												This game is surpirsingly good! Reminds me of the old Rainbow Six games, where planning was essential. The system is unique, and perfect for the ""roomclearing"" idea of the game. The customization of my men makes me lose myself in it. Even if the graphics aren't that good (mostly because the models look a bit weird, but the animations are well made), I like it very much. A game I have been looking for for a long time now.			"

												I bought this game on sale because it looked pretty interesting, and it turned out to be one of the best games i've gotten in months. I downloaded it around midnight and figured i'd play 15-20 minutes to see how it was, and it was 4AM before I knew it. The gameplay is turn based, but once you choose where you want your soldiers to go, it becomes almost real time until your soldiers and the enemy stop shooting. You can make 4 man squads from multiple different special forces from around the world. There's tons of weapon attachments to customize an almost equally large amount of weapons, along with gear, like clothing, vests, helmets, etc, and those give different stat boosts or penalties. It's a great game and I can't really find anything about this game I don't like. I would definitely recommend giving this a try.			"

Then you press ""GO"" and watch the result of your commands.After fights members of your squad gain experience, skills, perks, that can help you in next missions.Choose hard, elite and insane difficulty - and the game will suprise you.CONS: sometimes there are problems with comand interface in the plan phase9/10 - Strongly recommend.

												Pretty neat little tactical game, there are however some ""little"" things that bother me, like no way to sychronize doings, I think it is pretty basic requirement in SWAT to do when attacking a room that have multiple entry points. Other thing is replay, it would be so much better with possibility to view replays from each character and also possibility to slow time and even maybe save replays. Also some gear lacking features and generally lack of them, like different camo's could have somekind of camo bonus if used in correct enviroment, and no sidearms/reloading, it could have been so much more! Anyway I can recommend this game for anyone who like their tactical games like SWAT, Rogue Spear and Jagged Alliances.			"

												It's a port from mobile. The enemy AI is kind of a joke and you have no way to tell your guys to hold fire. They spray lead at everything in their view instead of waiting to get in to a superior position. This often leads to them taking unnecessary damage and is tactically idiotic. Example: 4 tango with backs to entry point. Your team enters and opens fire as soon as they enter while moving to cover. They kill all 4 tangos but take damage in the exchange of gunfire. Had they held fire till in cover, they would be far less likey to take damage while maintaining their advantage of surprise and position.Game lacks ""go codes"" like Door Kickers does so well. In the planning stage, there is no time representation so you can't see how many seconds it will take to move someone to a position. No hold position/delay for X time command. No shoot at this target till threat is removed, then continue with plan. You can't pick which targets to shoot at so no way to prioritize targets. Therefore you can't tell your guys to focus the sniper standing in the open vs the shotguner in heavy cover who happends to be a bit closer.Another glaring problem is that every gun unlocked after the CTAR has not been an upgrade. Currently at 472 stars. Laughing at how many stars are required to unlock the later shotguns. Game is getting far too boring and repetitive to ever reach 1400 let alone the 2100 for the last rifle.From the Devs ""The higher star guns are more for 'prestige' than anything else. They were added as    a prize for fans who wanted something out of the ordinary, so they are camouflaged or Platinum/Gold versions of earlier guns."" Prestige in a single player game? Umm OK.No way to tell what is required to reach 4 stars on any given map. Every map and scenario has different requirements, but game fails to tell you what you are aiming for.  Use an item on one map, ok. Use the same item on another and lose a star but won't tell you are being deducted. Did I get 3 stars on my last try because I didn't make time or due to using an item? No Fn idea. Huge fail IMO. Not enough variety of weapons. One assault rifle after another. Outside of the of the P90, game lacks submachine guns like a variant of the MP5, MP7A1 or UMP. Guess this is due to the squads being military and not law enforcement. These are guns I would expect to find in the arsenal of a game that focuses on CQB regadless of the operators. Game is more arcade'ish than tactically sound. Glad I picked this up at 75% off.			"

												Yes, its worth it.B&C is a turn based, squad controlling Xcom style game. But, instead of taking place in the future, it takes place in the present day, with real life missions, guns, and Spec Ops Units. In short, where as games like Xcom and Arma:Tactics are very stratgy based, I found this game to be based on ""instinct"". Missions took me a matter of a minute compared to an hour. I didn't think about what I was doing, I just was. And I ended up murdering everything with my squad of Zero Punctuation, Black Booker DeWitt, Chuck Norris and Duke Nukem. For $10, it is, well, worth it.I guess ill do a quick pros and cons, for the sake of putting this out there on launch day. When I spend more time with this, i'll attempt to have a good review.PROS+Fast Paced Combat. Like I said, its a welcome brake to be able to spend a few minutes in a game instead of an hour+Easy to learn. You can pick this up, spend about 10 minutes with it, and truley get it. Some may take that as a minus, but I see it as a very large plus+Amazing soundtrack, much better than CoD ghosts, and thats a $60 game.+Deep Costimzation. You can pick out your troops guns, hats, attachments, and more+Replayability. I feel like i'll be playing this for a long time due to all the different possibiltys in pathtaking+Varied maps. From Russia to Mexico, the missions felt different. More than I can say about most games.+Decent Port. In two hours, i got one gamebreaking bug. On hour one. GG+Fun. It seems like endless fun to go all Real Life and say ""Contact Down""!!!Cons-Bad UI in menus. Seems to be better suited to the tapping of a tablet than clicking of a mouseNo real other gripes exept a few things that didnt make it from the IoS version.I'd give it a solid 9/10. Its $9($15 off sale) Buy it, you wont regret it.  "

												Like a simpler version of Doorkickers that uses turns instead of real-time. Unfortunately the amount of time a turn is, or what will happen during said turn, is never explained. As far as I can tell the turns end once all your characters are done moving.Its very much a weird mix of XCOM in the way your characters (or ""operators"" if you prefer) gain perks as they level up, and a weird mix of Doorkickers in regards to position and movement. The movement is controlled by the same button that moves the camera around, so prepare to accidentally swoosh the camera across the map instead of moving your unit a lot.The orders you can give your units are extremely simple. Move, move at this speed, look this direction, or use a perk/inventory item. That's all. There is no synching up actions to ""go-codes"" as in Doorkickers. I guess you could synch up actions by just doing them in the same turn but depending on the stats of your units things might not happen at the same time.Speaking of stats, you can slap all sorts of tacticool♥♥♥♥♥♥all over your units and their weapons. Each thing will affect the weapon or ""operator"" in someway, but it usually just ends up being ""+3 to Accuracy.""Probably my biggest gripe with this game is how hard it tries to be high-speed low-drag hooah operators operatin' operationally. From the intro cutscene to the voice lines to the unit photos it tries so hard to be gruff and tacticool that it just ends up coming off as comical, almost a parody. But I could only listen to what sounded like a teenager saying ""AREA SANITIZED"" so many times before it stopped being funny.This might be fun for an hour or so, I picked it up for 99% off. I couldn't see myself getting this for more than a few dollars.			"

												Dont buy this rage inducing game. Its fun and addicting but then it screws you over and crashes, freezes the screen, locks up your computer, or FREEZES AND DELETES ALL YOUR F***ING DATA AND PROGRESS. This happens way to often, usually in the middle or at the end of a round, and to top it all off, ITS A MOBILE PORT. JUST F***ING LOVELY.Update:Ok now that I have calmed down, let me actually give a good reason why I have given a negative review. First off, graphics. Now I know graphics don't make a game great, or terrible, but the graphics here are the same on mobile. Don't expect anything super pretty. Onto the game itself, the gameplay is very addicting, satisfying, challenging, and fun, as you go through a variety of different situations in multiple locations. There are multiple CTU's to choose from like the JTF2 (thanks for adding that btw) and the SAS along with a bunch of American CTUs and the Spestnaz and some German one that I can't remember the name of. There are also multiple guns, attachments, and perks, with six different classes and various things to upgrade. Now my main problems with this game are the small bugs. I've had a few soldiers downed because the A.I shot a long range wall bang (one end of the map to the other, specifically happening in the Germany campaign) and also when a terrorist dies, the body of the terrorist sometimes goes through a wall, which for me, greatly breaks immersion. I've also seen bullets fly right through people without doing any damage. And as noted previously in my rage, I've experience multiple crashes and lock ups, but I found out that apparently it had something to do with skype being open (my progress being deleted is still bulls***). I still can't really recommend this unless it's on sale, as I'm sure there are other games that have done this better, like door kickers, which I have yet to play (but from what I've seen it looks better, not just graphically, but gameplay-wise as well). If the dev team ever updates this again, maybe fix a few bugs and update the graphics so they look better than on mobile, or add steam workshop support for custom levels and gameplay and graphical tweaks.

Frankly, it was more fun editing the game's text files than actually playing the game.			"

												I bought this game expecting something similar to old swat games. what a disappointment. this game had so much potential, but its so shallow...the squad building is pretty uninteresting and too quick, the missions are too straightforward and demand almost zero thinking ahead.The enemy AI is so dumb and so easy to kill all of them in every mission I played that tactical thinking is pretty much unnecessary. All the enemy ever does is get behind cover and stay there waiting for you to kill them or they run in front of you with gus blazing like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ madman. They dont try to flank you, dont try to counter-atack, nothing. And that, in a squad tactical turn game, should be the high point.so, if you would like a quick and dumb game, get this on sale. otherwise, stay clear.			"

												I do like this game but I feel it's missing a lot. Too much infact that I kept thinking this is in Early Access. It's your average turn-based combat game but it feels quite bare compared to something like Frozen Synapse. I was expecting to be able to fully control waypoints and time everything so that the squad performs a lot more efficient, but at the moment as far as I'm aware I can only set where the soldier goes and which way he looks and that kind of feels repetitive and not very tacticool. ""Deep tactical strategy simulation"" doesn't feel very depthful or simulating at all at the moment.The game does bring me back to titles like Police Quest: SWAT 2 and it is just as fun to play, but I just really wish they'd make the gameplay a little more intricate. Also there are about 7 regiments of special forces but you can only have 4 squads which is kind of disheartening. It's not only the gameplay I wish they'd improve, the game still has quite a few bugs. The Skullcap which is a piece of headgear doesn't fit many of the soldiers and needs some adjustment which makes it unusable unless you're used to half the soldier's head poking out of it. The Ballcap and the Skull Mask don't fit together and also during a Shotgun breach if your soldier is equipped with the LMG he pretty much shoots himself in the face. It has bugs and like I said it's missing a lot of potential. But it is massively addictive. I only recommend this game just by an inch.			"

												If you're an armchair general like me, then you'll enjoy this game.  It puts you in command of an elite group of spec ops soldiers where you make all the calls from selecting the team, equipping them, sending them into harms way, and then rewarding them (i.e. skills points, new/better loadouts, etc.) for successful missions. The game is simple and intuitive, but very unforgiving if you make a bad call.			"

												just got this game from humble bundle. this game looks similiar with Frozen Synapse. But with army style and 3D graphic. Compared with Frozen Synapse, Breach & Clear looks a lot simplified and easier to understand and play with. It has equipments that you could buy from the Marketplace (free, just using points) and there are permanent death feature in this game. Cons: AI is pretty pasive ... they waiting. Wish they use AI like in Frozen Synapse.			"

												Breach and Clear is one of the few games, that wants to go it own way. The missions are varied, fun and the perma death to squadmates makes a really interesting. Making different teams and loadouts to suit missions is extremely fun and rewarding. The game's price is a bit much for the content given, however if you like this style of game its WELL worth it.

												Before I bought this game I had a quick scroll through reviews and most seemed to be one of two things.  This game is so much like X-COM  OR  This game is nothing like X-COM. I agree with the latter. Both games feature turn-based tactical combat and squad customisation but that is where the similarities end. Instead of individual turns for squad members, you plan out the paths for your men, then you press the breach button and each soldier runs forth like a human weapon, pouring shots into balaclava-clad enemies. Each planning phase takes minutes but the actual real time mission plays out in a matter of seconds.I started up the game and was presented with a choice of various world special forces to play as; each with their own minor differences. I chose the SAS because it was the obvious choice (who wouldn't want to be the SAS). You get to travel to various parts of the world conducting three different brands of mission. You kill terrorists, you defuse a bomb and kill terrorists, you kill terrorists. Despite the lack of variation between the mission types the different environments are fun and the basic narratives provided give you some context as to why you are shooting these terrorists/seperatists/diisgruntled blokes. There is a rudimentary leveling up system in which you can upgrade the various skills of each of your 4 squad mates including their class specific skills. The game also has two currencies. You gain star ratings for missions and stars unlock new missions and new guns while silver allows you to buy new weapons, weapon customisations, aesthetics, new gear and consumables. It's simple system but works rather well.TL:DR -+ Be the SAS+ Bring Freedom to Heathen Terrorists+ 8.5/10- No ability to stab people from the shadows- Not enough Content "

												Really cool game! It's like SWAT just in a ""special"" Turn-Based way.Instead of planning the movements of one unit after another, in this game ALL your orders of all your units will be executed simultaneously. This makes this game a way higher dynamic than conventional turn-based games.Features:- You can choose your special unit (KSK, NAVY, SAS, etc. ...)- Customize every squad-member- Different classes/skills- Unlock a huge amount of weapons- Upgrade/Customize your weapons/gear			"

												If you are looking for deep tactical gameplay (as this game is advertised), then stay away, you won't find that here.That said, the game still offers good casual entertainment, if you enjoy leveling up your guys and unlocking new equipment, give it a spin.Quick run-down of the gameplay if you need help deciding if it is for you:You first create a squad, you can decide between some well-known specops units like DEVGRU, SAS, KSK and so on. What unit you select decides the starter attributes of your guys, one will have their special ability trained up nice, other will have reaction time up, other accuracy etc.Then you run through the missions, and I really mean run, as once you discover the one tactic that works 100% of the time against the AI, you'll just breeze through. Not much depth here, and the occasional weird glitch with your guys running backwards or facing a wall for no good reason.Your guys gain experience, and you get money, so in-between you level up your guys (in the end, it doesnt matter much what squad you made, they'll all end up the same just look different), buy them some new weapons and gear.You can upgrade weapons to modify their stats, but here you'll end up again with all the same upgrades as there is one good combination.Sounds like not much, but it is a decent enough time-killer, pick it up when it is on sale.In case 3d is not that important to you, I'd suggest to take a look at 'Door Kickers', that one has tactical gameplay down to perfection.

The good thing about it is that even if you play the same level again, your enemies will not be in the same positions. Plus, you can approach the same mission from multiple angles.

A turn based strategy game that handles the turns swiftly enough to make it feel intense, Breach & Clear puts you through the ringer around every corner. After spending a day or more customising every single aspect of your squad (from face to name to clothes, weapons, armor, and more,) you won't ever experience more abject sadness as you will when one of your turns sees your guy get killed.  Featuring what they call ""Permadeath,"" when you lose a guy in this game, he stays down. Forever. His name, picture, and stats will be listed alongside all of your fallen warriors under the ""memorial"" tab of the main menu.

Хочу отметить, что наряду с прекрасной возможностью устанавливать на оружие различное тактическое оборудование в данной игре к сожалению отсутствует оружия  формата PG или PDR и дополнительный режим ""Освобождения заложников"".

Хочу отметить, что наряду с прекрасной возможностью устанавливать на оружие различное тактическое оборудование в данной игре к сожалению отсутствует оружия  формата PG или PDR и дополнительный режим ""Освобождения заложников"". Надеюсь, что это даст дополнительный стимул замечательным разработчикам игры для введения новых образцов оружия и режимов в игру. Спасибо.			"

												It's like a sexy sexy love child of Hotline Miami, Company of Heroes, counter-strike, with a smidgin' of turn-based gameplay,  kinda... Simple to pick up yet dastardly difficult to master, lost 3 and a half hours to the game on the first play- felt like 20 minutes.Perfect amount of customisation, some elements feel a little ""half finished"" and there's some parts which feel more developed then others, and the graphics don't really break any boundaries for a '14 release. But it's not a block-buster E3 announcement worthy title, and for the price- it's pretty solid.Alas! All in all, if you wanna be a super-tacticoool agent of special forces trickery putting several countries' turrriststs to eternal sleep with a mildly arousing level of precision and professionalism ; buy this game sharpish.

												All I have to say is that, thankfully, I didn’t get this game at full price. Breach & Clear is a strategy, simulation “game” from developers Mighty Rabbit Studios and Gun. and publishers Gambitious Digital Entertainment and Devolver Digital. Let’s get rocking.The GoodI think the best thing about this game is that I don’t have to play it ever again and I can hide it from my Steam library.The BadGames that begin as apps for phones and tablets, should remain on phones and tablets. It’s painfully obvious that this game was designed as such. I don’t actually want to write much else because I feel like this game is still wasting my time by having me talk about it.The MehMove along please.Verdict: NaySave your money, people. This game is $14.99 at full price in the Steam Store. That alone is one of the funniest things I’ve seen this week. There are far better games out there with the same premise that aren’t a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ app port.			"

												Impressions of this game so far are not great.Controls seem more than a bit clunky and cumbersome. Graphics aren't great, it looks pretty brutal (for modern gaming standards) in my opinion. Similar games like Doorkickers use minimal artstyles and graphics but they definitely looked and felt a whole lot better/polished than Breach & Clear; Breach & Clear seems to try to look good, but doesn't really pull it off.Worse of all, I found myself bored within the first few minutes of opening the game. That doesn't necessarily mean that all of it will be, but I definitely don't feel invested the same way I was with Doorkickers. I bought this game because of the positve reviews and because I LOVED Doorkickers. This definitely is in the same exact vein, but so far hasn't excited me. I'm not going to count it out yet, but first impressions aren't great so far.I guess the gist of my review could be as follows:If you're interested in this game but haven't played Doorkickers, go buy/play Doorkickers.If you're still interested in this game and own/have played Doorkickers, you're likely better off to go back to playing Doorkickers...

												I'll start off by saying this game hasn't been updated at all in over 5 months. No patches, DLC's, anything. So far, not so good. And the graphics look like they are from the early 2000's! Super Mario looks better! Not only that, but it's SO BORING! I played it for about half an hour; I then went to Steam Refunds and clicked submit. Best decision ever. Way way WAY too much customization for everything. Buying different lights for your guns improves accuracy, so do triggers, barrels, etc. Why have different categories for items that literally do the same thing? (!!!!!!) The list goes on and on and on. I wish I could say something good about it, but I'm sorry, I just can't. I would be lying if I did.			"

Strategy, Tatic Game, if u just run in with your Characters, as in every game you die quick. So you have to build your own Strat. and try to kill all Enemys fast and without loosing one of your Soldiers. With every Level it becomes more and more funnier and harder to complete the area, but when you do its a great feeling and you wont stop playing for hours.<3 Breach and Clear good game 10/10			"

												Just bought the game, REALLY enjoy it. Hopefully releasing onto PC means that you'll be supporting mods and adding more content for PC users. That said, as glad as I am that I bought it, it looks like it'll dry out pretty quick in the current state. Even starting with small things like expanding the marketplace content would go a long way. There aren't that many guns, and once you unlock all the weapons there's not much motivation to keep playing missions for the mission credits to buy things for your squads. As well, things like Multiplayer, a Level/Mission Editor and custom Campaign planner, Workshop Support, to name a few things, would all be very welcome additions. And probably necessary ones, before too long.Otherwise, this is a solid foundation from which to work. Definitely worth the $10.00 I spent on the sale price, though I wouldn't recommend paying the full tab for it. Not -yet-, anyway.Also, just on the side, please fix the CADPAT pattern. It looks more like AOR2 than CADPAT TW. I have my set hanging in the closet right next to me and there are none of those big off-white splotches you guys have textured it with.			"

												Great little game. I played the heck out of it on Android, and decided to get this on Steam even though I basically completed the game on Android. Decent PC port I'd have to say, though it is a fairly basic game as far as PC games are concerned with a focus on gameplay.I'd compare it most to Frozen Synapse, though this with a real-life visual interface makes it better for me and it is also much less complex to get into. Some elements of XCOM thrown in for good measure as well. Lots of content, that's one thing for sure. To merely complete all the missions (7 locations, five maps per location, 3 scenarios per map), you have 105 missions to play. Which is a lot. Missions aren't super long. The earlier maps are smaller, while as you progress they get much bigger.Lots of different weapons customization, and the 5-point difficulty scale adds quite a significant amount of depth to the game. There are six different classes, though I must admit I never fully utilized each class to its advantage in the mobile version so this is something I seek to correct on my current PC playthrough.At the end of the day, Breach & Clear is a game that would delight tactical strategy gamers. It can be played in short bursts, rewards planning (and risks) and has a lot of content to offer. So much of content I am sure you'll never play all the levels in the game! $15 may be a tad too high an asking price, but the $10 it is on launch sale now seems like a good trade-off. Recommended!

												Good concept. Poor execution. XCOMEU has a more involved feel and less UI clutter, more in-the-action immersiveness, in case there's anyone left besides me that cares. It's a good game, I'll give it that. But the extraneous UI elements, added clutter, added ""game-ification"" floating indicators and general poor-quality animations makes this a non-recommendation. Soldier movement and phases/turns are not half as smoothly done as XCOMEU.Sorry. Could've been great. They've got the makings of something really special here. But not enough budget and polish and developer support from experienced leads and publishers.			"

												This is a Breach and Clear simulator, it feels realistic, however i wouldn't know, when i bought this game i assumed it may be repetitive but i still bought it, and it's not as repetitive as it may look. The game has 3 different mission types, unfortunately all played on the same maps, there are a few different nations that maps take place in, Afghanistan, Turkey, Germany, China and i believe there is also a South American country, can't remember which one, there are 4 different star ratings and 4 or 5 difficulties (can't remember), this equates to 2,000 possible stars, once you unlock a certain ammount of stars this allows you to buy weapons and gear for your squad with in-game currency called ""Silver"", i'm assuming there are 2,000 possible stars because the last weapon is 2,000 stars to unlock, i've played 10 hours and have approximately  140 stars. If you buy this game you're in it for the long haul, but if truly invested this game will keep you playing for a long time. This game is for the intelligent gamer, all situations must be accounted for and as Kevin Spacey once said ""Always account for Variable Change."" This game requires a very strategic analysis. I would like to remind that this is an Alpha and will be updated, but is also unfinished, bugs have been fixed by the dev team fairly well so far. I would recommend picking this up but only if you have an intrest in strategy games. Not for the average gamer. 6/10			"

												Really enjoying this.  It reminds me of a good game way back on Xbox called Full Spectrum Warrior.  I like the money aspect here and buying and selling gear and adjusting squad stats.  I haven't found myself thinking it's missing anything yet.  Maybe a slow motion playback?Definately worth checking out if you're into tactical turn based military games!!!			"

												Fun arcade-style squad-based tactical house clearance simulator. Apparently also available for iOS, but the PC version is stimulating enough to provide balanced challenge across all levels of difficulty. Squad customization is moderately deep, but there simply aren't enough options for equipment and gear to make it a true tactics sim. Some of the animations are a little buggy, and the whole game feels like it's not quite polished. The maps are pretty well made and provide good variation in theme and replayability. Some are a little hard to read or see clearly but they are great for the current game - but again, they lack the depth of strategic options that I would like. NOT WORTH current price (15$), but definitely give it a shot if you've got 8$ and want to feel like a total badass.			"

There is also a ""marketplace"" but thankfully it's only in-game money which you earn at a reasonable pace to equip your soldiers with numerous weapons and attachments. The interface is also pretty easy to use and nothing better than seeing your plan turn out just the way you hoped.			"

												Y'know those moments on the CoD campaigns when you did the slow-mo breaches for like 6 seconds That are really awesome but don't last that long? Imagine that crossed with XCOM and instead of being quick and action packed you control the soldiers for 1 move at a time and control where their vision is and whether they rush a room walk in slowly and just hold it and stay still. It is just fantastic. For a game that was simply from an app, it is incredible. No micro-transactions either. Brilliant game, I'd definitely get it now while it's on sale. (27 March 2014)			"

												Breach & Clear sounds complicated but I can assure you it is not. The game is a simple tactical game based on movement and angle of sight. Levelling up your soldiers makes the game enjoyable. However the game does feel it is missing more content, like more mission or even more perks for your soldiers. There is plenty of gear to purchase using you well rewarded in-game cash. There is also a large range of mods for your chosen guns.The graphics are simple with only little bit of detail but enough for the game to look good.The sound effects are very simple specially the environmental tracks while playing the missions.The gun shot effects are again simple but effective.Controls with the mouse can get a little annoying at times. When you try to move the camera around you will regularly place a move node for one of you soldiers.I do recommend this game because it is fun and enjoyable to play but the game does feel cheaper the its current price tag of £10.99p.

												Considering the fact that this is a mobile game, it's fantastic. It's a great strategy game with similarities to the XCOM series but not as in-depth. Very easy to get addicted to and the different mission types add a decent amount of replayability. Quite a few levels as well.If you can get it cheap and are a fan of turn based strategy squad games then it would be a great addition to your library.			"

												I recommend the game HOWEVER it needs a balance patch. PDW or the P90 is too easy to use, just add a -0.2 gas system and you get the fastest rate of fire in the game which is 0.01 ROF. I mean who cares about the -30 accuracy when you can just spray like a noob =) and steamroll room after room. Also, snipers are WAY too underpowered, low dmg when it hits, low accuracy at long ranges. stats should be increased twicefold to like 150 ACC and 200 DMG(around 2 hits long range and crits close range?) which makes this the lowest DPS in the game and hense the worst gun in the game. If you are only going to get it for supression on the germany maps, i mean theres no point since in 5-6 moves my team will probably finish the game by then. Shotguns should also have their dmg increased since they are also rather weak due to low ROF. you should remove the birdshot feature(cone dmg to room) and go with buckshot. perhaps like a high dmg close range to justify the worth but i guess overall right now its usable.(perhaps intended feature for clearing crowded rooms? useless when shooting on the move and turning a corner, able to get one shot off before enemy takes him down.) Anyways looking aside these recommends, a good game!			"

												Really fun tactical, turn-based, game!Despite it being a port from the iPad the devs have done a surprsingly good job getting it fit for the PC platform.Sure, there are bugs here and there but the developers are constantly adding stuff, like more spec-ops units and guns for example.The game itself is pretty solid, graphics-wise there's alot to wish for but other than that the game fluids well.Breach and Clear features some basic customization like choosing headgear, facegear, vests and clothing/uniform.You can also recolor the guns to fit the environment etc. Gun customization ranges from scopes/sights to IR gear, silencers, triggers and gas systems. (I might've forgot one or two things, point is that you can really make modify a gun to be all ~tier1~.)The turn system and waypoint system works well, it actually feels like cover gives your soldiers (and the enemies) realistic protection from bullets (on a basic scale though).Also, the soundtracks in this game is really good, really adds to that intense feeling when you're planning the perfect endgame move at the end of a hard mission!All in all i seriously recommend this if you want some hours of fun, definietly worth the low cost.

												Good concept. Poor execution. XCOMEU has a more involved feel and less UI clutter, more in-the-action immersiveness, in case there's anyone left besides me that cares. It's a good game, I'll give it that. But the extraneous UI elements, added clutter, added ""game-ification"" floating indicators and general poor-quality animations makes this a non-recommendation. Soldier movement and phases/turns are not half as smoothly done as XCOMEU.Sorry. Could've been great. They've got the makings of something really special here. But not enough budget and polish and developer support from experienced leads and publishers.			"

												Yes, as some others have said the game is a little simplistic.  Small maps and almost no permanence from engagement to engagement, aside from your squad's skills.  It is still wildly fun and engaging.  Despite their small size, some of the maps offer complex challenges, if you want to maximize your score.  The loadout options are widly varied, as are the specialties and skill allocations.  Is it XCOM or Jagged Alliance?  No.  But it is still a lot of fun, when you want a moderately deep, engaging, turn-based shooter conveniently delivered in bite-sized (<10min per mission) chunks.			"

												Great game with great mechanics, I really want to recommend this game but a few things are stopping me from doing that, for one the game has lack of variety, the gun selection is terrible, the clothes and personalization of each squad member is horrid, they will end up all looking like clones, the gameplay is mostly the same however the areas and scenery do change so it looks different but dosen't feel different also when a characters skills are upgraded they don't feel any more powerful than they were before.However this game is great when it comes to tactical simulation as it really does deliver with the tactical approach, you really have to think about the way your squad moves as a whole, the weapons do feel more powerful if they have better stats, some missions are harder to get through and the harder difficulties do feel different in a small way, different enemy types do feel different for example the first time I encountered a sniper unit, I had to change my entire plan once he/she started firing due to my squad taking heavy damage which resulted in one squad member dieing once they stormed a building, the different locations are all themed and it does offer 3 different game modes the last time I checked (there may be more).

												Solid tactical shootymans action, playable on old and underpowered hardware.  Design is tight and levels are short, if it took less time to load and exit I'd call it a coffee-break game. If you played X-COM Enemy Unknown/Within and thought the battles needed to be shorter and tighter, give this one a shot.The main draw for most people is probably going to be gun porn, there are dozens of gun and gear options, most of which only require the money you get from clearing missions.  Additional guns, however, are unlocked by scoring well on those missions.  It's a cumulative thing, so if you do horribly on 10-20 missions, you get the same gun as if you did great on five missions.  And of course you can replay the missions to get better rankings.Sound design is nothing to write home about. Guns go bang (or more of a clank when suppressed), terrorists go ow, your soldiers deliver canned soundbites, music is the generic vaguely patriotic military score.  It doesn't interfere with the experience.			"

												Game is really fun and addicting. If you're a big fan of S.W.A.T. raids or just overall special forces raids in bases then this is the game for you. Customization is good and acceptable. It could be better though. The downside of this game is the lack of gun variety. Sure the guns all have different stats, the problem is that they all look the same which really sucks especially when you want to role play as a specific faction. For example, there is no AK47 in the game so you'll be playing as Spetsnaz using M4's. It kinda sucks but it's not a HUGE deal. The ai can sometimes be real dumb. However, if you lose men, chances are it was your fault. Always buy UAV's. Yes, buy. The game has its own in game currency which you use to buy new weapons and gear as well as consumable gear like UAV's or defib units to revive downed units. There is also a ""perma death"" mode where any man that is downed in battle is dead and is repalced by a recruit. I strongly recommend this mode since it adds tension to every single raid. Overall the game is great and worth a buy. Give it a go and good luck because this game at the hardest difficulty is brutal.			"

												I enjoyed it and played it right to the end, but beside the levels, which were great, it seemed like there was a bunch of extra stuff added on that you didn't really need. Upgrading the gun, adding extra gizmos to it and suping up your armour, but what do you need all the rest of the stuff for? Do I need to spend money to buy face protection? Does it help to have sunglasses on the snow levels?After a while, once you get the idea, it becomes simple to get 4 stars on every level with little plenning. In saying that, I did enjoy it and wanted more when I finished, so that cant be a bad thing.7.5/10			"

												Decent game. I like how it works but after awhile it gets too repetitive. Could increase the number of gears available, that would be great. Other than that, the number of actions you can ask of the soldier is limited. Would have preferred it to have crouch, crawl actions, or be passive or aggresive.Neat game to get on sale.			"

												The game is fantastic, just like I expected. I personally don't have an iOS or Android device, so I wasn't able to play the game prior to its PC release.This game simulates rapid close quarter engagements from a top down view. You as the player controls a squad of elite counter-terrorist forces. Using careful movement and tactics, your goal is to move throughout a building complex and eliminate all hostiles as fast as possible.The different factions you can play as gives me a really nice immersive feel when I give my men orders. It's not just an aesthetic thing either, every faction has a different stat bonus. For example, the British SAS specializes in Evasion.If you're looking for a good top-down tactical shooter (or disappointed with Black Ops II's Strike Force missions), this is most definitely for you. Do not jump into this game thinking you can force your men in rooms like supermen and expect them to go gun blazing, killing terrorists.My only gripe with this game is that the game freezes up my computer during the after action reports, forcing me to use task manager to close the game. Devs, get this nuisance out of the way, periodically update it with new content, and you have yourself a AAA quality indie game.			"

												The first time I played Breach & Clear (B&C) was on iOS, I was a bit dubious as it was a turn based game as these are not to my style, but I tired it and was instantly hooked from the first mission.I’d also recommend this if you were a fan of games like Swat 4 and Older Rainbow Six games where it was about planning your moves to get the best result, as it will take some skill to get a 4 Star rating on the B&C missions. But if you were thinking I’ve got the iOS version so why would I need to buy it again?Well, it’s bigger than the iOS with more mission and gear as standard plus panning the camera and planning is made easier with mouse and keyboard support.

												Breach & Clear is a tactical strategy game that puts you under the command of a squad of soldiers from various forces from around the world, such as the SAS or Army Rangers. (Note that there is a Frozen Synapse DLC, which adds a squad, a new location and few missions from what i know, but i don't own it so i can't say much about it.)TL:DR - Skip to ConclusionREVIEW:There are 3 modes, a Terrorist Hunt (where you hunt down and kill all enemies in the area), Bomb Defusal (pretty straight forward), and Escape Plan (you're surrounded by enemies and you have get your men out of there and to the marked exit). There are a total of around 6 locations from around the world, and there are 5 missions for each location, for each mode. It works in ""phases"", or turns, where you can plan your squad's actions, from where they move and face, to throwing a flashbang in a room while the rest of the team storms in. Early in the game in the first three or so locations, the game is relatively easy, and having two men with suppressors enter a room first to not alert everyone, then bring in the other two when the sh-t hits the fan. There is, on occasion, situations in the Escape Plan mode where a soldier or two will be put in situations surrounded by 3+ enemies making it impossible to escape with them, it's fixable by exiting to the menu, and restarting the mission, but it can be a hassle sometimes. Missions tend to get repetitive.At the time of writing this, I have only reached the fourth location and it's become tougher than the first three, so it can provide a decent challenge, at least on higher difficulties, as i only play on normal. The game includes different roles for your squad members (The names of each role escapes me, i apologise) which can help in different situations, and  you can level them up using XP from completed missions, and you can give them bonus stats to the Accuracy, or the amount of Health they have. Oh, and there's a perma-death option which grants bonus XP. The game also offers customisation, allowing you to change your squad's clothing, camo, armour, and weapons. You can do this with the in-game money you earn from completing missions. The weapons all have available attachments which you can customise to give bonuses, like Accuracy +9001, for example. Despite this, there's a balance, where body armour which gives Health +35 will be balanced by making your movement speed go down. When breaching into rooms you have options for different entry points and different methods of breaching; Kicking the door, shotgun, breaching charge, and lock pick. Each offers an advantage and disadvantage, but i'd recommend just kicking the door open instead.The graphics, animation, and game design are pretty well done for what it is, considering it was also originally made for iOS, with Android somewhere down the line. The game offers two viewing angles while planning, a Top-down view, and an Isometric view, personally i like the top-down view better when planning because its easier to see where you moving your men. After you've finished planning and started the phase, you can view an over-the-shoulder cam of either of your soldiers, which is pretty neat, although sometimes when behind cover you wont see anything. It's there that you'll also notice how the graphics aren't as great as the would be when you're planning in t-d or iso view. There are some neat effects, and slow motion queues, which i can't say look amazing but it's tolerable. Additionally, the animations arent too great, especially when breaching and using a lock pick, as the soldier will be picking at the air or the middle of the door, as well as having their gun floating in front of them whilst doing so.CONCLUSION:Gameplay:+Multiple game modes+Different locations+Stealthable missions (for some)+/- Mission difficulty-Escape Plan mode-Repetitive missionsVisuals:+Decent textures+Effects+Different camera angles-AnimationsOverall it's a good game, with decent visuals, good gameplay, more than one game mode, etc. Coming from a more casual standpoint, for a tactical, strategy based game, it's definitely worth a buy, and if you can get it on sale even better. If you're a more ""hardcore strategist"" or prefer more robust strategy games, then it may not be worth it to you.			"

												Great game with great mechanics, I really want to recommend this game but a few things are stopping me from doing that, for one the game has lack of variety, the gun selection is terrible, the clothes and personalization of each squad member is horrid, they will end up all looking like clones, the gameplay is mostly the same however the areas and scenery do change so it looks different but dosen't feel different also when a characters skills are upgraded they don't feel any more powerful than they were before.However this game is great when it comes to tactical simulation as it really does deliver with the tactical approach, you really have to think about the way your squad moves as a whole, the weapons do feel more powerful if they have better stats, some missions are harder to get through and the harder difficulties do feel different in a small way, different enemy types do feel different for example the first time I encountered a sniper unit, I had to change my entire plan once he/she started firing due to my squad taking heavy damage which resulted in one squad member dieing once they stormed a building, the different locations are all themed and it does offer 3 different game modes the last time I checked (there may be more).

												Linear at times, and repetitive, with not much room for improvement, but I played this game for almost 6 months on my tablet. Maybe that's just me getting bored of this game, but at least the tablet version didn't cost this much for basically the same game, albeit with visual improvements on PC. However, I will concede that it's a fun little game that's great to just pick up and play. Tactical gameplay is really fun, and it's a great feeling when you're able to outsmart the AI with flashbangs, carefully placed grenades, and well positioned soldiers. In the end, I would reccommend this game.			"

												I will start admitting that I do not like turn-based game (I feel as I am playing Monopoli, alone) and that I suck at strategy games (no one's perfect), I always feel like the Ai is cheating, probably because I do not get the strategy gameplay elements fast enough, no doubt.Anyway I was pleasantly surprised that this game turn-based gameplay it's more a planifying stage of the action reminding me a lot of the good days, and actions, of Rainbow Six.Also that the strategy elements are simple: movement, line of fire, cross-fire. This game is actually addictive even if you are replaying the same levels at different difficulties (lot of levels).I also apprecciated there were different gameplays, not only terrorist hunt, but bomb defusal and escape.For stategy players it' surely boring, as it is too simple, but for a noob like me, I enjoyed a lot.A good game, a fair price, a nice surprise.PS: i disliked the actual values of the weapons, as the sniper rifle or the mg do not do the job they should.

It's turned based which makes it feel more casual and relaxing. The ability to tell your character which direction to look is a fantastic feature. I cannot recommend this game enough, however I would suggest watching some videos of gameplay. Like I said, it's turn based and there are no resources to mine, buildings to build/upgrade, etc. but you can earn money each mission to purchase weapon upgrades, gear, and consumables for your squad. It's a great game that I'm sure I will spend many more hours playing.			"

If I select the grenade button but then realise that it doesn't make any sense, i have to switch characters, since I can't undo it without that.

												Solid tactical shootymans action, playable on old and underpowered hardware.  Design is tight and levels are short, if it took less time to load and exit I'd call it a coffee-break game. If you played X-COM Enemy Unknown/Within and thought the battles needed to be shorter and tighter, give this one a shot.The main draw for most people is probably going to be gun porn, there are dozens of gun and gear options, most of which only require the money you get from clearing missions.  Additional guns, however, are unlocked by scoring well on those missions.  It's a cumulative thing, so if you do horribly on 10-20 missions, you get the same gun as if you did great on five missions.  And of course you can replay the missions to get better rankings.Sound design is nothing to write home about. Guns go bang (or more of a clank when suppressed), terrorists go ow, your soldiers deliver canned soundbites, music is the generic vaguely patriotic military score.  It doesn't interfere with the experience.			"

You Command a Special Forces team on a variety of mission types and what's interesting is that instead of being turn based the game pauses for you to plan your individual soldier actions then runs both you and the enemies turn at the same time for 5 real seconds and repeats. It made for an interesting style of play that kept it a lot fresher than it just being an RTS or TBS game.			"

												I enjoyed it and played it right to the end, but beside the levels, which were great, it seemed like there was a bunch of extra stuff added on that you didn't really need. Upgrading the gun, adding extra gizmos to it and suping up your armour, but what do you need all the rest of the stuff for? Do I need to spend money to buy face protection? Does it help to have sunglasses on the snow levels?After a while, once you get the idea, it becomes simple to get 4 stars on every level with little plenning. In saying that, I did enjoy it and wanted more when I finished, so that cant be a bad thing.7.5/10			"

												Great game with great mechanics, I really want to recommend this game but a few things are stopping me from doing that, for one the game has lack of variety, the gun selection is terrible, the clothes and personalization of each squad member is horrid, they will end up all looking like clones, the gameplay is mostly the same however the areas and scenery do change so it looks different but dosen't feel different also when a characters skills are upgraded they don't feel any more powerful than they were before.However this game is great when it comes to tactical simulation as it really does deliver with the tactical approach, you really have to think about the way your squad moves as a whole, the weapons do feel more powerful if they have better stats, some missions are harder to get through and the harder difficulties do feel different in a small way, different enemy types do feel different for example the first time I encountered a sniper unit, I had to change my entire plan once he/she started firing due to my squad taking heavy damage which resulted in one squad member dieing once they stormed a building, the different locations are all themed and it does offer 3 different game modes the last time I checked (there may be more).

												Really fun squad-based strategy game. Says what it has and has what it says. Although the maps aren't randomly generated, there are quite a lot of them, and each time you play a mission on a given map the enemy placement is randomized, so there's solid replay value here. Building your squad is fun, and permadeath (which is option, but gives you a massive XP boost if you activate it) makes your decisions carry weight. Gun customization for your squad members is extensive; MUCH more than I'd have expected from a game of this type. Everything from the sights to the gas system to the trigger of every individual gun can be customized to suit your squad members' strengths.In summary, excellent game. It can be even better, and I hope one day they'll make a game with procedurally generated missions, perhaps with an even greater variety of objectives. But even as it stands right now, this game was worth the price in my opinion.			"

												It's the best thing out there for a room clearing CQB sim right now (at least until Door Kickers comes out).  The mechanics and engines are tight.  The character classes, skill development and kit building keep the gameplay interesting.  Each campaign has a distinct art style, and later campaigns introduce increasingly tricky scenarios including armored enemies, outdoor terrain, and entrenched marksmen.The main downside is that I wish there was a narrative to it.  Each campaign is really just a set of five maps with the same art style.  You unlock campaigns as you go, and can bounce around as you please.  It's nothing like Frozen Synapse where the missions are plot driven.As for other wishlist items, I'm sure destructable terrain would have been a pain to implement, but could have really changed gamplay.  There's also no multiplayer mode (like you'd even be able to find players for such a niche game?)  It's kinda strange you can't break-up or shuffle team-members short of getting somebody killed.  Having to build and separately level full teams is a grindy proposition should the player want to go that route.For those unfamiliar with room-clearing, a more theory based tutorial might be better.  The devs designed the game to reward actual room-clearing tactics.  In room-clearing, the objective is to stay on the attack while not getting shot in th back.  If you're constantly camping behind cover, (like every-other game with a cover-dynamic encourages), you're not getting it.  Get away from the fatal funnel, stay agile, and learn how to sweep geometries.  If a room looks scary, toss grenade/flashbang before you breach.  Unlike the old Rainbow Six or the SWAT series, there's no incentive for restraint in this game (RoE, neutrals, civilians, surrendering enemies), so let the grenades fly.All in all, it's good little single-player indie tactics game.  It's worth you time if you'd dig a fairly authentic room-clearing sim.			"

Overall, an awesome tactical shooter game that everyone who likes military or action or strategy games, should play. Well worth the price and more.			"

												Pros:+ Realistic take on CQB action.+ WEGO format, giving both the satisfying action of CQB and the chance to contemplate and plan tactics for your troops.+ Typical scenario is short enough to be played as a quick, yet satisfying, lunchbreak distraction.Cons:- No complete replay feature (a la Doorkickers), you can only view replay the last turn.- Graphics is spartan. Even the program icon (at least in the Mac version) is low-res and looks ugly compared to other icons.- Different special forces options doesn't seem to offer much difference in gameplay. Bottomline:This is a perfect game for those of us who wished to relive the glory days of realistic FPS (e.g. the original Rainbow Six) but who no longer have either the time, reflexes nor sufficient computing power to play the current batch of FPS.

												Game is really fun and addicting. If you're a big fan of S.W.A.T. raids or just overall special forces raids in bases then this is the game for you. Customization is good and acceptable. It could be better though. The downside of this game is the lack of gun variety. Sure the guns all have different stats, the problem is that they all look the same which really sucks especially when you want to role play as a specific faction. For example, there is no AK47 in the game so you'll be playing as Spetsnaz using M4's. It kinda sucks but it's not a HUGE deal. The ai can sometimes be real dumb. However, if you lose men, chances are it was your fault. Always buy UAV's. Yes, buy. The game has its own in game currency which you use to buy new weapons and gear as well as consumable gear like UAV's or defib units to revive downed units. There is also a ""perma death"" mode where any man that is downed in battle is dead and is repalced by a recruit. I strongly recommend this mode since it adds tension to every single raid. Overall the game is great and worth a buy. Give it a go and good luck because this game at the hardest difficulty is brutal.			"

												Great strategy game. While I cant say its worth $15, it is a solid tactical strategy 'game'. Some of the aspects are not nearly realistic enough to make it a simulator or training tool. Some graphical glitches are really annoying but I managed to get rid of most of them them by turning the graphics down so meh. The game may lack content and variety which is why the price tag isn't very justifiable but if its on sale then it might be worth a purchase.			"

												Breach & Clear sounds complicated but I can assure you it is not. The game is a simple tactical game based on movement and angle of sight. Levelling up your soldiers makes the game enjoyable. However the game does feel it is missing more content, like more mission or even more perks for your soldiers. There is plenty of gear to purchase using you well rewarded in-game cash. There is also a large range of mods for your chosen guns.The graphics are simple with only little bit of detail but enough for the game to look good.The sound effects are very simple specially the environmental tracks while playing the missions.The gun shot effects are again simple but effective.Controls with the mouse can get a little annoying at times. When you try to move the camera around you will regularly place a move node for one of you soldiers.I do recommend this game because it is fun and enjoyable to play but the game does feel cheaper the its current price tag of £10.99p.

												Breach and Clear is a game that I wouldn't expect to be awesome. The simple yet expansive ideas it brings to the table makes it the best (if not one of the best) games I've ever spent $5-10 on.Pros:+Artwork is really nice.+Seemingly endless customization. You pick a spec op group (I think there's 5). You pick out a pre-made face for that person. You pick out each individual person for your 4 person squad. Each spec op class has specific duties. There are more than 4 different classes, so it forces you to be creative with your team.+ Each person carries weapons, apparel, and equipment that you personally customize for them. You can buy and sell all of these at the marketplace.+If you want to earn money you can grind on any particular mission. Also, these missions have slightly radomized locations for your targets.+There are 3 different mission types and each type has 7 locations and 5 missions per location.+You can create and switch between multiple squads.+Great tutorialCons:-I almost went insane trying to get 4 stars in some levels due to the slightly randomized target location.-Some of the guns don't get the stats they deserve. Primarily in range and damage.9.75/10			"

In those games you had to plan your teams movements before assualting a target building or area. Breach & Clear is that gameplay, expanded to become the entire game. You design your team, their equipment and weapons, even down to their uniforms. Then you get put into situations around the globe against different enemies and enviroments.Great game in my opinion, enough said.			"

Pro:Fun game (witout a bug) - Fun planning turn based and strategy game for who actually like that genre.Graphic is nice - near the same graphic as JA:BiA but it's ok for me.Cons:Cover system is the worst - Enemy hide between a desk we can't hit them at all while they can hit us while we cover from solid object/door. Weapon system also broken - Enemy sniper can shoot one shot kill from long distance without using proper 'SNIPER' rifle while we can't even using proper sniper 'RIFLE'.Unlocked higher star/Gold/Platinum weapon not worth at all. - Weapon stat almost identical to normal weapon, just for cosmetic & feel prestige only.

												Breach & Clear is a tactical turn based strategy game similar in execution to XCOM. You take command of a special forces squad of your choosing, and plan your attack on objective based missions (terrorist hunt, bomb defusal or extraction). You have a reasonably wide selection of weapons available, though weapons used by some special forces are absent from the game. Enemy engagements are always lethal, as there is no option to simply incapacitate. The inability to set timings is also detrimental to tactics.Overall the game is entertaining enough to keep you playing for hours, but it lacks scope and depth in comparison to tactical predecessors such as Deadline (1996, Millennium Interactive). The graphics and audio are good, but I'd like to see some destructability, and a greater range of weapons and consumables (no smoke grenades or CS gas?).7/10 - Still playing it.			"

												Whilst the concept of B&C seems cool, the controls feel clunky, and the PC options are practically non-existent--who ever heard of a legitimate military simulator that wouldn't allow you to invert the camera rotation? I'm a fan of the tactical turn-based system (e.g. XCOM, Shadowrun Returns), and having a ""realistic"" tactical sim for modern military squads promised to be highly appealing, but the interface needs an overhaul for me to recommend this game to any but the hard-core military devotee. As I am not, I cannot recommend B&C--XCOM gives me as much ""realistic"" military as I desire. Plus side: I bought it on sale.			"

												Was kind of bored at first not understanding the game; then the game got really intense and I got super into it. Played for a while, repeated missions I failed and got better and better. Later the game kind of lost its replayability. But still it was a great game to play.It'd be cool to have a campaign or something.			"

												Let me begin by saying that this game is alright. There isn't anything seriously bad about it, but there isn't much that is great either. I bought this game during a sale for less than $5.00 and I don't think I would have paid more for it. It's fun little game, but it feels just a step above a java game that you could play on your browser. It's pretty addicting just like some of those simple games are as well. I haven't played a game like this before, but I hear that there are similar ones with more depth. --WHO THIS GAME IS FOR--Someone who is just interested in some casual tactical gaming. Pleased enough with moderate strategy gaming.The Good: ++Levels aren't dreadfully long (about 6 minutes) but there are 7 countries to visit, each with 5 levels to play in. Also 3 game modes (Terrorist Hunt, Bomb Defusal, and Escape Plan) using same maps, This may not seem like alot but it manages to have just enough variety++There are a lot of options with costomization and I've found myself really thinking about my purchases for guns. --However, there is a problem with costomization that I will get into later++Option to play with Permanent death of squad members to earn extra XP (You get a replacement if one dies but you have to rank them back up) You keep the dead members expensive weapon equipment, which is good. ++Upgrading skills for your soldiers is pretty solid with the variety of options (Responce, Accuracy, Health, Speed, Evation and an Skill that goes with the soldier's role; Like Squad Leader gets leadership skill you can upgrade). Not too easy to upgrade but not too hard. ++I like that you can assign roles to your 4 person squad (Leader, Medic, Breach, ect) and that they get perks unlocked as you level up. The Bad: I'm going to begine with the costomization options++There are MANY different guns (some same price and same specs though) On the guns you can pack them with Optics, Lasers, Grips, Flashlights, Supressors, Gas System, and TriggersThe problem is that There are only a handful of attatchments in each category and it's easy to max out on the Optics, Lasers, Grips, Flashlights. There are no tactical thinking involved in these options because they only improve accuracy and have no negatives, so you don't weigh your options. -It's pretty mindless--The good thing is that Suppressors, Gas Systems,  and Triggers provide certain pros and cons that make you consider what perks you want and the expense of something.There are vests and other things but to buy that are important, but there are many items like clothing, goggles and facepaint that provide NO perks. ++The Main Menu is slow and kinda laggy and brings a bad first impression when you put your mouse over a button and it takes 3 seconds for it to light up. The response when you select it is absolutely normal. But makes the game seem cheap. ++The strategy is pretty basic. I've only felt trapped and in trouble a few times. The gameplay is mostly all about keeping your guys near cover and know how to split up your guys (which isn't challenging) If you 4 star all the maps as you progress Like I do and not jump ahead two counties (with harder soldiers) it doesn't stay very challenging. (I went two counties ahead and within two moves I was surounded and lost a guy right when he got shot at) -RIP Brett Breachers ++I'm playing the levels in Germany, (which is the 4th country) and the environment is pretty static. Only a few levels actually had 1-3 of the soldiers walking around in real time as you plan out your strategy. THE UGLY++The ugly part isn't in the gameplay. It is with selecting items in the market and selecting the items when you choose a new gun or add attatchments. +The interface with the Market and costomization is terrible. +When I purchase a new gun I have to make sure to detatch everything on the previous gun, and there isn't any fast/easy way to do it (Such as putting a small 'x' in the corner). I have to select the icon individually for Lasers, Optics, Grips ect. THEN select to 'unequip' this gets very Tedious when there are 7 attachment types. +The interface only shows you the picture of what items are attached to your gun with no name of them or what their specs are. +You have to go to unequip it and then mouse over it to view its specs. +Another problem is that it doesn't tell you the name of what gun your soldier is equiped with. You have to memorize its shape and look in the market so you can compare it to a new weapon. +When you want to compare weapons in the market you can't do it side by side. You have to click the gun, then scoll down/up the list to view the next one. That is teious as well. CONCLUSION:I give the game a 6.5/10 -Would not pay $15.00, wait for a sale of less than $7 if you aren't sure about this. Addicting to play but almost too simple to call it a strategy game. +It needs improvements to make the game more interesting and needs its interface to be changed. +Would be interesting to add multiplayer of terrorists vs Spec Ops. Where each team has to make their moves and then it plays out. +Another request would be to add new scenarios (This might be later in the maps, IDK yet) with a less static environment and enemies. Like Helicopter, or enemies driving in the stronghold with vehicles.			"

												This is a decent game, simple, but decent. It's a top down tactical room clearing (mostly) point and wait. While you can customize your team, and individual weapons, the variety is varied. Lots of armor options(stats seem wonky), but clothing is cut and dry outside of camo patterns. Weapon customization is good (if you like accessorizing AR pattern rifles), but there is a lack of rifle selections. Sure Mk. 18's and Hecklemykochs are there, but no AK? In the words of Dugan Ashley: When I hold an Ak in my hand...I get the feels that I don't understand, Man. Buy it on sale or don't buy it at all.			"

I hope that I will be able to finish the tutorial at least at some point. I know that it is not a helpful review regarding the actual game but this issue was really frustrating.Edit:The game now runs just fine. It is pretty much like it seems to be. A tactical turn-based strategy game with a high level of customization as far as it concerns the gear used.Not the best I have ever played but not the worst either.It becomes repetitive after a little bit but it was expected given the nature of this game.In my opinion it is overpriced but if you can get it in discount then go for it.

												I've really enjoyed my time with Breach & Clear, and plan on having quite a bit more time. I'm only about halfway through, I think. The graphics are nice, sound is fine, and gameplay is fun for me. My squad feels like special forces, but not overpowered. The marketplace is filled with goodies that you will need by the time you get past the first couple levels. I really don't have any negatives in my time playing. The tutorial could be a little better, but you will learn the stuff you need to know as you go along. It's a little bit of guess and test, but the ability to go back and replay old levels with new gear and knowledge make replayability nice.			"

												Linear at times, and repetitive, with not much room for improvement, but I played this game for almost 6 months on my tablet. Maybe that's just me getting bored of this game, but at least the tablet version didn't cost this much for basically the same game, albeit with visual improvements on PC. However, I will concede that it's a fun little game that's great to just pick up and play. Tactical gameplay is really fun, and it's a great feeling when you're able to outsmart the AI with flashbangs, carefully placed grenades, and well positioned soldiers. In the end, I would reccommend this game.			"

												This was one of the most addicting games I've ever played. I usually don't like this style of game and I wasn't expecting much when I purchased it, but I was quite impressed.The amount of customization is enough to keep you occupied for hours. There are several special forces factions to choose from, each having a minor stat boost to differentiate from the others. You can customize every soldier in your squad, unfortunately you do have to pick from premade looks but there's so many that it's not that big of a deal. After you've given your soldier his look you can pick one of the classes/roles, each having their own bonuses and skills that unlock as you level the soldier up. Then there is gun customization, there are a lot of guns to choose from, though it can take a while to unlock some of them. Unfortunately most of the guns are just different versions of the same gun with different stats. Furthermore you can equip scopes, lasers, flash lights, triggers, grips, and even change the gas system. After you have your soldiers outfitted with guns there are several helmets, vests, camos, etc. to choose from. It's really amazing for such a small game to have customization that rivals games like Battlefield.The gameplay is fun and thoughtful planning is your best weapon. Once you get a handle of the game the earlier difficulty levels can become sort of a faceroll, but don't worry there's multiple difficulty levels and you can tell a difference on each one. If you want to make it even harder on yourself you can select the permanent death option which is exactly as it sounds, contrary to the regular mode where your soldier will just be out of that battle but back again after the mission is over. I've always been a fan of hardcore modes in games so this was a great feature for me, though it caused me some pain a few times when I had almost max level soldiers die, then had to replace them with a fresh level 1.My only issue with the game is there is I guess you could say an ""OP"" gun. I will not list which gun this is as I don't want to ruin anyones experience with the game. But once I outfitted all four of my soldiers with this gun the game was too easy even on the hardest difficulties. All in all, a surprisingly impressive game. 9/10			"

It plays a lot like Frozen Synapse but has a greater focus on the units themselves (vests, weapons, attachments, skills, perks, etc.) than the timing and coordination of movements.

												TL;DR: Great light strategy game that will be very addicting for the first few hours for most. In a nutshell, it is a turn based strategy game in which you must complete levels to unlock new and better stuff, to be able to accomplish new and harder levels! Standard procedure really.Breach and Clear (B&C) is a port of what was original a mobile game (IOS, Android). It does have added content, however its origins still show through its simpicity. The graphics are decent and hold up to HD displays. but this the main improvement. It depicts multiple representations of real world Special Operations groups in a variety of environments, with the player being the commander that holds an eagle eye of the battlefield. The authenticity of much of the info in the game (such as the loading screen tips) is indeed relevant and true to modern day SOF, although the ""tactics"" the game pushes aren't necessarily completely accurate due to the reliance on user input of what to do.Technical Performance: Although I am running this on ""gaming"" (albeit aging) hardware, it should hold up on almost any machine at a very nice framerate. There's really nothing intensive computationally in the game. Loading times between levels  are minimal. The only adjustable settings in the graphics section are antialiasing (up to 8x), game resolution/full screen, and vsync.Starting out: There are 7 factions (squads) that you can choose from to customize, each with their own unique skill boosts. There's no context on why one might be better than the others, so it's essentially just luck. There's no reason to slave over the decision, I'd recommend just picking the squad you think looks the best aesthetically. You then select from a multitude of soldier types to fill your squad. This decision matters quite a bit as each has its own special abilities that have huge value on the battlefield. As long as you pick a variety (one of each), again don't think too hard about it. Afterward, you go through a relatively short tutorial that shows off the game's mechanics and basic strategies. Very easy to pick up, unlike some strategy games that overload my brain (and processor) from the get-go. Entertainment value: I personally wore out most of the game around 10 hours, going through every mission (7 total) and sub level (5 per mission, making 35 total playable stages without DLC) at first on normal difficulty then attempting them on insane. I've found that insane generally is actually quite doable for the most part, although on some levels (especially on the ""escape plan"" gamemode) they are quite impossible to perfect. There are 3 game modes: terrorist hunt (eliminate all hostiles), bomb defusal (reach and defuse one or two bombs), and escape plan (get as many squads members as possible to a position on the map). Each gamemode reuses the same missions and sub-levels, however the initial position of your soldiers varies. The reuse of the stages does get tiring eventually, but each stage provides enough enough entertaininment for a few plays. At the end of each sub level, player performance is rated on a scale of 1-4 stars, 4 being perfect or somewhat close to it. Criteria (as far as I can tell) is the time spent and how many squad members went down during the course of the sub level (this is the larger of the two criteria). Stars actually matter as they unlock the ability to purchase new guns (all accessories and gear are unlocked at default. Completion of a sub level also awards a certain amount of money, which can be spent on better equipment (guns, gear, etc). -As a little side note, it's interesting to see B&C incorporating a lot of big name brands into the game, such as but not limited to Crye Precision, Tyr Tactical, and Surefire. Even if the company doesn't have a nod, their equipment is still featured (LBT 6094, Giessele triggers, and a LOT more). This defintely is a seldom-seen feature that adds a authenticity. One of the flaws I see in the game is the lack of thought as far as gun and equipment upgrades. It's somewhat 2-Dimmensional, as there is often a clear ""X plate carrier is better than Y plate carrier in every category"". It seems almost carelessly done, as it significantly dims the strategic value of many purchases. In the end, out of the 18 long rifles featured, I purchased maybe 10 of them, skipping from the default rifle (M4 carbine) to some of the higher end guns by patience and thriftiness.  Gameplay: Quite fun, but reptitive after everything worth buying is unlocked. Each turn is worth 5 seconds, and works in a way similar to Fire Emblem. You start each sub level by picking from 1-4 entry points that your troops can breach through, and work your way to the objective. Each soldier has a movement range, effective firing range, etc depending on their stats and equipment, so each squad member has the potential to be very diffferent from the next. Sub level design is actually quite thorough, albeit somewhat linear at times. Usually, there are a few ways to approach an objective, through different paths. Object placement is realistic, and although this sometimes does not work out tactically, the developers really try their best to keep gameplay relatively balanced. Experimenting with new unlocks in different situations also adds to replayability, however in the end there's really only a couple of guns that players might choose to switch betweeen as they are superior to all others. I feel that some of the elements of the game, such as stealth, do not matter in the end. The developers seemed to have added them in as they are viable in real life, but the way the game works makes it relatively ineffective and I end up shooting my way through every mission anyway. Plot: There is no plot to B&C, not really even a true attempt at one, however this works out for the game. There are 7 ""missions"" that take place in different countries/stages, each with 5 sub-levels that have short descriptors which are essentially formalities. User Interface: The UI is especially important for strategy games as it can be confusing for newer players who have not learned what each button does. However, B&C is a relatively simple game that, once you go through the initial tutorial, you've pretty much mastered the controls. Everything is very intuitive and well organized.  "

The tactics, gameplay, gear, teams, all of those are realistic and fun, especially the planning. You can also customize your member's name, squad name, what gear they will be wearing, what optic they will be wearing, what color of the gun they will be using, the customization is very vast. You can have your team kicking doors the way you want them to look.BUT, the voice acting and sound quality needs to be improved. The weapon doesn't sound very realistic, and the flashbang sound just pains me. Especially when your team member says ""flashbang out"". It sounds like a damn robot. I would rate this aa 7.5/10. I had major fun playing this game, but there are lots of things that needs improvement.			"

												I enjoyed it and played it right to the end, but beside the levels, which were great, it seemed like there was a bunch of extra stuff added on that you didn't really need. Upgrading the gun, adding extra gizmos to it and suping up your armour, but what do you need all the rest of the stuff for? Do I need to spend money to buy face protection? Does it help to have sunglasses on the snow levels?After a while, once you get the idea, it becomes simple to get 4 stars on every level with little plenning. In saying that, I did enjoy it and wanted more when I finished, so that cant be a bad thing.7.5/10			"

												Awesome Tactical Combat. You Command a Special Forces team on a variety of mission types and what's interesting is that instead of being turn based the game pauses for you to plan your individual soldier actions then runs both you and the enemies turn at the same time for 5 real seconds and repeats. It made for an interesting style of play that kept it a lot fresher than it just being an RTS or TBS game.			"

												A tactical gaming must have!!! Plain and simple.Having originally started out on Doorkickers as my top-down squad based tactical game, I can safely say that Breach and Clear is a top quality game. The customization abilities for tactical and appearance benefit are the hallmarks to B&C. The idea of ungradable skills based on mission performance is a nice touch, making you really think your moves before you breach a door (pardon the pun!!).  I could keep rabbiting on about B&C, but I think you'd be much better off getting the game and seeing it for yourself.			"

												If you are into CQB tactics, this game is for you. It requires planning and is a turn based game. I like the fact that you can customized your special operatives with different gears, and xp points. Rushing into a scenario without planning, means your guys can be taken out easily.  There are several game modes, so you can learn how to play it. Your squads can composed of different soldiers from different armies of the world. Thumbs up from me.			"

												This was one of the most addicting games I've ever played. I usually don't like this style of game and I wasn't expecting much when I purchased it, but I was quite impressed.The amount of customization is enough to keep you occupied for hours. There are several special forces factions to choose from, each having a minor stat boost to differentiate from the others. You can customize every soldier in your squad, unfortunately you do have to pick from premade looks but there's so many that it's not that big of a deal. After you've given your soldier his look you can pick one of the classes/roles, each having their own bonuses and skills that unlock as you level the soldier up. Then there is gun customization, there are a lot of guns to choose from, though it can take a while to unlock some of them. Unfortunately most of the guns are just different versions of the same gun with different stats. Furthermore you can equip scopes, lasers, flash lights, triggers, grips, and even change the gas system. After you have your soldiers outfitted with guns there are several helmets, vests, camos, etc. to choose from. It's really amazing for such a small game to have customization that rivals games like Battlefield.The gameplay is fun and thoughtful planning is your best weapon. Once you get a handle of the game the earlier difficulty levels can become sort of a faceroll, but don't worry there's multiple difficulty levels and you can tell a difference on each one. If you want to make it even harder on yourself you can select the permanent death option which is exactly as it sounds, contrary to the regular mode where your soldier will just be out of that battle but back again after the mission is over. I've always been a fan of hardcore modes in games so this was a great feature for me, though it caused me some pain a few times when I had almost max level soldiers die, then had to replace them with a fresh level 1.My only issue with the game is there is I guess you could say an ""OP"" gun. I will not list which gun this is as I don't want to ruin anyones experience with the game. But once I outfitted all four of my soldiers with this gun the game was too easy even on the hardest difficulties. All in all, a surprisingly impressive game. 9/10			"

												7/10Plenty of fun, but about as deep as a thimble.The Good--- Tons of fun. Extremely satisfying to clear a level of badguys in like 14 seconds of ""real time""--- Just like the old Rainbow Six before they dumbed it down, (minus the Rainbow Six first-person mode)--- Passable graphics and sound. Good enough for what it is.--- Randomly generated enemy locations thwart attempts at replaying with prescience. --- Flanking seems to remove the need for dice rolls. I hate dice rolls. Strategy games should win or lose on strategy, not dice rolls.--- Levels can be replayed in a variety of different modes: Terrorist Hunt (standard), Defuse the Bomb (capture and hold), and Escape. These add a lot of really awesome replayability--- Heavily moddable equipment, but I kinda wish it were more moddable, and that there were some way to save loadouts--- Enemy AI isn't totally dumb. Uncoordinated, perhaps - but its how I would expect them to act in the face of marines kicking down the door. (Dive for cover, unload magazine at doorway)THE BAD--- Clunky User Interface, with some frustratingly annoying problems.--- No story, plot, or characters. Just a series of, what are essentially just ""puzzles"". Puzzles solved with guns and grenades, true... but the puzzle is always: ""Get all the Marines to flank all the terrorists as quickly as possible"", just with new environments each level.--- Guns are pay-to-win, which is a bit silly for a game touting its realism. I would expect realistic prices, not having guns that ""unlock"" when your navy seals reach a certain level, and like super-sci-fi versions from some of the company's other games--- Gameplay mechanics are more reminiscent of tabletop than real tactics. Cover can't be thwarted (except with grenades), so its all about getting baddies in a crossfire. I suppose there's nothing strictly -wrong- about this, except that (once again) it flies in the face of the vaunted realism--- A lot of the equipment is a bit silly. You might get a gas assist system that increases damage by 3 but increases noise by 3, then add a silencer that decreases noise by 3 but also decreases damage by 3. Somehow I feel that the net benefit of something should be greater, not just even-out--- Soldier customization is rather bad. You may find yourself doing the same thing over and over. Like if you want to switch out for close range for a particular level and then switch back afterward, you need to go back and replace every single item. There are no preset or savable loadouts. Depending on your level of customization, this can be quite tedious. For example: all my soldiers have helmets and armor painted black (paint applied separately), and guns with 6 unique enhancements. The guns and all the enhancements also have to be painted black (etc).IN CONCLUSIONFun, but not perfect. I really wish they'd add a plot like Splinter Cell or something. Something in-line with what they're trying to do, but make it more interesting. UI and the market/loadout could really use a lot of work. Otherwise pretty solid!			"

It's turned based which makes it feel more casual and relaxing. The ability to tell your character which direction to look is a fantastic feature. I cannot recommend this game enough, however I would suggest watching some videos of gameplay. Like I said, it's turn based and there are no resources to mine, buildings to build/upgrade, etc. but you can earn money each mission to purchase weapon upgrades, gear, and consumables for your squad. It's a great game that I'm sure I will spend many more hours playing.			"

												Amazing game, I played this after I played Door Kickers... and I actually prefer breach and clear !There are a lot of possibilities for customization, from the gear of your soldier to the color of the silencer of the weapon of this soldier. The game's pretty hard I gotta say, and unfortunatly it's not perfectly balanced : a team full of shotgun with a lot of HP can do a better job than a balanced team with a flanker, a sniper, etc... even when the level of the shotgun team is way lower than the balanced one. But it's not a competitive game so as long as you're having fun I suppose the balancing doesn't really matter.The gameplay is simple to master and I got into it really fast. The graphics are surpisingly good, gunfight scenes looks great and are intense.As I said the games is quite difficult, especially if you go in permadeath mode, where your soldier doesn't respawn at the end of the mission if he is killed in it. It makes every single gunfight super intense.To sum up I'd say that this game is deffinitly worth checking out, but you may prefer door kickers. Play both of them and make your choice :)			"

												It's fine and all, fills a niche, but it's stale and lacks obvious features. It's a bit like a 3D version of Doorkickers (worth checking out if you're considering this). The combat is turn based, let's say you were storming a room with two entrances and lined up 2 guys outside each entrance. You might conceivably want them to storm the room at the same time, but alas, no, the only way to tell if that's going to happen is with a timeline style thing which runs across the characters move path. So on the floor on the otherside of the door might say 2 seconds. Well, on that 2 second mark you might want your other team to storm in. Unbelievably, there's no way to synchronise those events, by say, telling the other guy to pause for a second before proceeding. You could get him to run in circles before going through the door I guess, but then you hardly feel like a SWAT team. Another similarly stupid mechanic is that you cant order someone to go stand where someone else is stood, even if they're going to be 4 seconds down the hall before the other guy gets there. I think the real fun stems from the customisation and the content around that. Lots of maps, lots of guns, and a combat system that is just competent enough to be fun.			"

												Absolutely love this game. 9/10 rating.++ Strategy is evolving. Use different breach types, split up your team at different access points, change perspectives at different waypoints++ Variety of mission types is good.+ Weaponry is broad. I wish there were more levels that involved a sniper and more sniper gun options.+ Five different difficulty levels to make each level more challenging the next time you play.- I'm not a fan of the ""Escape"" version of the missions and their randomness. I wish those levels were more true extraction, where you'd have to fight as a unit through to a waypoint.- I would prefer the ability to set a sniper in a lookout location to provide cover, but this is very minor and probably something I'd want the devs to include in a future option.- Again, something minor that would add to the game, would be if you could plan the strategy, but then control one of the team members as a FPS.- Very minor. I wish each team had their own bankroll, instead of sharing a community pool.The positives far outweight the negatives. Very fun game, and playing at multiple difficulty levels increases the replayability.**Have not played Frozen Synapse DLC yet, but plan to buy it**			"

												I will start admitting that I do not like turn-based game (I feel as I am playing Monopoli, alone) and that I suck at strategy games (no one's perfect), I always feel like the Ai is cheating, probably because I do not get the strategy gameplay elements fast enough, no doubt.Anyway I was pleasantly surprised that this game turn-based gameplay it's more a planifying stage of the action reminding me a lot of the good days, and actions, of Rainbow Six.Also that the strategy elements are simple: movement, line of fire, cross-fire. This game is actually addictive even if you are replaying the same levels at different difficulties (lot of levels).I also apprecciated there were different gameplays, not only terrorist hunt, but bomb defusal and escape.For stategy players it' surely boring, as it is too simple, but for a noob like me, I enjoyed a lot.A good game, a fair price, a nice surprise.PS: i disliked the actual values of the weapons, as the sniper rifle or the mg do not do the job they should.

												I am new to this whole genre, so my review may not be suited for everyone. But I have an opinion afterall which I would love to state. This game is fun in that sense, that you can carefully plan each and every move executed by your squad. The controls are somewhat clunky though. If I select the grenade button but then realise that it doesn't make any sense, i have to switch characters, since I can't undo it without that. The graphics are not pretty either, but this is a budget title and I don't really care about that.			"

												So, Breach&Clear is a tactical simulator? After a few hours of stringent gaming i figured that out wholly. The tactics you go through are really immersive, and it shows you how the real tough guys do it in the real world. And then there is all the customizing, amazing! The only downside i can find, and that is not even gamewise is that when my soldiers die and end up in the memorial wall, the portrait is different than the one they were given, which just for me is a bit annoying but whatever. All in all 10/10, XCOM plus CSGO (or something, you kill terrorists and can disarm bombs)			"

												I usually dislike turn based strategy games, but not this one.It has nice concept and would re-play it over and over again.✔ Good gameplay & concept.✔ Easy to understand & adapt.✔ Good graphic, well detailed & well optimized.✔ Good voice acting, even sometime they repeat same word all over squad.❌ Basically have 3 different game mode but with same map, not modified even a bit.❌ Weapon upgrade? It's some of them is not even an upgrade, just re-skin. Need higher star to unlock weaker gun? Need a rearrangement.How much I like this game score: 8/10, I like itHow much I want to recommend this game score: 9/10			"

												It's really simple, still has some bugs that you need to walk around (like stiff hands for some uniforms for some units), the variety is not really satisfying nor is that great. The game could be better with some, at first glance, easy and simple life improvements and, imo, that's the only thing that you'll actually notice while playing - cause all the bugs, lack of decals and whatnot will be just white noise in the background once you're leading your men in thick of action - the tingling sensation that this could be absolutely great PC game, but ended just as acceptable one.But damn, if you catch it on a sale, then you get yourself a solid ~20 hours of game straight away for a couple of euros. Or bucks. Or lira. You know, currency. I'm pretty sure I just found myself another game I'll sink few hours into every few months I'll get reminded about it and decide to reinstall.			"

												Time Played: 7 hours as of this review.I caught this game while it was on sale for 5$  And that was about all I'd spend on this game.Graphically; the game uses rather dated graphics made worse by missing textures from some of it's enemies, the first few levels are the worst in that regard. Also, lacking polish in regards to the little things, one of the most clawing is the AWP sniper rifle ejecting multiple brass casings when it fires.So, graphics aren't a deal breaker nowadays, so what's the tactical gameplay like? Basic. The game features cover, breaching tactics, and grenades, All were great in X-com: Enemy Unknown, but here they feel very contrived. I have yet to find a good position for my sniper, and enemy snipers start in very good positions. Starting positions in later levels are very impractical, leaving your squad open during the most critical entry moments. Furthermore, any feature involving doors (any breaching methods, and the ability to wedge doors closed) are not even present in many missions because they take place outside, with no other 'breaching' methods to replace them. I figured outside grenades could serve as a breaching method, but many of the maps are designed in such a way that you cannot throw grenades directly out the doorway to clear yourself an opening.Which brings me to enemy placement, which is randomized. Don't get me wrong, randomization brings replayability, but unless you want to spend a fifth of your mission earnings on UAVs for each mission, then you are left with no way of knowing where even basic enemies directly at your starting position are. This turns most missions into a bloody slug-fest as you pray your soldiers can even make it in the door without dying. Especially when mexican cartel snipers are far better shots than your special forces sniper with max accuracy and loaded with high-tech targeting devices.At the end of the day, the game uses many of the tired and cheap methods of increasing difficulty that I thought we left behind in the 90s, and for me, that makes this game a far cry shy of being worth 15$.

												Great game for fans of a high stakes strategy game, not knowing where people are really makes planning a key part of the game. Being able to change your squad and gradually upgrade it over time really gives you a sense of your squad really stepping up in the ranks. The moment i got the game i loved everything about it, my favorite part has to be the great gameplay. I hope they make a third one like this but not like the second disappointing one in the series. If they do make a third game i hope i becomes a SWAT game with negotiations and once again more strategy in the game. Overall definently worth the price and a great game i highly recommend.			"

												Solid tactical shootymans action, playable on old and underpowered hardware.  Design is tight and levels are short, if it took less time to load and exit I'd call it a coffee-break game. If you played X-COM Enemy Unknown/Within and thought the battles needed to be shorter and tighter, give this one a shot.The main draw for most people is probably going to be gun porn, there are dozens of gun and gear options, most of which only require the money you get from clearing missions.  Additional guns, however, are unlocked by scoring well on those missions.  It's a cumulative thing, so if you do horribly on 10-20 missions, you get the same gun as if you did great on five missions.  And of course you can replay the missions to get better rankings.Sound design is nothing to write home about. Guns go bang (or more of a clank when suppressed), terrorists go ow, your soldiers deliver canned soundbites, music is the generic vaguely patriotic military score.  It doesn't interfere with the experience.			"

												While I wouldn't necessarily compare the game to X-Com, neither new nor old, it is hard not to draw some parallels, considering both are Turnbased Tactics games. Breach & Clear has more in common with Frozen Synapse than it does have in common with X-Com though.The gameplay is rather simple. Enemies are randomly seeded into a map, where they will do their terroristy things like inspecting the carpet in an otherwise empty room, and you are tasked with clearing the bad guys, finding a hostage/bomb or escaping to an exfil location. The random seeding of the enemy gives the game quite a bit of replay-ability.Each level has one or more entry points and you as the player are tasked with dividing your 4 people team among the entry points and then go from there. You plan each move in its entirety and then once you have planned it, you execute said plan. Covering all the angels, trying to use cover to your advantage or throw flashbangs or regular grenades into an area to deal with the enemy.The game's simplicity is also its strength. Nobody ever said that chess was a boring game because it had a bunch of simple rules and Breach & Clear is like that as well. You do have a couple tactical options but for the most part its simple facing, facing and positioning, that wins the day.Graphically the game isn't impressive, but being a spiritual successor to Frozen Synapse it is still a step up from a blue backdrop and green and red enemies. Also I can't quite put my finger on it, why I am liking this game more than I did Frozen Synapse, but I also couldn't name any real difference between the two other than Breach & Clear having the more appealing aesthetic.Breach & Clear also offers a class and level system, with your team getting more experienced and unlocking more abilities. And there is a shop allowing you to buy new unlocked weapons, equipment and cosmetic items.All in all a solid game with, at the very least, the early missions taking about 10 to 15 minutes tops.			"

												One of the best tactical RTS games I've bought for $3 CAD.The game does get repetative after a while (I am 1.5hrs into and already getting a bit repetative), and the graphics are a bit dated. Also, the gun shots will scare you - make sure to turn your volume down...However, the soundtrack is pretty good; customazition of your squad is fairly deep; the game is easy to grasp; simple gameplay, and it doesn't try anything too complicated.TL;DRIf this game is on sale, get it. If not, wait for it to go on sale.			"

												Admittedly I barely get to game these days , but  with that said I am enjoying short bursts of this game immensely . It's hardly ""perfect"" but  with that said it's stepping  in almost all the right directions and actually applies real life logic that you'll see any tactical course instructor  teach  during any given training day in any shoothouse across the world. no  bizzaro ""game logic"" applies within these missions ( just the in game ""marketplace"" ..that  could use some tweeks but it's the  only ""game logic"" moment I have encountered . )  and  all that one could hope to learn about sweep and clearing applies hereIf you are asking yourself : Which  do I  get , this XCOM Doorkickers or Frozen synapse? ..just get all 4 trust me, each has their merit .If you are like me and spend more time  practicing with  arms and equipment than playing  games... get this one FIRST. Still get all 4 though! , why miss out on great  strategy gaming? and when you're done with all of em  come back  home to the  original X-COM titles...They miss you. (but their aim is improving!)Now if this game gets a  Vs. mode more avaiable  squads from around the world ( where's my FBI H.R.T. ? ) and steam workshop support / D.I.Y. levels   in either this title or a sequel  we pretty  much have the PERFECT  modern military game..and one that the COD kiddies  will  loathe and despise ...because  ""gasp"" gods forbid that  they engage more than  two braincells that  don't involve flinging profanity, pathetic ""trolling"" ad hominems, or insults through standard TCPIP via a cheap headset .Sorry  had to ..

												Its a solid game, not too complicated. But it also have a very tactical feeling, taking down a room with out taking fire, because you used time on planning feels good. Graphics are not the best, but its a cool game.			"

												Ima change my review, This game is fun till you beat it and then you realise there is nothing else you can do. Yes there is a couple mods but all those are is reskins. If the devs didnt just leave this game for dead it still be a good game but now i cant recomend it.			"

												Played it on Android, loved it.Playing it on PC, loving it.Tactical shooter fans can't go wrong, hours of fun guaranteed. Nice sound and graphics, some cool  animations, tons of customization features, nice balance between feature overload and simplicity. Big fan. For this price? Must buy!			"

												A real fantastic strategy game, with amazing gameplay, but its to short game, and small choose of a squad country type.I'm hoping this game is getting an update, but it will not, as dev leaving all B&C games to die or rotten.I love this game because it reminds me of childhood memories, playing this kinda tactical strategy game on a phone, whats the name... oh its RAINBOW SIX series.

												I don't normaly review games, but when i do, it is something worth mentioning. If you like TBS RPGs as much as I do, don't miss this one; it's easily become one of my favorite games of all time. This game scratches that itch that can only be scratched by a well ballance and properly developed tactical game that lets you play the way you want to play without forcing you into prescribed roles or onto prescribed rails... This game RULES!! I can count the number of games i have played for more than 5 hours in a sitting on 1 hand and this is one of them.Put on a pot of coffee... you might need it lol			"

												If you are looking for a great solo strategic shooter I would highly recommend this game to you. Good amount of customization and character building, but the gameplay is excellent! Choose paths, cover angles, and push up through whatever scenario you are doing. So many different options and ways to complete the objectives, I love it. Lots of perfection to be done to get all four stars on every level. While I've only played it for 3 hours Im about 30%-40% done with the game on normal difficultly, Im sure going back and getting 4 stars on the harder difficulties will give you plenty of gameplay time.

												Clunky, underwhelming, feature-lacking interface that just makes me want to play Doorkickers again. There's no means to make soldiers wait to synchronise movements, you can't have them wait at a door before opening it, etc.Glad I only paid $1.50 for it, but it'll be worth it if it keeps someone else from wasting their money. Just go play Doorkickers.			"

												---Important: Game was bought in a sale---Pros:-Pretty motivating progression System with a lot of gear selection and stat editing-Gameplay is fun and offers enough gameplay depth-Graphics are decent considering the game is already a few years oldCons:-Walls do not become see-through when necessary which causes issues from time to time-Controlls (especially the menus) feel clunky-Compared the Doorkickers the game offers not as much gameplay depth (no breach options after the first door, less actions that can be ordered for a move, etc.)Overall the game is fun and I don´t regret buying it in a !sale!, I wouldn´t buy it for the current full price though. Gameplay wise I think Doorkickers is superior because it offers more options to complete a mission. On the other hand ""Breach & Clear"" offers a better character modification and the soldiers act more realistically (lean around corners, etc.). The same is true for the graphics which I prefer over ""Doorkickers"" comic look.			"
