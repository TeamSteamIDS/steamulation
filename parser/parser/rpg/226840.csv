												This game is absolutely incredible. It stays true to the style and feel of the previous games in the series, while also embracing some of the more modern elements in the 4X genre. Some may find the game a bit ""simplistic"" compared to other 4x games, but this is misleading. While this game is very easy to learn, and keeps most of the numbers and math pretty simple, there is an incredible amount of strategic depth to this game, and even after over 500 hours played, with 90% of that focusing on just *one* class, I am still learning new things.The game itself takes place on about 3 different levels. The most prominent level is the tactical combat itself. This is unmatched by any other game in the 4x genre. In truth, it's more akin to the Total War series than anything, except turn based. It is not an understatement to say that this is the best combat system in any of the modern 4x games, bar none.The second level is strategic movement. Many reviewers and players alike who only play this game for a bit do not understand just how much thought goes into something as simple as moving troops around. Each hex has different movement costs, which affects how fast units can move across them. But the movement costs are variable based on race, unit type itself, and even what the player has researched. Furthermore, different types of units may benefit from terrain features, such as Druids and Rogues who have units with Concealment. This allows some of their units to be rendered invisible in forest tiles. Compounding this issue is how classes and races interact. For instance, Dwarven Rogues are the only combination in the game with access to mountain concealment from the beginning, and this allows for some rather unique strategies involving raiding parties in the early game. While many will say that the tactical combat in this game is what stands out, at the intermediate skill level, the strategic level may actually be more important. After all, you can't actually GET to tactical combat if your enemy utilizes terrain to outrun you, or to reach your cities before your main army can get there to repel them.The third layer is the empire management layer. This layer is pretty much what your typical 4x player expects to be the bulk of the game, as games like Civ largely ignore the first 2 to focus entirely on management. To those who have played and enjoyed the Civilization series: be warned. Age of Wonders 3 handles city management *vastly* differently than most other 4x games. The key difference lies in how cities work. Unlike civilization, there are no wonders or structures that can be built in cities to give them a specialized role. But don't worry, there absolutely are ways to make cities unique. Where this game differs from most others is that cities are largely defined by the terrain features within their domain. This creates a very different feel to empire management than other 4x games, in that the single most important factor of a city lies in where it is placed. In fact, a city placed on the right structure can often unlock units that cannot be accessed normally, or allow unusual and powerful modifiers to your armies. Some even give massive bonuses to income, or research.While each layer is important, it is worth noting that this game is still very much different from many other 4x games. The focus is of the game is, at its heart, a wargame. While the diplomacy is functional, the predominant strategy will always be to crush your enemies, and annex their cities. Make no mistake, though. Although the goal is the same in every game, the methods are as variable as your imagination.I'm not exaggerating when I say that there are players in the multiplayer community who have reputations for using an iconic style or strategy, that is almost entirely their own. The sheer number of options in character creation means that a player could very well run a strategy that is truly unique.So if you're looking for a fantasy 4x wargame, you will not find a better one out there. Age of Wonders 3 is simply the best at what it does.			"

												Review based off of playing the Closed Beta. (Which is voluntary, and invites were sent based off of forum participation.)I like TBS games, generally ones with interesting combat systems, and the last one I genuinely liked was XCOM. I've spent the past years lamenting every TBS game that came out, because of the combat systems that resolve the battle in damage exchanges on the World Map. So I was excited about Fallen Enchantress, and I played it for a while, but it had no multiplayer which inevitably killed it for me.So, I was overjoyed to hear that Age of Wonders was returning with all the Tactical Combat and multiplayer features that I so loved. I've played each of the games in the series, I thought that AoW1 was excellent, AoW2 was abysmal and Shadow Magic was great. For whatever reason, I actually expected to be disappointed by this entry and was considering not buying it. After playing the beta, I can see that my initial instincts were unfounded.There are obvious graphical improvements, and I can't really fault them, beyond what I feel is an issue with the change to lower tier unit parties. Though each of the models is well detailed, because they are stood together in a tight stack I feel the units lose a bit of their definition, this might be because of the level at which I zoom out to, but at the end of the day I need to do that to see a practical amount of the battle.I think the time it takes to enact tactical combat is good, there are speed settings to allow you to increase unit movement and attacks if you're in a hurry, and I generally am. The game ran smooth for the most part, and my biggest issue, which is fairly minor, with the combat is that the hitting animations don't feel particularly visceral in terms of sound, graphical action and reaction. (Some do, but for the T1/T2 melee clashes I didn't feel it was as brutal as the earlier games.)I prefer the combat system to any TBS that I have played in the past years, and it allows for larger scale battles as well in beautiful settings. (When I compare it to HoMM, which I dislike, or XCOM's, which I loved, or Civ's, which I found boring as I'm sure I would Warlock, etc.)Each of your Heroes/Leaders has access to a number of upgrades when they level up, leveling up is fairly easy and painless compared to the earlier games (where you had to get the final hit to get the exp) so your heroes become quite strong, quite quickly, but still steps below higher tier units until they reach higher levels. Each hero has it's own class, which grants it access to class specific upgrades, but they all share access to basic upgrades to upgrade stats like Defense, Attack etc. which are fairly straight forward. Each Hero can become a spell caster, and each class has its own subset of spells, though only one spell can be cast a turn (regardless of how many spell casts you have in a battle) which prevents the issue of your army getting instantly destroyed by a barrage of spells in the first round. Your heroes have items slots, and you can get items from exploring dungeons etc. You can also make your own items if your city is advanced enough. I felt that there the items available were interesting, particularly the range of mounts (which unlike other gear displays graphically) that allow you to fly about, in the case of wyverns or manticores, and offer other abilities.I thought the leveling system for heroes was quite good, I found myself often upgrading the default stats and I didn't feel that there was much variation between each hero class type, though there were some cool melee orientated abilities for the Warlord and some interesting ones for the Theocrat, as well as the Rogue. A lot of abilities amounted to global damage reduction to your party, and so the differences amounted to a change in damage type.The class you choose for your leader (which has its own levelling/point allocations and is quite similar to a hero) will determine what research/units you will have available to you through the game, as well as three sub-specialitions you can choose when creating your hero which can give you access to new schools of magic, or more practical exploratory/empire building skills. In that regard I thought that there was a good variation of research/summons/units across the six classes and the sub-specializations added extra replayability/variation to that.Unfortunately, I haven't had time to play the multiplayer. I thought that one of the campaigns was excellent, and that one of them was good, I had some issues with it, but I expect those will be resolved before release. Both of the campaigns were a cut above any TBS campaign I've played in the past, featured interesting protagonists, solid writing, and excellent voice acting.Each campaign has a text, voice-acted prologue, and an epilogue for each mission, and throughout each mission there are text pop-outs for dialogue from your enemies and allies. In both campaigns there is a branching point where you have to choose sides so I believe that would result in at least four different endings, though I'm not sure.Either way, there should be a good amount of replayability and entertainment value from the campaigns, and I'm sure that there will be more to come (both from the developers, and users using the editor), and the excellent mechanics of the games themselves (combat, beautiful world design, variety of units and strategies) will add to the enjoyment of those campaigns. There are currently six races, each has different benefits/negatives to its racial units, there are some instances where lower tier units are quite similar, but I think that's to be expected. Overall, I thought there was a good range of units available and that each of the races/class combinations offered a good variety of choice. Across the campaign you play multiple leaders (races/classes) though your main character always sticks with you, either as the leader or as an accompanying hero.I would recommend the game simply for playing the campaign, or for playing the scenarios available or using the random map generator. If you enjoy TBS games then you'll probably like this one, and it should provide you with hours of entertainment. I intend to play the multiplayer when it comes out, and I imagine it's going to be fun, but as I haven't played it I can't really say for sure. "

AGE OF WONDERS III - Good Turn based tactical combat, Hero RPG elements and Empire building 4X strategy  || 8 || Score Comment   Graphics 8 Nice graphics and detail on the strategic map and even better graphics for units, terrain and magical effects in combat. UI is nice, detailed and easy to use  Audio 6 Music gets a little repetitive - maybe a little more variety needed, sound effects are good but nothing special. Gameplay 8 Age of Wonders III is a turn based, 4X strategy game based in a fantasy setting. The tactical combat view (when your army's battle) is excellent, you really feel like you are head to head with the AI (which seems to do a good job most of the time) in a battle of wits. Casting a well timed spell or outmanoeuvring your enemy can sometimes turn the tide of a battle, unfortunately usually the outcome of a battle is a forgone conclusion due to the relative strength of the units involved, but even when this is the case its still fun to crush your enemy and minimise your losses. The strength of the Units in your army really plays such a large part of the battles that you can actually choose to skip the tactical battle entirely and have the computer automatically calculate the results. Some of the units have somewhat of a balance issue with the higher level units often being able to take down whole armies by themselves with little damage or risk. This inevitably results in a race to upgrade your city buildings to create these higher level creatures. AI at the strategic level is a little predictable but there is still fun to be had placing your cities and grabbing as many resources as possible to fund your economy. One thing I noticed at the strategic level is there doesn't seem to be any downside to city spamming (covering the map in loads of your cities) as you gain resources (mana, gold, research) for each city. Ruins, shrines and artefacts are scattered throughout the maps and these will often require you to fight a monster to claim the reward for your Hero. Hero's are your army leaders you get a main one and then can hire more for gold. Hero's have a selection of spells they can use to aid you in battle, summon monsters or benefit your cities. Items you collect / make can be given to your hero's to increase their stats and they also get skills as they earn xp through battles.   Story 7 The game contains a number of well written scenario's which are fairly fun to play through. Overall I think I preferred playing the random maps though.  
Replayability 7 If you enjoy the game you will probably want to play it again, random maps and steam workshop adds more community made content.   Overall 8 A fan of this genre will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of this game. While not as complex or detailed as others of the same type what it does it does well. Hotseat mode (a mode I loved from Civilisation) is a great addition to this game and playing with friends is a lot of fun. More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

												Finally the perfect game to scratch my TBS/4X itch! I have a feeling that in 15 years or so I will still be playing Age of Wonders 3. I make this prediction because once in a while I still  play the original AoW and it came out in 1999. So unless they come out with an AoW4 or standalone expansion that is even better in every aspect I think this game will stay on my computer and my next computer and the VR headset after... a long time.My favorite part of AoW3 is its focus on tactical combat while still including all the 4 Xs (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) plus RPG elements. There are cities to form into an empire, heroes to level up, spells to research, dungeons to loot, resources to manage, etc... On top of it all players are engaged in battles early and often. The battles are killer fun tactical experiences that take place on their own maps separate from the primary strategy map. When a hex is attacked on the strategy map the armies/stacks in that hex and all neighboring hexes get pulled into the tactical battle. This means there could be 42 units (7 hexes x 6 units/hex) in the same battle and they could even belong to several different players! The combat mechanics like attacks of opportunity, flanking, guarding, and 3 action points to use for movement, multiple attacks, or multiple reactions are very well done. When playing single player I almost always choose to fight each battle manually because they are so much fun, but there is an option to automatically resolve them if you wish.The only bad thing I can say about AoW3 is that it feels like the morale systems need to be flushed out a little more. My wish for morale is that your starting/ruling race should have more influence on the morale of your cities and units and diplomatic relations with independent cities. It was important in past AoW games. These things will probably get improved with some patches, and should not stop anyone from buying the game.There was a period of years where I played a lot of Civ4 and some Civ5. Eventually I found myself thinking - I wish there was more action in these games and battles were more realistic like... Age of Wonders. Before AoW3 was announced, I searched for recent games with gameplay similar to AoW but nothing seemed to be on the same level. Warlock was too simple and too Civ-y... Total War just didn't draw me in... Others didn't even look worth buying. Age of Wonders seems to fill a special niche that no others do.edit: Forgot to mention one of the things that makes AoW games so replayable - the races. Past AoW games had at least 12 races, but AoW3 is releasing with 6 which is a little disappointing at first glance. However, this is made up by the new class system which did not exist in previous AoW games. The developers have done an amazing job making both race and class matter. An elven archdruid feels different than a draconian archdruid or an elven warlord. Thus, instead of having simply 12 races to choose from you have 36 race/class combos (6 races x 6 classes). There are also specializations/spheres that further customize your leader and playing experience, similar to previous AoW games. I expect more races to be added in DLC or an expansion and am fine with that.			"

												Although Age of Wonders III features story based campaigns and scenarios (many of which are obviously balanced for multi-player), the real meat of the game IMO is the Random Map mode. This is equivalent to the default mode of most 4X games like Civilization, and that's what I'll talk about here.Unlike most 4X games which start you off with a single settler in a mostly empty undeveloped world, the default mode (normal game flow) of AoW3 starts you off in a populated world which already has roads, cities and armies. In these games you can get stuck into the action quickly and may not need to build any cities at all, just capture existing ones. These games can be a lot quicker to play than other 4X games.However, the random map games are extremely customisable, much more than Civ. There are three other preset modes - Battle, Empire Building and Adventure - which provide very different game experiences. Better still, go into the advanced setup screens and you can tweak the details to your heart's content. You can start with nothing more than a settler and a leader in a completely empty world, just like Civ, if that's what you want, or you can fill it with as much or as little of the different options that are available. You can also tweak the geography, altering the quantities of different terrain types that will appear on the map.The graphics are superb, they blow away the old AoW games and are better than most current 4X games IMO. The music is excellent too, one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a game, making it well worth getting the Deluxe version for the 2 hours of music, not to mention the huge 8 player scenario Dragon's Throne.The huge variety of units in the game, and the many different unit abilities and spells, provide for an awesome variety of strategy and tactics. The game is far more detailed than previous versions, and while the older games were great in their own right, AoW3 takes it to a whole new level. I can't go back to the old games anymore. It's a game you can get sucked into for many, many hours of your life.The two expansion packs - Golden Realms and Eternal Lords - are real expansions, not shallow cash grabbing DLCs like in many games these days. They add a lot of real content, not just new races and campaigns, but many new rules and game mechanics.I highly recommend this game, one of the best 4X games ever in my opinion.			"

												It's difficult to follow up a classic. It always feels like something is lost when a great game from years ago is brought into the modern age. Things get prettier, bigger, and more streamlined, but many times it feels like some essential chemistry is lost. Some of us blame nostalgia, others simply write the developers off as appealing to the largest audience or the lowest common denominator. Sequels always lose something.Which is why Triumph Studios had no right to produce such a perfect game.This is the perfect sparkling bouquet of what made the original great, combined with the streamlined production quality we've come to expect from a quality modern game. It's asymmetrical and unfair in the most balanced ways possible. Whether you're outfitting your heroes or designing your player class, you'll find great satisfaction in trying to break the game. You'll be very good at some things, and very bad at others, but it will always make sense and it will always feel right.The unit design deserves special mention. Each unit is deeply well-crafted and unique, even when comparing racial units of the same role. The attention to synergy is unmatched, both between units of the same race and in the way that race and class combine to make a whole. Leveling up often provides interesting new abilities that also tend to synergize, instead of simply providing better stats.This game has a lot of everything, and all of it affects everything else. You'll build cities, research and cast spells, and train units. You'll command armies on the beautiful strategic map, and when you explore dungeons or fight another army, you'll go down to fight on equally beautiful tilesets. Tactical combat is reasonably simple but very deep. This game has not been casualized. The A.I. is maddeningly clever, and you won't take this statement seriously until you've experienced it. You'll fight skirmishes in the woods with bandits, and you'll fight in truly massive sieges to conquer cities. Your heroes will explore dungeons, find and equip items, and lead your armies into battle.You will build your strategy, and then get excited about other strategies you think could work. They probably will. Your race, your class, and your specializations all fundamentally change the way you need to approach the game. It takes a long time to bloom into a full understanding of how the various parts of the game work together, but the journey is pleasant, and you can absorb it by playing.The campaign probably deserves it's own review. It's gloriously cheesy golden-age high fantasy. The campaign follows branching questlines, so you can end up doing different missions. The base game has two campaigns of eight missions. Eight does not sound like a lot but you can easily spend an entire day playing one mission. They're huge. Think of them more like chapters. The expansion packs can add another two campaigns. There are also a number of scenarios which are like competitive missions for X players. The ""real"" Age of Wonders though is in the procedurally generated random map mode, where you can fight other players or the AI. There are a huge number of random features on the maps, such as ""dwellings"" where you can purchase units from a non-player faction like Giants or Pixies. You'll need to play many games before you've seen everything you can find. Also of note, Age of Wonders has an underground map, full of caves, tunnels, and the cities of the Goblins and Dwarves.Triumph is confident enough in the mastery of their game to give the player enormous freedoms to explore how to play. Their own mastery is evident in the careful design of how every element acts together. If you find anything this game does interesting, play it for that reason, but be prepared to fall in love with the rest. This is what a strategy game should be. 10/10			"

												Amazing game! Been having many hours of fun with it. It's well made, intriguing, solid voice acting, deep strategy, and overall a complete and fantastic experience. A solid combination of heroes of might and magic, civilization, fallen enchantress and master of magic, with the best of all of them.Solid recommendation for ANY TBS fan or anyone interrested in giving TBS a try.Edit: The review is based of my closed beta participation.

												It has been almost one-year since release, I've been playing this game constantly for almost the full year.  Incredibly addictive coupled with vast replayability and a veritable smorgasbord of options, units, spells, structures, and game mechanics... and the developers have only expanded on the deep content with Golden Realms and the upcoming release of Eternal Lords.  I am not normally a review-writer or poster but this is hands down the best game of the genre I've ever played, including Master of Magic.Only a few fairly minor issues - mostly having to do with requested features  such as added victory conditions, more customization options, and more gameplay options have been addressed by the developers or are in the process of being addresed.  Kudos to Triumph.  They've certainly earned the name.  A long-time  player of other 4 x games I would enthusiastically recommend this for any fan of the genre.  I definitely encourage anyone on the fence to try it out!			"

												17 Years ago while I was in college and working at Babbages I bought and played Age of Wonders, I still remember a woman coming in asking me if I knew any games like Heroes of M&M 3, it was surprising to me because you did not get many females back in the late 90s(especially middle aged women) who were into strategy gaming, I remember telling her that if she liked Heroes 3 then she would really like Age of Wonders, so she bought it and left with a smile on her face.  A week later she returned and with the same smile on her face she thanked me for recommending Age of Wonders.  I am now around her age, and I still smile like her when playing an Age of Wonders game.  Triumph has staid true to its formula while adding wonderful new content and graphics to the series.  This is not something that you can say often in this age of gaming, especially with most big companies doing everything they can to create or cater to a casual gaming market where product quality comes second to just feeding gamers their new content fix every couple of months.  Thank you Triumph for staying true to your work of art, and thanks to all of the new and old gamers who have bought their products and supported them, I am sure most of us will agree that they deserve every penny and more....

												Great game, I bought all of the DLC for it and have not been disappointed. It basically is like Civ 5 but the combat is played out on a small map when to armies meet. Considering the combat is the whole reason why I dislike Civ 5 this was a big boon for me. The game has a wide vareity of races and leader types to play as and has a ton of replayability becasue of it unfortunatley though the larger game (6 to 8 players) can take forever (40 hours) and by the half way point everyone has the highest level units and are basically just spaming them at each other. The AI is very competent in the fact that they don't stupidly start a war with you just because and the roving enemies or bandit camps can actually become a problem if you are play on a higher difficulty (this is a good thing). Really its a great game for anyone who likes turn based games, it is not as deep as Civ is in certain areas such as culture and technology, but it makes up for it well with balanced and fun combat.

												ADDENDUM THE REALLY VERY LAST (and probably the most important): While I might not recommend the vanilla game (even with all its patched-in improvements), you can still purchase it and all its DLC (which I would, overall, recommend) as part of a bundle that saves you about $10. I personally don't think the Gold Edition upgrade is worth it, but you're still getting a hefty discount on the meaty bits like Golden Realms and Eternal Lords. The rest of this review pertains to vanilla AoWIII. If you like what you read, definitely consider the bundle. Compared to similarly priced titles like Civ V Complete and Endless Legend + DLC, I'd say it's worth it.Let me preface this by saying that AoWIII is a very polished game; it looks quite nice, has few glitches, and it seems like the Devs put a lot of thought and work into this game.However, I cannot recomend it. Why? It's simply not an enjoyable experience for me. Now, don't get me wrong: I've always been fond of TBS games. I loved Civs 3-5, and have played quite a bit of Fallen Enchantress, as well as some Galactic Civilizations. I'm acquainted with the genre, but am by no means an aficionado.So, why don't I enjoy this game? Well, a large part of stems from how narrow your in-game options are. There are plenty of choices between class and race, and those choices feel significant enough, really, but once you actually start playing the game, you realize that there's really only one way to win: expansion and conquest. I knew going in that this game would be more heavily conflict oriented, but to the point where that's the only means of victory? Not exactly what I had in mind, though I can certainly get by with that.But it's not just that you'll have to go to war to win. It's more holistic than that: everything in this game is about conquest. The only real purpose of your cities is to produce soldiers, in some form or fashion. You build buildings to unlock units to fight wars. You conduct research to unlock units to fight wars. You manufacture ""merchandise"" to fund your wars. You ""build housing"" to increase your domain to capture ""resource nodes"" (that only provide a slight buff to production rather than serving as actual resources) to more quickly produce units to...wait for it...fight wars. Now, fighting wars isn't necessarily a bad thing. The combat is very well designed and has a good deal of depth to it, especially when you take into account the racial and class distinctions. But, this generally superior combat seems to come at the cost of the depth of everything else.And that's just the problem: this game lacks depth. There is no real economy management, no real resources to capture (the only two ""currencies"" are gold and mana, the former of which is over abundant and the latter of which is often too scarce), and no real tech tree to navigate. You just plop your identical cities down to increase you GPT to support a bigger army. There's nothing else to it. You don't have to worry about acquiring special resources or developing advanced industry to train particularly powerful units, you just unlock them via research. And you can complete that research very quickly (late game starts at around turn 50 in a standard game, though the overall pacing can be sped up/slowed down during setup). By the time you've done that, you've rendered most every other standard unit in the game obsolete. You can really spam your way to victory against the AI (assuming they're not doing the same; otherwise you just get caught in a gridlock). And so, you lose that depth again.If you love TBS combat, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you're looking for something more well-rounded, consider picking it up on sale. If you're expecting something akin to Civ V, check out GalCiv III (maybe; it's really expensive and still early access).ADDENDUM 1: Since patch 1.093 (I think), pacing has been slightly improved through the addition of new production-related buildings and other changes. However, there have been no major changes made to the other mechanics, so, take it for what you will. Mana has been capped as well, which helps to prevent surpluses. T4 spam is still prevalent, though it occurs about 20 turns later for non-summoning classes.ADDENDUM 2: Since patch 1.12 (or something, I dunno), different races have received different buffs/nerfs, and different gamespeeds have been added. This does indeed help with pacing, and provides more strategic depth to the potentially longer early/mid-game. However, economy and diplomacy are still pitifully simplistic, meaning that my core issues with the game (the near single-minded focus on combat) remain. The late-game is still shallow, even when opponents are on fairly even footing.ADDENDUM 3: A new expansion has been announced, Golden Realms (I guess? Heck if I know.), that adds a new shorter campaign and race. It's Halflings, and it's only three episodes long, compared to Vanilla's 6? So, basically, it's half-sized, just for the Halflings. It's pretty clever. More importantly, (to me, anyway), it's supposed to bring a lot more to the table in regards to empire management, like special, competitive city projects, new, powerful effects for ""special tiles"" like treasure sites, and exclusive racial defensive improvements. A new victory condition has been added, as well. Unsure as to what they'll be doing with diplomacy. Iffy on the price, too. Something to think about, though.ADDENDUM 4: Golden Realms is out and it can be yours for a cool ten dollars. If you're American. Not quite sure about the pricing in other regions, as Steam doesn't do direct conversions. I've played a teensy, tiny amount of the new campaign but, to be honest, I really couldn't get back into it. Diplomacy has been upgraded (for free) as well, as part of patch 2.4 (I never get these right). It's an improvement, but you simply won't see specialized treaties or tech trading a la Fallen Enchantress or Endless Legend. No manipulating multi-national councils, either, even though they exist per in-game lore.ADDENDUM THE LAST: Late to the party, but that Necromancy expac, Eternal Lords, released and, if you're willing to drop whatever they're asking for on it (~$20 up front, less on sale), the game definitely becomes robust enough to where I can call it a worthy 4X title. The new Necromancer class does a good job of shaking things up (as most necro-oriented civs do), and the new races (Tigrans and Frostlings, both returning from previous AoW titles) are surprisingly distinct from each other and the rest of the cast as far as units and aesthetics are concerned. Diplomacy received a hefty overhaul, with the inclusion of a new racial diplomacy system and related victory conditions. Play nice with races and you can construct wonders cementing their allegiance, or somesuch. You also unlock various empire-wide policies in the process, which adds another layer to empire management. It's fairly simple, but the overall concept's a pretty novel approach to diplo.The game's pretty much where I want it to be now, though you have to invest in it to get there. I'd say it's better than Endless Legend + DLC now, but that's just my opinion. I'm leaving the review as ""not recommended"" if only because most of the core problems in the review can only be alleviated with DLC. Unless the modding scene fixed that. Did I mention, they added workshop support. Pretty nifty.			"

What Age of Wonders 3 consists of content wise.6 Fully Playable Factions Humans Dwarves High ElvesDraconiansOrcsGoblins 4 sub factions you encounter in the world and can also control while playing as a main faction to suppliment your forces.DragonsGiantsFeyArchon Revenants 249 unique units all with their own custom visuals and animations depending on race
These are split between 4 tiers with 4 tiers of ranks every unit can level up to obtain passive stat bonuses and unique abilities. There are 6 unique classes you can choose from in order to determine what specialty your hero leader unit posses which also affects access to unique units only for that class.DreadnoughtTheocratRogueArch DruidSorcererWarlordEach hero class offers different sets of spells you can use in combat and on the strategic maps.
104 Combat Spells91 Strategic SpellsLeaders and hero units have an extensive range of passive stat bonuses and abilities players can choose every time they gain a rank. 44 hero leadership passives that affect troops. 29 spells and hero specific passive abilities for the rogue class alone. There are plenty of abilities, passives, and spells for each of the 6 classes to make them widely customizable. Each leader has 8 slots for gear ranging from melee weapons, to cloaks, and even unique mounts they can ride. Weapons and mounts are fully displayed on your character while in-game during combat. There is an additional 10 slots per leader/hero available for ranged weapons and storage. Empire building including city upgrades and other dwellings you'll find located throughout the map24 city upgrades to expand and customize each settlement33 unique dwelling upgrades that allow for custom non faction units such as dragons and undead to suppliment your army. To further customize your facation you have access to a total combination of any 3 different specialization available to any class and any facationCreation AdeptCreation MasterDestruction AdeptDestruction MasterFire AdeptFire MasterEarth AdeptEarth MasterWater AdeptWater MasterAir AdeptAir MasterExpanderExplorer A fully functional leader creator
Emblem option2 tiered color choices13 different categories of visual customizations such as gender, head, hair, skin color, accessory, eyes, hair color, eyebrows, posture, clothing, skin decorations, facial hair, and scene (background environment). Also various static character portrate angels to choose from of your unique character model.Randomized generator option for visuals, class, and/or faction.53 pre-made leaders to choose from What else can I say about this game? You've just read through a ton of in-game content making it one of the greatest turn based combat games out there. So many different ways to customize and play you most likely won't even encounter or use everything available in the game. Even if empire building and diplomacy features are fewer than combat assets there is more than enough to satisfy 4X genre players. The games strenght  is getting out into the world, slaying monsters, finding treasure in dungeons, and crushing rival empires. If you like to send postcards and and have tea parties to talk out your problems with rival warlords, this game might not be for you. If you like to trick rivals into allegencies only to build up your forces while their guard is down then knock over their castle when convenient, this game is for you.Beyond being an absolutely great game with tons of content it's technical side as a PC game is solid. No poor low resolution console port, plenty of game options, and loads key bind customization to be found. Performance is a dream and the game is beautiful whether raiding dungeons relieving dragons of their loot or sacking major cities, and doing so right outside their gates seeing the city itself in all it's 3d model glory on the battlefield.One of the greatest PC games of all time. More factions and content to come via expansions. If you are a 4X fan and like fantasy genre games you cannot pass this one by.			"

												This game really captures the 'just one more turn!'-feeling. It is addicting and the game becomes better with each patch & DLC.Pros: A beautiful strategic map Combat is fast, brutal and entertaining  It is fun to level your Heroes and Leader; it adds RPG to the game. Also quests that can be gained from independent cities or dwellings add to RPG-feel. Concept of Race & Class for your Leader provide much variety in play. For example, you can play as a Orc Sorcerer, Dwarven Warlord, Elven Rogue etc.  Classes are really different from each other; this applies to gameplay, spells and units. See this wiki[age-of-wonders-3.wikia.com] for an overview (click the class name for more info). Nice campaigns with different outcomes A pretty good Random Map generator with tons of options Users make custom scenarios and challenges with Map Editor Great music Triumph Studios listens really well to the community and has fixed (almost) all bugs/issuesCons: In general races could be more varied. The good news is that Triumph is working on this and it is expected to improve in the next patch. See this official dev journal[ageofwonders.com] (nov 2014) --> *EDIT april 2015* - this has been addressed in the latest patch 1.5!! Although the idea behind alignment is nice (good/neutral/evil is based on your actions and not on your race choice), it remains a bit shallow imo.  --> *EDIT april 2015* - this has been addressed mainly in the DLC Eternal Lords! MOD-tools are not released at this moment (nov 2014). They most probably will in the future though.Other comments: For new-comers to the game it can be difficult to learn and to master. It is recommended to watch some videos on YouTube if you are new to the Age of Wonder-series. For example: How to play Age of Wonders 3-videos by iHunterKiller.

Disclaimers:- I was a closed beta tester for the base game as well as its two expansions. However I'm not an employee of Triumph Studios, only a community volunteer. - This review was written post Eternal Lords and 1.5 patch releases. Age of Wonders III is a turn based hex based fantasy 4x game that is a lot more combat focused compared to something like the Civilization series but also quite a bit more strategically and tactically involved than let's say Heroes of Might & Magic which can be both good or bad depending on your personal preferences. GameplayCompared to the previous games AoWIII retains most of the series' fundamentals but also iterates and adds to the formula. The most notable change is the way yor faction is presented via the class system. Your research tree and unit roster are not only determined by spell school and starting race picks but by your leader class (warlords, sorcerer, archdruid, dreadnaught, etc.), starting race as well as specializations which are akin to the previous game's spell spheres and leader skills. Your base unit list is thus determined by the race of the towns you own as well as your chosen class.Comparing it to AoWII the class system in a way separates the racial aspect of a faction from the  gameplay theme of it. For example, in AoW2 Elves were always Druids with nature themed units, Archons were always Theocrats with their religious and holy theme, Dwarves were Dreadnoughts due to their technological prowes, Orcs were Warlords with strong physical combatants and so on. The AoWIII class system separates race and theme so Elves can be steampunk-ish technologists, Dwarves can wield druidic powers while Goblins can be religious crusaders. Thematically this allows you to create both stereotypical combinations (wizard elves) as well as some unusual ones (holy angelic goblins). Gameplay wise the trio of race, class and specialization (additional mini tech trees) allows for a myriad of different play styles and strategies and a very diverse meta game which encourages experimentation and greately enhances replayability.  Each class comes with a unique tech tree which consists of special class units which can have their own racial variations as well as a large number of combat or strategic spells and passive upgrades that enhance your empire as well as units.CustomizationAoWIII features a leader creation process which allows for detailed aesthetic and gameplay customization. Visual options are akin to rpg games like Dragon Age allowing for changes to race, gender, clothing, accessories, hair style and color, skin color,  eyes, hats masks, postures, background scenery, portrait poses, coat of arms, etc.Gameplay-wise the options include race, class and 3 slots for specializations that can be magic oriented or more mundane empire upgrades.Game settings include numerous tweaks to the random map generator like map type (land, continents, islands), map size (s, m, l, xl), geographical settings (types of terrain and climate, existence of the underground layer), starting town/army, amount of resources, treasure sites, independent monsters, etc. Furthermore various game parameters can be tweaked like the number of heroes, hero level cap, hero race, game pace, starting resources, turn progression (classic i-go-you-go or simultanious), empire quests, map events, victory conditions, type and number of opponents, preference for manual or auto-combat and so on.Much effort was made to cater to different preferences and play styles.CombatLike in Heroes of Might & Magic for example, combat in AoWIII happens on a separate tactical map that is derived from the participating units' position on the strategic map. If the units were standing on a snowy arctic hex the tactical map will also have snow on it for example. Same with forests, swamps, etc. Not only that but various sites like cities, farms, dungeons, mines, tombs, etc. are all represented on the tactical map and can have different effects like providing obstacles, choke points, magical effects and so on.Compared to AoWII combat in AoWIII has less randomness and is more dependent on the player making the right moves. Attacks will always hit for example (except under special circumstances) but the damage can still vary and there is the possibility of criticals or fumbles.There are many things to keep an eye on in combat like move points (usually the less you have the less attacks you get but not always), limited retaliations, defensive stances, attacks of opportunity, flanking attacks, distances, unit position and facing, range, the presence of obstacles or city walls, types of movement (walking, floating, flying) and so on.And this is without taking into account unit stats (physical attack vs. defence, magical/elemental attack vs. resistance), traits, special abilities, morale (which influences critical chance), combat spells, unit and battlefield enchantments, unit types, etc.The basics of combat are simple. Click on a unit, right click to attack an enemy unit. But is the enemy unit far enough to trigger the charge ability, can I flank it, what's the chance of my special effect triggering, what elemental protections does it have, how many retaliations does it have remaining, does it have first strike, is it a polearm unit and will my cavalry take extra damage, can I weaken it prior to attack and how, can I kill it, will my unit survive the next turn after it attacks...there are many questions you could end up asking yourself.Learning about the units, what abilities they have and how they can be used and combined for maximum effectiveness is necessary for mastering the game but learning can be achieved in gradual steps.AoWIII retains the adjacency rule of previous games so all armies that are adjacent to the hex being attacked will also participate in combat which can result in some pretty large battles. Thankfully animation speed in battle can be adjusted during combat. Units and heroes that perform well and survive will accumulate experience points and become stronger acquiring new abilities as they level up and grow into valued veterans. StrategyOn the strategic level you build up your empire by settling or capturing new cities and expanding your borders in order to bring more and more resources under your control. There are resource sites to be captured, treasure sites to be explored, artifacts to be found, neutral creatures, cities and enemy leaders to be subdued. All in all the world is a dangerous place and venturing forth requires combat worthy armies and leaders. Luckily there is a beautiful cloth map to be zoomed out to in order to get an overview of the situation.Resource gathering and exploration primarily serve the goal of building up armies that can defeat the dangers that lie beyond your borders. A new addition here compared to AoWII are the creature dwellings which function as minor races that offer unique units for hire as well as their own sets of buildings. These dwellings can expand your unit roster and provide unexpected tactical  and strategic options.Both creature dwellings and independent cities can be outright conqured or negotiated with towards peaceful annexation by vooing them with money or performing quests. How you treat various towns and races can determine their attitude towards you as well as your alignment and diplomatic relations. Another addition is that clearing out and controlling certain treasure sites can unlock special unit or town upgrades in cities controlling those sites which can make some cities more valuable than others.All in all after 618 hrs of playing I have not yet experienced everything this game has to offer, so many untried combinations and strategies, which is probably the biggest endorsement I can give.

												I always knew I'd review this game, it was just a matter of when. At 331 hours, I believe I have enough exposure to offer an insightful look into AoW3. I picked this up on a whim during the Steam Summer Sale at 50%, having never played any other AoW games but myself enjoying Civ seemed like something I could get into. AoW3 would quickly become my most played game on Steam by a large margin and for good reason. There is so much good here, so much depth, variation, custimization. If you enjoy Strategy games, buy this game. If you enjoy Turn Based Combat, buy this game. If you enjoy City Building, buy this game. If you enjoy all these things AND Multiplayer for up to 8 people, FFA, Teams or AI partners or any combination BUY THIS GAME. 6 Races and 6 Classes that can be mixed and matched how ever you see fit, an ABUNDANCE of unquie units and Heroes that can be leveled and equiped with various gear that you can find or forge yourself. Sling spells in battle or on the World Map. Giants, Dragons, Titans oh my! Various map settings to take the game in whatever direction you want, size, land type, Underground, number of roaming Bandits etc. 2 Main Single Player Campagins and multiple Scenarios to play through. Up to 7 different full armies in Turn Based Combat. This game has it all and plenty of highlights I'm forgeting. BUT. And there always has to be a but. I do have some complaints to address here as well after all my praise. The community  is FAR too small, SO BUY THIS GAME. Also there are occasionaly minor issues connecting with players (which a simple restart of the game remidies) but the problem is there and it needs addressed. Other than that, this game is perfect at what it is. It's some sort of Civ meets Fire Emblem, coming from someone new to the series and never played Might and Magic. This is worth full price. Buy it. Add me. And read my guide to help you get started too :D			"

												Turn-based strategy, how boring.Then this game changed my (gaming) life. (To be honest, I also love Heroes 5)Look at the DLC tabs and you'll only see 3. Incredible, isn't it? Only 3, developers must be lazy. No, you're wrong. These DLCs, except ""Deluxe Edition"", are big. They're more like ""Expansion Packs"", if you're a good ol' RTS player you'd know what they are (Remember Warcraft 3's Frozen Throne? That is an expansion pack!""). I'm actually impressed about this, great job on it, developers!Many other reviewers mention the ""Random Map""  system and how great it is. Yeah, I admit, it's not really that very customizable by itself, but it's great nonetheless. I can imagine it being overly-complex if it was a lot more customizable anyway. And if you don't like random maps, well, there's always scenarios, community maps and so on.That's right, for a turn-based strategy, there's actually a workshop, and it's not a ""CSGO-style"" or ""Voteshop"" workshop, where, if you want an item to be in the game, it can be as long as it gets a lot of votes. Right now, the SDK offers a good enough freedom, but I heard that it will be better on the next updates.Also, aren't you tired of stupid, useless hotfix patches and so on? Make a hotfix, break another thing, a hotfix again, blahblahblah (NOTE: I'm not talking badly about developers who do it, there is always a bug after a patch and a hotfix may be necessary, but when there's a small patch for something so simple, useless or just decorative with no necessary bugfixes, yeah, I'm sure you know what I mean) and BOOM you may just lose interest. Luckily, AoW3 goes the Good Ol' style; only make patches when fully tested and necessary.By the way, this may not be of high interest since not everyone is an audiophile (personal note: I tend to hate music), but the Music? This is music made by Michiel van den Bos. Name might mean something, name might mean nothing. I'll just say that if you listened to Unreal music and Overlord music AND you loved it, you WILL LOVE the music in AoWIII. Do buy his soundtrack, he deserves it, the guy made this beautiful orchestral music with love for love...Or something.Also, he's very nice, you can see it on his YouTube comments ;)All of his songs are great, but if you want SOME recommendations, here;

												Very well put together game, and the devs are supporting it better than I have ever seen a dev support a game before. The game is a bit of a combination of homm and civ, I would reccomend it highly. If you are new I reccomend to play a few single player maps before playing the campaign which is hard at times.			"

												If there was ever a competition between Heroes of Might & Magic and Age of Wonders, you can sleep easily knowing that it is over.Age of Wonders wins.And with the third instalment of the series, the game is giving Civilization a run for it's money as well. Indeed, conquering a fantasy world has never been more fun, and AoW creates beautiful situations and, thanks to the hero/civilization customizer, unique factions. Like technologically advanced elves, or druidic dwarfs. But the battles? The battles are really damn memorable, and can pin up to 6 regiments against each other, and up to 3 armies can join a fight, making the largest battle 18vs18 units. You will doing everything possible to not loose your most well trained soldiers as well, thanks to the promotion system.Another small, but very nice feature is that the custom heroes/civilizations you create can be used by the AI when playing a skirmish. Meaning you can meet Sauron, Tyrion or any other characters you created. (the heroes have some appearance customization options as well, though not too many)The game will create memorable moments. Like the time when, while busy with my northern expansion, my kingdom of religious orcs was sheepishly invaded from the east by a distant (and so far peaceful) neighbour. After losing a city, i mustered my entire armada and, like Russia on 90% Georgian sale day, invaded and conquered their entire kingdom in a matter of a few turns. But this is were some might see a problem, and there are a few with this game:- AI is really not that good, not even on harder difficulties. it can stand it's own in battles, you might even loose a few if you're not careful, but the strategy map AI seems rather dumb;- ""Classes"" (aka civilizations) with a level-1 scout spell will have a massive advantage over other civs, since they will get a good scouting unit early and cheap;- Multiplayer does not have ""Simultaneous Turns"" options, which in PvP makes sense, since the battles need to take place, but it also makes Coop (players vs AI) almost impossible, unless you like waiting 6-7 minutes in the end-game for your buddy to take his turn;- zooming out to maximum displays a beautifully crafted map... that displays no borders unless the area is in your line of sigh (minor, personal, grudge). you'd think that, if X kingdom conquered Y city, word would reach my court, eventually.

												Vote for Age of Wonders 3 for the ""Only Five More Minutes!""-Award for the Steam Awards!The third part of a game franchise is often where things are starting to go downhill rapidly, especially if the franchise has been around for a long time (1999) and managed to establish something like a ""cult following"". The franchise left some big shoes to fill when they released Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic 11 years ago, and Age of Wonders 3 fills them admirably. At its core the Age of Wonders series are turn-based strategy games with turn-based strategic battles set in a fantasy world full of fantastic creatures and magic. You pick between different races, create your leader, build an empire and set out to claim the land as your own. You can forge alliances with other leaders (both AI or other players, if you play multiplayer matches) or try to conquer the world on your own. Your leader and hireable heroes are different to your main army in that they can level up and gain a plethora of new abilities and equippable items. Magic is an always-present factor in Age of Wonders. You constantly research new sorceries and in battle you will most often find yourself flinging powerful spells with your heroes while the rest of your army engages in more traditional combat, which also has its own nuances with line-of-sight penalties and flanking mechanics, on top of other things. Age of Wonders 3 stays true to the spirit of the previous titles while bringing new features to the table. The most game-changing feature is the introduction of classes. When you start a game you pick a leader, race, class and specialization. Each class gets many dedicated units that are restricted to this class only, for example Arch-druids can get hunters while Mages can summon wisps. The same is true for spells, a Warlord could get a spell that sends an enemy unit into a fit of rage, making it unable to tell friend from foe, while a Rogue might send a plague of brigands upon an enemy city.Here are some of the features you can expect:+ 6 playable races, all with their benefits and drawbacks (Draconian, Dwarves, High-Elves, Goblins, Humans, Orcs)+ Many different spells and units to research, depending on your chosen race, class and specialization+ Units can level up and gain increased stats, while heroes gain new abilities+ Neutral cities and dwellings that offer quests and access to unique units and items for your heroes+ 2 full campaigns serving as a tutorial+ Random map generator with a plethora of changeable settings to tailor maps to your liking+ 8 pre-built scenarios of varying sizes with their unique twists, for multiplayer as well as singleplayer+ Multiplayer with up to 8 players+ Ships with the same level editor the developers useIf you are into turn-based strategy games you owe it to yourself to at least take a closer look at Age of Wonders 3!

												What makes Age of Wonders 3 unique compared to other fantasy 4X, and real core of the game are it's turn based tactical battles, there's some serious crunch to them. There are a lot of supporting mechanics, such as spellcasting, flanking, and varying unit types and abilities, but what it all adds up to are tactical battles where you always have interesting choices to make. The battles are fun to watch unfold even after playing for hundreds of hours.The game comes with two fairly long single player campaigns, a random map generator, and an editor that allows you to make your own maps, scenerios, and campaigns.Multiplayer works well, but unfortunately the tactical battles can cause things to grind to a halt. I don't recommend trying to play more than a one on one multiplayer game unless you and your opponent have entire days worth of free time. It's unfortunate considering Endless Legend, another fantasy 4x, integrates tactical battles into the strategic layer nicely and supports multiple tactical battles at once, something Age of Wonders 3 can't manage.AoW3 also has PBEM mode, which I play a lot of. Unfortunately you can't control the player vs player battles in this mode, it's autoresolve only.Overall this is a great game. I also recommend the two expansion DLC that have been released.(edited July 11th 2016: fixed some spelling mistakes)			"

												Nothing is ever my cup of tea.  This game is my cup of tea.  It's kind of like playing five or six games of Civ V at the same time, on two maps.   If fantasy themed stuff don't turn you off, and if you like 4x strategy of the Civilization variety, it's well worth giving this a try.  I'm the type who searches and searches for the perfect game, so I've tried Endless Legend, and Galactic Civilizations, and Empire Earth, and Age of Empires, and Beyond Earth, and on, and on.  Age of Wonders 3 is the shizznit.I will say this - if you only play this game for an hour or something and think you've seen it all and it's just silliness - well, it is just silliness for the first hour or so.  Play through a whole game, and I think you'll find there's a lot of ♥♥♥♥ happening.  Play through a few games, and I think you'll find there's enormous strategic depth and complexity.And that's not even mentioning the tactical combat system, which is impeccable.I'm thinking of getting an Age of Wonders 3 tattoo.

												Bought Eador - Wasted time and money.Bought Fallen Enchantress - Wasted time and money.Bought the newest Heroes - Wasted time, money, and got information mined by EA.Bought Warlock - Had fun, but Warlock II is a waste of time and money.Saw AoW3 on summer sale and warned myself to not waste time and money; but I really like it compared to all the other incarnations. I like turn based, conflict oriented, strategy. It's not going to be as strategic as Total War, or as simple as Age of Empires- both genres I love. It is a Civ game, based on action and strategy and it's the best flavor I can find on Steam. The AI isn't perfect and it looks like they want me to pay for xpacs. You have to make an account with them to go online, but the game is still playable in solo mode without giving out your information.I guess I like this one because it looks good, runs smooth, the races are to my taste (traditional with a Warhammer kind of twist), has very few bugs, and a subtle and funny sense of humor. It's basically a blend of the best elements of all the Civs I've wasted time and money on.			"

												Imagine Civ 5, but with combat that actually felt fun to do, choices that were actually meaningful and the ability to create and flesh out your own leader of one of numerous races. The gameplay is less than stagnant, it has mob support and it's campaign is awesome.			"

												Age of Wonders III is an excellent 4x Strategy Game. I first found this game when looking for a game similar to the late 90's game called ""Lords of Magic"". Lords of magic was quite similar to this game, but so much was done wrong in that game. The AI was just too simple, once you knew a couple tricks - you could beat it without thought. Not so for Age of Wonders, the AI is a good challenge, to me at least. There are a number of classes to pick from as well of a number of skill paths to tailor for your character that will change the play style for any class. The lore and immersion is fantastic, the help/information system is very in-depth and explains any game concept I've had a question about. One thing I really like about this game is the ability to create my own leaders for either the AI or myself and then customize who I'm up against or just let it pick randomly. The game seems pretty well balanced overall, although the Necromancer AI leaders can tend to get fairly powerful and be an incessant threat if they get far enough. Although, there are classes and skill paths that can take care of this easily - not every class/skill combination will do well against them. But this game offers a lot of custom settings when creating a new map, so you can just choose not play against AI classes that might be too tough for your level of play or make them all one class, if you so choose. This game runs good in a seamless window as well as full screen - so those with mutiple displays will not be disappointed. The mouse automatically constrains to the play area for easy scrolling around the map/battle field - and also handles switching to windows very easily. I don't think this game has ever crashed on me at all, it's stable and runs well. I have to also give praise to the music in this game. It's excellent. I love the soundtrack in this game. I play this frequently, and will buy more expansions in this series without hesitation. 10 out of 10!			"

												I never played any older part in this series, just so you know. Also I review the game with all DLCs so far (Necromancer was the last), but only the single layer part.This game is really fantastic :) I have now almost 200 hours in gemeplay and still have not finished the last campaign (and not even started smaller maps or MP). Pro+ Tactical fight is great. With the same stack of unit(s) you can either loose all or win with no loss. It's all about preparation and tactics.+ I like the storytelling and the voices are quite nice (especially the halfling hero)+ The maps are very different and made with much love+ Really overwhelming (in a good way) amount of units, monsters and heroes+ The ingame help is fantastic. Press F1 and simply search. With a few exceptions everthing is explained very good.+ The graphics lack detail and are kind of old, but very athmospheric+ I get bored easily, but this game suprises me even after 200 hours of gameplay with new units, new skills. new game concepts, races, monsters....+ 18 months after release there are still new DLCs with quite heavy modifications and also free updates with new game conceptsCon (mostly only minor)- The UI just sows you two ros of skills for your hero. I discovered only in the last cmapaign that not more skills than 12 are shown. You cann access them with clicking on your heros portrait but I sure missed some before. This could be easily solved with pressing of alt and shift to swap between more skills. Developers?- not all things are explained in the ingame help. What is ""weakness 5""?- Diplomacy is very basic and can be exploited by evil heroes (breaking peace = bonus points)- The necromancer seem to be not as balanced as the other classes. One of it's main features is reanimation of your troops, your hero or other troops. This can simply be stopeed by placing living units on top of an (un)dead stackIf you lke turn based exploring and combat and love good tactics, I really recommend this game to you.			"

												If you like the Civilization games, you will like this game. Especially if you also enjoy fantasy and adventure. It is kind of like a mix between Civ, Black and White and WoW (love it!!!); as you have to choose a race and class and you pick up pieces of magical equipment on the way that improve your skills in battle-scenarios. Also you can choose to be either neutral, evil or good, depending on how you play the game: do you make people like you by buying them off, win land by completing quests or greedily claim it all by being a mean warlord-bully? It is really fun to try the different classes and explore the  different maps hunting for treasure and fighting monsters. Great game. Many entertaining hours to be played. Civilization gets very boring after a while, so if you're looking for something like Civ, but more creative and fun, this is your game.			"

												I looked forward to this game for months, pre-ordered it and took the afternoon off to play it the day of release. I consider myself well within the target market for AOW III, as I mostly play games along the RPG-Strategy spectrum.As much as I hate to say it, I agree entirely with the top-rated negative review (by dacasonic). AOW III isn't bad, it just lacks depth. There are way too few units (really just one type of : light infantry, heavy, infantry, archer, cleric, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, trebuchet for everyone + 4 class units?), the research is one-dimensional (unlock a handful of units, terraforming and some spells), tactical spells are somewhat varied, but can't be used nearly enough and don't feel impactful due to a (in my opinion) mediocre resource system....In essence, my biggest qualm with the game is how little there is to look forward to. In HOMM, I look forward to unlocking level 5 spells, top-tier creatures or upgrading my hero, because those things immediately feel impactful and rewarding. In Shogun II, I can't wait to get those hero samurais on the field or finish a massive citadel in a border city. In civilization, reaching milestones (wonders, key techs, even your first settler) feels bloody great and is immediately rewarding gameplay-wise. Even in Fallen Enchantress, a second-tier X4 game, upgrading towns, levelling heroes and reaching certain research milestones feel rather gratifying and makes the player want to go on ""one more turn"".There is no equivalent in AOW III. Cities don't feel worth caring about (and it's a drag to keep them from getting overtaken by sneaky flying invaders). There are no great projects to feel excited about. Units are obtained early and the game turns into a variety-less grind within an hour of its start. Maybe the game could have been salvaged by a better hero progression and XP distribution system, to give the player something worth caring about. Levelling up heroes (XP earned when attacking other units) will grant a few points to invest in simple stats or underwhelming perks (20% resistance to an element). A talent tree with meaningful incremental investments (see shogun II, or even fallen enchantress...) coudl have helped the game a lot.I played AOW III on a mid-level laptop bought a year ago (well within reccomended specs), and the game ran rather poorly after a while. Naturally, this could be a problem on my end.			"

												It feels a lot like Heroes of Might & Magic had a baby with Master of Magic.I HIGHLY suggest reading some of the reviews here.  The negatives aren't all bashers, the positives aren't all fanboi's.  You'll get a good picture of what this game offers and where it is lacking.  This is my take.Pro's: The hex-7 combat. You can flank prior to engaging, but you may leave an army vulnerable to attack (it affects placement in the battlefield.. except against a city)The hero ""Leader"" capabilities.  Each army (group of 6 units including hero) can have a hero as a leader.  Heros can pick from abilites to strenghten themselves or provide army-wide bonuses.The Dreadnaught Class (while overall not high on my personal list) is really neat.  They are mech-based, rather than magic.  If you use their higher special units, you need other special units to heal them.  This matters most if your empire included multiple races.  Healers can't heal machines, and workers can't heal normal units.  I like that concept. :reusgreed:Spell options are ""random"" which helps split up the monogamy of game play (with a few exceptions).Underground & above ground, + teleporters, water tunnels, and 6v6 ""dungeons"" with unique item (Strong, Epic, Legendary, and Mythical difficulties. :ghlol: )The graphics. Con's:The basic race & class units are carbon copies of each other.  Slight differenced being pure damge vs a resistance-based damage type)The buildings are all exactly the same (except the T2 & T3 class buildings.. but the resource from them isn't a game changer).The spell system is lacking, in comparison to Master of Magic.  There are obvious ""winners"" for large maps/games, which are to be avoided in smaller/shorter games.As above, there are several abilities/spells which only have true functionally in MP... thus wastes a spell slot.Again, as above, the spells are generated ""randomly"" based on your leader choices.  While not entirely bad (MoM was like that also), the MultiPlayer-biased or large map-biased abilities aren't balanced out of the choices.  Likewise, they don't recive more weight in those circumstances.So that's really just one big one, split into 3 parts and the last being a pro & con.--------I've not gotten the xpac.. but that's supposed to add a few more nice things to the game.  Worth the expansion price? Not sure yet.  Next sale though.. ;)There are a few things they could do differently, from a deisgn standpoint, but given the origins and overal gameplay..  It's definitely a good $20-30.00 game.  Not sure about $40-45 (not counting the expansion)Apparently there is a bug that can crash and lose all of your data.  I haven't run into that one yet.  It does have occasional ""lag"" on the large + maps.I defenitely enjoy it, so far, I'm just a bit picky about things. --------What they could do to ""fix"" some of the holes in the game:Make a couple of ""difficult"" races, that are OP'd, but  cost more.Make a couple of ""easy"" races, that are weak, but fast to max out.Mix up the complexity of the city structures.  Maybe Orcs only get a shrine, not a grand temple, etc... then balance it out other ways. (can tie into above)Get rid of the ""Knowledge Points"" resource.  It becomes 100% worthless at some point in the game. :angrytitan: Merge ""Mana Income"" and ""Knowledge Points"" and let the player balance the resource between the two. (mana income if dor spell upkeep, unit purchase, initial spell cast, etc..  Knowledge Points only go to how fast you research spells)Unbalance the spell system some more.  Let a Mastery level always yield a really bad@$$ unit and global power.Weigh out some of the spells that favor different game maps and MP vs SP.   There shouldn't be a clear ""winner"" for them, on that front. (These are in the Class-specific spells, regardless of your focuses, and the one focus realm of expansionisim.)  If a balance can't be reached easily.. simply making a counterpart (with a note on each as to what they favor) that is equally beneficial in the opposite playstyle is fine.			"

												I discovered this game about one year ago and never stopped playing it. I'm a big fan of strategy games and AOW 3 has really met and exceeded most of my expectations. I recommend to purchase the two expansions Golden Realms and Eternal Lords because they add a lot to the base game. Gameplay is a mix of Civilization and Might and Magic: you build and conquer cities and occupy resources to be able to field powerful armies and defeat your enemies. But what really shines through is the great variety of units, spells, maps, geographies and playstyles that make AOW3's replayability almost endless. There are 9 races, 7 classes and about 15 magic specializations that can be mixed and matched in endless combinations. The races play similar but have different strengths against each other. The classes play different, i.e. Archdruids summon animals, Horned Gods and build Hunters and Shamans and their armies are very fast, Dreadnoughts build machines of increasing power and are way slower. Then, an elven archdruid focuses on range and shock damage while a goblin archdruid focuses on blight damage and fast growth of their cities.Necromancers gain most of their armies from dead enemies, sorcerers and archdruids from summoning spells, warlords and theocrats from recruiting in cities, etc.Early game plays different from late game, and the random map generator allows the customization of every map feature.The graphics, art and storyline of the campaign are superb. The atmosphere of the game is unique, mysterious and magical. Game is easy to grasp but hard to master because of the miriads of combinations and customizations possible.Highly recommended5/5			"

												EDIT:I have well over 1000 hours into this game (drat!) and every time I think of putting it down, I keep coming back.  It's been a long time since a game grabbed me like this one.  Great game!  replayabiliy is insane.WOW!Short review:  If you have any doubts from the trailers and are thinking ""Yeah, I want to get this game.""  You are probably right and do so immediately.For a bit more detail:I'm not even more than 170 turns on a big map,I can already tell you that this is an awesome game.  At first I thought it was just going to be another 4x clone, which are also great, don't get me wrong, but it's a lot cooler than a lot of games I have played.  The thing that sets it apart to me is that IT'S DEEP.  And while production and exloration and exploitaing are still the core of the game, there are a LOT of other elements that you REALLY have to consider if you are going to win.  It's much less of a numbers game and a lot more of a strategy game like CHESS.  It is mainly an empire conquest game as well.  There IS diplomacy, but you best be prepared to back that up with force.  It's not really a builder game, but you can totally turtle up if you want to.  If you want to survive in the world you have to maintain your empire.  And thats' before you even meet other players on the max size map.First off, you have to create your game.  As per most 4x games, there are a ton of options.There are at least 4 starting modes ranging from nothing but a city builder and a couple of military units, to having a fairly established state with big armies so you can go right to combat if you want!Next, you get to create your LEADER.  Your leader has a class, and a race. You can completely customize this leader just like an MMO or RPG. There are several classes and several races so that is a lot of options and there are both racial AND class bonuses.  All the classes are ""rock paper scissors"".  They all have different strengths and weakneeses and they are designed to be equal, if different.  I haven't confirmed how balanced they are yet.  But if you want voral bunny rabbits defending your city, Hobbit Druid has it!  In addition to that, you can style your charcter as you want, create your own flag and colors.  You get to choose 3 major abilities for your leader, such as the power to summon fire elementals out a pool of many!  You feel an imediate connection with the character.When you get in the game, it's EASY to pick up if you have any experience with a 4x game and even novices can probably figure it out if they click enough things and there are tool tips on everything.  It was very easy for me to pick up.  The maps are great looking, but the cool part is that there are Volcanic, plagues, frost, and I think a couple of more types of territory and the TERRITORIES are ALSO rock paper scissors for the RACES of your leader and heros, and this factors into the game.  If you send anti volcanic troops into volcanic territory they are going to be far less efficient because moral will be low.  Things matter in this game.  Another actually cool thing is that there AREN'T these giant research build trees to go through.  You can upgrade a city to max pretty quick in easy mode, which I am playing now in order to get a better handle on the game, but I'm sure the STRATEGY racks up quick.  There are like 3 levels for most abilites.  If you want to park your city and just produce mana you can do that.  Some units can fight on water.  Heroes can and do level up, and units can gain veterancy.Build cues are kept to a maximum of 5 cue items, either research or unit production.  Yes, it means you will visit your cue more often, but it works in this game because there are less actual cities on the map with an even spread.  There aren't a lot of city upgrades, so you can blow through them pretty quick.  BUT each of them matter a LOT.  You have to research archers if you want archers.  If you want to build a weapn forge (which crafts actual items for your heros) you have to research it first as expected.  There were about maybe 15 unit types under the hobbit units. (give or take).  Armies are also streamlined because you can only have a maxium of 6 units per army (at least in the game I am playing, not sure if you can change that, but I don't think so.  This is GOOD because you are far less concerned with how BIG your armies are, but WHERE they are and what units are in them!  Another thing is that each hero or your leader in the game has their own character sheet and as they gain levels you can spend points on any NUMBER of spells and abilities and you actually USE these abilities in combat!  There is ALSO a ""diablo like"" item page complete with a bag, and character outfitting, and you can send items from one hero to another.   The time it takes to do that is based on the distance of the heroes from each other.  So all the gear AND the spells make this hero or charcter very unique and deployable for specifc roles in an army.IN addition to that you have a SPELL BOOK which keeps each of the spell abilties of all of your heroes in combat and also GLOBAL spells that you can use to rain fire down units, or convert plague land to fertile forests for example.  You have to SHARE mana between the strategic spells and the close combat spells so it has to be managed wisely!  You learn spells by using research points (candles!) and there are many of them!  You can only cast a certain number of strategic spells per turn, depending on what they are.  Also, the spells are somewhat dictated by RACE and CLASS!  So the spellbook is different for each game.  But some classes are bad at magic and a lot less effectve with less options.  The Warlord class for example.  But they make up for that with better armor and weapons and archers.In addition to your basic units that you produce, when you are successful Heros offer to join, and you can have them join you for a one time fee (I think all units have maintence fees, as expected).  Once a hero joins you, they get a character sheet EXACTLY like your Leader's charcater sheet.  Every hero you get is randomized based off race, class, and abilities so they are all UNIQUE.  Sometimes you can win a unit in battle, or a random unit to town will join you.  The map is filled wtih independants and non-player kingdoms.  They can be hostile or neutral.  If you try and conquer them, some will run but some will fight.  Best be prepared if you want  to win, but stay close enough to your cites or a dragon might blow through and mess up your day!  Sometimes there is an opportunity for them to run, and you can choose between killing them or letting them run.  If you let them run you get good alignment and if you kill them you get evil.  Yes, there are good and evil abilities available when you spec your leader and for your heros.So basically, between the several terrain types, the rock paper scissors aspect of the heros and leader as well as chaning the compositon of each 6 unit army, you get BAZILLIONS of combinations, and all of the race units are themed for that race like the Hobbit Eagle Rider.  This means just a crazy amount of replayability.Finally, the COMBAT is VERY cool!  When you zoom in to the battle (IF you choose to manually fight it out) it's an area themed for the place it is.  I went in to one battle zone in a shrine and the objects decorating the shrine created obstacles that had to be worked around in the fight!  Terrain IN the fights is absolutely factors into game play.  Flanking and charging are ALSO part of the game.  If you have a hero on a mount you can charge into an enemy.  Each spellcaster can cast 1 spell per turn, so the combat really revolves around all those abilties you chose for your character.Anyway, it's all amazing.  If you like strategy games OR RPGS OR 4x genre games, you will very likely like this one.I see many hours of gaming awesomeness ahead.			"

												9 / 10 This is combat oriented 4x game. or more like little combat dedicated 4x game smiliar to HOMM or civilizations.Graphics are ok, music and sound effects are kinda cool game play really feels great. The game lacks some empire menagements  when it comes to empire building like other 4x games like Cilvilzations. Few choices you can make , few buildings you can build , and economic stuff game is too simplifed and shallow. And i have to say it is disappointing. But when it comes to combat , the game has the best combat mechanics. Unlike civilzation 4 combat system (And some bit from civilization 5) which luck plays major role in the game and you have little control about the combat itself, this game has some edge. You re no longer waiting for outcome after just throwing dice. Instead you actively engage in combat , and you can make a lot of tactial choices in combat. It feels like heroes of might and magic combat style but it has some more advaced combat mechanics and introduced some nice concepts to battle filed. You can flank your enemy , use special talents , you can bait them out... etc  And yea this makes the game difficult to learn somewhat and could be little confusing but this is much better than You just attack the target and waiting for the outcome and saying like ""Oh crappp my modern infantry just got owned by pikemen , the odds were 99% purely because the luck turned out ♥♥♥♥♥""  I really still hated some luck based combat mechanics like ""Chance for your spell failure 40%"" and pesky halflings who evades 10% of attacks. but i think they removed a lot of luck based thing in the game. Theres still some things are totally governed by the luck but its less often and less frustrating then other simmliar games. The game units feels like AOE 3 , the races are unique and features simmliar units but the each races got some little bit of tweaks ""Goblin pikemen has the life drain and much stronger then others , while the elven one has the lightning attack , Draconian pike legions can fly"" and theres quite noticable amonunt of themThe hero / leader customizaions are quite remakable as well . you can experiment with a lot of magic / economic / combat oriented specialization and it is really fun playing with different races / classes  / specailization This game requires several hours of game play to learn basic stuff but it will be rewarding as you get better and gameYou can expect a lot of from game if you re fan of TBS like civilzations .P.S if you re planning to get just 1 expasion pack i recommend Eternal lord one it has the more volume then the other one.

												To say I like this game would be an understatement. With over five hundred hours on record, and a healthy amount of those hours spent playing multiplayer with members of the Something Awful community, and most if not all the hidden things explored, I still find joy in loading this game up and taking a necromancer out for a spin as I turn the entire world into an open grave. I still find myself impressed by the swathe of modding content, adding more hours to the lifespan of this game.On that note, it is worth emphasising, Please get the collection and not just the base game. Eternal Lords is worth the difference alone, while golden realms is also a really strong expansion. The Delux DLC is a nice bonus but the real prize is Eternal Lords. Necromancers are a very fun class but Tigrans and Frostlings are also great races to play as well. Now, lets discuss comparisons. This is not Civ, nor is it Endless Legend. In both of those games, you have a few other ways to win, you can play as an economic powerhouse who wins by driving everyone into a happy friendship circle. This is not how Age of Wonders 3 plays. War is here. War is how you win. * Drive your enemies leaders to their knees and take their thrones. * Find the seals of power, drive away the guardians and stand upon them, facing rival kingdoms and angry elementals until you master control of the place of power and turn it upon your foes in victory. * Unite races together and ignite beacons of unity, driving your enemies mad with envy as you prove your mastery of diplomacy by the sword as well as the tongue. You do not win Age of Wonders by becoming king of treasure hill or cutting into other cultures like a knife, You win age of wonders by the sword and the spell. You will lead mighty armies of golems, backed by the might of goblin riflemen. Armies of high elf berserkers, howling furious challenge. Armies of frostling spellcasters, standing alongside summoned beasts. Armies of undead humans, still wielding spiritual fire even while bound to your dreadful will. Heroes will be at your command to be equipped by the prizes you rip from ancient tomb and bandit-infested farmstead. From swords to rings to mounts, all waiting to be claimed and lost when your rivals finally kill your promising champion and scatter their prizes to the wind.You win in Age of Wonders in battle, and battle is what this game does very well. On this note I advise checking youtube for a few videos of the combat. Words don’t really capture it, nor do comparisons. Best to see for yourself.I think by this point I’ve said enough. There are other reviews that go into more technical details then I have, I am simply writing from a very bias place of love. There are battles to be won, cities to be courted, inn’s to be explored, caves to be feared, lairs to be cleared, heroes to be leveled, heroes to regret losing, items to be won, armies to be lost, beacons to be lit, seals to be defended and grand spells to be cast. Get to it.			"

												It's a true spiritual successor to Master of Magic and that's what I love about itI would estimate that I played somewhere in the vicinity of 1000 hours on the original Master of Magic (in fact, still have it and play it occasionally on Dosbox). It had been a pinnacle of fantasy TBS games, unsurpassed by any, in my opinion. until this game came along. To any MoM player, Age of Wonders III will feel right at home. From mage customization to the exploration of ruins and caves, the settling of new cities and the building of great armies, the researching of grand spells to strike your opponents and bless your lands... and of course the heroes - numerous and varied. The races are fairly unique, with no two feeling alike. Playing anything from Elves to Pantherfolk, the difference between units and cities are big enough to merit playing at least once with each race. Add to that the different classes and magic skills you can customize your leader with and you get near infinite replayability The music is great - I found myself walking around humming some of the battle tunes plenty of times... the visuals are fairly good for a TBS and I doubt anyone would complain much about them... The multiplayer returns the classic old Hotseat option, which definitely feels good for an old-timer like me...So far I've played well over 200 hours and I am still playing... it's just great.			"

												Edit 04/23/15: So I've done some multiplayer testing. The game is still super snowbally and overall, the mechanics still kill fun. I do, in fact, think the single player is alright now though.Again, keep in mind that I'm going to focus on the multiplayer aspect only. I didn't play civ to play by myself, and neither did I buy this with that intent.Old content/Base game (This is now current 04/19/15):First, the positives:
Tactical combat: This is what the game sells itself with. The concept, how it's designed is actually quite fun on its own. If you like Endless Legend's combat, you would like this.Race/Class combos: One of my favorite things for the longest time was the different race and class combos would actually cause you to play differently based on what race you put with what class. The developers have indeed succeeded in improving parity some in 1.5.Map generator: More often than not, I enjoyed the randomness, aside from predicible positioning of capitals. Powerful treasures, like production materials/scrolls are now guarded.Diverse Units: Units are diverse, and even units from the same class may have differences between races.Now for the bad.
Balance: Dear god, balance. Heroes have always meant to be powerful, and that is fine. But the majority of experiences players you meet will use heroes as spell casters. This doesn't sound so bad, right? Well, spells, in tactical combat have infinite range. If your hero is on the battlefield, it can hit anything. Your leader can do it even if he/she isn't there for double cost. The majority of matchups will be determined by spells. If not that, you will see tactics such as run and heal. In short, play to the utmost efficiency.Scouts/city mechanics: Scout wars are still annoying, and the flying ones are especially capable of taking cities, particularly the incorporeal ones. All units in any amount or strength are capable of burning any city in 2 turns, and any fort or watchtower instantly. I cannot emphasize this enough, the most central mechanic to continuing the game is the LEAST secure. This will turn your disadvantages into a landslide.The community: The community has become somewhat insular now, as 90% or more of the lobbies are locked. Join a steam group or the forums to try and get in, don't try to meet people in lobbies.Autocombat: To be frank, to manually do every battle yourself is not feasible in this game in multiplayer. Unlike Endless legend, which is very fluid about its manual combat for the most part, manual combat in this game stops all other action for every player that is not in combat. You either get to watch or not depending on what the host decided before the game starts. So you have to use autocombat... except that the AI in autocombat tries to resolve things as quickly as possible by having both sides rush at each other, tactics be damned. Therefore the losses are always higher than they should be, and unless you've played for as long as I have, you shouldn't expect to accurately predict the results, which to my knowledge is not a common skill.Fog of war: Once you initially explore the map, it shows everything happening except units. You see all changes and spell casting locations without vision if you're attentive. While this is a skill, it's not much of a fog.Patch 1.5:
The new vassal system is actually pretty cool. You can now relinquish control of a city to the independents (vassalship is also the step before actually owning the city, too, so you can get it back). When you do this, the independents will pay you a portion of the total income and occasionally give you tributes ranging from resources to a small army (whose strength is based on the current size of the city). The vassal will also keep their city defended, which makes vassalship the answer to the player who lacks the ability to defend from silly things like wisp spam or something. It's not all good though. Much like burning a city, you can make a vassal out of any city in 2 turns no matter the size of the city, and after those two turns, the city will instantly spawn an army relative to the size of the city. Too much, too fast.Guard breaking: Now a thing.The new race governing and race happiness system adds a bit of flavor to the game that causes the way you play to have an impact on the people in your empire, and thus affect you. Now, if you migrate for optimization, it doesn't just impact your (ignorable) alignment, you've made one race pretty happy, and really upset another one. Good luck making use of them when their units are starting out unhappy. I have nothing but good things to say about this system, although I haven't had the time to explore every option with every race.Cosmic events: Adds random events to the game, which are mostly status modifiers. Some are positive, some are negative. Some only affect certain people. Some affect everyone. Fun in theory, but I find that I'm often annoyed by the results since it can cause damages to your empire through no fault of your own. The appearance of the boss drastically affects one person. The encounter is around legendary difficulty, and it roams the map. The items if you win are powerful, but I wouldn't lose a city temporarily or lose 4-5 units to secure it (in auto-combat). Overall, I think I would play with cosmic events off with other people to keep the frustration levels down for us all.Expansion content (yeah, I bought it to review):
Necromancer is actually a rather nice addition to the game. It turns the class system a bit upside down because it has completely new mechanics added to the game (happiness and morale isn't a thing when you're dead, rushing causes your undead puppets to be destroyed instead, presumably because it's hard to rush and keep things safe, you also get population from killing things, which is kind of awesome). In practice, it plays a bit like a combination of theocrat (healing), sorcerer (supports are very important for more than just healing, and you get a decent spell selection), and warlord (with emphasis on debuffing rather than buffing, but you DO get some pretty nice battle enchantments like a warlord would).Frostlings: They play a bit like a combination of draconians and humans (I'm approximating), my two favorite races, so naturally I like them. They lose physical power in exchange for doing frost damage. Their pikemen are amazing (and tier 2). Love the race overall, but frozen flames (their support buff) will be op until it doesn't have fire resist (normally the race weakness), especially when used on frostling necromancer reanimators. (It also gives +2 fire/+2 ice damage to melee/range and inflict chilling, which is -20% ice resist/-1 defense.) Huge upsides in exchange for no healing.Tigrans: Poor Tigrans. Has the exact same weaknesses as orc (with even less healing!) with almost none of the upsides. -1 resist, no healing except support once per fight self-heal, who then lose their range for the rest of the battle, low range damage on archers in exhange for bleeding (in fairness, units do more melee damage to bleeding units... but no healing). You need considerable skill to make use of their unique talents.Halflings: Fun little race. They scale a lot on unit happiness. They have -20% phys resist in exchange for Lucky. A mechanic that makes every offensive ability have a chance to miss them. Seems not worth it at first, but it includes spells and such, and actually net decreases incoming damage. They lack elemental damage though.Specializations: Their themes are essentially chaotic magic, neutral good, neutral evil, and balance/anti-unnatural. They offer really nice tools that can offset racial and class weaknesses.Literally out of space, so I hope I wrote enough to help you guys make your own impressions, guys.			"

												I’ve been playing the Age of Wonder series for years, but I think that Triumph Studios deserve a veritable Roman Bacchanalia for creating Age of Wonders III. It’s proof of what an independent game developer came accomplish with vision, determination, and care for the gaming experience.The customization options are generous and the game delivers what many games of the 4X adventure fantasy only promise, an infinitely repayable and engaging experience with several modes of play. Personally I like the Adventure mode, for what better fun can be had in a virtual fantasy world then exploring, dispatching monsters, and discovering vast hordes of loot and heroic upgrades? The races are predictable—orcs and frostlings and such—but their weapons and powers are not. I mean, really, what other game out there offers foes who toss exploding chickens at you and gobs of ordure? As a “seasoned gamer” of 60+ years, I play games not only for the pleasure they afford but I’m convinced, and there is some seminal research to suggest, that video gaming helps with both cognitive skills and hand-eye coordination. An antidote to Alzheimer’s? Too stiff a claim as yet, but it seems I can always remember minute details of my 13th year after an hour or two in AOW III's expansive realms even if they are details I’d rather forget.Let’s not overlook the aesthetic qualities of games like Age of Wonders either. The game offers campaigns, scenarios, and random maps that are varied, beautiful, and endlessly surprising. Thank you, Triumph!			"

												A welcome addition to the franchise, with some new additions and some drawbacks.Pros:+More strategic layers than previous Age of Wonders games with Race/Specialization/Class combinations+Unique balance of over-world construction, exploration, conquering/destruction, and tactical battles+Strong RPG elements for a strategy game with Heroes and Leaders' leveling and meaningful choices along the way+Interesting strategic variety with interaction of terrain and races+Many and meaningful strategic options/choices in units (skills, abilities, looks, interactions) and cities (city types, upgrades) and empire quests+Relatively easy to use map editor/makerCons:-Less friendly fire (I enjoyed how friendly fire was handled in previous games) and height advantages-Less atmosphere than age of wonders games through slightly weaker lore, presence of magic, racial uniqueness, and music/sfx-Story is a bit weak-3D Models are a bit ugly-Less races (Currently) than in other age of wonders gamesDifferences from other 4x Strategy-Fantasy Games:-More tactical battle focus-Less focus on constructionThe Future:The community is strong and kind enough.The developers are continuously working on the game and listening to the players.New races and classes are coming out.New race relations coming out.New balances and bonuses coming out.More modding coming out.Buy or No?If you are experienced with 4x strategy games... I would get this game.While the genre probably could use a game to revolutionize it a bit, this game does enough new things to keep your interest if you are captivated by 4x genre.  You may be annoyed with some things here and there, but overall the balance is strong enough and they are working on improving the balance and adding more content to sink your teeth into.If you are interested in fantasy lore, role-playing/story-making, primarily and racial interactions... I would get it on sale or wait.Do some research on the game first; if you find the lore interesting, purchase it if you haven't played any game in the genre or wait to see how the updates improve and add to the game in a few months.  Keep in mind you can also create some interesting quests with the map editor/maker.If you haven't really played much strategy 4x fantasy games and are curious... I would get this game now or on sale.Your enjoyment of the game will be higher if you have an open-mind and like intricate game systems.If you are looking for a fast-paced, mind-blowing, competitive game... do not purchase the game or do more research.  The pacing is similar to other strategic games like Civilization.  Also, there is nothing in here that will take your breath away, at least immediately.  The engagement relies on the stories and histories that are created from the complex systems and events that occur.Overall...AOW3 is a quality game that could use some improvements.  Fortunately, the developers care so improvements are on the way.  There  isn't too much else in the genre being made at the moment either and is better than its nearest fantasy-strategy competitors.  But feel free to check out games like Warlock, Fallen Enchantress, and Endless Legend as they offer slightly different fare if tactical combat is not entirely for you.			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is an excelent 4x game that focuses heavily on combat but should not be your first 4x title as it's so deep and complex that it will overwhelm you.This game is very similar to the ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" games but everything is taken to a next level. There are wide variety of starting races and classes. You even got 3 specilization skills on your leader. There are tons of stuff that are thown to your face right at the begining so I strongly recomend to watch a lets play video on youtube before jumping to a saddle youself. Heroes naturally level up as you proceed and they can be focused to be a healer,a disabler, an aura giver or a creature summoner for example. You can develop your empire to a way wish: getting everything by brute force or with cunning diplomacy. Whatever you choose war is inevitable in the end.The combat is executed excelent in this game and fighting is something you do almost every turn. Some fighting areas give units buffs or debuffs. Most terrains is also filled with natural obstackles that you can use to your advance. AI plays clever and will kill your units when it have a chance. Every unit has 3 action points and you can drain enemy units APs with diffrent kind of attacks and abilities what makes combat really deep and interesting. There is no pre-battle deployment and your units can get underfire the very first turn. I Feel mixed about lacking this feature: It's annoying to see your leader starting position being on a frontline and taking damage, however even now you still use your first turns to getting your formation up so is there really anything missing?There are random world wide events that happen every now and then which makes every game feel unique. Amount of items and abilities is just ridicilous and they can really alter you playing style. Not every items is ""+2dmg or +3 armor"", some give you unique abilities, auras, immunities or spells. You can also develop each race under your rule and try to complete special goals called ""empire quests"" while playing to get more powerful.There is no ""Technology tree"" in this game because most of the new learned things are not linearly linked to each other. This is without a doubt interesting feature when you have played this game a while but I'm pretty sure all the new players find this very confusing as you don't have a clue what you unlock after curent research is completed. Strategic minimap don't give almost any information about the map besides it's shape and location of the towns. I also didn't find any way to enlarge which is unfortunately as it really is a minimap.If you have patience to really study all the complex game mechanics you are probably going to spend a good portation of your time with this game. On the other hand if you have just played call of duty games and want to try something else, this is not for you. Start with Civilization 5 if you are looking for easy approach turn-based strategy game, because this is made for 4x veterans. Have played some 25 hours when writing this and I have just scarth the surface. Every game I find many items and monster I haven't seen before and develop more efective ways to use my units and vanish my foes.10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			"

												The city was lost. Orc civilians were rushing around, gathering belongings and fleeing their homes. On the horizon, six Ogres were marching forward. I had corralled every unit available in the area into the city, in a last-ditch effort to kill at least one or two of the foul creatures. The force consisted of 2 Musketmen, an Engineer, an Orc Priest and a Dread Monkey. None of those units could take a single Ogre on in a fight, but it was all we could muster. The plan was to force as many casualties on the Ogre's side, fighting them to the death, before our glorious leader came to avenge the fallen with his siege cannons and Juggernaut landships.I instructed the men to pour burning pitch made from Dragon Oil around the walls, in the hopes it would slow them down, and perhaps damage them further. Our leader cast a Mass Curse on the Ogres from across the world, using up all of his magical power for the time, which weakened their armor and resistance a little bit, but also, unwittingly, it seemed to drop their morale down from a high standing. The Ogres charged the city walls, and became immolated from the pitch. They yelled out in pain and anger, but all struck the walls with their fearsome clubs, shaking the very foundations. It seems the pitch wasn't enough to make these beasts think twice. I ordered the musketmen to fire down upon the beasts, and one fell in the initial volley, while the engineer handed one squad a set of freshly loaded muskets so they could fire again immediately.And then the Dread Monkeys began to fling their own excrement at these lumbering beasts. A foul, uncivilized tactic, but it proved to be too much for our would-be conquerors.The Ogre it landed on stopped everything it was doing, and tried desperately to rub off all the filth. The stench was horrific. Nearby Ogres were so repulsed by it that they fumbled, barely damaging the walls they were attempting to tear down. The burning pitch continued to sear their flesh, as the Musketmen fired volley after volley at the hapless monsters. The monkeys danced around, giggling and chattering in glee. Before the dastardly cretins could fling more of their filth at the Ogres, there were none left. All that remained were the charred, punctured corpses of what was once an impressive invasion, and not one of my men had fallen.TL;DR version: Dread Monkeys fling poo at an invading force of Ogres and demoralised them just enough that my ragtag group of defenders held onto a key city instead of being absolutely slaughtered.10/10 would fling poo again.

												I love this game: how many games will you ever own in life where you have played over 3,000 hours and counting?

												An extremely polished game with very intuitive controls/menus/interfaces. It's kinda admirable how it all comes together fluently and flawlessly for this isn't something that is self-evident in game design I suppose. As far as it's actual features are concerned it doesn't reinvent the wheel, it stays faithful to it's prequels in many parts, but there was probably no need to mess with tried and tested mechanics anyway.

												This game is truly a gem amongst the 4x genre. It does a great job of blending familiar combat mechanics of games like heroes of might and magic with the turn based empire building of more well known games like the civilization series. While not as complicated on the empire management side of things compared to games like civ, The very fact that you are constantly having to weigh your ofensive and defensive capabilities from the very beginning of every game prevents the pace from ever getting boring. Being able to combine races with empire classes provide a lot of diversity in unit bonuses and combinations which, between that and the game rule controls makes every new game unique. Overall: 9/10			"

												This is a really fun game. I like the tactical battles for this game. I have quite a few turn based fantasy 4x games, and the tactical battles for AoW have always been fun. There are lots of unit types. Also, players get to cast many spells while playing the game, both tactical and stratgic. Leader customization is great, and starting new scenarios is neat due to all of the choices availble. AoW III is also a very pretty game. The graphics and sound are phenomenal. There are spells that allow the player to change the terrain. Tactical maps also look good, with a lot of environment colors.Overall AoW III is a good, fun game.			"

												Having not played an AoW game since the first one, way back in about 1995, I wasnt quite sure what to expect with this.What I found was a delightful cross between two of my other favourite franchises - Heroes of Might and Magic, and Civilization.Age of Wonders III features many elements from the above and adds in a few ideas of its own, the result is a very solid turned based strategy/RPG hybrid of sorts. Certainly one to watch out for on the Steam Sale if you are considering getting it.			"

												This has to be one of the best 4x strategy games I have ever played. Coming from the Civilization series, I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this game but I was pleasantly surprised. Age of Wonders III blends RPG and strategy mechanics together and creates a really unique experience. You can design your own character like in a real RPG game, deciding their look, race, and class which determines the types of units you can use and also the types of spells you can utilize and research (research spells instead of technology in this game). You get a massive Civilization-like map to build cities upon and explore and during combat you get to fight on a randomized map and do turn based combat with TONS of soldiers and hero units.  You can play Age of Wonders in a randomly generated scenario, campaign, or with friends in head to head multiplayer. Both of the campaigns for the game are very well done, have good voice actors, and compelling gameplay. The only real turnoff for the game for those coming from other 4x strategy games is unlike games like Endless Space and/or Civilization, the only way to really win this game is through conquest. For me, that's okay since I feel like the game has so much to offer with what it already has. My Score for the Game: 9/10			"

												Really solid 4X with extremely in-depth combat and plent of units, spells, etc. to play with to make your perfect army. The developers have show a huge amount of support for the game and have gone out of the way to listen to criticisms to iron out the flaws that stuck out on release. I definetly would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the 4X genre just for the combat alone.Note: This isn't fantasy Civ 5; The game focuses more on the war aspect of 4X's than it does the empire/economy management, so if your strictly looking for a game with that Civ feeling then you might want to watch some youtube videos to get an idea if this is a game for you.

												As of 12/3/16 this review has been modified. At the time, it was at 94% helpful. I hope that only goes up!You can see how many hours I have in this. It's only going to keep rising. I love this game. It may well be the best strategy game I've ever played. It's heavily combat focused, and that combat never gets old for me. I'm still learning all the time. The highest level AI remains a challenge for me, though that is largely due to its construction; it cheats on the same order as SCII's AI cheats, gaining massive resource bonuses, morale bonuses, etc. It's a challenge, but not a fair one. I still enjoy it!So, what's it about? War. The entire game is focused around going to war. Do not get it for empire building, there isn't any. The biggest decision you have to make with cities is when it's worthwhile to stop producing units in favor of a building of some sort. All of the buildings either unlock new units, upgrade units produced from the city, increase research output (used to research more WEAPONS), or make the city harder to take. The only victory conditions are war related.Is that a problem? No. Because the war is so good. The strategic map is for faking out your enemy, destroying their economy, causing their cities to rebel, and striking their armies with spells. The tactical map, entered for battles, is for destroying their armies, and no other purpose. And it is so good. Most of your time will be spent on the tactical map, trying to keep your units alive while inflicting as much damage as possible on the enemy. The tactical AI may be the best I've ever encountered at providing a challenge. You have to be careful, or even the weakest group of enemies can deal serious damage to you. It does have mild flaws, largely centered around valuing damage over keeping its own units alive, in many cases. Which makes it extremely dangerous, if not quite as viable in the long run. Harder difficulty settings easily counter this shortfall by giving it resource bonuses.Everything has a counter, but no counter is hard. You aren't going to be crushed because your opponent chose a ""better"" setup at the beginning of the game. You will always be able to find a way around it.While I myself do not play MP much, the community is alive, both in PBEM and live games, and there are periodic community run tournaments. Man, I've rewritten this review so many times, trying to keep it short. Too much to talk about, and I'm going to cut myself off here. This game is wonderful. I will be playing it, minimum, until Triumph puts out their next game. My metric for value on a game is that it's worthwhile at 3 hours per dollar paid. I'd say that it falls well beyond that benchmark. Want a game focused on tactical war? Get this. Full price, all DLC included, I recommend it.A note: The above said, this game will often go 75% off for base game, 50% off for the complete pack, and 40% for DLCs. If you're not going to buy it unless it goes on sale, that's the best you're going to get in the near future. I still say get it full price, support the company, it'll still be well worth the price.			"

												A solid game in the 4X category.  Rich in fantasy lore you can easily find yourself losing many hours as your submerse yourself in the game.  While I would argue that this game could use some more balance testing, your are given a wide array of upgrades and abilities and opportunites to customize more then you would normally get to in another game of the same genre.I would recommend this game to those looking for either a single player or multiplayer experience however patience is required during multiplayer games as it's not as fluid as the single player experience.

												Logged 250 hours beta testing the game. Not because i wanted to just test the game, but because i loved playing it. It is so good. A lot of depth and strategical planning involved. This is a highly recommended game from the YouTube guy who made the How to Play series. Check it out if your new to the game or the 4x/TBS genre as a whole :)https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhAjLeSwzp3hLPeLqY2p-R7Ubbauwhxpe "

												This game is similar to 4x games like Civilization or Endless Legend except that there's more emphasis on combat and less emphasis on other aspects like commerce, city building, or diplomacy. *Those other aspects still exist in this game but their purpose is mostly to facilitate battles.The combat is turn based and highly rewards you for good strategic play. Most fights come down to simply having stronger units but even if you have low tier units you can still sometimes win nearly impossible fights with a good mix of strategy and spells.Individual battles can range from one unit vs one unit to massive wars that can take nearly an hour to complete. If you're impatient (and are sure of victory or defeat) you can also select the auto option which will measure your strength against your opponents and the computer will instantly dictate the winner of the fight.  Each class rewards you with unique units and spells and each race also has specific units as well as its own strengths and weaknesses.  Some classes focus on mobility and ranged units, one focuses on spells and summoning, one focuses on resurrecting hoards of undead, one focuses on spying and debuffing, one focuses on healing and buffing, and the other simply conquers as much territory as they can to produce as many units as possible. On top of all that, when you make your hero you're also given a choice of specializations that even further customizes your spell choices and strengths/weaknesses. As you can see, this allows for nearly endless combinations of ways to play the game. They aren't just superficial differences either, each class/race/specialization you play will have dramatic impacts on how you play the game.			"

												Pretty good turn based strategy game. It is a mix of a few things actually, there is lite empire management (think Civilization), hero customization and - the main focus of the game - huge turn based tactical battles. For a game of this kind it's refreshingly bug free, but there are some serious balance issues still. Nothing that can't be patched though. And even in the release state I had a real quality 40 hours of enjoyment with it already. It can only get even better from here on.In the interest of full disclosure, here are the problems the game still has at the time of this review IMO:- Tier IV units are so much better than anything else, they make older units obsolete and the best tactic is rushing and spamming them. Also if you can't kill the enemy in time to prevent them from getting stacks of T IV units, you basically lost. If you have them, the battles lose their tactical depth. Just move forward and smash all opposition.- The heroes are super squishy and you instantly lose the game if they die (in the campaign, in custom maps they are still perma dead at least), which makes you not really want to use them, which is a shame because they are some of the most interesting units in the game- The economy is off, mana is practically limitless, gold is either no issue or a good sign that you'll lose within few turns if it becomes one- Little item variety, you'll quickly amass triple and quadruple copies of each item in your hero's inventory if you comb the map dilligently "

												I bought this game because my boyfriend wanted to play together. It was fun! Especially playing it local co-op. Sitting together, talk strategy, team up. Great experience!It reminded me of my favorite nostalgic game Heroes III. The choices of characters and races were broad enough, and the different enviroments were typical for a rpg-strategy game. Through the fights I loved that you have the options to zoom in anytime and get a close up. The graphics are very clear so I recommed to play this game with High Performances adjustments to get the best of the production. The single campaigns had a deep story and it gave you a lot of strategy challenges. Thumbs Up for this one! It gives you a  lot of gameplay hours!  "

												Take Civilization IV/V and strip away the complexity of luxury resources and strategic resources, as well as complex diplomacy. This is very loosely a 4X strategy game. And It's amazing. They have tuned the strategic combat system to practical perfection. If you enjoy turn based combat, and the idea of empire building, but want something more exciting or prefer battle. This is for you.Each civilization is pretty unique, though the humans could be a little better. The classes are ALL Unique though. And each one adds variety to the game.Overall I would say it is a solid game, that is worth getting if you are into the war part of 4X strategy games.			"

												EDIT 23-11-2016 - This game still stands the test of time, if you still haven't bought it; Do it now!EDIT 17-04-2015 - With the new Eternal Lords expansion in combination with the free 1.5 patch, this game is even better than it was originally.Twelve years we waited for the successor of the excellent Shadow Magic (also available on Steam). And is it worth it? Hell yes!The graphics, soundtrack and (re)playability are excellent! As the Devs are a small company from Holland, and independent publishers, they actively browse and reply on the official forums, making notes of bugs (although there are very few bugs at release) and planning on fixing them in future patches. The same is regarding balancing issues. They are very actively gathering balancing suggestions and also implementing them thorugh patches. They are very close to the community and that is something most software companies can learn from. Regular patches are already released and more are in the pipeline.The game itself comes with an editor, so you can make your own maps/campaigns. Furthermore single-player options are two campaigns, about 8 scenarios and, the icing on the cake, a Random Map Generator. This generator makes very good maps with realistic landmasses. Maps can be selected for small to extra large size and 2-8 players.There is also a multiplayer mode which supports Hotseat (players take turns on the same computer), LAN (need to make contact with official servers first, after that it's offline), VPN (in beta patch at the time of writing) and normal multiplayer games through the internet.I already netted 165 hours in the game, which was released just 16 days ago (at the time of writing) and I just cannot stop playing! This game is highly recommended, not only for gameplay purposes, but also to support the independent developer!			"

Age of Wonders IIIDeveloped and Published by: Triumph StudiosReleased: March 2014+ Rich and colourful high fantasy setting+ Deep and challenging tactical combat+ Beautiful soundtrack+ Massive unit variety, with the different race and leader variations+ In MP, only the host needs to own DLC for a match to use all the expanded features+ One... more... turn...+ The devs are active with the community, helping with issues and implementing features and fixes+ Steam Workshop, and not the paywalled kind- Very basic empire building- Could use some more game changing magic spells- Some slight balance issues- Some of the original campaign maps feel lame, forcing rushes before the AI gets stronger- Consistent lag in MP often up to 4-5 seconds on the strategic map- Visually unimpressive, with jaggies and 'blocky' terrain features- Low framerates on strategic map on my system far surpassing recommended specs, often down to 15(!) if Vsync is enabledAge of Wonders III sucked me in and after 150 hours played, finally having finished all the campaigns I still want to play more of it.  The base game is a solid fantasy strategic war game, and the two DLCs Golden Realms and Eternal Lords both add satisfying campaigns and a wealth of features and 'stuff', end result being a title that has a lot to offer.I would have liked to see better empire building and management in the game, and it could look better, and run better.  Even so I am greatly enjoying my time with this game and don't see myself deleting it from my hard drive any time soon.			"

												This is one of those games you think you're not going to like but ends up surprising you with how good it truly is. The best way to describe the game is like it's Civilization V without the city micro-management in turn for more indepth combat and multiple story driven chapters. If you enjoy strategy or hex-based games this is a definite must if it's on sale.			"

												Excellent fantasy based strategy game. Combines elements from Heroes of Might and Magic, and the Civilisation series to create a game with a focus on aggressive expansion. Pros:- Fun combat mechanics.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of spells/units.- Nice audio/visuals to go along with the fantasy element.- Well made campaign.Cons:- Bit of a learning curve if you haven't played any AoW game before.- Games can take a long time, especially when you first start and don't have a late game strategy in mind.- Using auto-combat can be risky.I would recommend getting the expansions after you've finished the main campaign. Well worth it.			"

												This game is like the beautiful love child of Total War: Warhammer and Civ V. It is now my most played game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys 4X strategy games, but there are some things you should know if you buy the game.-The smaller the map size, the easier the game. I could not figure out for the longest time why an Emperor AI would destroy me on a large map but I could beat him on a small map. The AI steamrolls, hard, with the buffs they get just for being on a harder difficulty. If you're like me and love giant maps with a ton to explore, turn the AI down a notch in difficulty.-The DLC do make the game a bit pay-to-win if you do player vs player. They might nerf how OP the Necromancer class is in the future but I doubt it, and some of the adept Wild Magic spells are extremely good. The DLC races seem decently balanced to me, so that's good.-The game crashes very rarely for me personally, that's a plus.Those are just some points I wanted to make for if you play. I hope to see you out there!			"

												I really enjoy this game. I've wanted to play a game like this for some time now. I haven't played the previous AOW games but I'm glad I finally found this one. It's a great blend of Civ and HOMM. I like that you need to be aggressive to win. There's a lot of action and conflict.The game has a great combination of races, spells, and units. The graphics are great and the customization of your leader are very nice. There are a ton of settings that you can adjust to enhance your game.The multiplayer is very good. If you autofight independents then it goes by fast. There isn't a lot of waiting around for your opponent to take their turn (hello Warlock games).I haven't even played the campaigns yet. I prefer sandbox mode.The expansion adds a lot to the game and is reasonably priced. I bought the base game on a 50% off sale. At $20 you cannot beat it. Knowing what I do now about the game, there is no doubt I'd pay full price for it. I highly recommend it.			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is the best modern reimagining of Master of Magic, period. It takes most (but not quite all) of what was great about MoM, and puts it into a modern package, with a slick UI, great graphics and large single-player campaigns. It even improves significantly on some gameplay elements compared to MoM, like the tactical combat and the concept of leader domain.If you are a fan of Master of Magic, just buy it already, don't wait another second. If not, but you enjoy TBS or 4x games at all, buy it anyway.			"

												I have played Age of wonders game in the past so I am pretty familier on the game play of these type of games, let me start and say this game is the best graphical of the lot.   Now that I have that out of the way the detail that the developers have put in this game is pretty impressive.  Each individual unit makeup and descriptions are pretty well done as well pretty funny on some of the unit discriptions, similar to Warcraft humor.  The tactical combat is a pleasure to do even though there is a option for auto-resolve. I wouldn't suggest auto resolving too much unless your cut for time, and this game is not really made to be rushed and get it done game.  Like the old saying goes its good to smell the flowers sometimes and you should do this in this game because the animation and tactical combat is a thing of beautify.  The unit detail as you battle is so detailed I had to zoom all the way to appreciate the orc's armor and color scheme,  it's that good.You can tell they put alot of love and effort in this game.  There is so so much detail besides the units makeup, terrain, heroes, etc. etc...  I just can't go thru all of it, it was pretty much worth my hard earn money.   Gameplay is very addictive and the story is interesting and keeped me involved. Now everything isn't perfect like when siege units break down walls.  Its hard to see from the animation that the wall was destroyed or not.  I keeped attacking the same wall because of it.  Only way I knew that the wall was destroyed was that I accidently moved a unit past the castle and it moved threw the wall.  Thats probably going to be patched since this is fairly a new game.  I am sure there are other bugs but nothing I have played so far that crashes the game.  Its pretty stable and the turns are rather quick after you finish your round.  I would say it takes few secs for the next round, thats really fast, which is pretty impressive compaired  to game like Rome Total War 2. It seemed like forever to wait for your next turn the Total War game.  Yes these two games are different but just trying to point out that turns are pretty quick and fluid in Age of Wonders 3.   All in all I would highly recommend this game to any turn base strategist and fantasy buff.  The intereface is so easy I believe it might attract a wider audience besides the aftermentioned gamers.  Yes, this will suck your time like no other.  I went straight 4 hours playing and didnt even notice the time go by, thats how enjoyable this game is.  Just smell the flower and trust me dont rush threw this flower bed or you will miss the beauty of this game.NOTE: I purchased the game and was not a Beta tester or a employee of them. lol			"

												So, i nominated this game for some Steam Award and now i have to write a review for 25XP. Deal with it! Still, i'm going to write a full review as someone wo has nearly 400 hours in Age of Wonder 2: Shadowmagic, and... well, a lot less hours in Civ 5.So what is Age of Wonders 3?Age of Wonders 3 is a turn based Strategy game strongly focused around combat, in a pretty standard fanatasy setting. You have elfs, orcs, goblins, halflings and some more unique races like fronstlings and draconians for example. You play as a highly customizable wizard, learning spells and taking over cities, you can upgrade to build stronger and more units, either by producing them in the cities or summoning them with magic.You have multiple classes for your wizard, that kind of work based on the rock paper scissors principle.You'll be able to recruit heros, who can cast some spells as well, and whom you can level up and equip, just like your wizard. Unlike in the previous Age of Wonders game you have the option for your heroes, that if they die in battle, they'll still life on afterwards, unless you lose the bettle entirely. But then you can just resurrect them, using a spell, everyone gets sooner or later. This makes things much less frustrating for those who wish so.The other big new thing in AoW3 is flanking. In AoW2 you could come in with a few string units and just ♥♥♥♥ up a whole army of individualy weaker units with ease, unless you enemie had a big defensive advantage. Flanking gives you new tactical method to make your numbers count, if used well, and it makes some stealthy units more viable, by focusing their skills on this tool, not just having invisibility or concealment on the worldmap.Yes, there is a worldmap and a ""new"" map for each battle. Playing CIV5 after AoW is the least satisfying thing in regards of combat ever. It's like playing ludo after falling in love with chess. You can fire with archers or priests from the top of your city wall, while the enemie sends massive wallbreakers to tear down your gates. Meanwhile his flying unity just pass the wall, trying to take out your raged units. As your last archer dies you cast a massive firestorm for lots of damage on every unit on the battlefield, including your own ones. This is combat.Now there are some cons i'll have to point out.First of all i am not a fan of the campain. As much as i'd like to play it, the missions are just annoying to me. I can't really explayin why, sorry. But i've never liked the campain in any AoW game, while there are many others who loved them. So most of the time i'm just playing randoms maps.The second thing i'd like to point out is a point that occurs in every round i'm playing. It's the point where you are (if you're winning) reaching superiority in a game it becomes boring. They implemented the option for leaders to surrender to you, which i really appreciate, but if you play a 4-player match and took over the cities of 2 of them already, the last enemie is pretty boring to defeat most of the times. That's why i rarely ever finish a game.The third thing are the difficulty settings for the AI. The AI cheats on higher difficulties. They get way more resources, combat bonuses agains independent units, like for example a group of dwarfs protecting a mine, and other stuff. That's not a good way to create difficulty in my opinion.And at last the DLC problem. No, i think the pricing is ok, but i also think they are mandatory for a good experience. The base game just feeld a bit empty.But now a quick sum up of all the great stuff, and belive me, there is a lot!The combat is great, and if your Army of Angels has to fight a pack of wolves you can just let the battle fight out automatically. The new class-system is a welcoming difference. The environment looks gorgeous, even on (most) random generated maps. I still prefer the soundtrack of AoW2 but it's still great in AoW3. Never had any problems with online play. The spells are great. The customization options for the leaders give a lot of variety and a lot of different options for tactics.To sum it up.Age of Wonders 3 is a great turn based game that lacks the economical complexity of games like Civ, but provides a superior tactical combat experience in a good looking fantasy setting.8,9/10 because i can play as a goblin druid and it's great!

												I have always loved both the mythological turn based strategy war games and the Civilization games, so when I saw this I went for it.  Man, I am not disappointed.  Personally, it keeps my interest better than Civ V because of the unpredictable variance of the random maps.  I started playing the recommended campaign, but that was right when I got it, and needed to learn how to play this game.  I quickly switched to the random maps and have been having a blast with the curve balls this game throws at you.  I took over a dwelling of giants at one point and was carefully upkeeping it before producing a giant unit due to the expensive maintenence when suddenly a city on my outer borders got attacked by a very nasty undead dragon.  The dwellings are cool if you can take them over, but are fierce opponents.  If you take over or are joined by an independent city of another race, you can make units of that race.   Learning the game is an experience that increases its replayability.  At first I thought goblins were unfairly weak, but after playing other races, I learned some goblin units are pretty darn superior for their type.  You can basically play the way you want - if you want to be warlike, go ahead and invade and break treaties, or whatnot.  There are rewards for getting an evil alignment as well as good if you want to try more diplomatic methods such as doing quests to absorb cities.  I can't say much about the campaigns or the multiplayer at this point, as I am having too much fun with the random maps to try them yet.  I totally recommend this game if you like Civ games and myth-related turn based strategies.			"

												I'm going to just address the top 3-4 negative reviews.Most of those seem to come from players who are not used to the Age of Wonders franchise, people who come from other 4x games like Total War or Civ (But mostly Civ).I understand that you find the game ""lack-luster"" or ""lacking in depth"" in comparison to Civ. Truth be told, I agree with you there. But the game makes for it in THE BEST way by being 5x more in depth than Civ in combat. Civ combat has got to be one of the most boring things that have turned me away from the game. Purely, if I were to play it for economic, diplomatic, and technological victories then Civ would be my ideal game.However, let's be real here we want to fight. We want to see Elven Arrows blasting holy damage into undead and dealing critical damage that sends zombies flying. We want to see Frostling Mammoth charging into a line of human swordsmen and send them packing or frozen solid from wizard buffs. Isn't that more interesting then your typical ""right click this group because hey scissors beats paper.""The hero customization is pretty damn interesting, while you maybe thinking: ""There are only a few options in the beginning what are you talking about?"" The true customization begins when you are leveling up on the campaign map where you can allocate stats, and new skills unlock the higher level you are. These are all incredibly unique.AND NOW THERE IS MODDING. So even if the core selling points didn't get you (Which if they didn't you've got quite a boring taste for video games, I'm sorry) The community has made re-skin mods, unleashed whole new races, created ridiculous legendary nits for your favorite races, and more.If you're a fan of Age of Wonders, just get the game. I usually wait for it to be on sale to buy games anyway since 30$ is a little high, but it was worth it when I got it. If you're a fan of Civ games but want to take a break, THEN TAKE A BREAK. This game IS NOT CIV. It has MUCH higher emphasis on military campaigns and military strategy, and MUCH less on building/economic strategy that Civ excels at. Don't get me wrong, I understand why Civ is a success, but this game is NOT civ so stop comparing the two, lol.			"

												If you have played the past installments of the series, here's a brief overview. First of all, this is definitely AoW as we knew and loved it. Game mechanics is closer to AoW2/SM than it is to AoW1 - there are domains, you don't need siege units to take out walled cities (tho they help), lots of various buildings with a tree of what is needed for what, can build settlers and found cities etc. Overall I'd say changes to core mechanics compared to SM are relatively minor, and focus mainly on tactical combat, where we now have flanking and a more clear mechanics for ranged shots. All in all, if you liked AoW series, and especially AoW:SM, highly recommended. Personally, I still think AoW1 is the best of them all, but this one is still plenty of fun. Oh, and the soundtrack is awesome and very much reminiscent of the very first game.If you haven't played AoW before, but remember the name ""Master of Magic"", then you can basically think of this as a remake of MoM. Again, if you liked that game, you will probably like this.If neither of those ring a bell, the short way to describe this would be Civilization crossed with Heroes of Might and Magic, with some special uniqueness of its own.The Civilization part is the global map where you capture and/or build cities, manage them to grow their population, build various buildings that improve growth/production/gold/mana/research or produce units, and research spells and special abilities. There's also a HoMM-esque aspect to it as the map is littered with loot and special gold/mana/research producing buildings, typically guarded by NPC mobs. However, unlike HoMM, the global gameplay is definitely geared more towards city management.When it comes to combat, you can either auto-resolve it, or go into tactical mode like HoMM. Now the big difference here is that, where HoMM is basically two armies of 6 unlimited stacks of units battling on a very small map lined against each other, in AoW you get the combat map produced out of the hex that's being attacked (on the global map), plus the six hexes surrounding it - and all the armies on them! Each army consists of up to 6 units (which CANNOT be stacked), and can technically belong to a different player, or independent mobs (some of which will fight each other). So you can have up to 42 independent units in combat, controlled by anywhere from 2 to 7 players, and with a large combat map which presents plenty of opportunity for maneuver - flanking, retreating to form a line etc are all very common here and have to be learned to fight efficiently, plus the terrain is full of buildings, trees and other obstacles that can be used as cover or to break up enemy line. Consequently, battles typically last longer than in HoMM, especially large city sieges, and are far more tactically challenging - superiority in numbers by no means ensures victory.Another HoMM-like-but-better thing is hero and leader development. You get the usual system with hero classes, experience points accumulating from kills etc, invested into various skills and traits. There is inventory, too, to be filled by loot from various ruins after evicting their occupants. All in all, this is a solid high fantasy 4X game that is rather engaging and a lot of fun.			"

												Age of Wonders 3, what can I say that hasn't already been said. I am a late convert to the game. The original release didn't inspire me. The Golden Realms expansion, though great, didn't interest me. The hype of Eternal Lords got me to look and it's implementation got me to stay and play. A fantastic fantasy war game that reminds me a lot of Warhammer Fantasy Battle, AoW 3 is a fantastically fun battle simulator. Is it a perfect game? No. It has some shortcomings, but it's getting better all the time. My favorite Race are the Tigrans; fast, blood thirsty and feline. My favorite specilization: Arch Druid because of the summons and the cool units.Least favorite.. BONE DRAGONS!!!!!Anyways, to get more, come check out our official review at eXplorminate4x.com "

												The AI cheats like crazy in this game.There is no way around it. The AI seems to know EVERY LOCATION that is UNGUARDED. I have tested it by having 6 cities. Whenever I remove a garrison from one, the AI will go there. It's immensely frustrating that after saving and loading 6 times, the AI still does this, and there is no way that I can proceed.Overall, since the AI will be our core opponent unless in multiplayer, I don't recommend this game at all if you wish to fight against a cheating AI.

												I played part 1 & 2 of this back when they were new so I was very much looking forward to the new one. It didn't disappoint.The game looks quite beautiful. The basic game mechanics are still the same so if you have played the old games you will feel right at home again. There are lots of different units and strategies you can use. Combat is fun and complex. The story is pretty run of the mill but good enough to glue the maps together.The game is well supported with patches and expansions.Well worth playing.			"

												This game is exactly what I\'ve been looking for: a decent fantasy strategy game.I do have some slight issues:1. Needs more Navy. I love naval combat. It\'s adds a different layer into the strategy game and makes it more interesting and challenging. Unfortunately there are only two fleet options in AoW: the frigate and the galleon.2. I\'ve found the Tigrans to be slightly OP. I started a game with Cerren and have tier I & II units just walking effortlessly over tier IV and higher units. Are they OP or an I just better with the Tigrans than I am with other races?3. Sorcerers feel slightly OP. Sorcerers. Holy ♥♥♥♥! ♥♥♥♥ing sorcerers! They start of weak then suddenly BAM! Unstoppable. But I can\'t judge AoW for that. They\'ve always been like that.3. Why don\'t assassins have throwing knives? Assassins without throwing knives or shuriken is like waffles without maple syrup.What I love:1. The tactics. Having to take into consideration race, class, morale, climate, terrain, and all these factors makes this game pretty damn sweet. I know it\'s not really a new concept, but it\'s a good one.2. The world is beautiful.3. The characters are beautiful.4. I can customise my own heroes.5. It saves after every turn, which is great if something goes wrong, like a blackout or a crash.All in all I like this game a lot.			"

												The best turn-based strategy since Heroes of Might and Magic III. Prepare to invest heavy amounts of hours into the campaign and barely have even explored what the rest of the game has on offer. The AI offers a decent challenge that will keep you interested for a while to come, and the combat system has enough depth to bring along a few surprises each match. Look no further if you are after a polished strategy game that will keep you thinking and offers some nice fantasy elements to boot.			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is perhaps the best in the series thus far.  The best features being the extensive random game generator and the capabilities of hot-seat multi-player.  That being said, for those who are wanting a good single player srategy game, it fits that bill as well.  Though I have seen repeated unit selections, there is enough variation to edge you towards creating multiple heroes just to see what build fits your concept best.  The music has changed in pace from being dreamy to driven synth orchestra... and boasts a great selection of tracks.  The digital soundtrack package included 36 tracks, plus all the cd case art.  If you are looking for a good strategy game by which you can take your own pace, dab into some light rpg elements, and team up with (or betray) a buddy... you have found it.  Previous fans should rejoice. Others, well, welcome to the club.  Oh yeah... don't forget the perks of the included map editor.			"

												While not exactly revolutionary at any given aspect, the unique combination presented in the gameplay plus the fact that it is fairly well-made make for a worthwhile experience if you are into this sort of thing. It's a fantasy turn-based civ-style game, which is not something you really see a lot of. The campaign leaves much to be desired, the gameplay isn't perfect, and sure, I'd like a little more from the customization options, but this game does a lot of things competently so I can't ask it to be perfect at everything. If you want just an rpg to customize characters, this isn't it. If you want your hero to also lead armies in your growing civilization in a fantasy world, this satisfies that. There's also a map/scenario editor. You'll have to look up how to do scripting if you want to be fancy with it, but the map editor itself is fairly easy and well-done.			"

												Are you old enough to have played Master of Magic? This is Master of Magic. Not 'loosely based on' or 'contains a nod to' Master of Magic... it IS Master of Magic. If you know how to play MoM, you won't even need the tutorial.Which is fine. I loved Master of Magic. The graphics are much better, and there are a lot of improvements in the way your various campaigns can be set up. You've got adjustable victory conditions, more players if you want them, and you can ally with independent cities for starters. This game is well worth picking up if you like 4x.			"

												I was pleasantly surprised and impressed when I picked up Age of Wonders III.  A fantasy 4X strategy game is something that will always catch my eye though the genre has disappointed me quite frequently lately.  Fortunately, this particular one nearly flawlessly pulls off what I would expect and lived up to its potential.  This is a fantasy conquest game with a sizable helping of RPG that you don't want to miss.The map aspect of the game is fairly simple, though it has enough to it to keep it interesting.  There are plenty of landmarks, cities, and dungeons scattered about and, usually, plenty of space for you to construct new cities and fortresses if you so choose.  Cities can be improved with buildings to assist in growing their populations, boosting their economies, enhancing their defenses, training units, and more.  Though empire management is nowhere near as deep as something akin to Civilization, I never found myself feeling as if anything additional was needed for this particular game.  It is, after all, a conquest game, not an empire builder.Combat, on the other hand, is where the game truly stands out.  Battles take place on a zoomed in map that is generated based on the features of the terrain being defended.  The turn-based tactical engagements can involve a large number of units and, at times, a single battle can take over twenty minutes.  The AI is no joke in this game and can provide a legitimate opponent which is a breath of fresh air.  Progression for you units and heroes is also an exciting aspect of Age of Wonders III.  When a hero levels, they acquire five skill points that they can purchase skills with.  These skills are from a non-linear tree that is specific to their class.  When a unit levels, it generally gains only stat bonuses, though every unit in the game has at least one unique ability that it can acquire once the required experience has been gained.  The system offers a lot of customization for your hero builds but also manages to make leveling your non-unique units fun as well.Playing one of the campaigns in the game offer unique goals and a decently written story, though, they do limit your power over the customization of your heroes.  You are supplied with several heroes that are characters within the story who will take turns acting as the 'leader' of your faction on certain maps.  It is an excellent way to get a grasp of the game and the differing races and classes in a way that dips your toes in slowly instead of hopping in head first.  Your heroes will also carry over from map to map giving them the opportunity to reach levels that would be hard to obtain in scenario play.When playing a scenario, you are able to design your leader from the ground up.  This includes they and their army's race, the hero's class and specializations, and even the appearance of your hero themselves.  There are a fairly significant number of each and you could spend all day deciding which combination you want to play with.  Do you want to play an orcish archdruid and have your melee powerful units complemented by summoned nature-themed units?  Or do you want to play an elven engineer who has their line of dangerous elven archers aided by cannons and musketeers?  The combinations are a lot of fun and the class specific units have different unit models for every race.If you couldn't tell by this point, I am quite a fan of Age of Wonders III.  It successfully fills a void that I'd felt in my soul time after time playing the games that were 'inspired' by Master of Magic but couldn't quite hit the mark.  I highly recommend this game for turn-based strategy fans, especially those who are also fans of high fantasy.Raise your sword, ready your staff, load your musket, sharpen your claws and conquer these lands for yourself!

												I've never played an Age of Wonders game before.  I played Civ V however, and this game is similar in a lot of ways. Basically, imagine Civ V but with less to do with science and diplomatic options and more just combat, combat combat.  Throw in some Final Fantasy Tactics for manual combat (there's an auto resolve button if you choose not to) and you have a steller game.   I originally wrote this game off as I figured all my friends playing it would move on shortly after.  Now I can see why they are so into it.  It has plenty of depth for replayability. Whether you want a rogueish goblin who is adept at fire, or a theocratic orc who uses kindness, it's all up to you.  Pick this ♥♥♥♥ up.  If you are on the fence, just jump.  I did, and I don't regret it.			"

												One of my favorite games on steam!Prepare to be sucked in with Age of Wonders 3.  An amazing turn based strategy game that will continue to hold your attention and WOW you with attention to detail, depth and rich battles.The game features a series of campaigns with different routes, fun hand crafted scenarios and a random map generator with different modes to play.You pick a race/class/specializations which are all interesting, fun and create different synergies.Orc warlord? Human Dreadnaught? Elven sorcerer?, Goblin Archdruid Specializing in water magic to create a swampy empire?You name it! the combinations are plenty!Each race starts off with a variety of units that for the most part fill common roles,Infantry, Archer, Pikeman, Cavalry, flyers, and support.  All these units per race ARE UNIQUE and different, it just might not appear that way on the surface. Orcs are great at melee, elves great with archers etc.Classes affect your spells in and out of combat, and units that you get.Terrain/weather affect.  Your leader and Heroes units level up and can customized.Units can level up.Different sub factions that can be conquered and used to your advantage. Like dragons and giants.I can go on and on but the combinations and situations to be in are plenty and it never gets dull.MUST PLAY! 9/10			"

												If you were ever a fan of the old games, make no mistake, this is a perfect sequel for the franchise.Having grown up playing the first three Age of Wonders games, it's hard to say in words exactly how excited I was in the lead up to this game coming out. I was worried in part by how it seemed as if your class defined the vast majority of your army but, having finally gotten the chance to play, all my fears from watching the previews have been quenched. This game feels exactly like AoW2/SM in all the right ways; next to nothing was removed mechanically and the new class and neutral city systems are simply additions, not replacements, to the old ways and they blend in perfectly.While it seems weird to review a game less than a day after having first played it, you should understand that I am the kind of gamer who will play a game I adore for only an hour per day when I'm ""into it"" and yet, with AoW3, I haven't been able to put it down. The sense of adventure and discovery I've found playing this game is unmatched, though I admit I'm looking at it through rose-coloured glasses. It really feels like a fresh take on the series, and the genre as a whole, without seeming too attached or too spiteful towards its predecessors.It is not a flawless game by any means. I've found numerous graphic and sound bugs in the time I've been playing with some battle map terrain acquiring a strobe effect and a few attack sound effects simply missing in the ether. The map generator is still somewhat flawed, leaving a suspicious trail of grass along the edges of some maps and awkwardly placing patches of water in giant lava pools. My first encounter with an NPC in a match had me face to face with the character I had just created minutes before and was currently playing, turning the war into what looked more like bickering twins. These issues to hinder on the immersion quite a bit and hopefully they will be patched in time but it's never enough to make the game any less fun. What DOES make the game less fun is how suicidal the AI is when trying to rely on auto-combat, which is mostly a problem in multiplayer as not using auto-combat takes up a lot of time from everyone involved.Tactical combat is, in my opinion, far more intricate and engaging as any of the older titles. The simple addition of the flanking and defending mechanic, as well as the reworking of the accuracy systems, was enough to vastly increase the depth of the combat but the sheer number of new units and abilities added on top of what we're already used to is almost overwhelming and it makes combat much more surprising, adaptive and satisfying.The reworked city system is a rather significant departure from the originals and is what leads many to believe it's taken too much inspiration from Civilization. Having played Civ 5 to death as well, I can say the change does feel more in line with Civilization than the previous Age of Wonders games but it's very unintrusive and comes with a purpose. Now you have to be careful about where and how you place your cities because their growth (and, by extension, they effectiveness) is inhibated by whatever borders surround them and the structures nearby have significant rewards attached whereas, in the older games, you would place cities as close as possible because more cities just meant more gold, no more thought involved. Here, cities hold a much more strategic purpose and can lead to epic battles fought over one mostly unimpressive city just because it has a structure you want in its domain. It's exciting and thought provoking and feels natural in the evolution of the series.Overall, I love this game. I don't think it's an easy game to get into but it's clearly a game made with their fans in mind and is completely unapologetic about that. If you ever felt the other Age of Wonders game appealed to you before, chances are you will love this new installment. As a child of the AoW era, I can honestly say this has turned out to be everything I have hoped for for the past 11 years.			"

												This game has the best combat system out of all the 4x games I have played. Rather than watching your army play an attacking animation against the enemy on the map like in most 4x games, you are transported to a seperate battle map. In this battle are the units of the attacking army, the defending army, and any adjacent armies, for a total of up to 42 units. There are lots of unique units with unique spells and abilities. The combat is very strategic, you have to think about how you position your units to flank your enemy and not leave them vulnerable to be flanked by the enemy.The empire building isn't as in-depth as other 4x games though. This game is focused more on your hero, whom you can level up and acquire new armor, weapons, spells and abilities for. You can also recruit other heros to join you. This is one of my favourite 4x games and I would highly recommend it if you are looking for one with a more engaging combat system than most other 4x games.			"

												Short review: 596 hours. Um, yeah.Longer review: If you were ever a fan of classic turn based strategy games like Heroes I-IV, you'll love AoW III. Much more than the recent Civilization games, it has that ""just one more turn..."" feel that will cut into your sleep time. Beautiful graphics, easy to learn and use UI and excellent mod support that adds even more depth to an already deep game.The only real negative is that the expansions really are required to get the most out of the game, especially the one that adds necromancers and a lot of other fun stuff. A number of the really excellent mods also require the expansions, beware. "

												A wonderful game!This is what Heroes of Might and Magic 5,6 and 7 should have been like! Clearly developed to beat these titles and it succeeds I think!Essentially Age of Wonders III is HOM&M but with far superior combat, tactics, spells, heroes and troop development.The graphics are as good as later HOM&M titles but the 3D used here seems to work so much better than HOM&M I feel, the interface is also more intuitive. Though I loved Heroes of Might and Magic 1 to 4 I could never get used to the later version's interface but AOWIII improves on them greatly in almost all aspects. The one small issue with it is that the maps, at least in the Scenario's, do not seem quite as heavy on resources and independant enemies as HOM&M games but I guess this is because the game is trying to break away slightly here.I will also say, it's HARD! I like this but was continually getting my backside kicked until I realise how much effect terrain variations had on different troops types! I love this and it really distinguishes it from HOM&M games where morale was a simple mechanism. AOWIII brilliantly bridges the gap between HOM&M and a more traditional squad/unit-based wargame.Think of a cross between HOM&M and Warhammer and you are just about there :)			"

												A fantastic strategy game that will appeal to anyone who loves the genre. The game is a 4X similar to Civilization and Master of Magic, but it takes heavy cues from Heroes of Might and Magic in that the world is littered with goodies thrown about to plunder and neutral enemies guarding them, as well as customisable hero units that you can recruit and level. The best thing about it though, is the tactical battle system. This is nothing new, as Master of Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic, as well as the original Age of Wonders games, all did this a long time ago, but here it feels so refined. Terrain has a big impact, units have cool active and passive abilities, and the strategic choices that you make in battle all feel meaningful. On top of this, the game has great variety. Not only do you have a selection of races to choose, all with their own tech trees and units, but you also have character classes and traits to choose for your leader. Your leader's class and traits will determing what extra special units you can produce, as well as the spells you have access to. The combination of both race and class makes mixing and matching fun to do, and allows you to have much more variety if you get bored of a certain setup, yet still like certain elements of your previous games. The expansions are absolutely worth it if you enjoy the game already. The Necromancer class added by Eternal Lords is amazingly fun, and plays entirely differently than the other classes, with a much more agressive play style that emphasises growing your cities and armies through combat. Over all, Age of Wonders III is one of the best in the genre to date.			"

												****Edit on Feb 2015****Purchased and played Golden Realm DLC...ExcellentPro 's-3 part Campaign with storyboard and voice acting, extra gametypes, leaders, units, etc.-Game seems much more balanced and only crashed once on a custom scenario.Con's-I use to be able to host internet games but now you get a connectivity rating and if it is poor you are   not allowed to host game although you can still join them.  (Nothing in my hardware setup has changed, so one of the later game patches must have implemented this.)-though they have done balancing to the game, I still found myself having to reload ingame saves while playing on the easiest skill level.In all I'm moving my rating up to a 9.April 7 2014My review for the 4x, fantasy genre, strategy game called Age of Wonders III.   I had high hopes for this title, as these types of games seem to be few and far between, especially when it come to the game raising the bar and setting a standard for its genre.  I wasn't disappointed at all.  Lets break it down:Graphics: 8 Graphics had lots of detail, varied terrain types and meshes that blended well. Music/Sound Effects/Voice acting 8.5Had a great musical score, character acting was top notch, sound effects and environmentals were good too.Controls 8Controls are actually good.  Small issue with some poorly placed, floating info boxes that interfere with selection choices for hero skills. Gamplay 8This could have been so much higher.  The good part is content: 2 campaigns, each with 2 different endings.  I have put about 50 hours into the first campaign finishing off both endings.  With still another campaign left, it seems there is alot of content to keep you immersed.  The game also features a multiplayer/co op multiplay option (and it aint ""hotseat"").  You can now finally battle it out, with or against your friends, in a 4x game turnbased strategy game.  The bad part is there are some issues.  I started the campaign on normal difficulty and after two or three maps I had to change the setting to easy.  On easy settings it got just as difficult and impossible to complete the last 2 maps without dying a couple dozen times and having to reload the game.  Multiplayer also has issue, infrequent game hangs, and the more frequent friend dropped from game issue.  However, the game allows you to continue with an ai friend or save the game and reload and have your friend rejoin.  Nothing gamebreaking, just a minor annoyance.Overall 8Final thoughtsTriumph Studio was very attentive and  helpful with any issues on launch day.  There are obvious issues that they have noted and promised a quick patch for.  I take it as a good sign if they start pumping out patches before DLC for their game.  There are also gamers who feel the game lacks customization of units or this and that.  I personally feel we have been flooded with sandbox type games, and it has become an expectation that we should be able to create our own game, with the game you give us.  You can create your own custom hero and there is a map maker/editor I have yet to mess with.  With all this to consider, the game doesn't lack, but as any game, can always be improved upon.  Let Triumph get on with the bug fixing, and be patient for the additional content that they promise to work on and deliver.  The game is complete as is and will most likely go down in history as a ""classic"".			"

												I never heard of this game till now. I am a big on this type game mechanics. This game is similar to Civilization with it's turn based style. I'll add a plus on Manual Battle scenario. Although this is my first time playing an Age of Wonders game I can seem myself playing future series. Pros - Like Civilization  - Manual Combat ""as a plus that civ doesn't have"" - Interesting Leaders - Mixed Racial Empire ""Different types of units"" ~well races* - AI don't declare war on you just becauseCons - Requires an account to play online -_- - City Management isn't all to work with - Cities don't have defense protection like civ - Research is pretty wack ""Seems plain""People may diss me, but civ is the only game I can compare this with. Continuing on,  this game is worth playing and I'd recommend this to people who enjoy turn base games and sorts.			"

												This game is absolutely the Real Deal.  A friend and I was a big fan of the Civilization games because we could play together easily and seemlessly, and when we bought this we were a little unsettled at first because we thought it was too good to be true.  15-16 hours later I can honestly say this is one of the finest CO OP, Grand Strategy, RPG games I've ever touched.  So many game elements, unreal replayability, great depth and this isnt even counting possible DLCs in the future.  You'll EASILY get your money's worth in this jewel.			"

												Age of Wonders III is already a very in depth and well made title. With Eternal Lords thrown into the mix. It just seems even better. This title has a laundry list of features, game modes, and more. Going through all the aspects of the game will take you easily more then a hundred hours to fully assimilate. To break it down, Age of Wonders III is a mixture of Civ meets Masters of Magic. You will bring your spell-flinging champion into the fray against other champion leaders. The empire aspects compliment your hero. This 4X title has more of a focus on individual heroes and tactical combat. Ordering your troops around the map isn't enough in this title. You must command them in battle as well. While the combat is optional, to fully experience this title I would suggest it. Simply put Age of Wonders III: Eternal Lords is an impressive accomplishment. For such a small studio. Graphics, music, and design are all top notch here. The only true complaint one could form is the price. While it can be a bit pricey. You will be playing one map for hundreds of turns and then there is there multiplayer, The level editor, and more. Bang for your buck is guaranteed. Along as you enjoy the genre.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												This game is great. I really like that the developers chose the right path, they not only did not move towards contraction but instead they actually introduced lots of new features into the game, which was very risky in the first place, knowing how conservative are fans in such games like AOW, Disciples and HMM. But in reality, compared to Heroes of Might and Magic and especially Disciples, which both went the wrong direction, this game is a masterpiece.The new added features make the game different on the one hand, but also more interesting. I do not want to compare this game to Age of Wonders II, which of course is a living classics, but I can tell that this game has set the bar very high. This is obvious when you look at everything - the picture is amazing, it creates an impression of a beautiful fantasy world - very often I stopped the game in order to look at the map, take a look at the river, mountains, forests, and to look at how my pocket kingdom is doing. The music is great, altough I always consider the Age of Wonders II contained the best soundtrack of all times in games, the compositions of Michiel van den Bos are very powerful, and are used when they are actually needed, very often giving an additional inspiration in difficult battles.I think the best argument which summarizes overall impression of the game is that there is always a wish to let the game go even when the map is already won. This is paradoxical on the one hand, because each map takes very long time to beat, but it was always a part of Age of Wonders gameplay, and compared to the previous games, in my opinion, it feels way faster. There are always so many things to do, do some research, build more buildings, recruit more units, build improvements, and to build new cities... So sometimes I regret that there is no single unified map like it is in Civilization, where you could develop a huge Empire and allow it to stand the test of time - this is perhaps the only bad thing about this game.8.5 / 10			"

												I wish I knew about this game sooner. It incorporates features from Civilization, Total War, and XCOM in a turn-based format.=========================================Pros:I'm just playing single-player so far, but I'm loving the RPG elements of leveling your leader and troops.You can research spells which you can use to cast spells in combat (buffing troops, damaging enemies, etc), or cast spells outside of combat (damaging enemy armies, buffing your cities, etc.)Sieges are well done as far as giving the defender a big advantage, but still making siege weapons useful. Not enough games use these mechanics properly.Each race has it's own pros and cons, and each leader has their own spells and stats, some of which you can influence when they level up. There is a custom leader creator as well which is pretty cool.Great value. Got this game on a -66% Steam sale, absolutely worth the price. Only bought the base game, but in the first hour realized I would enjoy it enough to buy the whole package.=============================================ConsThere is a lot of micro-management, but it's turn-based and similar to Civilization. So if Civ was overwhelming, this may not be the game for you.Battles can be a little tedious because you move and attack with every unit. Also most units have their own spells and ranks, so it's not too horrible. I'm not disliking combat yet, but I can see where some might. There is an auto-resolve option like Total War though.Edit for multiplayer review; highly not recommended. You have to watch every battle as other players complete their battles. There is auto-resolve, but this game is all about tactical battles and it's unplayable like that. However, there is play-by-email and that works fine, so if you don't mind doing that, then it's do-able. Really disappointing, but it's because of gameplay balance. =================================================All in all, if you enjoy Civilization, XCOM, or Total War, then you would probably enjoy this game.Also, that guy who has 100 hours played and still didn't recommend this game, stop being so entitled. That's a great value.			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is definitely the best turn based fantasy Civilization rip-off around. I have a number of competitors and none of them come close to AoW3 in terms of polish, depth, strategy nor fun-level. The learning curve is steep - but you will never feel like your wasting your time.There are a good number of units and races, and then on top of each race is the class, and then the cherry is '13 specialisation trees with Adept / Master grades' (thanks CrUsHeR) so with race and class you end up with like 6² characters, then there is the choice of male or female which doubles that again - this game is huge. Add to that 3 expansions and you're looking at a true Civilization comparable time-waster.Recommended - especially at 20USD / 8.99NZD!			"

												I am having fun. There are a few known issues like pop up screens not appearing at higher resolutions, but nothing game breaking.This is my first AOW game and I like how it reminds me of HOMM3 with playable leveling equipable heroes that can participate (and die) in combat.It has a large leveling and upgradable creature base, a decent town system that allows captured towns to be plundered and adapted to your culture group.The maps are beautiful, hex based, allowing up to 5 adjacent stacks to reinforce and participate in battles.There is an extensive tome (encyclopedia) that is a boon to players providing whatever knowledge you need to learn about playing the game.The campaign is well voice acted, has a decent storyline and a good interface.Overall I am happy with this purchase so far and am looking forward to playing all the types, maps, etc. with my friends.

												At the writing of this review I have just finished one random map on normal difficulty. I had a lot of fun with this game but there are a few things you should know before buying it.This game excel with its tactical combats and it does it very well.  And the game is developed as a war game and the developers made this game around this concept, and you should accept this game as it is, a war game, where you need to carefully maneuver your units on a battle field behind covers, flanking enemies, exploiting enemy's weakness (elemental, armour, speed etc), and the game does it really well, and the ai is also very well done which employ a variety of tactics and is challenging even on normal.Now about what this game isn't. It is not a sophisticated empire builder like Civilization. In fact, because the game is so build around the tactical combats, the designers want you to intelligently maneuver your troops tactically, that you simply cannot win by strategic planning alone. There are no super units that you can simply steam roll through your foes. There are no super spells that will wipe out an entire stack of enemy on the tactical map. It is even hard to win by economy alone because even with one city you can produce a quite powerful army, on standard map the resources are so aboundant that you simply cannot starve a city out.Some people criticize the game because it is not what they expected, a fantasy Civilization game, and you should accept this game as it is, a very well done tactical war game. I really love the presentation of this game, both the visual arts and music are full of imagination and epic. I did encounter a few freezes although they are relatively rare. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.			"

												A fun game which stays true to its precedessors spirit. Although I recommend it hoping it gets better with future balancing patches, this game as of this moment has a huge game balance issue where top tier units are many times stronger than lower tiers without much restraints in place to discourage spamming. Coupled with city build spamming and relatively quick-to-research, cheap, effective spells (like machine in-combat res at only 20 mana cost, really!?), end game becomes boring and tedious.			"

												I miss the variety provided by its predecessor in terms of races and great changes of units from one race to the next. That being said, this game adds its own type of variety with the leader classes, and the game provides a very solid turn based gameplay. The combat is involved, and your leader is an active participant in your conquest. In alot of ways, this game is more akin to a sequel of Age of Wonders 1, than it is a sequel to the more widely popular, AoW: SM. Fun, engaging, and as always, it has the hated feeling of 'one more turn is all I need'.			"

												It is time I give this beast a review.I feel very lame about posting this quite a few years after release.Age of Wonders franchise has always been very dear to me since the first iteration.This review is a critic of the current version of the game, including both expansions.Age of Wonders (1), was a magical title. An epic title.Yes, Epic, is pretty much everywhere nowadays, and quite frankly the new epic is quite ♥♥♥♥.Age of Wonders, wasn't that epic, it was Epic. It was Mechanical and yet it was Ethereal It was made of steam and it was made of scales. It was a smile depicting sadness and a cry reminiscent of joy. It was Air, Fire and Water. And it was the Light that casts the Shadow under the bellows of the Earth. It was shaking but it was cooling. It was carved in chants that resonated among impermeable silences, it all belonged to one mystical place. It was built over a valley, and lead only by its very own fantasies: The Valley of Wonder.Because of characters limitation I decided to post the full review there:http://aow.triumph.net/forums/topic/review-in/ "

 Amazing 4X strategy game which provides great tactical battles and huge variety I recommend this game for any 4X fans who enjoy nice tactical battles/huge variation of everything. I really like the design choice which mixes race and class of the main hero, because this helps to create huge variety of combinations (and of course - many different units to choose from). I'm glad that I started playing this game about 6 months after release, because most of annoying bugs and problems were fixed and corrected. After two expansion unit/tactics/spells variation is really amazing. Each game is different from each other. Graphics and sound are also very solid. After this great experience with Age of Wonders III - I am looking forward to see what Triumph Studios will bring next.Thumbs up!!!			"

												The game is one of those i love and hate. I love the rpg elements of creating a leader, hiring heros, and finding loot. I love the combat system. I love so much about this game! However, I hate that the only acceptable tactic in this game is super aggressive expansion into every buildable tile possible. The fact that their is only a single strategy that can be used to stand a chance is really dissapointing. I mostly turn city building off because of this, and that helps. I mean it is a good game in some ways, and a horrible one in others. The biggest being the lack of depth in the strategy. I can't really recomend this game, but it isn't the worst thing I played. Just needs a new system to limit the rewards for city spamming.			"

												This game is a true spiritual successor to Age of Wonders 2 and Shadow Magic that manages to remain true to and enhance on many things that make Shadow Magic such a timeless classic. One great improvement is the new and improved custom wizard creator, which allows you to make really interesting custom characters and save them to use or play against. One of the big changes is the addition of a class system, each wizard chooses one of seven classes, and some of the classes take over the function of some of the old races (Dark Elves, Undead, Archons, Nomads), for example, Rogues build Shadows and Succubi and can do so for any race, and Necromancers can summon or build a lot of the iconic Undead units, as well as ghoul forms of normal racial units.Each of the seven Wizard Classes contain a variety of unique units and spells and can provide unique upgrades to their armies, each of the nine races has several unique units and a few generic units and can build class units for any class that commands them, in addition wizards can choose from several masteries similar to Spheres of Magic in AoW2 and Shadow Magic, each of which have their own spells and upgrades.Now with the recent surge of mods, it's also possible to customize your experience beyond what normal options allow, with mods that range from allowing custom wizards to wear any armor with any class, to more custom colors for wizards, to more powerful terraforming spells.The game has a slightly greater focus on Hero Units than Shadow Magic did, but that can also be configured in settings if you don't like it. However your wizard doesn't have to sit around in a tower and will gain levels like heroes so it's usually a good idea to take it into fights. The Building Selection is mostly just like in AoW 2 with the main focus of the game remaining on exploration and combat. Patches have added buildings based on resources within a city's domain with a variety of effects, such as unlocking special units, or increasing research speeds. A racial governance system has also been added that allows you to select one of two race wide bonuses with each upgrade.The Diplomacy system is improved in many ways over Age of Wonders 2, but compared to games like Civilization 3 it still falls short, it's impossible to threaten and coerce other Wizards, and the AI is usually unwilling to participate in diplomacy unless it fully sets the terms.There are a variety of game modes, including Play by Email. It's possible to play single player, and to my understanding local host multiplayer without creating a Triumph account, so it's not DRM, but be advised that in order to access all of the achievements and some multiplayer modes you may need to create an online account for some of the multiplayer. Multiplayer probably isn't the main reason you'd want to buy this anyway, but it's worth mentioning.Overall, I can't recommend this game enough, it's my all time favorite game,			"

												Age of Wonders III is an charming game but has too much cut and/or unfinished content to recommend, especially to fans of the older titles in this series, both which were filled to the brim with atmosphere.THE GOOD:- MusicInvigorating tunes that spur you on while you play, great remixes of old tracks while adding in a few new ones as well. Most are of great quality but due to the length of some instances (late-game world map micro-managing or lengthy battle sequences with large armies), the themes can seem to reoccur too often too quickly.- Gameplay (Leader vurnability)While defeat could come easily in Age of Wonder 1 when your leader died to a stray spell, Age of Wonders II made them too persistant with next turn revives and respawning at any city with a Wizard's Tower. Age of wonders 3 perfects this balance by granting the leader some form of revival but at a decent cost. All in all: Leaders are neither vurnable nor near-unkillable like they were in previous games, striking the perfect balance where all tactics can be considered during play to eliminate your opponent.THE BAD:- GraphicsWhile city-scapes during sieges can look amazing and army units are decent enough, there are equal as unpolished or plain bad textures as well. The leaders & heroes are the main offenders here: hair, beards and sometimes armor clipping or looking translucent, clothes or armor clipping through mounts,... Customizing your own leader has been expanded upon graphically, which I can only commend but the sore lack of extensive options makes this but a tiny timewaster rather than anything worthwhile. I confess, this is far more important in an RPG than it is in a TBS, but it looks half-♥♥♥♥♥ nonetheless (example: No skin-tone for Dark Elves whilst the High Elves race is a mixture of both Wood Elves & Dark Elves). Furthermore, while some ingame items equipped to these heroes show up on their avatar and thus offers a nice nod to detail, other items do nothing of the sort. In my opinion, either do all or none of the items lest you create the notion you hadn't the time to bother with them all.Some flying units have issues as well when fighting over lava or water. If the unit in question has an idle stance where it lands itself until ordered, it gets submerged nearly completely in said lava or water. Creating another idle animation when fighting over water or lava could have provided a solution here, as of now it just gnaws at the player's experience.- ContentAge of Wonders 1 had 12 playable races, Age of Wonders 2 had 15 playable races (12 in the original, 3 extra in the expansion), Age of Wonders 3 has 6 of these races. Not only a major plunge in what you can play, but all units feel much the same with different skins. Although each races varies slightly from the standard template (Dwarves have 1 extra defense & resistance but cost 10% more gold to recruit, Orcs suffers -1 ranged damage yet gain +1 melee damage, etc...), none feel as diverse as they were in previous games. While some units do have unique abilities (Elf Unicorn Riders pack the Phase-ability, unique to them), their stats are nearly equal apart from their racial modifier! To me, the varied stats seemed to have a far greater impact in previous installments, contributing to each race's unique style. The only units I currently feel that make a unique impact over its peers are the Orc Greatsword and the Elf Gryphon Rider due to enhanced stats or extra abilities.Next comes the story, spoiler tag inserted:Even though they try to take the story into a new direction, this game only contains 6 or 7 missions per campaign to explain it. Aside from being utterly uninspired with an ending that just oozes: BUY OUR EXPANSION SINCE THIS RESOLVES NOTHING; all of these missions fall into the same tedious category of: ""Build a base from scratch against overwhelming enemy numbers who rarely do anything and sit there until you grind them piece by piece into a pulp."" The last and fifth mission of the Elven campaign are notorious for this in my book. Aside from a few skirmishes into your terrain, they'll just wait until you come to besiege them. A few secrets here and there spruce up the lot, but they are far too minor to sit through hours & hours of same old empire building & grinding the foe to a pulp. Since nearly every mission is played with a different leader as well, don't count on transfering your researched spells over into the next scenario like you did in Age of Wonders 2! In my opinion, endless padding. The only plus was that it forced you to play with many of the classes the game has to offer, daring players to test all it has to offer, albeit not that much. - MultiplayerAs many posts on the Age of Wonder III tech support website indicates, a tremendous amount of players is having issues even making a connection to other players. I had this same issue until I disabled my McAfee software, the ONLY game I must do this for in order to play it online even when adding said game to the exceptions list. Even though the game forwards ports automaticly in the hopes to get a connection going for the owner, I still feel this is a nuissance that could have been avoided or handled in a better way than just stating ""Your router must cause the issue, call your providers to sort it out!"".When you're finally able to get this mode to work, the only feasible tactic to win the game under an hour is to rush your opponent to oblivion. I've played multiple team sessions and Free-For-Alls, all ended in either two scenario's. A: as stated before, players rushed eachother with their starting stack and hoped to have randomly received a summoning spell at the start of the game in order to crush their foe, quiting if they lost too many units along the way. B: People played passively for an hour and then quit the game due to a lack of intrest. In short: Play with friends so you can extend the game past the hour mark or fight it out until the bitter end. There is nothing satisfying about games ending abruptly because one felt it didn't go his or her way.VERDICT:I wanted this game to be good, I truly wished for this as I am a long-time fan of the series. I adored the previous games but with all the issues & disappointments I've encountered here, I cannot urge others to buy, let alone play it. A few more months to expand the content provided would have made this game a worthy addition but for me in its current state: It falls short.I've probably missed a few things here & there, but I hope my review helped you decide if this game is worth your time & money.

												I have recently nominated this game for the Steam 'Just one more turn' award. I have played all the Age of Wonders series. I can honestly say that this is one of my favourite games of all time. There's something about Triumph Studios; they just 'get it' when it comes to these type of games.  As I have stated elsewhere, this game is a remarkable piece of work of which the aforementioned developer should be very proud.Heart-touching.			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is a 4X turn based strategy game, with a fantasy setting. I haven't played the previous games in the series, and I'm not the most knowledgeable gamer when it comes to this genre as a whole. I've played a couple of games each in the Civilization and Total War franchises but not much else. In my non-expert view, AoW3 is a pretty good game, and I've had some fun with it.Most concepts will be familiar to anyone who ever played a similar game. Expand your empire by creating cities, construct buildings to improve things like economy and production, research new technologies, train armies, move them around the world map and then take direct control on the battlefield.AoW3 has a strong emphasis on combat, in fact every victory condition (at least in the campaign mode) is related to conquering your enemies, Total War style. There's no equivalent of Civ's peaceful victory conditions, however if you can create a diplomatic alliance with another faction, you are allowed to win together.This isn't necessarily a complaint, because I like AoW3's battle system. The world map is divided into a hex grid, and each army stack can hold up to 6 units. When you attack, all the units in that hex and the 6 surrounding hexes, will be included in the battle. So the positioning of your armies becomes vital, and with a little tactical planning you can create a numerical advantage before the battle even begins.The battlefield is where the game really comes to life for me, because of the fantasy theme. I love RPGs, so I really enjoyed the use of magic spells and supernatural creatures. There's an amazing variety of units in this game. Of course you've got the standard melee, cavalry and archer units, which function pretty much the same whether they are Human, Elf or Dwarf. But then you can have dragons that fly over castle walls, giants that just bash those walls down, unicorns can teleport behind an enemy, succubus can seduce an enemy to fight for you ... and so much more.Your generals can cast spells to damage or stun the enemy, buff or heal your troops. They can equip loot, better weapons, armour and rings for passive buffs or resistance to elemental damage. They can gain XP and level up where once again, there are dozens of abilities to choose from.The enemy AI is easily the best I've seen in this genre. Playing on normal difficulty, I was frequently punished for my mistakes. If I leave a city undefended, the enemy will capture it. I actually learned the importance of flanking the enemy for bonus damage, by watching the AI constantly doing it to me.This is also the first strategy game that I've played that has a scripted story. Elves and Humans are at war, you can play as either side, and each chapter takes place on a different map. The story branches half way through based on a decision made by the player, and leads to one of three different endings. Dialogue is a mixture of voiced and text. And I must mention that the music is fantastic.It took me 52 hours to complete one side of the campaign. Some of that is because I screwed up the later missions so badly that I had to restart the map and try a different tactic, but still, its long enough to make a full price purchase easily worth it. During all that time I don't recall noticing any bugs (unless you count Goblin Beetle riders ;)).			"

												TL;DR: If you like a fantasy-themed, combat focused, round based X4 go get it. It's a very good game. The Golden Realms and Eternal Lords DLC are highly recommended as well.When I say this a combat focused X4 I mean it - this game is probably focused mostly on the eXpand and eXterminate aspects of the X4 genre. Don't expect any deep dipomacy or city building aspect, it mainly focuses on expanding your empire and overthrowing your enemy. While the addons add additional victory conditions, still the focus is mainly on combat, however it does this very well with an insane amount of depth.Battles are extremly strategic. Positioning and composition of your units matter a lot. Units can be flanked for extra damage, many units retaliate (fight back in melee) if they are attacked, or they do attacks of oppurnity on enemies that run past them. Ranged attacks deal damage depending on range and line of sight. Many units have active abilities often also reflecting the choice in your class (like dreadnaught class, for example engineers class units can reload other class units like cannons or muskeets that could otherwise only fire every two tactical rounds, all units only available to that class).The whole element setup and unit-ability plays a huge role as well. If you defend your city with all archers (which deal physical damage) vs units that have high protection against physical damage, you'll have a hard time if you win at all. Casting spells here might save the day, since they could give your units elemental damage or lower the enemy resistance.Obviously you want to mix up your units so that you a good chance of winning over attackers. When attacking a walled city, you probably want some way to finish off the defeners on the wall, either with spells or possibly with flying units or with units that can climb the walls. Or you choose to simply destroy the walls and then move in. Instead you use units who don't get a penality when shooting up the walls and simply shoot the defenders down. .Cons:* AI, while probably the best I've faced in a RBS 4X so far, suffers from the same problem that it can get rather predictable after a while * End-game can be boring (usually turns into a steamroll/spam fest)* Diplomacy is very basic* Town management, while substantially improved with Golden Realms expansion, is rather basicPros:* runs very smooth (on my system)* visually fitting for the theme and overall very appealing* story and lore is integrated into the game and the classes/units feel very thematic* good music* game includes character customization for your heros* single player campaign while short is pretty good* random maps have a decent amount of settings to customize* AI is compared to other games very capable and can pose a threat (though of course, for a seasoned player you'll figure AI exploits eventually)* modding toolkit/support* classes play very differently and have their own flavour* races also play somewhat differently and come with their own flavour (and strengths/weaknesses)* specalizations allow you to further customize your playstyle* spell castingFantastic:* the class/race/specalization combinations make things highly varied (in particular to games like civ)* RPG deeply integrated - units can level up, the game contains hero which are fully levelable complete with skills and equipment (which can also be found in encounters on the map as well as crafted in cities)* tactical combat - this makes it possible to have very deep and tactical battles that can take a while. Unit placement, unit abilities, spell, everything matters			"

												Solid Turn based strategy game for fans of Heroes of Might and magic and or the lod Age of Wonders Game.Pros:A large variety of heroes and faction combinations accomodate multiple playstyles. Something I always loved about the Age of Wonders game is the magic system. Spells are very strong in this series and  allow for many tactical sheananigans. In this game you can choose how strongly you want to focus on magic or if you'd rather prefer conventional armies.The performance is solid. Little lag and framedrops, though I expierence occasional crashes on my older PC.Cons:The AI, as is often the case in strategy games, is not impressive, especially when it comes to diplomacy.I feel like the balance between factions and heroes could use improvement.All in all, a worthy addition to the Age of Wonders sereis. If you loved shadow magic, then you'll love this too.			"

												Game is great with the expansions, and it actually managed to capture that MoO2 feel for about a week but is marred by a few issues. The AI is bad.  Not terrible, but bad.  Combat is a little simplistic all things considered and feels pretty grindy late game.The simultaneous turn thing was a little weird at first, but it makes much more sense than the alternatives even if creates the illusion of lag.  It also prevents players from being at a disadvantage in a turn due to combat.The game really shines in multiplayer but the AI issue will really leave single players and pure co-op players frustrated eventually, but likely not until they've gotten their moneys worth anyways.

												Heroes of Might and Magic 3 on steroids.More city options, but not too much so you get lost like Civ.Epic full 3D strategic turn-based hex-grid combat.Lots of variety of units and heroes.Lots of spells to research and cast, both combat and strategic, but impact is a bit limited because you can only cast a few spells per combat.A few mildly irritating quirks, but nothing critical.80 hours in so far, and I haven't even finished one campaign yet...9/10			"

												This game does well to represent the past games in the series while bringing it up to date. This is a very well crafted game with nice visuals and fun gameplay. It does have issues with frame rate drops at random and a few bugs here and there, but it's overall well made. Creating a hero is very interesting and deep enough that I have yet to find anyone with the same setup as mine. I hope for future DLC adding in new races including Undead who you can take over and use their forces. The Wraith you can make is my favorite. Highly Recommended.			"

												Pretty much all about the warmongering.Age of Wonders 3 is very much a niche title, even within the 4x game, however, it covers that one niche really well. It's a game about combat, and everything, from the UI, to the city building, to diplomacy itself is entirely in service to the engine of war that this game runs on. Cities are built to build and fund more soldiers. Spells and techs are researched to give an edge in battle or allow you to get more soldiers to bring into battle. Heroes are recruited and trained and killed in the name of war. And they will die, because death comes fast.The game's selection of Races offer little more than stat changes for your units, granting passives and and a few advantages/disadvantages here and there. Elves have better archers, but are weak to poisons. Goblins have poorer stats, but massive innate poison resist. It's not too important, but definately does shift how you play. As elves, you'll snipe from max range often. As draconians, you won't care much about non-lethal incoming damage.Classes, namely leader class, determines far more, from your tech tree to your unique units, taking much of what is traditionally race based in other, less warmongering 4x games. Rogues get access to demons, stealth spells, and plenty of tricks to force enemy cities into open revolt. Theocrats tithe for gold like it's going out of style. Dreadnoughts cover massive areas in fiery death with warmachines that outright immune poison and holy damage, but lack counter-attack ability.Combat is suprisingly quick, due to units being able to destroy eachother in short order. Even levelled heroes are able to be struck down by a few first tier archers focusing fire. As such, mistakes get punished hard.The game has great customization for the genre, letting you tailor your tech tree, your character and diplomacy screen appearance, hero growth, and make custom equipment to fit the situation.In summary: I wholeheartedly suggest picking this game up if you're like me and your games of GalCiv2 or Civ V regularly decend into ""If it moves, kill it."". Age of Wonders 3 simply does warmongering so much better, even if it comes at the cost of alternative victory conditions.			"

												This game is the ♥♥♥♥ right there. No need to say it, but it took the best of AoW 1 and AoW 2, mashed it together and improved the rest of the game. The soundtrack is also a nice nostalgia trip for me too.But a few things need some improvement.-Needs incentives for having an alignment, some design decisions are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You raze a city. You get evil points for it. You settle the ruins of the city. You gain good points for it. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing city that you pillaged to the ground, wiped out their inhabitants and settled the ruins again with your own people. It shouldn't be more 'beneficial' than outright settling the city with members of your own race. It's like rubbing salt on someone's festering wound. How the ♥♥♥♥ would you gain good points for it? Just rebuilding the ruins of the city after you looted and pillaged that city to the ground? -Late game is a whole cluster♥♥♥♥. Everything plays the same way. Above all else, it was fun and I'm just waiting for the inevitable Necromancer DLC. Been dying to try it out to get a feel of it.It's planned that the game would be a lot more moddable than it is. So I'm looking forward to that!			"

												This entry is a fantastic --albeit different-- return to the series. If you want a turn-based high-fantasy strategy game, look no further than AoW.However, I can say without a flinch that if you wanted to truly enjoy Age of Wonders, you should start with the earlier games. As good as this game is, it's nowhere near earlier instalments. No, this is not nostalgia kicking in, I'm actually playing Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic right now, and it has more races, more units (some will tell you AoW 3 has more units, but they'll omit the fact that a decent portion of them are literal copy-pastes).The old games stick to a recognized lore, so you literally will not see Angel Goblins (I'm not kidding, they're called ""exalted"".. the struggle is real), Elvish trolls (""Warbreeds""), and other ridiculous units.Bottom of line, this game is great for what it is, an attempt to revive a highly praised franchise, and although it falls short in many ways, it is still a good game for all it's worth. Fans of AoW will definitely like this entry, while newcomers may shy away from the bizarre setup.Plus, the developers are really trying to appease everyone, and they're constantly supporting and updating the game. They can literally cash in and make a new game with all the updates and DLC they've done, but they chose to support this already existing game. Triumph is no big studio, so this says a lot.Thank you Triumph, this is a good game. Although, we're still hoping for an SM-tier entry. :-)			"

												When I was young I played the original Age of Wonders to death. As i got older I still played it and it became one of my most beloved games. Now while I do have a biased point of view I will tell you this : AOW3 Feels so much like the original is frightening. It seems like Triumph decided to start with the original and flesh out what was good and shave off the bad. I feel that they did a fantastic job making this game exactly what it should be. The overall gameplay makes you think that its a CIV knockoff but after playig it for some time I realized that its just similar, nothing more. I like the overall feel of the game and the only complaint I had was that the screen scrolling seemed quite clunky.I truly think they did a great job making the combat system emulate the original while giving it a unique feel that makes you want more. I'm excited that they kept commander (or leaders) in the game which nearly makes the game a turn based RPG. One of the best additions to this sequel is the ability to create a random map. While random maps are pretty standard now (or should be honestly) it brings a breath of longevity to the game.If you enjoy turn based stragety games that are fun and have dynamic combat this is the game for you. I truly think you'll spend hours enjoying this game and exploring or conquering your own world!			"

												So far I have played 10 hours of this game, and to tell you the truth the game is just gorgeous. I can't believe how much work was put into every single detail. The in game guide makes it so easy to learn what each unit does, and how to use spells correctly that it makes you want to sink in and spend hours and hours just learning. You are able to play whichever way you like. You can conquer, and jump into battles or you can slowly develope and form alliences without having to rush. It is one of those games that makes you appreciate gaming industry, and why we play games in general. As I said before I have only played about 10 hours of the main campaign and so far I have not one complaint.

												This game is CIV 5 but with magic and more movement. Also has little skirmishes whenever you fight something, unlike CIV (You zoom into a little battle, which is entirely identical to DnD but digital). Less focused on economy and city management, more focused on combat, which is perfect for me. If you liked Civ but wanted more combat, buy this. Graphics are lovely, slightly more optomised than CIV. There are ""Heros"" which act as leaders, have extra spells and get an inventory in which to store loot (you get loot from raiding tombs, dungeons and ruins. Such as a musket, a staff, armour or a necklace). Theres a leveling system for all units, so fight with them and they increase in potency, which makes a good deal of effect on combat. There are parts of the game that you breese through, and some that you just get wrecked. Unlike Civ, cities dont fight for themselves, you need to put normal units in them, and any sieges against them are fought by them, with a wall being the advantage given to the defenders. All in all, its a great game. £30 is a bit steep, so you might want to wait for a sale, anything over 10% off would seem like a decent deal to me.			"

												This is my second review, the first one I did not recommend the game. I decided to redo the review as I have spent quite a lot of time playing the game and have grown to really like it a lot. If you approach it without the comparisons with Civilization, then you wont be too disappointed at the lack of victory options, and the diplomacy is very weak. This leaves you with inevitable combat, however it is lots of fun and theres always the option of auto battles. Playing single player on a large world with maximum AI opponents it can be a very long game with lots of things going on. Graphics and sound are top notch, the length of time the AI sometimes takes for its turns can be rather long at times. Highly recommended, dont delay buy today.......			"

												I have mixed feelings on this game.   Ill start by saying that I own all the previous AOW games and have played them through many times and also multiplayer.1. A number of downgraded changes were made from aow 1-2 in the area of gameplay, seemingly in favor of better graphics.2. The sound tracks from the older versions were better, IMO.   Plus the lack of a customizable playlist that existed in all other AOW games bothered me.   I had asked a dev if they could implement the customized playlist like the older games have and they did say they would see if it could be done...3. The change from 8 units to 6 units per army...  I cant say I liked that.   It made the combat less diverse tactical. They ought to have increased to 10.  But this was probably done because of the more intense graphics and in battle animations/particle effects wouldnt allow for good framerates.  More units in a battle would probably make it unplayable except for the best PC's.3. Flying or floating units are no different than any other now.  Basically a unit with wings doesnt actually fly anymore.  I understand why they changed it, but they didnt have to.4. There is a very steep power curve between the different teirs in aow3.  Too steep.  Any lesser units are basically useless later.  In AOW1-2 even a tier 1 unit still had a chance to survive vs a tier 4.  Now? no way.  The power gap is too much, and you only get 6 units per army.  If you could have more it would be economical to bring more cheap units to a battle and only a few expensive ones.  5. The heroes in aow3 are somewhat weaker.  Your armor and resists have a negligible effect.  And your heroes are heavily targeted.  They are most just for show and spellcasting but cant really fight very well.  In aow1-2, your heroes really were heroes.  In this game they are wall flowers...6.  Every time your units get attacked they turn to face the attacker, after the fact. This facing change that happens every time a unit is hit is really dumb.  Your units can be attacked from the rear several times because of it, and it really makes your heroes feel useless when it happens to them and enemies always seem to focus on your heroes too.7. Castle and tower walls are just graphics now.  They are pretty useless for slowing down the attackers and several times I felt that playing defence behind a wall was actually detrimental and did little to stop attacking forces.  In this regard I feel like a good defensive strategy is a moot point.  In aow 1 and 2, seiging a walled city or tower was pretty difficult, as it should be.  You had to build and bring siege weapons in order to get past walls.  There were not many unit types that could climb or fly over walls.  And you needed ranged attacks or your own flying units(or magic/spider webs/druid entangle and other - such diversity that was stripped from aow3...) to deal with flying units. AoW3 just has too may ways for units to circumvent or destroy the walls too quickly and easily. Its like the walls and gates arent even there.  Also in aow1-2 cities had a number of magicaI defenses you could unlock and build.  It really made sieging a city quite an ordeal.  I resorted to using the auto battle instead of torturing myself....8. Magic domains in aow 3 are also another moot point now.  Your leader should not be able to use any magic outside it like it was in aow 1-2.  I feel like this magic domain mechanic is anti AOW, which has always been about wizards and their towers and domains and their armies being powerless outside of them unless the leader or hero was physically present.If you never played an AOW game before, these flaws probably wont be noticable and you might like it.But if your like me, the differences and dumbed down mechanics from aow1-2 will make you not enjoy this game as much as the originals and possibly even regret buyng it.  Ive tried playing through the campaigns twice now, and the story is interesting, but the dumbed down gameplay turns me off and I get tired of it.			"

It can easily co-exist in the same space, it offers a fairly unique experience without sacrificing quality. It's a bit less plodding and quite a lot more awe inspiring.

Short description: for the TL.DR people.   Age of Wonders III is a sequel to the series, having not played the previous I can’t compare it to them. Though the game has a bit of Civilization, Heroes: Might and Magic and some RPG like elements.    What I mean by those is that the game lets you create the empire/leader you wish to have those include:ClassSpeciesGenderTraits   These materials help creates your empire and leader on how you wish to conquer each Age of Wonders III world maps that can also be customizable from how many treasures and mobs to how much of kind of terrain. Even if the World Map is mostly a Vulcanic place but you want to whole world to be Frozen you can do that if your traits correspond to being able to make the lands arctic.    If the world is corrupted you can cleanse it which will put you on the Good Alignment making it easier to be friends with people of the same Alignment, but that also means those that are on the Evil Alignment are going to be your enemies of course.Game Story:   At the start of the game you can either go into Singleplayer Story or Singleplayer Skirmish, the latter means you make up a story as the game proceeds with the Empire and Character you’ve created or chose from a preset before starting the Skirmish.    Now the 1st kind has you choosing from 2Vanilla(“The Elven Court” & “The Commonwealth”) stories and 2DLC(“Eternal Lords” & “Golden Realms”) based stories each unique in its own way and each having a story to tell and show you a world of wonders (pun intended)Scale:GreatGoodDecentNot badBadNopeGame: GoodGraphic: GoodSound: GoodAnimation: GoodAI: DecentGameplay: GoodModding: DecentClarifying the scale:- Graphics    Graphically speaking the game is good to be honest, visually aesthetic and pleasing to look at for longer periods of time well I suppose that depends what kind of Empire you chose to be being an Arctic Empire and staring at the white abyss can be rather too much for people that don’t like that look. Then again you wouldn’t be playing with that if you didn’t like it, each kind of Empire has their own unique look depending on how they chose their traits to be. A Druid will have a very green area filled with forests where as a Necromancer will have a very barren and desolate maybe even corrupted land.    The micro-manage battles look very good when using spells or sending soldiers to fight, those same or other magics that are Empire-wide or World-wide will also have a visible effect in some cases that looks nice. - Sound    The sound is only good because I’ve had a few times where my sound was bugging out and that can be annoying, but other than that the sound is great and as a good fidelity when you take an Archer Unit and order it to shoot at a Machine Unit (usually made of metal/wood) you can hear the arrows hitting that metal/wood. What I mean is that it’s not the same sound for every landing attack.- AI    The AI of the game acts corresponding to their traits and alignment and so far, I have had no issues with the AI doing something out of the ordinary like they would in a Civilization game. Now it is only on Decent because there are some aspects of the AI that could’ve been done better, like if a Good Alignment AI is good that I would expect them to cleanse the land a bit more or an Evil Alignment AI would corrupt.    It could of course also be that I haven’t played enough to be able to see that develop and since I’ve always been either an Arctic or Temperate Empire I would’ve reshaped the land per my own traits.- Gameplay     Gameplay wise the game is easy to understand and get into, although I am still having an issue with combat mechanics, but that’s mostly due to my part of not doing much combat in the game. Other than that, the gameplay is well done, research is required to do anything in the game but if you focus like a maniac on knowledge like I’ve always done you learn everything so fast that by the time I am in mid game I have all the spells, buildings etc. that are within my traits.    An awesome mechanic I’ve liked in the game that besides being able to craft your own gear for your heroes/leader you can also do World Quests well they are called Empire but since all Empires participate I find it more appropriate to call them that World Quests.    Each one of those has a goal and a reward the first Empire to complete that goal will receive a reward it can be anything from a Unit to an Empire-wide buff.There are so many more things I could be saying in this clarification of the Gameplay, but I will leave that for discovery, I am just giving a “small preview”.- Modding The area is Decent because I’ve looked at some of the mods in the workshop and they look good, but I’ve never personally tried mods in this game since I’ve still yet to finish all the achievements and stories of the game so before that I will stay away from mods.Conclusion: for the TL.DR people   This game to me at least is a gem in the rough and worth picking up it’s not often I find a game that I like the style of just by looking at it, this one was one of them and I had it on my Wishlist for a while before I decide to say best way to find out if I like it is to try it and I did and I liked it.   If you like(d) Heroes: Might and Magic series, Civilization series and/or you want some RPG elements in your RTS/TBS games like say being able to decide what kind of leader to have or what kind traits you want you Empire to have and can specify then this is something you should at least consider it. Speaking from my own point of view, it was not time wasted it was everything I liked put into one game.			"

												Love this game.  Reminds me a lot of the old Warlords series.   Get a hero, build units, create a stack and then go conquer.  But there is more complexity then just that.  If you like 4x, turn based strategy games like the Endless series, then you will probably like this game.   The only con (if you can call it that) is the slow paceing.  Games progress very slowly.  Large maps can take forever.  However it is fun, so I forgive it for being a major time suck.			"

												Bought this game years ago expecting a fantasy civ, something that I'm still struggling to find today. It's really not though.Instead, it's a very fast paced, turn-based strategy with an emphasis on exploration and combat rather than economy and diplomacy.Think of it more of a fantasy, turn-based total war and, if you like the thought, you will be very satisfied playing this game. Highly suggested.			"

												This game is brilliant.  If you're looking for a fantasy 4x with a military/tactics focus, this game takes the cake.  Economy management is extremely simple compared to Civ5 or other 4x games so if that's your interest I'd look elsewhere.  However the unit diversity, spells, and tactical battles of this game are unmatched.  The assymetrical balance via combinations of starting race and leader class really makes for truly epic dynamic compared to the copy pasted civilizations featured in other games.  Playing a Dreadnaught (engineer) leader is a whole different ball game from playing a Druid or a Theurgist.  Seeing a battlefield of up to 42 units strewn with one army of cannons, tanks, and musket men standing on a city wall vs an army of shaman and summoned beasts set to a wonderful backdrop of a massive rising city scape really brings the game to life.Worth every penny.

												Can't recommend this game but it may be, at least in part, due to how I play this type of game. When I play a 4X game, campaign mode in particular, I want to be able to enjoy the setting. I want to build my cities, armies, and empire. This game is just a xenophobic sprint to tier 4 units. If you sit back at all the AI will crush you. On normal, the AI has numerous bonuses to everything and starts to send steamroll armies at you while you are still trying to enjoy setting up your empire. If you want to progress then you have to rush as fast as possible, save often, and dump all hero points into defense.Scenario is more of the same from an AI perspective. Diplomacy is pointless and random. The AI leaders remind me of Ralph Wiggum: ""I'm HAPPY AND ANGRY"".In short, not a terrible game but there are better 4X games out there to spend my money and time on.			"

												One of the best strategy games ever! Unlike Civ 5, Age of Wonders has tactical combat (rather than running two units into eachother), vastly differing classes supported by moderately different races, and NO PUNISHMENT FOR EXPANSION!!! Additionally, Age of Wonders is much faster paced and more centered on elite forces (heroes, champion units, etc.) than Civilizations, leading to a greater investment in specific armies and their powerful commanders. Expand, build armies, and WRECK your friends!			"

												Ok so, off the bat. I have not played the first two games to be able to compare it to them.Other TBS I have played are Heroes,Fallen Enchantress and something else that I can't quite remember the name of.ANYWAY. I brought this on a whim after getting tired of Fallen Enchantress and needing a game to keep me occupied before the next borderlands came out. (At time of writing). The idea behind i'd pick up something that wouldnt keep me too hooked and I could just put down...just put down...This game is addicting, the first TBS in a LONG time to give me the ""just one more turn"" feeling. I will not be putting this game down anytime soon. I'm not one for long winded reviews so i'm going to do a good old Positive & negative list.Positive:- A TBS game with an actual interesting story! (achivement in itself)-Fun to play-Beautiful art style and game, each race and unit looks fantastic.-Create-a-hero-Combat that makes you think (well me anyway..)-Brilliant system to learn mechanics, can simply type in a term to the in game Book that helps you and get brilliant explanation.Negative:- Well err....- Hmm...- Kinda wish you could zoom in a bit further.. but this is nitpicking as it's fine as it is..- Other TBS games I was looking at look really dull since I played this?  Is this even a thing? Probably bad for others but hmm..TLDR: Buy now, must have.			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is not a game like Civilizations. They share things in common but the troop lineup is ripped straight from typical RTS games. AoW3 is a turn-based RTS complete with base building, buying stables to produce cavalry, buffing the units with upgrades and tech research (which takes time to build just as it does in an RTS) and spamming your favorite units across the map as early as possible.You'll explore tons of treasure sites, find optimal places to build a new base, and wrack up tons of experience and artifacts for your heroes. In that sense it's a competitive PVE game since optional autobattles and economy management can make the game about who has the stronger army as opposed to the smarter tactics. Units move extremely fast across the map unlike Civ and you can have your enemy's army invisible and at your doorstep without warning. Hope you left some defenders or you just lost your capital.Base rushing, expansion, tech research, build order, unit synergy, all important RTS elements and brought here for your amusement. Spy on the enemy with scouts to find out what he's building then build the perfect counter units that are essentially invincible against that type of enemy. Best part is that if you play for a VERY long time you will eventually get access to every race in the game by conquering neutral cities. So you can design your ideal endgame army and semi-reliably get it every game as long as you explored enough to find the right cities.If you played Heroes of Might and Magic then you know the drill.  Awesome game!			"

												Very enjoyable 4x strategy game. The single player is fantastic. The customization to your leader is enjoyable and fairly in-depth, as much as something like Fallen Enchantress. The combat is more enjoyable than most other 4x games. The multiplayer is a bit laggy and simeltanious turns + timers makes taking your turn really hectic but with patient players and classic turn style the multiplayer is fantastic, if not slow paced.

												Domination is the name of the game, and luckily this game does that very well. If you are looking for complex building or research options, vast diplomacy networks and interactions.. then this is not the game for you. But if you are looking for fantastic, highly tactical turn-based combat in a good fantasy setting then Age of Wonders 3 is going to satisfy your needs. The strategic map has great detail and a real sense of atmosphere (the music certainly helps out a lot in this endeavor), and there are plenty of combat maps that have a beautiful layout. Unfortunately, siege maps lack variation (you will be fighting on these the most) but beyond that this game does conquest incredibly well. Classes feel distinct and allow you to focus on your own playstyle, maps offer a lot of freedom and with two decent campaigns, scenarios and a good random map generator there is plenty for you to try out.

												I've spent several days and many hours, trying to give this game a try.Despite all complaints on Tier4 spam, I tried really hard to just enjoy the gameplay. But... What to say... a game with great potential but DEVASTATED by itself, or should I rather say by developers. Simply unplayable, unless the game creators do something to bring at least some ballance there.Going for a battle: 3 armies versu 3 armies, and seeing 15 Manticore Riders all together on the other side (or even more!!!) is just NOT FUN. And just after another 10-15 minutes, another 6-pack of Manticores arriving, and so on, and on... All other units except Tier4, become simply obsolete and useless after just 1-2 hours of playing...Would love to enjoy AoW:3, but simply cannot. Will not play it anymore, unless something is going to be done with Tier4....Please, make the Tier4 a centerpiece of army - one (1) per stack allowance would have been just perfect. For the moment Tier4 units are just pests, spoiling this beautiful game...			"

This has it all.Back in the day *rolls eys* I played the previous two and they were good for their time but this latest offering is fantastic.Depth? It's practically bottomless, especially with all the mods available from the Steam Workshop.The AI always has a trick up it's sleeve to stop you getting complacent and too big for your boots.I have over 300 hours on record. I keep coming back to it. This is one of my mainstays along with Total War Rome II and the Civ series, games I just keep coming back to.You could wait for it to come up on some sort of reduced price deal, but why wait? If you're a TBS gamer this is worth every penny of the full asking price.I shall say again.........BUY THIS GAME!			"

												Pretty alright for what it sets out to do. It's like Heroes of Might & Magic meets Civilization meets a big bag of crack cocaine. Great visuals and aesthetics. Combat is fun; a lot of depth lies in unit choice to compose units but actual combat feels insultingly shallow with most abilities being 'damage enemy' or 'heal ally'. Empire building is quite fun, the exploration aspect is wonderful, the hero level-up is fairly detailed. The create-a-character could use more options but it's par. The sounds, music, etc is good. Balance can be fairly topsy-turvy with most strategies being 'spam the ♥♥♥♥ out of your biggest units and butt♥♥♥♥ the enemy'. AI and Diplomacy need serious work -- very, very serious work. When your diplomacy system is actually worse than Civ 5 BNW's, you have an issue. All in all 8/10; you'll get anywhere from 10 to 40 hours out of it.			"

												Undeniably one of the best Turn Based Strategy games and a true sequel to its estabilished franchise while at the same displaying a lot of maturity with its newly introduced mechanics.Age of Wonders 3 takes the best of all its predecessors and builds upon them instead of shoving new gimmicks in hopes of keeping things interesting.

Even with the humongous number of abilities that each unit has all of them are finely interwoven with the estabilished systems of attack, defense and morale. The reduction of uncertainess that previous games had also opened venues to dozens of other tactics and created a wonderful balance between all units. No one strategy is unbeatable.What shortcomings this game had after launch have been fixed with balance updates and the expansions, all due to carefully listening and considering the feedback given by the community.

												One of the most amazing games I've played of late, whether playing classic (one player takes his/her turn and passes it on to the next player) or simultaneous turns, the different feel it gives to the strategy genre works particularly well from my standpoint. With classic, it will allow me and others I play with the ability to play what feels like a virtual game of chess. This while being able to enjoy the luxury of a lore filled world and roleplay a large number of different wizards, strategists or great leaders from a graceful 'tree hugging' elf to a dirty scheming goblin. An ideal game for the fantasy enthusiast for sure.			"

												Without doubt my favourite turn based fantasy strategy game on the market. For those who recall Master of Magic, Triumph Studios have recaptured the wonder of that game and brought it into the modern era. The tactical battle system is in particular a pleasure to play and hasn't got old no matter how many battles I have fought in the process of raising my empire to pre-eminence.			"

												In Short:PROS: -great gameplay -high replayability -very good multiplayer -easy to get into, hard to master -low price -frequent updates (it looks this way so far)-good balance-a lot of customization-nice graphics-beautiful musicCons:-relatively long games (not for the genre)-not that many people playing multiplayer-rather bad tutorial-not the most challenging AI (for veterans of the genre)This game is a steal! I bought my steam digital download version for 75PLN (about $25) and if you look online you can by it this cheap pretty much anywhere in the world. For this price you get a brand new game with 2 campaigns, each with 6 missions + 1 for alternative choices made. I would say this is easily 40 hours of gameplay, at least. Then you also have scenarios and endless possibilities with random map generator.The game is complex, but easier to get into than the likes of Europa Universalis, Total War, or even Civilization series. At the same time it offers plenty to more seasoned TBS and 4X players. It's different than almost anything else on the market. People compare this game to HoM&M, Civ, and Total War, but while it includes elements of all these games, it's still something totally different.If you enjoy 4X games, you should definitely try it. If you like TBSs in general you might want to give it a go. If all HoM&M titles after HoM&M 3 (and maybe 4) disappointed you, buy this game!For anyone who likes Civ, Gal Civ, HoM&M series this should be a definitve buy. People who like Paradox games should also consider it.The random map generator in this game is like nothing I have ever seen before. The number of options is mind blowing. You can customize the number of cities, their size, number of treasures, resource, visit structures, starting army sizes, and much more.There's plenty of strategy involved and enough variety to keep you playing for many hours. 6 classes, 6 races, and 14 specializations to choose from means you get to try out new things almost every game.And finally, the multiplayer. I don't know how 4X games could have existed without simultaneous turns. I used to play some with classic turns and it was a thrill, but it also dragged on way too long and I would never play with strangers for this very reason. Here you can start a small map 1 vs 1 game with smallest starting cities and medium armies and finish it in about half an hour, it that's your cup of tee. You can still play epic large map games with mutiple opponents and save your sessions, in this case too, the simultaneous turns option will vastly speed up the game. I was worried about using this over the classic turns, but it works like a charm, I use it even against the AI, there's hardly any reason not to.Buy this game! Even if you have never played 4X games before. This is a good game for beginners too and at this price it is worth giving it a go. The support for the game is amazing, the forums are very helpful and best of all there is more content to come in the form of dlcs and expansions, which are likely to feature new playable races, new scenarios, and maybe new campaigns			"

												An excellent tactical wargame. It plays like a combination of Might & Magic and Civilization, however it differs significantly from the both of them.First off: do not be fooled, Civilization fans. If you're looking for a fantasy equivalent of Civilization, this isn't going to perfectly scratch that itch. While it does have highly customizable kingdoms (with races and themes to pick from - steampunk elves and druidic dwarves are both possible, for example), the kingdoms themselves serve no purpose except to produce combat units. There is no need to improve tiles, and while civilization happiness is a factor, it's generally not an issue unless enemy empires start using magic to lower happiness within your cities. The biggest thing that hampers it from being 'fantasy Civ' however, is that there is no tech tree and there are no victory conditions other than to defeat your enemies, or attempt to form an Alliance between them.That said, if you were the sort of Civilization player who preferred scrapping with barbarian tribes and winning the game through domination of your enemies, this game may actually end up being a better alternative. It plays similarly to Civilization V, but it is entirely a wargame. It provides roaming bands of monsters to fight, and small dungeons to explore with your army and recover magical items to equip your heroes with. The independant cities (this game's version of City-States from Civ V) provide quests which can give magical item rewards, and can even reward you with joining your empire, giving you access to unique units such as fey and giants.The game turns into a Might & Magic-esque tactical RPG when in combat, providing a large grid with terrain to utilize for cover and flanking. Might & Magic players should be happy with what is provided here, though they should keep in mind that battlefields are typically much larger than the chessboard-esque M&M battlefields. Army sizes are also typically much smaller, with most engagements having no more than six units on either side. Only city battles can exceed this limit.I highly recommend this game to M&M fans, fans of tactical RPGs, and fans of Civilization who enjoy the Domination victory condition. However, Civ players who enjoy nonviolent victory conditions should look elsewhere.			"

												I keep trying to write a succinct review, but can't. So here's a short thought:AoWIII is amazing. I was wary at first, but now I'm absolutely sold. The tactical battles are astounding - I used to always use quick battle in the old games, but I always do tactical in AoWIII. The world looks beautiful. I love the introduction of RPG elements, meaning that you can design your leader, pick a race, a class, and your alignment changes depending on your actions in the game.I could write everything here, but it'd go on forever. Just know that this is a great game.If you've played and enjoyed any of the previous AoW, do yourself a favor and grab this.			"

												I bought this game expecting the wrong things.  I wanted a 4x that focused on empire building set in a fantasy world, but this is much more focused on combat.  It is entirely my fault for not looking further into the title, but this is still a fair warning to those looking into purchasing this game.What is does offer is very good, though.  Everything else is well thought out.  Exploring is interesting because of the random dungeons and camps spread throughout, the AI is serviceable, and the simple hex-based tactical combat is actually pretty fun.  It just wasn't my cup of tea in the end, as I wasn't a big fan of HOMM games, but I can respect it for what it is and would recommend to people who are into this type of 4x gameplay.			"

												I played the first AoW religiously when it came out all those years ago. I never had the hardware to run the second one when it came out, but I was excited to find that a third iteration was in the works. Although I feel the depth of the game has been lost a bit, there are fewer units, and picking a race doesn’t really feel special anymore as many share the same unit pool (just with the obvious racial twist and visuals) I feel the game is still well worth the money paid. It is a polished game without bugs, the visuals are stunning, and the developers seem to show an interest in adding content through patches as the time goes on.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of this genre. There are many hours of enjoyment to be had with this title.			"

												A good game to start with! but the DLC? ITS A FANTASTIC GAME! Age of wonders 3 is a 4x game crossed with an rpg. the lead your armys with your hero equiping new gear and leveling up, through dungeons or simply all out war. you can of course take the peaceful approach and build up your empire.WAR IS THE BEST OPTION (in the base game).The dlcs add more options for peace, aswell as new ways to build your economy and eventually be come a deity for a race. or become their worst night mare! Before each game you must choose : race, class, and speciallisations.RACE-like any rpg each races has areas they like to live in and different perks.CLASS-decides your perks, late-game units, spells, and upgrades each class counters another class.SPECIALLISATIONS-you can choose 3, they add different spells and sometimes units-each one has a different affects on playstyles. some encourage being good others evil but most neutral.in terms of empire bulding it IS a bit simple,but dlc DO improve with more options for building your cities. you get more buildings based off of what in in your territory.All in all tho its a great game! sure war will be likely be inevatible, but you can win by becoming a deity of several races and building a beacan of peace. there are options for lots of different playstyles!. Play it now! choose your lord! find your own path! may it be peace or a bloody war-path cutting down cities like they were grass.			"

												Pretty alright for what it sets out to do. It's like Heroes of Might & Magic meets Civilization meets a big bag of crack cocaine. Great visuals and aesthetics. Combat is fun; a lot of depth lies in unit choice to compose units but actual combat feels insultingly shallow with most abilities being 'damage enemy' or 'heal ally'. Empire building is quite fun, the exploration aspect is wonderful, the hero level-up is fairly detailed. The create-a-character could use more options but it's par. The sounds, music, etc is good. Balance can be fairly topsy-turvy with most strategies being 'spam the ♥♥♥♥ out of your biggest units and butt♥♥♥♥ the enemy'. AI and Diplomacy need serious work -- very, very serious work. When your diplomacy system is actually worse than Civ 5 BNW's, you have an issue. All in all 8/10; you'll get anywhere from 10 to 40 hours out of it.			"

												This is an Excelent 4x Fantasy Strategy game.  The Strategic and Tactical AI should be the gold-standard for any other 4x game.  Over the years I have aruged with people about how shity the AI is (I am looking at you Warlock Master of the Arcane) and people just tell me it is not possible.  This game disproves that.  Its not smarter than a human, but it is sneaky and doesn't make the same stupid mistakes you see happeing on other games.  I definitly reccomend it if you liked Master of Magic / Warlock or want a fantasy civ like game.There is a downside though:  The diplomatic AI makes no sense and seems totally broken at the time I wrote this review.  It is the only big stain on this game. "

												I really like this game and I think it's underrated. It consists of two parts; strategic world map and turn-based battles. I'll briefly explain each one here. There's a campaign mode which is fun but my favourite part of the game is the random map which you can customize the hell out of. There's an incredible amount of options for you to customize your own skirmish game. You can have a very short one with a small map, with huge amounts of resources and starting with large armies, or you can have a large map with lots of civilizations, slow research times, few starting resources (and few resources on the map) and so forth. You can even customize the terrain if you want to take the time, so there are a lot of options to suit your fancy.You'll choose a race (human, orc, goblin, elf, etc.) and a class (warlord, theocrat, dradnought, sorcerer, etc) for your civilization. Each race has specific strengths and weaknesses and each class is very very different. A warlord civilization for example are focused on strong conventional armies, a dreadnought civilizationis focused on industry and powerful siege engines, a sorcerer civilization is magic based and so on. Your starting hero (which is like a leader of your overall civ and can be used as a general in your armies) will determine the class of your civilization, so choosing a warlord hero will make your civilization a warlord civ, but you can recruit other heroes of other classes as the game progresses.World map - this part of the game is very much like Civilization V and is wonderfully simple and easy to learn. You'll begin with a settler (or a city depending on what options you chose to start with) and your settler will set up your first city, you can choose where. Cities produce gold, production and mana resources and you can build city upgrades and recruit units from them. There are resource structures on the map and if they are inside your city's borders then they give bonuses to gold, production, mana or research. Gold is used to build upgrades in your cities, recruit units and has some functions in diplomacy (yes there's diplomacy with independent cities and other civs), production is very simple - if your city is producing 20 production and a barracks takes 100 production to build, you'll build it in 5 turns. Mana is used to cast spells and knowledge works like production except it's used to research new spells/technologies. Your cities also produce population and grow from small villages to huge metropolises. There's happiness and allignment too - if a city is happy they will throw a party in honour of you which nets you some gold, and alignment is good and evil (and neutral) and is affected by things you do on the map, such as attacking independent cities or letting enemies run when they don't want to fight you. The strategic map is also quite beautiful. Think of it as Civilization V with a fantasy, Lord of the Rings-type feel to it.The other part of the game is the battle map. You create your armies on the strategic map and when they meet enemies the game loads the battle map. The battle map is turn based and hex based with flanking penalties. You have a variety of units to command, each with very different skills (like necromancers that can raise the dead to fight for you and curse enemies) and your hero can cast spells that he/she has learned. It's all quite easy to learn but takes a bit of time to master.As I said I think this game is underrated and it's definitely worth buying if you like 4X type games.			"

												Pros and cons at the bottomshort version:This game is the best turn based strategy game i have ever played (i have played a lot of them). I have hundreds of hours in offline play on this one. If you like fully customizable heroes (very very customizable, almost rpg like), deep tech trees and xp earning units that end up forming an elite guard in your army or gets thrown away as cannon fodder just to be replaced with more, then this game is a must. Graphics are good, gameplay is very good and music is absolutely excellent.Longer version:This just might be the best turn based strategy game of all time, rivalling the likes of Heroes of might and magic 3 and warlords 2. AOW series can be described as being a mix of those two games series as this game features city specific tech trees, hero classses and races, fully customizeable heroes, global and tactical spells, xp for all units and heroes, income and upkeep, tactical battles, heroless armies, quests, random events and the list goes on for pages. The campaign story rocks from the very first game in the series and no less in the last. Scenarios feel like mini campaings and the map generator works very well. Races and classes have clear different feels to them and are well balanced with the option to build some badass heroes and armies.An example is the match between the rogue class and the dreadnaught class, one is based on nimble movement and cruel backstabs while the other is based on mass destruction by steamdriven warmachines. The AOE from the dreadnaughts death macines would prove unbeatable for the light, but fast rogue units if not for their scoundrels ability to sprint through the incoming fire and sabotage those same engines causing tremendous damage. There is no such thing as a fair fight against a rogue and so such thing as a casualty free battle against dreadnaughts.This is an immersive fantasy strategy game with deep tactics and rock, paper, scissor counters with near endless options for combination and no two games need look alike. The fantasy setting and campaing story with a red line going from the very first release in the series to the last of the DLC (which btw is well worth the purchase on sale if youre short on cash). Your hero pick up where you left him in every mission of the campaign making you increasingly badass and without any linear progression as it is entirely up to the player how to build him or her.Pros:-Game is awesome-Very good campaigns with thorough and exciting tutorial elements in the start-Turnbased with simultaneous play options with the turn ending when all players press end-Music (really).-You will never try all combinations of races, classes and hero skills nor will you want to stop trying.-So customizable that style and taste comes into play.-Deep morale system and buff/debuff.-Alignment (good/evil/neutral) is earned in every game by actions.-Unit alignments.-Race relations and specific faction relations also mostly earned.-Can be played in ""simple"" mode by making easy setups and disabling things.-Great campaign with red line from the very first game, without it being a requirement that you have played the earlier games.-Very dynamic once you get the hang of how to do things properly.-The little things does matter, they make up the balance which allows deeper undestanding for better tactics.-Has settler mode with empty maps where the empires have to be built from scratch.-Have a ton of modes and random events and basically endless things that can make every single game significantly different even on the same map.-Sometimes trying that thing you didnt think worked turns out to work very well and continues to surprise and reward creativity-Has many good scenarios which play out like small campaigns-Classes and races have very different, but balanced, strengths allowing any well executed approach to work effectively.Cons:-Very large maps can accumulate a little too much management for some peoples taste, though it can be circumvented by teching and planning well (making 5 dragons instead of 50 footmen, less units is less management).-Did not release a sequel the minute i finished the campaign (making me wait, like why?)-Can be confusing if you try to understand everything at first, play the first campaign first which turns this into a pro-Some classes like Rogue or Sorceror/Sorceress can be a hazzle to fight if you dont force the fight onto your terms and instead let them harass you, this can be a pro if you like being that one ;)			"

												Age of Wonders III is my favourite strategy game for a couple of simple reasons:1: it has the best tactical combat.2: it has great strategic play, where you need to decide what your priorities are and when to engage.3: the whole is greater than the parts. The strategic and tactical parts of the game complement each other greatly.This game is focused on strategy and combat. Everything relates to that, from empire building to leveling your heroes. But don't be afraid, it may be a lot of combat all the time, but the combat is deep enough to be different every time. The game's classes offer you many distinct flavours on how you run your empire, on what kind of army you build, on how your strategies play out. Some classes are more mobile, some classes are better at annoying others, some classes are better at simply building up. The difference does not lie in whether they have units to wage war with, the difference lies in how strong those units are, how they reinforce your armies, how your spells reinforce your armies and wether the class is better at direct battles or sneaking past the front lines.A bit about empire building: this game is not civilization. The way you develop your cities is not based on what research you unlock and there are NOT a hundred different buildings to choose from. Instead, your building decisions are based on what units you want to unlock, what resources you need more of and how many units you need right NOW. At first, empire building will seem simple compared to other 4x games, but it ties in very well with the other parts of the game.Dislaimer: I am a total fanboy. I've been part of closed beta testing and met the developers.Warning: This game has ruined tactical role playing games for me. It has ruined other strategy game tactical combat for me. I find those boring just because I'm used to AoWIII.			"

												For those familiar with the Age of Wonders series, this game is definitely worth playing. The game will immediately feel familiar, while new game mechanics do not feel forced in. Overall, each race still plays like their predecessors, but each leader type will put a twist on your force composition.If you are new to Age of Wonders, this is a Turn Based Strategy game that is based on a series that has been around for some time. Age of Wonders III is similar (but superior) to games like Disciples, and Heroes of Might and Magic. Other similar titles would include Warlock, and Fallen Enchantress. The basics of it are you build an army, learn new spells, and march your gathered army to victory. On the main map, you can cast spells to help you and your allies or hinder your foes. You can explore the map for powerful items to equip your leader and heroes with. When you fight another army you switch to a tactical battle mode. Here, you will command your troops individually, and you are also able to cast magic to aid them.This is not a fast paced game, and larger maps can take a long time to finish. There are some minor issues, such as AI Diplomacy being touchy, however this game excels at Multiplayer as its previous iterations have. The campaign allows you to play both sides of the main conflict, and the achievements allude to 2 endings per side.			"

												I haven't played Endless legend, but both of these games seemed similar and I had the choice between them. After some research: the basic difference is probably that Endless Legend is closer to Civilization/ Warlock, and Age of wonders is closer to Heroes of Might and magic.Age of wonders is a well done 4X game with combat reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic, but more strategic depth and world-strategy elements such as city building.Overall a great game, although the campaign story feels a bit 'meh'... it is basically a set of missions with each class so you can get used to it's strengths and weaknesses.  Multiplayer contains a lot of cheese or strong strats, but if you know what's possible it becomes a fun challenge to play around your opponent.Learning the game properly takes a while, there are a lof of mechanics that only make sense when you research them.

												 The game is pretty much like Heroes 4 and 5 mix. Some aspects of it are even better. You actually have armies instead ofnumbers to represent them. The battlefield forces you to think and actually create strategies to get the optimal casualties.Not linear and doesn't get repetitive i can say. Still full price is a lot but definately worth on sale. I grabbed it %75 off zeroregrets and absolutely endless potential to sink hours to it. "

												First thing, I highly recommend you try one of the previous games to see if you like AOW's take on 4x games before you take the plunge. I've enjoyed this game very much. The tactical battles could be better. I find myself skipping through them sometimes even if i'm not playing multiplayer but they are more exciting than I've seen in any other game of this genre (except maybe legendary heroes). The overworld strategic elements are diverse and engaging.			"

												This game is wonderful. It has some things which could be better like possibility to build mines, farms etc. But it is better than AoW 2 like AoW 2 was better than AoW 1.Advantages:- great imperia atmosphere,- but first you must build this empire,- sometimes from begining,- in random game, in some cases it can be not easy,- but it can be easy,- you have many options diplomaic option,- also to avoid use military power to conquer smaller cities,- but if you dont like, you don't have to use diplomacy,- you can build imerial infrastrucuture (roads and... bridges!),- which will make your empire much stronger for defending it,- but without it you can play welll too,- sometimes faster actions can be also better than build infrastructure,- playing as evils is always more dificult than playing as good emperor like it should be in real,etc.Disadvantages:- short cmaign (but good),- a few options to build on stratgic map (roads, bridges (!), forst, watchtowers, cities),- there are modding software but without tutorials, I would like to make builder possible to build mines and farms! ;-)- bridges should be longer than one hex and should join to ""one"" if you build more than one in line.My subjective rate: 10/10(I very, very like game)P.S. If You want to build bridge, your buildier must have not to little moving points. River must be not wider than 1 hex in directionwhich you want to build bridge, also on next edge, it musn'y be mountains, other buildings and generaly I think nothing. And click ON the WATER not on the next edge. "

												This is not a Civilization V with magic around it, and before buying this game you should have this in mind. he city managing part id far too simple. You cannot modify the environment around it, all what is left is to choose which building or unit will be next, and if you will use a special resource. It is really a sad point, because everything is ready in the game to do this, so it is obviously a game design choice. Amateurs of city builder will not find this enough. Actually almost everything is focused around the combat. When enemy units meet, you can choose to resolve automatically or manually. If you choose manually, you then have a turn-based hexagon grid where you deploy your units, and where the deployment zones are functions of the relative locations o the units on the main map when the encounter started. This is not the big thing, but a nice idea. For the rest of the fight, it is dejà vu, so I will not go in details. But if you liked Heroes of Might & Magic, you get a lite version of the fighting encounter. In the long run it gets repetitive.You've got a campaign, which without being a paragon of originality is not bad at all.The graphics or the main map, are really nice, and the game runs without problems on Linux.It is hard to either recommend or not this game. I would have preferred a game more about management, but that said, it is not a bad game. If you like turn-based hex-grid battles in a fantasy world, you're a future customer.			"

												Feels truly faithful to old Age of Wonders games, and is not a bug ridden mess like some other turn based games tend to be. The AI could surely be smarter, and it would be nice if towards the end of a long game, there was some actual use for lower tier units. But, that's about it for the negative things I can say of this game. The gameplay itself is otherwise brilliant and the game truly shines when played with your friends.			"

												Took a little bit to get into, but after ~10 hours, I began to understand the game and started to really enjoy it.  It was touch and go for a while.  Tactics in battle are the games center and strong point.  MP is slow moving, but you can do so much stuff out of game, while your frien-emies are taking their turn.  You can pick it up on a sale for less than $10, a steal really.  If you get into it pick up Eternal Lords DLC.			"

												I played AOW2 frequently in my younger years. Though it has fewer races, there is a greater variety in leaders. So far I'm greatly enjoying the game. Between the Leaders and Races there are 36 combonations to choose from. Thats not even factoring in the spheres of magic.One warning. This game will murder your time. Not in an honorable way either. Most games murder your time face-to-face. Letting you know that it is slipping away. With this game, it waits until your time is asleep then smothers it with a pillow. You never see it coming. You look at the clock and it says 12:00, you look after what you feel is two hours and it still says 12:00. A closer look shows that it went from PM to AM. I bought a copy for my friend so he could experience time travel too.			"

												I am... Bitterly dissapointed in many aspects of the game, having come from a group that used to LAN this game quite often. Mostly this is because they have overhauled the wizard/player setup and the research tree into abominations (but there are other things, like how armies are 6 stack, instead of 8 from the previous). There are also a few persistant bugs that still need to be fixed (some units on huge maps sometimes don't renew their movement points after turns are set, and a few other somewhat minor things).I've put in some 130+ hours or so on it already, and I see myself putting more into it. The campaign isn't really all that in my opinion, but I never played this series primarily for the campaign. If you can get 3 or more friends (and half a day) to play with you on a small-medium map, this game is great. If you can get them to play multiple sessions, going on a larger map is better.That being said, I can't help but say that while it is only worth getting the game while it is on sale, it IS worth getting eventually. Especially if you can get friends in on it.			"

												If you are a fan of the classic AoW games, this one may disappoint you a bit, especially if you are only interested in the Campaign mode and story. The storyline finishes before even you warm up. You can't bring your best levelled-up units to next level, which is why I bought this game in the first place. That was what made AoW awesome. You used try to keep units alive and level them up so you can take them to the next level. A huge disappointment for me.			"

												I'm going to start off this review with a couple of things:I've never played AoW 1 or 2And I'm going to compare it to HoMM3AoWIII is sorta a fantasy 4X game with very similiar gameplay to the heroes of might and magic series. You have a hero, town(s), and go around raising troops, casting spells, leveling up, exploring the map, and eventually conquering your enemy.The graphics are pretty nice, it's easy to tell what sort of terrain is what, units are stylistic, and overall the graphics suit the game well.  The music got boring real quick, normally with this kind of game you eventually turn off the music, but I had it off within a few days.A couple of big differences between this and HoMM are how units are handled. Gone are stacks of 5500 power liches, instead each 'stack' of units on the map can go up to 6 SEPERATE units. This means that a squad of swordsmen is treated as a single unit, and functions the same at 1 HP as it would full. I'm not sure if this good or bad, but that's just how it is.  While you might say battles would be smaller, they can actually be significantly bigger than HoMM, as you can have adjcent stacks on the map help you attack an enemy stack(s).Battles are also very different (yet) similiar compared to HoMM.  Like HoMM you can cast a spell a turn by your main hero, all your units move in a hex and have different ways to attack and special effects. However, in AoW it's more more tactical, there are flanking attacks that can potentially deny counter attacks and attacks of opportunity against the enemy if they try moving through an enemies' zone of control.  Another big difference between HoMM and AoW is towns. In HoMM towns are usually rare and extremely important objectives for either side, in AoW, you pretty much are able to build towns almost anywhere.  This is an interesting mechanic, but ultimately I found it very boring.  It isn't very difficult to  figure out where to place towns, and as the game goes on I felt I was wasting a lot of time picking what buildings to build in each of my cities, it isn't like civilization either where picking what to build can be a very strategic thing with upsides and downsides (upkeep).Compared to HoMM, the different races feel overall are way too similiar. Aside from minor stat differences and sometimes damage type differences each race will only have a couple of units that actually stand out from others.The point fo the above is to try and place an emphasis on hero types. At the start of the map you will select/customize a hero.  You'll choice from a choice of 6 different jobs and select 3 extra magic types.  The job has the biggest effect on how you will play the game. Each one gives you access to the majority of the spells/special units that you will recruit.  This is a very interesting mechanic, however I found it to be somewhat boring in practice.For example, playing as an archdruid will give you access to Hunters, they're basically bowmen that can charm animals, are better at crossing difficult terrain, and they wear very decorative large masks adorned with feathers.While playing as a draconian, they fit in perfectly with the rest of the army. However, this is how they look for ALL the races.Not only that but, they're almost identical no matter what race you have. Why can't goblin hunters focus on traps? Human hunters can be mounted or have tracking dogs with them?  It's even worse when you select a warlord, as two of their special units are bersekers and warkin (basically ogryn from 40k). All bersekers are bald. Even high elves. And they look absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If they couldn't differentiate the units in abilities due to balancing issues, at least they could make the units thematically look like they belong to the faction, something HoMM did very well.Another minor problem I have with the game is there isn't a quick access for your different heroes you might have hired, you have to bring up the overview panel then switch to your armies. This wouldn't be a problem, except for that you can't have the overview panel up at the same time as your city build orders, which is a problem, because over the course of the game you'll have both a large amount of cities and units.Additionally, the neutral units available for fighting and recruiting/prizes feel very small, it might just be because I played HoMMIII with WoG and that offered quite a good selection. Another thing HoMM had that AoW lacks are interesting items to loot for your hero or neutral unit hexes that let you hire them. While there are a couple of special town types like dragon they function a little differentlyI really want to like this game. Its combat is fun, and has some really great mechanics dragged down by citiy micomanagement, race diversity, and some lazy copy\pasting unit designsEdit: Since there's been two expansions for this game, they've been absolutely great. They did a pretty good job at giving each race more unique abilities, and added more neutral units and items. I don't like necromancers though, the mechanics they have seem so gamechanging compared to the other hero classes.			"

												I've been a fan of Age Wonders since the first time I played Age of Wonders: The Wizard throne in 5th grade. Since then, Age of Wonders have been the one game I have played continuously throughout middle school, high school, and college. In my opinion, Age of Wonders III is the best of the franchise.  One of the greatest strength of Age of Wonders is its combat. In my opinion, Age of Wonders III is the best of the series in this regard. AowIII introduces new mechanics like flanking which make unit position incredibly important. A smaller army can quickly gain advantage of a stronger army just by utilizing flanking to their best ability.  One of strengths of Aow is the wide variety of units. AoWIII continues this trend. Abilities include dominate, seduce, faerie fire, hurl fire bomb, web, assassinate, hurl boulder, phase (teleport), and much more. These abilities make combat a very engaging and enjoyable. AoWIII introduces a new class system. These classes include the dreadnought, archdruid, rogue, sorcerer, theocrat, and warlord. Each class as their own set of combat spells, empire upgrades, and units, giving all classes a unique playstyle. As of this review, Triumph is working on a necromancer class. More information on the classes can be found on at http://ageofwonders.com/category/news/. Like previous games, AoWIII has a variety of races that the player can choose from. The original AowIII has elves, goblins, orcs, humans, dwarves, draconians. Halflings were added in the Golden Realms Expansion. Each race gets an irregular, an archer, an infantry, a cavalry, a pikeman, priest unit, and special final unit. Upon first glance, the races appear to be quite similar. However, there are subtle differences that can end up really impacting one strategy. As an example , consider the archer unit. Elf archers suffer no range penalty, allowing them to do full damage even at distance. Draconian archers laugh firebombs which damage all units in small area. Goblin archers shoot homing mosquitoes which can go through obstacle. Dwarf archers have crossbows which do better damage when they are at close range. Orcs have the worst archers with the worst range; however, they can cause units to bleed which does damage overtime. As one can see, there is a clear difference in the unit abilities. Along with their class and race, players also choose specializations. These specializations revolve around elemental magic. Player can choose between air, fire, water, earth, creation, and destruction. Each specialization has global and combat spells as well as enchantment and summons. In the original game, there are two non-magic specializations-explorer and expander. These specializations add another level of strategy. When one considers all the race, class, and specializations, there is an astounding number of combinations and strategies to use to destroy one enemies. In my opinion, AoWIII is the best in the series. It’s one of my favorite games. On a final note, the devs are really involved in the community. They really listen to players and incorporate suggestions in the gameplay. Triumph Studios is an amazing studio. They have put a lot of work into this game and continue to do so.  "

												If you want a nice casual strategy, buy this game. But the tactics of fighting is extremely simplified compared to AoW 1|2.Here are some examples: 1. Earlier melee warrior could not attack flying creature. Now any swordsman kill a bird, probably he jumps well.2. Previously, to swim in the sea the ship was needed. Now each soldier has his ship in the pocket.3. In AoW 1|2 ghost was protected from physical attacks. Now just get less damage. Archer shot a ghost? Easily!And so on.As a result, we have another good strategy game, where you should not think. Just relax and have fun. Hamsters will be pleased!			"

Campaign mode has odd loosing conditions that the AI will take advantage of and makes the game more hard and frustrating than challenging. Playing keep away with your hero troops instead of useing them to lead battles. In single player mode its easy for all involved nations to hate you but its difficult if not impossible to repair reputation. For example if you come across a nation that declares war with you on sight, you loose reputation with all the other nations you know for starting a war when all you did is exist.

												I am always coming back to this game. It has a great combat system, fantastic empire building, and diverse units. The fact that modding is open for the game also gives it tons of replay value. I can never get enough of trying new mods and having the game randomly generate new maps. It keeps itself fresh even after 600+ hours of gameplay. If you're interested in any kind of fantasy at all, I reccommend picking AoW III up. Get it with the DLCs and have fun wasting your life away because you need to play just ONE more turn. You can create your own heroes or use pre-designed heroes, create your own emblem too. There's a ton of customization and versatility with your hero as well as what units you create and when. Mods enhance your gameplay 100% so I reccommend browsing the workshop. Just subscribe to whatever sounds cool and when you pull up AoW, just tell it to update the user content.This game is awesome for multiplayer too. Just hang out together with friends or family and take turns passing around the mouse. You can be on a team, you can play online with randoms; the game even tells you what mods the other person is running so that there won't be any compatibility errors. Plus accessing your mods is super easy. I have little to no experience modding and I have like 15 going at one time right now. No, I don't have a super computer.All I can say is beware if you create a gigantic map, the AI will take exponentially longer on their turn the longer the game progresses. One more warning; if you are playing with mods and you want to play a game with someone who has no mods, create a new map with one of the preexisting heroes and save it. That way it has the pre-created hero on the start-up screen. If you have a custom hero on the start-up screen after turning off your mods, the game will crash.Freaking love this game and will always reccommend it to anyone.			"

												I'm very surprised this game didn't get more attention and praise when it came out. I guess it was somewhat overshadowed by Endless Legend, a game that's also excellent but very different in focus and pacing.Aside from an unintuitive UI and some goofy unit/character design, I really have nothing to complain about here. Each match on AoW3 is fun and satisfying from start to finish. The AI is competent and challenging. The combat is FANTASTIC, and for me it works very well as the focal point of the game. AoW3 might not be the deepest or most inventive 4X I've ever played, but it is definitely the most enjoyable. It really is a great experience, especially in the mid-late game when you're able to field powerful units and make tough tactical choices.Also, the expansions/DLC are fairly priced and add a huge amount of content and depth. I highly recommend picking up the full 'Collection' over the base gme.			"

												Jesus. I bought it only a few days ago and already have 45 hours of it played.It's a very entertaining and fun game. It has a lot of depth. In my opinion it's the best of its kind out the right now. There's some very similar games. Like.. the Might & Magic games. I think something like.. 'Warlock 3' was also a game of a similar genre. This definitely feels the best. I've played most of its peers, since the type of gameplay appeals to me a lot.If you like strategy games, definitely buy this. If you like games where you get to build a civilization, buy it.If you like card games, oddly enough, buy this. If you like chess, buy this.You don't have to be a genius to play this game, but if you're a genius you'll be able to play on the higher difficulties and have fun with those.There's lots to learn in this game, which is engaging and entertaining.

												I remember my days as a kid, I had just gotten a new copy of Heroes of Might and Magic III, even back then that game was old. But for me it was a new fresh experience that I'd never had before, it took me about a month to reliase that I could end the turn and didn't have to make a new game each time I'd finished my moves, but when I reliased this I suddently got really into the game, I spent almost 2 years playing that game non-stop... Ever since I've been looking for something similar, and Age of Wonders III is probably the best fantasy 4x game I've played in recent years, it succeeds in fullfilling my nostalgia with HOMM3 and I couldn't be more happy that I bought it. A strong recommend for anyone that is even slightly interested in 4x games with a focus on combat, hero customization and exploring.			"

												I have been a fan of the Age of Wonders series since the very beginning. The series has been my favorite when it comes to strategy games. I was extremely excited when Triumph Studios announced the third installment of the series. I have watched the status of AOW III develop from the initial announcement up until release.So, here is my review based on 10 ours of in-game experience. I am extremely impressed with the AI. It is a much greater improvement over the original games. The AI is really taking me for run! I never had much challenge with the AI in the previous games. I like the detailed terrain and atmosphere of the maps/world. The tactical combats are sweet and prettier than the previous games. Also, the tactical AI is much smarter as well. In AOW II SM, I would lure enemies out of the gate in a siege and slaughter them... it doesn't work like that anymore. :D The AI is tough and smarter. The soundtrack is AWESOME! I wish I would have got the deluxe edition just for the soundtrack. I'll have to wait until they release it as DLC. I love how the knights look in AOW III. Their armor shines as they sit on their steeds with their lances; it brings a nice heroic personality. During the 10 hours of in-game experiences I have really enjoyed game. It is fun, exciting, and challenging. I rate it a 9/10 in my opinion.Here are some of the things I would suggest to improve AOW III. Angels... I really miss the angels from AOW II. Beautiful females, powerful, and celestial beings. They were my favorite unit, and I love how they could only be summoned. AOW III has angelic-like beings called the exalted. However, they just don't fit in the game as the female angels would. Another thing reflecting back upon the angels is that you can also get goblin angels, human angels, dwarf angels, etc... This is due to the new class system in AOW III. Angels, succubus, etc need to be unique, and preferably summoned instead of being standard recruitable creatures. I am hoping Triumph will bring back the angels from AOW II as summons. :) Another thing I would suggest is to bring back the old method of handling flying creatures. In AOW II you needed magic, another flying unit, ranged units, or for the flying unit to attack you in order to deal damage to a flying unit. Based on what I have seen all creatures whether flying or not can hit a flying unit. Lastly, I do prefer the 2d art for heroes and leaders as compared to the 3d stuff (lowest priority).In conclusion, Age of Wonders III is a solid game that will bring an exciting and challenging experience. I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to support Triumph Studio on further development of Age of Wonders III! 9/10!			"

												Age of Wonders III has really managed to hit my itch for a great game. There are seemingly infinite customization combinations  for creating a random map. I have counted 36 race/class(6x6) combos and then there are the specializations, all of which can have a pretty big impact on how your character's empire will be played. Editing the physical appearance of your character is kind of limited in my opinion but that did not ruin anything for me, i had already spent a half an hour debating what I would play first. Adding to the changing of physical appearance items crafted and found while playing will show on your character (only in battle i think). The AI has proven to be a challenge for me, to keep it simple they don't seem to play fair or nice things have gone poorly for me several times. The fourth difficulty which I believe is called 'king' is too much for me currently. I do a lot of empire building, and i have played with the scenarios however i haven't played though either of the two stories yet. When building my empire in a random map I find myself ready to sit there for hours leading my character and other heroes on a quests to help and save cities and then conquer those who don't want peace. I have logged in around 40 hours so far, much of which was spent using local multiplayer. All of my friends around here play consoles but a few do enjoy games like this one so it was great being able to have them over and play this. Turns can get pretty long late game (using classic turn based system opposed to simultaneous) on the bigger maps but when all you have to do is past a wireless mouse back and forth its easy to do other things while waiting. Even so between turns waiting on the AI doesn't take nearly as long many other games similar to this style I've played.I'm actually bored of writing this now and really want to go play more Age of Wonders III before i start my day, so take care everyone and if you haven't checked out this game I seriously suggest you do. Really you guys/girls/lords/ladies...do it right the frack now! Go play as a goblin dreadnought and blow some things up you'll have loads of fun! and nothing beats fun...			"

												The most awesome aspect of this game is the joint tactical battles. If the game creators take one thing away from the game, it would be squad building and turn based strategy with multiple players. You could create a spinnoff game where players command small tactical insurgent forces for some missions and large seige forces for others, with a smattering of mid level combat around towns and villages. It would be incredible to play with multiple friends, explore and find new and amazing treasures and defeat incredible mythical beasts.			"

												This is the best hex-style turn based strategy game I have played. The game offers very distinct empire classes to play, each with a very unique playstyle and unit set. You can also select a race which augments your class by giving your base units special traits and skills. Every class is surprisingly balanced with the exception of Dreadnought, which is significanty overpowered.What I love most about this game is its combat system which is very deep but at the same time completely transparent. All units possess unique traits and interactions which if leveraged perfectly, can turn a likely defeat into a flawless victory. Units can level up and earn promotions that give them not just plain stats, but additional skills and traits making them more suited to their combat role. The addition of a wide array of global combat spells also adds depth to the game.This game is a must buy if you enjoy games like Civ, or if you want a game similar to the HoMM series but with balanced gameplay and game depth.

												This is a triumph for the AoW series. It is not a re-hash of the old model whatsoever. The system of play has been totally overhauled and it is a very refreshing new approach to the series. I might go so far to say it is better than AoW 1. It combines elements familiar to Civilization players with great RPG-focused gameplay, there is a much greater focus on the kings/queens of empires in AoW 3 than before; where they were merely another hero with a special title.

												AOW is everything Heroes of might and and magic VI should have been, but wasn't.It's not enogh empire building to satisfy CIV veterans but the tactical phase is extremely deep, and the hero and troop progression is full of possibilities.I'm a little worried about the balance of the various sides and skills, but I'm hearing good stuff from the developers on the forums about tweaking various aspects of the game.The AI is as dumb as usual, but MP is great.

												I have 342 hours into the game as of this review, and have only played single player.  This is easily the most played game in my Steam library. (Skyrim comes in at 2nd, with about 275 hours as of this review.  And whatever is in 3rd place is so far back, it can't even see the dust from these two.)  I find this funny, since I almost passed on buying AoW3.This is a deep game, which took me about 60 hours just to feel like I was getting the feel of all the possibilities.  The intro campaign got a bit tedious by about the 4th chapter, so I jumped into random maps.  Very enjoyable!  Just about anything you can think of is customizable, including your leader's race, specialty, and appearance; to map type, size and features (the map can be dangerous and rewarding... at the same time); to number of heros allowed and their max levels...  Oh yes, and the number, skill and specialties of your A.I. opponents are individually tweakable.  Basically, after you haved played a bit, each random map is a game you can fully and intelligently customize to optimize the challenge and maximize your own enjoyment.The strategy level is turn-based or semi-real time (selectable) and the combat is turn-based.  Decisions you make at the strategy/map level greatly influence numbers and capabilities of troops you field.  The tactical combat is deep.  With the right skills and knowledge, you can defeat far superior opponents (or vice versa: you can get your fanny kicked by an inferior opponent).  Your opponents are scalable in toughness, and total defeat is definitely an option.  Making the right decisions at both the strategic and tactical levels makes for very satisfying play.A lot of attention was given to the audio and visual experience.  The map and game pieces are beautiful.  Every troop has its own unque sounds and animations for different actions, including combat.  There is a bit of an RPG element --> Heros and leaders get stronger if you cultivate them, have many different capabilities, based on class, and really can make a big difference in battle outcomes.Due to the fact that I think the tutorial campaign could have been a little more ""teachy"" AND interesting, I lower my ranking a bit below perfect, and give this game a rating of 9 out of 10.

												I strongly recommend this game. The variety of strategies and choices is outstanding. Every hero, race and unit feels very unique. Every expansion improved the base game really fine.Age of Wonders III feels really  different from other turn strategy when we look at battle mechanics. I can't say how good it feels in my hands. In a battle with 32+ units, one badly unit move can turn the tides.And after almost two campaign I still have not experienced a single major bug.However, after two year of paths and ballancing, it still has some flaws, for example:- Tier IV units making tier I units almosts useless in late game- Limited controls. There's too many repetitive mouse actions that can't mapped to a hotkey.- Some of campaign levels are way too long. Managing 10+ cities is not funny while hunting enemies heroes around other 10+ cities.			"

												This game is addictive as hell. Whether youre a fan of the old series, as i am, or a newcomer who enjoys 4X games, Age of Wonders III will keep you persistently hungry for ""one more turn"". I have not played the campaign much (i never do in these games) but the skirmish/random map mode is exactly what i want out of games like this.Exploration is very rewarding in AOW3, as each randomly generated world feels rich and large. Whatever method, pattern, or logic it is that the world generator uses, it does its job; mountains, forests, and rivers all fit very naturally together, have plenty of variety with sensibly placed climates/regions, and just look wonderful. The resources are spaced and balanced really well, and there are tons of dungeons and rare encounters to discover and conquer. I always get absorbed in roaming the world, every time.Hero creation is fun. The classes are mostly what you are used to (warriors, wizards, priests, etc), but there are many combinations of race/class/specializations available whos impacts on the game are felt gradually over the course of your campaign, and every change can have a major impact on how you play, so it is easy to get excited about trying out each one. Personally, i spend almost as much time creating heroes and imagining up personalities for them as i do actually playing the game (LOL), and the fact that i can make them, not only for myself, but for the NPCs as well really gets me into the game alot more than i would be otherwise.There are plenty of spells, including hidden ones, plenty of items and equipment, including some you make yourself, and plenty of monsters, most of which you can learn to either capture or acquire for your own armies. Some units have unique abilities when certain classes and races combine to produce them, and each hero can be customized with RPG-style level-upgrades and equipment. There are also rare units which can only be discovered through exploration, or by conquering/befreinding key locations, so even play throughs with the same customized faction will vary and feel different.The tactical combat is better than i have seen in a 4X game in a long time. Many different unit roles exist, with a variety of strengths and positions which counter them, and each has advantages at different times. Combined with heroes and spells, there are many things to think about in battle, and many strategies to win with. The sheer number of unit abilities in this game is impressive in its own right, but once you begin to realize that every single one of them counters, and is countered by, something else, things move to a whole new level. The action-point and flanking systems ensure that you cannot simply hire a few beefy units and chop your way through hordes of enemies... there is a limit to how much one badass can do in a turn, and you WILL be outmaneuvered and killed by cheap little weaklings if you do not position your units correctly.If i had to complain about something in this game, i could only think of two things to mention. Firstly, the diplomacy mechanics are ♥♥♥♥. To be fair, they usually are in 4X games; diplomacy rarely ever gets implimented well into games which are mostly designed around combat but, in this case, it feels especially worthless. Most NPCs will decide whether or not they are at war with you before you even open the diplomacy screen, and once it has been decided there is really nothing you can do to change things. There isnt much you can trade, and NPCs will typically never accept a trade anyway, so this much of the game may as well be removed.And Secondly, the difficulty of the game is spasmatic at best. One game, you may walk over everyone else as though they werent even there, and the next you may be clinging to life every turn; there seems to be no consistency even within the same difficulty levels of this game. I have had several matches where i have spent hours exploring the world only to find one of the enemy factions tucked away in a corner of the map repeatedly failing to extablish a second city for some reason or another, and i have also had matches where all of my cities were under constant siege by max level units before i had even located an enemy. It is wildly inconsistent and, if you do not limit the number of heroes a faction may have, AI factions will hire as many as they can afford to the exclusion of everything else.But, the game is amazing and has only been getting better with each patch. As far as i am concerned, there is no better 4X available right now, and it is worth the full price of 40 dollars. If you catch this thing on sale, you would be a fool to pass it up.			"

												Good turn based tactical strategy with RPG mechanics, kinda similar for a first look as HoMaM franchise but on the second one there is so varying diferences that AoW stands on it's own.+ Story ~ campaing is fluent and well written (yet I prefer random maps more)+ Graphic ~ optimized and beatiful at the same time+ Customize your main hero ~ you can make your very own hero, randomize pre-builded one or just choose from the list+ Classic fantasy races+ Spell system ~ global and combat alike+ Developers are still adding free content, patches and paid DLC's at the same time & community workshop- Basically a tech race ~ rush for better technology tier of units is almost always win and often mandatory - For multiplayer is not advised to play with strangers (not so many games without passwords anyway) because of rage quits, disconnects if something is not by their minds etc. Although groups looking for play, especially for longer and steady plays, are made on forum so it....balances a bit8/10   ""Always plays as evil dwarf dreadnought machines freak.

												This game is awesome. Heroes of Might and Magic meets Civ meets Disciples meets turn based combat. Units have multiple levels of veterancy. Heroes can level up, use spells of multiple school trees, use items they find in battle, and make items to use in battle. A no brainer for 50% off or more. That said, I haven't played Endless Legend yet which is also by an amazing production company and JUST came out of Alpha. Then again, it isn't 50% off right now with an expansion coming out tomorrow.			"

												As someone who cut their teeth on Master of Magic on my first PC, I can definitely recommend Age of Wonders 3 to both old fans of the genre and folks getting into it for the first time.  The clean visual look and easy to follow unit art combines well with a deeply layered strategy game that has an amazing depth of content, particularly with both DLC packages included.The top layer of the game is all about strategy - building up your empire, expanding your cities reach, marshalling a vast army of armored elves, lucky halflings, or agile tigrans and assaulting dungeons and tombs for ancient treasure while balancing your diplomacy and maintaining an alignment that may influence your neighbors opinion of you (if you even care what they think - especially if your goal is to crush them like a bug).  When you get into battle with an opposing force, the game really shines again with a powerful tactical layer - positioning your units to defend their flanks and take advantage of your enemies over-reaching become as important as fielding the proper units.  Pikes deployed against mounted cavalry works brilliantly, especially if you can get behind a spent and exhaused human Knight!  Then again, a well placed fireball can work wonders, as well.The races and classes are many and varied, and with one amazing spell or ability to research after another regardless of the combination you select at map setup you'll play for hundreds of hours before you start to see all the combinations.  From Warlords and their incredibly potent troops to Necromancers and Sorcerers with their poweful magic and mighty summons, including Dread Reapers and Eldrich Horrors, there is something here for all types of strategy gamers.The multi-player in simultaneous mode works wonders - especially if you are playing with friends on teams, it takes a long time to complete a game but it's just an amazing half a dozen hours to spend.In the end, I've probably spent as much time watching videos as I have playing it, and I am looking forward to many more years of both - there is a lot to learn, and a lot to dig into, but the basics are simple and elegant and the longeveity of the game is definitely something worth considering.  Highly recommended.			"

												I believe the finest fantasy TBS we have at the moment.Heavily focused on epic battles, exploration and leveling up your heroes. That's where its core is! Every class and race play differently with their pros and cons so gameplay and replayability are kept alive and fresh by the ""let me try this now!"" factor.City management is secondary, but not irrilevant: you'll find yourself specializing cities and terraforming here and there to suit them to your strategy and playstyle.It'll completely suck you in and if you've a friend to play with it's even better! MP goes on at a VERY slow pace, especially when it's more than 3 Leaders involved, but the pause between turns gives you time to do other things like reading a book, watching a video or a movie, checking the Tome of Wonders, planning next moves and so forth... so its apparently weak spot is instead another of its great points.AI is a bit weird at times but it reacts and listens to your request and proposals pretty well. So forge alliances, betray, bribe other factions and set them at war against your opponents. Level up your Heroes, send them afar to expand your domains and rule the land with the iron grip and brute force of the Orcs! Or dwell in the underground and patiently multiply your Goblins waiting to erupt to the surface and destroy the land of men!Cleanse the earth and bring peace in all the Empire as the Leader of High Elves or forge incredible machines that will shake the ground beneath their wheels and crush your enemies as a Dwarven Dreadnought!

												Do not expect the deep empire management of civilization, this game's strong side is in its combat system, magic system and customization options. You can customize your own avatar and the choice of talents, class and race have significant impact to how your game will play out, allowing to pick a combination most suited to your playstyle. Or just experiment if that's your thing.As mentioned, the empire management aspects are lacking compared to the competition. Tech tree gets exhausted pretty quickly and it's pretty easy to win by overpowering the AI in early game. On the other hand this kind of setup allows for faster and more 'action' oriented multiplayer matches. However the AI is notoriously bad in terms of diplomacy and still has some bugs that make it easy to beat even on higher difficulties. Add to that an incomplete diplomatic system and the only real option to win the game outside of scripted scenarios is full on military conquest.The best part however is the combat system. Units are carefully balanced and the combat system allows to win through superior tactics against much more powerful armies... if you know what you're doing. Finding out the various tactics to take down particularly tough units is half the fun. Defending a city surrounded assaulted by a superior foe is suitably satisfying, as is taking out defenders through tactical use of the right units.Overal: Age of Wonders 3 is a Heroes of Might and Magic meets Civilization in a Tolkien-ish inspired setting. Don't get it for the empire management or you'll be disappointed. Get it for the combat and magic system and it's loads of fun.			"

												This game isn't perfect, but I think it is a good followup on the old AoW games. I really like the class system and the classes do play very differently. Magical spheres are still around though they are more of a complement to the class spells and abilities now. Race has a lot less impact than class admittedly, but there are enough differences between the races that the choice matters.  That aside, the tactical combat is very good and has some interesting additions compared to the old games.The game is in need of some patching, and could definetly use some expansions/DLC with more of the old races (Tigrans naturally) being added. One of my main annoyances however is that the unit design is fairly lazy, at least for the class units. Most theocrat and warlord units for instance are bald for all races, they could have had some variation there. Skinny hairless elven angels do not scream exalted to me. =P			"

												Absolutely amazing. This is definitely one of the better strategy games you get on steam. This game is on par with Civ V or  maybe even better. The combat is fun, the customization is fun, taking cities is rewarding and each game is different in its own way. The visuals are fantastic and the tactical combat is extremely well done. It rarely gets boring since all minor conflicts can be solved through an auto-calculation so it never gets tedious. Plus the auto-calculations are usually pretty fair and that's a huge plus compared to other games that have tried this feature.  If you're a fan of strategy or even just fantasy this is a must-buy. I can't believe this game isn't more popular than it is. Steam and really the entire 4x scene should have more games like this and would benefit greatly from it.			"

The sound is great. The UI is great. Almost everything is at the point of your cursor or a click away.But, what is the greatest thing about this game is the developers and the support they give in the game and to their customers. They monitor the forums and address every problem in a speedy way. They listen to the feedback and try to fix whatever little does not work as it should.They release DLCs that *add to the game* while they release updates that *fix the game*.I am impresed by Triumph on this aspect and I think that they are a model of how a company should support their titles.It is certain that I will be following this company's releases and I will support their work in the future, as long as they keep this quality level.

												Easily the best 4x fantasy game since the last in the series: Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic. However the real question is AOW III better than that game or not. It is hard to really say, with the current more limited number of races included and some changes that seem to speed the game up a bit, I would say it is not better as a whole than Shadow Magic but it is pretty damn close as it stands right now and on its own merits it is an amazingly deep and polished 4x fantasy game and the closest you will find to a true modern Master of Magic. If they do open up steam workshop support for this title and/or add more races/classes/units it will be a near perfect game.			"

												What a wonder indeed. I've been waiting for a game that's close to Heroes of Might and Magic 3 for so long. The Heroes of Might and Magic series itself has let me down in every installment after the third one. I've been playing for several hours and not once have I wanted to put the game down, I just had to because I have stuff to do. I have nothing bad to say about the game really, it reaches top marks on pretty much everything that's important in a game like this. One thing I would've liked though is more races. Where is the undead race for example? Maybe they'll keep supporting this game with expansions and patches we'll see but for now I'm having a blast.			"

												Lovely game. I enjoyed the tutorial immensely. This is a hybrid of Heroes of Might and Magic and Civilization, 2 games that I also enjoy. I prefer the textured map of Heroes of Might and Magic rather than the flat map system of Civilizations. Being able to see the rivers, mountains, streams and the underground make for a much more interesting game. PROS1. The Zoomed In Combat SystemI love this. Combat is based on an Action Point system and is slightly better compared to similar combat systems from 4X games like Endless Legends. You have elevation, terrain, range and spells and even strategic positioning. E.g. If you were to attack an enemy Hero with 2 armies on the left and right flank, the armies will appear on the right and left flank of the enemy as well.2. Feedback ButtonI love the consideration that the developers put in for their players. While I'm sure that the developers aren't able to attend to all feedback, it is a good idea for players to give their feedback. Also, if I ever need to report bugs, this makes it easy to do. Alternatively, F12 works as well.3. Textured Map vs Flat MapYou get to see details versus a plain flat map.4. Lore and ThemeI love the Dreadnought.5. Wall ClimbingVery nice. I like the climbing of walls. It's something that's not in Civilizations or Heroes. Not that it's very useful. I'm guessing Total War has had a small impact here?6. Scout CreaturesPrety useful.7. Expanding your Territory with BuildersNot bad, but not perfect. Instead of using builders for roads and industrial upgrades, you build settlements that increase your city's domain. Compared to buying tiles with culture, it's much better. However, the builders need to be given instructions, otherwise they are pieces of junk. If you don't expand, it stands around doing nothing.8. Spells instead of TechnologyNot bad. It's thematically more interesting.9. Multiple heroes in CombatLove it, although I am unsure if hero bonuses stack on troops.CONS1. Unintuitive ClickingNo auto-pickup. You have to pick it up on your own with a left click and then place it in your inventory. Why can't you just auto-pick it up if you have inventory space?2. RegistrationPain in the ♥♥♥. I understand that you need to use it to link with GOG and Steam though.3. Equipping itemsWhy is the bow in your inventory and not held in your hand? Do you go into combat with your weapon stashed in your bag?4. Cliche RacesGoblins, Elves, Orcs, Humans, Dwarves? How much Tolkien do you want to repeat?5. No Parallel BuildsYou can only ever build 1 thing at anytime. Why can't you make an upgrade that builds 2 things at once? E.g. 2 infantry will pop up in a single turn. 6. Spellcasting in CombatIf I'm right, only 1 spell can be used per round. Having 2 heroes that can cast spells is redundant. I may have to double-check on this. "

Initial Overall ThoughtsTwo years have passed since I was gifted the base game of AOW and purchased the expansions along the way. I’ve put in over 100 hours of play in the single player campaigns, online and play-by-email multiplayer modes. I’d say I spent most of my time in online multiplayer. From the get-go, I was already enjoying this entry and I think it’s for the simple reason that there aren’t a lot of 4X strategy titles like this on the market. The blending of RPG, 4X and Empire Building mechanics is still rare despite the resurgence of turn-based games in recent years. Age of Wonders seems keen on proving that it still deserves its place.This is the kind of strategy game I like to sink an entire Sunday afternoon and evening into. Where time simply goes by completely unawares. I get sucked into managing my noble empire of good Humans against the undead scourge of the evil Necromancer (aka: Managarmr). That one-more-turn addiction is ever present and I’ve burned many happy days trying to explore, determine the next resource to take over, training armies and expanding the empire as best as I could. With the random procedural generation, each match will feel unique, even when playing on the same map settings. Just the experience of roleplaying a fantasy character, that’s in charge of any number of types of empires,was engaging on its own. However, maybe that’s the roleplayer in me talking. Evil, neutral, chaotic, elemental, destructive, good or peace-seeking, the game allows you to build your own experience and try to play to the conditions you set for yourself. I’ll explain more in the mechanics below.AOW3 is about victory through expansion, fighting and conquest. As the leader of a powerful empire, you should always be exploring to find hidden treasures and places to setup new cities. To expand your empire as quickly as possible by taking over resource buildings and conquering your foes. You should move quickly or else you’ll get left behind. The basic structure of your empire are towns, cities and outposts. These places let you build units, upgrades and more that grant access to more powerful units, increasing your revenue streams and giving permanence to your empire. Which you’ll need for the army and taking over rival Throne Cities. Even with the alternate victory conditions brought about in the expansions, military prowess is what the game favors for victory. The diplomacy system is simplistic. It gives the very basic functions of diplomacy (declare war, allow armies through territories, etc) and that’s about it. It also provides a way to talk to players if needed. Otherwise, the AI doesn’t use it very well and trying to barter with it is near impossible. Side note, you could technically win a victory through peaceful means, but that would require forging alliances with other players who win the game for you. It’s not that enjoyable nor encouraged by the game or myself.Leader, Heroes and Units ExaminationEach player controls an empire led by a Leader, a powerful character with vast control over their elemental and racial magic. These leaders can function in the role of a supporting hero or go on the offensive in the front lines with spells and abilities. They can also ride mounts, equip weapons, items & armor as well as level up. During the game they are casting spells that can affect cities or other units as well as learning new spells through knowledge research. There are plenty of spells to learn from not only based on their class but their specialization and race. They are your most powerful units but they are also a potentially crippling weakpoint of your empire. If taken out, they can no longer cast their spells, research is stopped dead and whatever existing spells are cancelled. Leaders will return in a couple of days at their home base but that leaves the empire vulnerable to attack and can slow everything down to a crawl. Generally, it’s a good idea to not lose them. You can completely customize their appearance, race, class and specialties or pick from several defaults included in the game. The leader builder in the game is definitely good if not the most powerful I’ve ever seen. I’ve created several unique heroes and always liked coming up with new ideas for mine.Final ThoughtsAge of Wonders III combines empire building, role-playing mechanics and turn-based strategy into one glorious mix. I don’t regret the 100+ hours I’ve sunken into it. It’s got great multiplayer support and a pretty decent multiplayer community to go along with it. The sheer amount of content that you can find is incredible as well. I haven’t even touched on everything I could have in this review. I’m going to keep playing Age of Wonders 3 in the future even if I do have reservations about its pacing. What AOW3 does right far outweighs what it does wrong and it’s been a hell of a memorable experience. I just wish the early game’s battles were more interesting and less one sided. I additionally wish magic was a little less restrictive and more interesting in the early game as well. The game only really seems to get interesting once you hit mid-to-late game levels. But maybe that’s just me. The RNG system is robust and fair along with the game’s overall balance giving players a more-or-less equal chance to win. At least, from what I can tell of my 100 hour experience.Far and away Age of Wonders III is one of my top strategy games of all time. It’s memorable for all the right reasons despite its flaws and shortcomings. I heartily recommend it for both new and experienced 4X strategy players. This is well worth giving a look.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] "

												Best Warhammer Fantasy game that's not actually Warhammer ever. It really is a great game, and the DLC makes it so much greater with Wild (Chaos) Magic and Necromancy. The terraforming magic ability where a type of environment creeps out of your cities with each turn is one of my favorite in gaming, especially the terraforming WMD spells in the old AoW games.Excuse me while I go create a Tigran Necromancer named Nagash and take over the world with my undead legions and immortal undead heroes.

												Now that I've completed both campaigns, I would have expected to be strongly recommending this game to others.Unfortunately, I have a real love/hate relationship with this game. Much of the game is great - the grpahics, interface, music and basic gameplay elements. You certainly won't lack for gameplay, the two campaigns took me well over 100 hours to finish, although I never use auto combat so battles made up most of that time.The hate part comes from the lack of documenation and a few really terrible scenarios in the campaigns. All games should have a manual, especially games this complex, but there is no manual.Three of twelve scenarios in the campaigns are awful, some of the worst scenario designs I have encountered in decades of playing strategy games, the rest of the scenarios are lots of fun. One is horrible because it has a hidden timer. The other two, the last scenarios in each campaign are horrible because they are mind numbingly frustrating. You have far too many enemies to fight, your basic task is to fight two leaders and attack them with a particular hero. Finding the two leaders is a slow, boring process. It's an idiotic idea which pretty much ruined both campaigns for me. If you are lucky you won't have to play these scenarios, it depends on choices you make earlier in the campaigns.I do recommend this game if you are willing to put up with some frustration.			"

												The game shows alot of promise, and I was totally sold on it from the trailers. But truth be told, the actuall combat mechanics and AI leaves much to be desired. The different races all play the same, with mostly the same units to choose from, and it doesnt help that you can absorb any race into your empire and as such actaully play all races in one single game. The different classes have some different spells and units to choose from, but spells in general are a bit of a letdown. You generally use the same two spells over and over again since there is no point in using anything else. Same with units, some units are way OP and when the enemy only build these units there is no point in creating diverse armies for the fun of it. Units dont have many special abilities, and the lower tiers become obsolete quickly. One cool thing is that you can absorb the ""special"" NPC races such as dragons, giants and undead into your empire if you take one of their towns. On a strategic note, you need to learn how to use your units to their full extent, and pay atention to flanking since this plays a major role in combat. Unfortenetly units with lots of HP generally have high dmg aswell, so using week dps units are just not an option in the long run, bigger is always better in this game. Verdict: Has some good ideas, and the game looks good. But after playing one custom map against the computer, you have basiclly experienced all there is to it. So good fun for 3-5 hours, then you forget about it.			"

												Well, what can I say?♥♥♥♥. I lost whole, WHOLE damn night because of ""another turn syndrome"".There is no better fantasy strategy game out there. Heroes of Might and Magic (the new ones) would wish they were that good.This game not only did what the first Age of Wonders did right, it does everything better.Battles of epic proportions, upgradable heroes and minions, a great ammount of various races and units plus specialities, spells, freedom to create your own towns, deciding what to specialize at, using terrain tactically, flanking and joining several armies around the target to fight with 2 or 3 heroes at the same time... That's just from the top of my head. This game is a real time stealer...With those kinds of games I am usually hard to please, but this time I am shocked at how good this is.Unlike the first games it is not only good techically, but story-wise as well. Keeps you entertained for sure.As far as fantasy strategy games go? This is 10/10 right there.			"

												In brief: A game with a fantastic concept that lacks the depth and balance to hold the player's attention.In not so brief:I was really excited about this game. I saw some gameplay and got it on the Steam Winter Sale after waiting forever for the price to drop. I was excited by the combination of strategic overworld combined with tactical combat and thought it would make for dynamic and immersive gameplay. To go with the Civilization comparison I had always wished the combat there was more detailed / more engaging and I thought this was the answer. Unfortunately I fails to live up to expectations.You choose class and race and those determine what ""special units"" you get and some specialized bonuses and abilities. Unfortunately, the special units are little more than reskins of the same basic types. You have infantry, calvary, and archers. And your specialized units are only ""special"" in a few details. Once you get to mid-game you've figured out the most efficient way to conduct your battles in the tactical map and so just rinse-and-repeat through the entire late-game. You end up hitting ""auto-combat"" more and more because it's no longer exctiting to spend 7 minutes to crush some bandits. And at that ponit you're no longer even playing the tactical portion. Every tactical map is effectively the same, and so each battle progresses the same way.There is no other choice than ""crush all your enemies in combat"". While in Civ you can win through economics, diplomacy, or culture, in AoW III it is ONLY through conquest. Well that's fine, right? Because you came to play a fantasy strategic/tactical combat game. That's what I thought. But this affects the AI a LOT. Peace treaties are a joke. The AI will propose them, and then break them only a few turns later. There's no real penalty for doing so and in the end they have no other choice. They HAVE to fight you at some point. So forming alliances in game doesn't really work. As a result, the AI is pumping out units at a high rate. Which just turns the game into an arms race. You don't have time to focus on the unique terraforming spells or anything that's not directly combat related. It's just a sprint to get to late-game units so you can stand up to the AI. Which means you probably get there before even exploring the entire map. So the late game is dominated by just cleaning up the rest of your opponents. Sure, now you have the flexibility to play with terraforming or something, but why bother? The game is almost over.One final thing is that some of the background game mechanics are broken. Empire Happiness is notably problematic. You gain happiness for a number of things but most importantly for conquering other cities. You lose happiness for such things as losing cities. Happiness determines how well your troops perform in combat. The result of this is that once you get an enemy on their heels it's lights out. It becomes a runaway effect where you just get better and better and they get worse and worse. Instead of long campaigns being tiring for your troops, it's almost invigorating. Additionally, your throne city is EVERYTHING. As in, if you lose that, you lose it all. Literally. Keeping your throne city is a victory requirement. So you can't turtle in a lesser city off to the side to make a brilliant comeback later. If you lose that it's game over. So the easiest way to defeat an opponent is to walk past all of their other cities, go right to their throne, and take it. The end.I could say more but this review is already overly long. I really, deeply wish I could recommend this game, but it's simply not worth it. Like I said a fantastic concept that falls flat when it comes to execution. If you want to play a turn-based strategy game, play Civ. If you want to play a turn based tactical game, play X-COM. If you want to play a fusion of the two, wait for something better to come along.			"

It has just the right amount of rpg and rts elements, you can auto battle anything to avoid the manual battling but you can almost always provide a more effective strategy in the manual battle reminisent of FFT and other tile based turn based rpgs. The other heros and squad management aswell as the ability to have other teams assist you in a manual battle similiar to having other generals in warband join your fight. Very good so far.			"

												Age of Wonders III is a fantastic game of which I feel like I have dumped too much of my life into already but can't help but keep coming back to it. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys civilization but also loves to lose themselves in a fantasy universe. This game however can become challenging at times and you might even find yourself losing a mission in the campaign where you have no choice but to restart the mission since you backed yourself into a corner. Overall though, its a definite purchase I would make again.			"

												This new iteration to the Age of Wonders franchise combines the empire management of the Civilization games and the turn based, hexagonal combat system of the Heroes of Might and Magic series perfectly. The world full of vast biomes and areas to explore has a lot to offer. From sending your armies into a crypt to find a dragon defended by dragonkin and skeletons to sending your army against the Elvish Arch Druid army, only for him to call upon the Forest God to decimate your musketeers. This game offers amazing customization options as well, from creating your character and his looks to choosing his race, his class, his attributes and his spells. All of these options affect how you will play the game. Will you become a Dwarf Arch Druid and heal the land around your empire to reap the awards of a bountiful Harvest? Or will you become a Dragonkin Mage and call down fire and plague and destroy your rival's lands? These spells and skills also affect the combat in the game. Your heroes will have one time spells to use to decimate a particulary powerful creature or even call up a large random creature, which turns out to be a poisonous death adder. Overall, this game is a great source of fun and enjoyment and I can see myself putting many more hours into this game.			"

												Age of Wonders III is a very combat centered turn based strategy game with a fantasy setting where magic can turn the tide of battle just as much as steel. Many people try to compare this game to Civilization V, in respect to that I respond. Age of Wonders III does use a city based system in part to produce an army and procure territory to gain resources. However, in the defense of that mechanic there are options of using Summoned units, Inns, and rewards gained from battle or clearing quests to earn an army. Some of those features are clearly not in Civilization V. For me the better game series to compare to comes from the Real Time Strategy games known as Warcraft (Age of Wonders III) and Starcraft (as opposed to Civ V). If you ever played Warcraft III you might remember the times of having a Hero unit that could (and often did) become more powerful than most other units of your army, sometimes more powerful than a small handful of units on their own.Age of Wonders III uses a Hero system in a similar concept as Turn Based Strategy game. Your heroes level up, earn abilities. You can quest, battle, or even forge your own gear (non-campaign on the forging bits) for your heroes to use in combat. Heroes can die, and when they die they drop all the items they had on them. But you do not have to say goodbye to them forever because there are ways in game to revive them, powerful revival magic (instead of hero shrines from Warcraft 3).TLDR: Ultimately, if you play the game for a single player experience you will find enjoyment in the campaigns, and for a time in the solo scenarios, random maps, and various play styles. However, combat will quickly become tedious and repetative. Against the A.I. I recommend using Auto-Battle most the time, but the true glory of the Manual Battles is when you can fight against a Human Opponent using either Online, LAN, or Hotseat as a multi-player turn based game.Quick Notes:- I recommend Turn Based with a 3 minute turn timer for small groups.(turn timer incase people forget to hit end turn)- There is the option to use Simultaneous turns (but it can feel choppy, and it can lead to logisitic problems for battle prep on the strategic map)			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is a turn-based fantasy 4X strategy game focused on combat rather than empire building. As such, it has more in common with Master of Magic and Heroes of Might and Magic III than with Civilizations 5.The base game provides two different and quite long campaigns featuring branching paths and different endings, a few pre-generated scenarios, and a random map generator with a lot of map and game options to customize your games to your liking.Multiplayer is present and alive with the possibility to play with people who own the GOG version, meaning the community is not divided.You start a game by customizing your leader by choosing his race and class between 6 different races and 6 different races, amounting to 36 different initial combinations, with each race and class having distinct spells and characteristic, providing them different optimal gameplay while still being homogeneous enough to keep things balanced. To further specialize your leader, you can also chose between 8 specialization options, such as Water adept, Fire adept, Explorer, etc.The game is extremely fun to play and the combat system is excellent in both concept and execution. Add to that different units and spells interacting together dynamics and you get really epic battles that never feel like they are dragging on.Golden Realms Expansion:The first expansion pack adds one new race, two new specializations, a new campaign, new scenarios, new units, new spells, new mechanics, and new map options, turning the game from great to amazing.Highly recommended!!!

												For strategy game maniacs such as myself I can recommend this at full price. However, if you are new to the gendre I would rather wait till discount or buy some other strategy game first. It should be noted though that I've only played multiplayer so my recommendation is solely based on that.If roughly compared to other 4x strategy games I've played I would say it's better than Endless Legend but worse than Civilization V, and quite par on par with Endless Space. This is of course my personal opinion, and coming from someone who rarely touches single player aspect of strategy games and plays almost solely against friends in multiplayer.The little experience I've had with AI is that it's somewhat repeative, stupid and predictable. For example if AI is defending a city it tends to charge trough the gates giving attacking player easy win. But this is very common for games (that's why I play almost solely against human opponents) and Age of Wonders still does better job with AI than for example Civilization V.			"

												This game is very entertaining. The way the combat works, is an interesting twist to typical HOMM style.  There are not any creature stacks and units due full damage regardless of health until they die.  Along with that, probably the best feature is being able to pull multiple armies (attacker and defender to a combined total of 6) into a single battle.  If you are looking for a combat focused turn based strategy, do not overlook this.Pros:Small to large scale battles.Lots of Hero customization (talents and itemcrafting).Game looks good.Haven't had any crashes or bugs.Campaign story is enganging.The voice acting is very good.Cons.The AI is brutally difficulty even on normal.The tutorial doesn't tell you much.Could take too long for multiplayer (I've had some battles take an hour plus).Not much of a diplomacy system (fine by me but others may be sad).Every time I go to load I get asked if I want to save (why?).Third party drm (can do single player without logging in though).

												When i heard this was like HoMM and Civ5 i was pretty much sold, i love these games but its more like HoMM in almost every sense, the base building is a side thought and combat is the focus. The loot whoring i did as a dwarf warlord got a bit intense the first time i played and i admit i love that aspect of this and HoMM.  The battles in this get ridiculos when you attack one group with 3-4 of your own, its  the greatest feeling when you see a band of rogues running around the outside of your town and you go complete overkill bringing in multiple buffed up heros with all ranked up units to pick on the nerds with there light crossbows. Also you can have one unit beat numerous foes with spells from your hero who is nowhere near. i have never had the same thing happen twice yet and i love it, does get a bit boring when your trying to preserve your champion 5+ units and take over the world cause some reason they like to die for no reason in auto resolve... all in all 8/10 cause it needs some more content to it.

												Can't recommend this game enough. A magical empire building game with simmilarites between Civ 5 and Fallen Enchantress, yet unique enough to be its own game (Wizardization 5 it is not). Very polished, extremely fun combat, great graphics and a beautiful soundtrack to boot. I am finding it very hard to find fault with this game, and with future expansions will only get even better.Definately has that 'One.. More.. Turn...' factor.			"

												Great game which brings back much of what I loved from AoW 1 and 2. However, perhaps my main misgivings are just nastalgia but I find empathizing with the leaders rather meh. Early Release there were a lot of balance issues. Yet I recently got back into this game and I find it even more fun and invigorating than before. My wife has filed for a restraining order against my computer.... Looking for a gaming shack greater than 100m from my current address :) I do still find a lack of depth in regard to the spell book. While I admist some spells are OP/Amazing and all classes have equiv of this OP spell.... they arent completely balanced. For example You have spell that are individual cast on tiles to convert to forest, etc.... yet there is one spell just as in previous versions of the game that you cast and tiles will automatically expand from your domain to this unnamed type of tile. Previous versions all had this outbound growing spell of tile your race will love. Morale in this game is very well handled, even with the new DLC and the necro. I just find the customization options of GAMEPLAY, i.e. spells, quests rather lacking. Great to design your own leaders but meh..... 8/10Will continue to play in the future			"

There are many layers of depth and after 100 hours you will still be learning things.

Very very few complaints here.  Sometimes there is a lag from when you click on things for the action to take place but it could be due to the huge map size I played on.			"

												So you like 4x games? You like the exploring, expanding, exterminating, and exploiting? You also like turn based games? Well then you have come to the right game. This game revolves around empire building and toppling enemy empires. Pretty straight forward, but each game can take up to four hours to complete. The bigger the map the longer. Me and my friend did a very large map(largest you can get) in a two vs two. We won, but it took us at least 20+ hours to finish it. You found a city, build an army explore some dungeon areas to get some gear for heroes. Build bigger armies and vanquish your opponents. I would recommend getting the DLC even though it is pricey. It makes it more fun to spice up the game with more classes and races to play as. "

												This was my first Age of Wonders game. I've played tons of HoMM up to 3, but no Civ or any other 4x games. Overall I like the game and recommend it. It took me five restarts of the first campaign before I ""got"" it, so you might need to be patient.The story is indepth, if you enjoy that (admittedly I started skipping it a few missions in - just wanted to play). The graphics are great. So far I've made it through most of the Elven campaign. You get to play several different heroes. Each one has many different skills to choose. You'll find loot along the way that you equip on your heroes. There are several different quests for each map, some optional.There's lots of exploring, including underground. Lots of fighting as well. The battles are hex based, similar to tabletop games. One thing you'll learn is you'll want at least two armies when attacking. The battles are strategic - obstacles that cause line of sight penalties, flanking, hero spells, siege attacks if someone is in a city, support-group spells and abilites, etc.On the postive, I enjoy exploring the map and battling, although I auto battle a lot because it's quicker. The graphics are nice. I like the loot you pick up. As someone who's never played an AoW game before, I do find the AI challenging, even on Easy. If the AI has an advantage, it will attack your army. Any time you leave a city undefended, the AI will take it. And it seems very smart in the battles; it doesn't make dumb moves.For the negatives, I find the game repetitive. I build up my cities pretty much identical each map. So far all of the maps have just been ""Defeat the other players."" Manual battles can be lengthy which makes it tough if you have limited playing time. There is such an advantage to being in a city for a fight that you can trap the AI in a city as you buildup other armies to attack. I've run into this repeatedly - having to track down ""turtled"" enemy heroes in cities and build up large enough armies to win.There are some negatives for me, but I do still enjoy playing the game. I'm almost finished with the Elven campaign and hoping the other campaign offers more than just ""Defeat all enemies"" every map.			"

There are tons of different units, each with different stats and abilities depending on which race they are, and the ""heroes"" can be equipped with weapons, shields, armours, and mounts that you find when exploring the map's dungeons.The fantasy theme of this game is done extremely well, and I would say this is one of the only strategy games of this kind I truly enjoy and would recommend to anyone.

												Great fun! You really feel like you are constructing your own empire and building your own world. Your sad when units die because they are so important to level up and keep going. I've never played on the hardest difficulty and as a result by the time I get to the end of the game my armies and units are too powerful to make a challenge of it. If this type of game looks interesting to you than I'm sure you will have fun and enjoy yourself. A large mix of races make for an interesting mix of battle types and winning feels so damn good.

												If you like 4x type games this is a good one, if you like rpgs.... well if you like 4x its a good one. But seriously a good solid game. If you want a Civ type game is a fantasy setting this is one of the best ones out there. Lots of customization and depth. Very detailed character creation and great mechanics for customizing the play to your own style. Want to sneak up on your enemies? Smite them from afar? Smash them with giant machines? Blast them with terrible magics? Negotiate with them (coward... jk)?  you can do it here.First the basics-Graphics- immersive and well executed, solid if not flashy. 8/10Gameplay- Easy to play and learn. It has good depth when you want to dive down into the mechanics. 9/10Music/SF- Nothing jarring or off putting, but nothing epic either. Always switched to my own tunes fairly quickly. 5/10Content- Lots of good stuff on the map, fun to explore. Plenty of scenarios and several main campaigns, but no really engaging stories, I find I go to randoms maps as I come back to the game. as a RPG 4/10, as a 4X 9/10.Ok so now lets look at this as a 4x-eXplore- This is probably my favorite part of the game. Many and various encounters on the map lead to a lot of variety in gameplay. This has a feel like Heros of M&M 3, with maps full of goodies. eXpand- Not really part of the game. Oh sure you grow your city and maybe build a couple more, but there is no real benefit or mechanic for the massive empire in this game. eXploit- Magic always makes this fun. I really enjoy the way it lets you manipulate the environment of the game. Lots of ways to customize your character to fit your style. eXterminate- This is were this game shines. It has good combat mechanics that make each battle different, but also allows you to turn things over to the AI when you get too bogged down late game. Every race and every class bring their own unit types and style to combat, making it extremely variable and challenging.In the end I recommend this game. If you saw RPG and came for that turn around now, but otherwise a good game and worth the price.			"

												Age of Wonders 3... the depth of this game is immense! I love the combat structure and its depth. both a blessing and a curse are how long it takes to play and learn this game. Its possibly the best TBS out there but that is debatable.Frustrating at times when you are 5 hours into a mission and realise then that you have already lost.Very satisfying to win the big combats too!

												Having played most fantasy turn based strategy games since Master of Magic, I can honestly say that Age of Wonders III is a worthy addition to the genre.  It looks and sounds great, runs smoothly, and (unlike most of the venerable fantasy TBS,) has an AI that actually shows up and tries to win.  However, if you go into the game with the same attitude that you might have in the older games, you might not have much fun.Age of Wonders III is about conquest and fighting.  Everything you do in this game must drive you to this goal.  You cannot explore the map lazily looking for secrets, build armies of ""fluff"" because dwarf axemen are cool, or waste your mana terriforming cities when the enemy is at the gates.  In this game you have to constantly be on the lookout for ways to exploit the map, and for enemies to come out of nowhere.  By the end of the game, the surviving empires may be two giant war machines endlessly pumping units at each other from across the map (thankfully, rally points have been added.)  The last battles will, in drawn out cases, consist entirely of massive stacks of the most powerful units.  This may or may not be okay with people.I'll admit, I'm the kind of person who wants his last army to look like something from Lord of the Rings, just a huge mass of swords and bows being thrown at a huge mass of orcs.  Sadly, that will rarely happen, as this huge mass of men would just be slaughtered by a smaller mass of dragons, giants, war machines or those horrible Manticore Riders.  Indeed, I was a bit frustrated when my army of dwarven crossbowmen behind a stone wall was slaughtered by a handful of these units.  I guess what I'm trying to say with this is that this game will not make you feel like you are really leading an army of fantasy creatures in a great war.  Neither does a game of Magic the Gathering, but it sure is fun.On the subject of the AI, if you leave it alone, then you will see it turning into a massive war machine with the aforementioned rallypoints and Tier 4 units slogging across the map.  AI Knight has learned a few things since Age of Wonders II.  While it is still possible to see some tactical blunders (suiciding flyers for example) it puts up a better fight than most without extra help.  Admittedly, I haven't seen if it gets any, but I haven't noticed anything from it that made me call foul.If I have to criticize it, it would be that most games play pretty much the same, requiring a similar strategy from the player to win based on race and class choice, and the layout of the map, while it may throw occaisional curveballs at you, has little to do with how things progress.  But in that criticism I just described many games that are perfectly fine, as is this one (Heroes of Might and Magic series might be the exception there, but look how good the last one of those was...)  The fun in a game like that is to optimize that strategy to perfect it, while someone across the battlefield from you tries to counter it.  The game's AI does not forgive you if you screw up. Really if I wanted to throw out things I'd like, it'd be some degree of city specialization (choose between buildings rather than just build everything everywhere,) more options for creating items and creating/leveling characters, and maybe some map structures that can change the course of the game (special unit recruitment, buffs to city created units such as Master of Magics ""Adamantium Deposits"") and so on.  Also, with all the terriforming and terrain changing options, I want terrain to mean more to me during the game.  Maybe I'm just not paying attention to it, but right now, I only terriform for a little extra gold from cities and for looks.  Its still cool though, changin the world into a frozen wasteland or a sweltering jungle.  I do miss the Shadow World though, and the Dark Elves, and the Nomads, hell, even the Halflings, but I am sure I'll see them all again.There will be DLC, and I will pay for it.  The game world can only get bigger and better, and Triumph really seems to be putting all their effort into it.tldr: Its very fun.  And competitive.  Its not building an epic empire in a grand story, its all about stomping your enemies into the dirt.  And it ends like Clash of the Titans except with more Titans.  Its not Age of Wonders II, but Age of Wonders II didn't magically disappear or anything.  And you can make a Dwarf Succubus.  Seriously.			"

												Review as of the Eighth of May, 2014.After about 60-70 hours in total with recorded time and offline time in this four X game, I have to commend it.As with every 4X game, this one has a distinct love of two of them, eXploit and eXterminate. Let's start with that.The command, unlike some other games, namely Fallen Enchantress, which is the main comparrison I'll be making, is rather dull. It takes about 25-70 turns, depending on what's in its domain, to complete the city entirely, and each city has to make that trek and the only real thing that changes it is the Raze, Plunder and Migrate options for each city, which is a nice touch, since each race has its own benefits.  Compared to Fallen Enchantress, though, the cities feel... Dull. It's the same path each time, and once you get all your class specific units, the entire war units tree is useless. One main problem I have with it, and this is a personal quipe, but oh well, is that the cities just suddenly... get taken over. Anything above a city I'm practically yelling at the screen with the general rage when a group of SCOUT units, which literally are so easy to kill that a tier four takes 1 damage to them, takes over your throne city/any other metropolis. That was a major turn off for me.Now, onto the war section. The combat is probably the most fun I've had in a 4X. It's really slick, it carries weight, and the seiges are fun. The general feel of the units are amazing, with specific combinations practically winning seiges and battles. The units all have unique rolls on the battlefield, some are tanks that don't deal much damage, or a ""Give them the plague!"" units that makes whatever they attack weaker. And one of my favorite, and at the same time least favorite, mechanics is that each battlefield consists of six hexes that each unit on takes part in. But then comes the little problem of top teir units being stacked and being literally impossible in a city to dislodge. And the units that aren't inside the gates on the map spawning on the battlefield suddenly inside it. That irritated me that you couldn't just send an army to fight one another. But, despite the units unique to each faction, I kept feeling the same feeling of ""These are rather generic units"" at the end of the game, since every end game unit tends to be what you'd expect. They should flesh it out a lot more and add either entire unit customization or just athestic customization. Oh. And heroes are practically useless unless you totally defend them with everything, since they're so low health and defence.The explore and expand elements are generally how it feels in other games, use the explore to get loot and make more of the same generic city over the map. And don't even get me started on how useless the neautral city AI are. They're there for one purpose: Be conquered!All in all, though, I'd say it's an amazing game with its problems that can be fixed with just a smidge of effort, or if a modder is willing, they could always fix it.Overall opinion: For me, personally, I like more diplomancy and less masses of war units everywhere. 8/10. I recommend it, I got my money's worth out of it.			"

												I give this game a 8 out of 10.The game reminds you strongly of Heroes of Might and Magic.  Your character travels the map, explores locations, and takes controll of resource points.  Combat isn't as developed as HoMM.  Your troops are deployed randomly and your find yourself really missing being able to line up your troops as you see fit.  Also lacks the variety of HoMM's tactical combat options for your units.The game also strongly reminds you of Elemental Fallen enchantress.  You can send out units to colonize and expand your realm.  Building different buildings expands the zone of controll for each city.  It falls a little short of the Elemental comparison with the lack of RPG elements and the variety of items to equip your character with.The storyline for the two campaigns is decent, the single female voice actress does a great job, but you find yourself wishing for a few animated cutscenes to spice things up.  Each mission is more or less the same.  Build up your troops and take out your enemies.  It can get a little stale after about 20 hours though.			"

												There have been a lot of new entries in the Fantasy 4X Strategy genre in recent years. For a long time though it seems like the genre has peaked with classics like Master of Magic, and Heroes of Might an Magic 3. The latter being a personal favorite of mine. Now after a long wait we are getting games that are really good again like Fallen Enchantress, and Warlock. Age of Wonders 3 however is probably my new favorite out of all of them.You can tell when playing it that the designer has probably played all of the games I mentioned above, and more. The game takes many good ideas of those titles incorporating in with some good ideas of it's own. The result feels really solid. Almost like a greatest hits album of the genre. It's important to know though that the title is focused more on the competitive element. This isn't an empire builder like Civ where you can sit in a corner, and focus on culture or something. It's built as a war game. Those that go into understanding that, and craving it will have a better time.			"

												This game is a rare treat. I was looking for a game to scratch my ""Disciples: Sacred Lands"" itch and found a game that played like a hybrid of the aforementioned itch and the later games of the ""Civilization"" franchise. Gameplay is enjoyable and well developed, but not so complicated that it detracts from the over-all experience. Animations such as the number of soldiers in a unit being a visible ""health bar"" for the overall unit is a nice touch, as are the animations in general. I have had much enjoyment watching my Dwarven Musketeers open fire against the flank of an Orc Spearmen unit. Or my Elven Longbowmen fire wave after wave of arrows into their foes. The lore is well done, and not too heavy or crying out for your undivided attention, but there is enough there to get you into the game's mechanics, whilst leaving room for DLC and add on campaigns and scenarios which will help this already interesting game stay fresh. A good soundtrack with a variety of fantasy inspired tracks doesn't hurt either, I have found myself humming along to the soundtrack on more than one occasion. A privilege in strategy games previously only enjoyed by Paradox. Multiplayer is remincent of other games in the genre. I would recommend playing it with close friends, or people in the same room as big maps with strangers would be a bold, and overly optimistic state of affairs.All in all a good experience fully worth the money advertised. I fully expect many hours to be lost to this little gem and would not lament that fact.			"

												I never played the original, but I loved Age of Wonders II. So coming into this as a fan of AoW2, my expectations were high, and I honestly wasn't disappointed. I love this game for so many reasons, from leader creation and customization to the way your race tints the special units your class affords you. The game is visually beautiful and fairly well-paced, and the random map generator has always delivered a world I genuinely enjoyed exploring and conquering.AoW3 suits a number of play styles and victory conditions, all of which you can toggle on or off. The battles require thought and planning a little more than raw power. A number of weak units can take down a smaller number of more powerful units if you position everyone correctly and use just the right spells at the right times. I get a genuine sense of pride every time I successfully bring down a powerful enemy army.There are, of course, a few things that could stand to be improved. I'd like more customization options as far as hair is concerned, and there are some lighting issues and minor clipping problems on some of the unit models. However, all of these issues are superficial and very easy to overlook. I don't find they detract from my experience at all.Excellent game if you enjoy fantasy, strategy or 4X games, and an absolutely superb game if you enjoy all three!			"

												I am a great fan of the whole series of Age of Wonder so when I discovered it for linux I didn't hesitate to buy it.The game is the worthy descendant of the dynasty and I found in it what I was expecting.Other people wrote better and more complete reviews so I will point out the only two things I didn't like:1. Only watchtowers can be razed. It's a pity because razing opponent structures was an important strategy element.2. The campaigns (at least the two I finished) are a bit short: their scenarios take a lot of time to complete but there are few of them. I would have preferred more and shorter (not easier!) scenarios.However these are just two details that I didn't like: overall the game is wonderful, so thumb up without hesitation!			"

												Oh yes!Age of Wonders remastered, with slight mechanics changes to make it more balanced (like hero progression and spells) then unbalanced back into different classes' matchmaking. Even if it doesn't seem like it at first glance but it has bigger depth then the predecessors, just wating to be slowly discovered constantly keeping it fresh and new.If you're into this kind of game this is the very apogee and you will play it for MANY years to come. Can't see how things can get better that this.Devs are really good and reactive, they treat matters like 4k resolutions and 5 different operating systems compatibilities, powerful modding tools have been added in only three months.Also strong community supportthis is what Steam sais on the Community Page : ""Most popular community and official content for the past week.""

												At a younger age I played ""Master of Magic"" by Microprose. Loved that game and spent countless hours playing it. When Age of Wonders came along, I had a ton of fun with that as well. Shadow magic and Age of Wonders two were also a lot of fun. This one however, I didn't really like. They've taken a step away from the high fantasy setting and tried to incorporate steam punk into the game, which in turn makes it a mish mash of two different settings. They should have gone with the original concept or simply made a steam punk game and call it something else. The previous games did have some hints of steam punk with the dwarven faction, but this time around it's all over the place and magic feels like a secondary thought in a game that's supposedly about magic.The story isn't really that good, just a repetition of previous installments, but not performed as well and kind of boring.The game is to it's core the same as previous games, but the i.e. lack of diversity between the races is gone, now instead it is based on ""classes"" what type of units you get. It's not a bad game but I was expecting more of a third installment. Magic doesn't feel as useful as previous games, other than perhaps some very late game summons that pretty much instant win the game for you. There's a ton of loot for your heroes, which is quite nice (but feels over the top at times, i.e. there is a spell where you can summon eggs that turn into mounts and I just spammed that spell until I got the best mounts in the game for all my heroes) and heroes are still very useful addition to your armies. I liked the introduction of mounts for heroes, that affected how they move both in the world and tactical map (even gives some stats). The music is as always good, could have used a few more tracks though. While it might seem like I am bashing the game, I'm not, it simply wasn't what I expected it to be. If you enjoyed the previous AoW games you should give it a try, I played through both sides on the original AoW III, but didn't feel like it was worth my time playing the expantions/dlc, I'd rather just give the original games another go.

												This is my favorite game right now.  It has the best of expected stratagy game features, and extends the standard by including features that were missing in other empire building games.You can not only choose your leaders, but you can customize there face, hair, clothes. You can also pick the scene background for there leader screen.  You can also decide on the pose. very sweet.  I like the feelling of entering the buildings on the map.  I really like being able to move the pieces during tacticle battles. The unit banners have the health meter, so I pick on the weakest guy.Naval battles actually take place on the water, and ""Embarked"" units are standing on boats while they fight.  The research takes place from a spell book, which is cool. The mini map is more custamizable than I was used to. The landscape textures are beautiful.Zooming out on the strategic map and having the map become a ""cloth"" map with drafted geographic features, makes this seem even more emersive.  It is very similar to the map in the end pages of ""The Hobbit"".Speaking of fantasy, the realm and genre one has come to expect from fantasy rpgs is well represented.From undead, to will-o-whisps. Mermaids and Krakens; Kobolds, and Dragons.  Treasure, gold, mana, and Hero pick ups.I had gotten fairly good at my usual stratagy war game, so I am humbled at how involved the added calculations and stats, the RPG world encompasses.  Good bad, Creation, destruction; the 4 elements; Arch Druids compared to dreadnaughts, or necromancers.So much fun! So much to ""get into""The single most excelent awsome feature is the Modding Support.Import your blender models! Download the Rigged models from the developer! Extend the Resources that are already in the game! Customize the story line.Linked maps in a custom campaign.  Program quests! Build underground worlds! The creation Engine alone is worth every pennie I spent, (My goblin leader is Pennie the Pincher)			"

												It's a fun tactical strategy game with some rpg elements. There is a decent number of unique units and spells which make each class feel unique. There are many items to find, which—along with the randomized maps—increases the replayability by quite a bit. There are other games like this, but this one is well polished and well updated.			"

												This game is great whether you're a fan of the series, a fan of strategy games, or just a newcomer to these kind of games. Learning the gameplay might take a tad bit but when you start playing you'll find yourself bargaining time away just so you can play one more turn. The single player is pretty much where most people start, in order to learn the game mechanics and the game does that pretty well, by the time I got to the thrid level I was already building proper armies, upgrading cities, and destroying other empires. The game's AI is smart even on easy and you will find them hitting your weak points if you underestimate them while the hardest difficulty pushes you to use everything in your power to win, also although you can build alliances with the AI it is actually very hard to do so because most of the time they're in it for themselves but then again so are we so peace most of the time will not be in your options. You can also fight the battles yourself on a field but after awhile I just kept using auto battle unless it was a battle that I needed to be won then I took control but do know that one level can take a long time to complete because you'll be managing your cities, planning strategies for the future, or something else which will take time unless you're blitzing all the time. The music really is well made, the graphics are great, the multiplayer is fun and in a nutshell this game is very entertaining			"

												This is a game that makes me look up and look at the clock and realise that 7 hours of my life has just passed by and it is suddenly light outside and oh god I need to sleep before I have to go to work and oh alright then, just one more turn and then I will defintiely go to bed... Stylistically it is a cartoony version of games such as Heroes of Might and Magic where you control a Hero and their own faction of fantasy scamps out to do valiant battle against other assorted fantasy tropes and critters. But under the cheery colourful exterior there is a very good game that, although with limitations, scratches almost all of my fantasy strategy empire building rpg itches. The RPG style Hero levelling and item system is well executed. The empire building is decent. The battles can be pretty fun and sometimes even quite challenging. The diplomacy is about as good as any other 4X game I've played and not as awful as some of them although I have yet to try to win diplomatically and so I am not sure if that is even an option. I have not played AoW 1 or 2 so I have no idea if they are better or worse than this installment but as I said, I think this one is addictive good fun.Now I feel that there is room for improvement. The late game is a bit of a boring grind; as your cities expand they all turn out a bit samey. The AI is not terrible and I have been beaten by it a few times but I wish they would actually do a bit of empire building on its own: they never build roads or forts for example. Perhaps it is better against human players but as I have no friends I have yet to experience that aspect of the game.All in all, if you like your 4X's but feel that CIV V doesn't feature enough ogres, imps or kobold minions then you should defintiely give this title a go. Also the two first expansions are good additions that in my opinion adds a lot of essential content to the vanilla game so maybe wait for a sale to get the bundle. Just a tip.			"

												Age of Wonders, a classic, something I played devoutly when I was a kid. The third installation in the series however, as expected, is far more difficult. Ramped up to be challenging and to compel thought, to really take the turn based 'strategy' to its word. This is a game where you don't really have your hand held, and you've got to consider what units may be your best option during certain parts of the campaigns. The story's also tasty enough to eat with a dash of olive oil and pepper.			"

												Grading Scale:10 - Masterpiece9 - Amazing8 - Great7 - Good6 - Okay5 - Mediocre4 - Bad3 - Terrible2 - Abomination1 - UnplayableGame: Age of Wonders IIISummary: Turn-based strategy game with some RPG elements and a fantasy setting.Pros:Combat- Refreshing and fun for a turn based strategy game. Although some flaws are evident (will go over it in the ""cons"" section). Combat takes place in a battlefield that takes into account the type of terrain you were on when combat was initiated. You can move your units around and place them in strategic areas around the field.Character Customization- Able to customize your hero with different hairstyles and certain cosmetic options such as armor and head pieces. RPG Elements- Able to equip your hero with items that are obtained throughout the world. You can also level your hero and have him/her learn new spells and moves. Among these units are mounts which really give your hero a unique feel.Units- Each unit is unique and inspired. Although you cannot customize your units the same way you can your hero, they each have their own unique abilities and appearance.Cons:Limited Victories: Although diplomacy is possible, the style of the game begs for a conquest win. The resources at your disposal for any other type of victories are simply not worth the effort. It's a lot of fun to just stomp through everything with your unique armies.Repetitiveness- After playing for a while. Combat can get a bit tedious to a point where you just find yourself skipping it altogether. Once that happens, the rest of the game just doesn't hold up. Combat is the fun part of this game, not so much the diplomacy.Verdict: Fun turn-based strategy game with a fun twist on combat that suffers from repetitiveness. The hero development, different class system and customization adds for a unique experience everytime you play the game.Score: 7			"

												Fallen Enchantress, Eat your heart out.This 4X Fantasy game allows for a deep level of customization that captures the creativity of Fallen Enchantress while providing a more aesthetically pleasing, polished experience. Diplomatic and overworld gameplay remains similar to the Civilization series, while not quite as robust. It does make up for it with its level of creative control. Create your own civilization leader from a host of classes and racial combinations. Both your class and race affect the type of units your empire will have access to. If you play a rogue, depend on having stealth units, assassins and the like. Play a dreadnaught? Youll have rifleman and steam tanks. A warlord? How does having a legion of berserkers sound? While you cant directly modify individual units like fallen enchantress, the sheer vareity at your disposal makes that irrelavant.If youre looking for a high fantasy themed civilization style 4X game with RPG elements, look no further.

You can easiely take on armies three times your size if you outplay/out manouver them so to counter this there seem to be AI armies running around made up of 6 Heroes. All the same level. To make it even worse you see a say level 5 enemy hero, with stats and buffs only reachable by lvl 20, like a lvl 5 arch druid with 18 armour 14 resistance and around 10 different individual buffs, ohh and a never ending mana pool, so it can just hit you with stoning 12 times in 1 fight.

But not the NEED to do it that way.  Alliance wins means you don't have to wipe everyone off the map.  You have to explore to unmap areas.  Basically your 4x type of game.

												Age of Wonders III is one of those games that won't grab you instantly. But if you stick with it and learn the ropes, you'll find yourself playing for hours and telling yourself ""just one more turn"". The game isn't perfect, but it is one of the deepest 4x fantasy TBS game that I've played in recent years, with its strongest element being the combat system. Easily recommended to any TBS enthusiast out there.

												If you're a fan of the previous installments of the series; buy it. Immediately! You won't be disappointed. The only real downside, that I can think of, would be that it's lacking in races/armies, seeing as how its predecessors offered many more. We can only hope more will be added over time.			"

												If you are a fan of the genre, you needn't think about whether or not you need this game. It doesn't necassarily bring a whole lot of new ideas to the table, but what it does do, it does very well. In fact, it is one of the most well made game's I've recently played.			"

												It's like civ 5 and Heroes of Might and Magic 3, but delete 90% of the civ 5 diplomacy (The Diplomacy in this game is ""I'll kill you now"" and ""I'll kill you in like 30 minutes k?"") and the empire management and replace it with murdering things, heroes, 100x better combat, awesome spells and DIRE PENGUINS D:RIP in peace the next 1000000 billion hours of my life :3			"

												Just Another Review.Well so I bought this game because everyone who has played a kings bounty, disciples, heroes of might and magic?, civ and etc type of turn based strategy game will get the itch to play another if they discover they like it.Ive put around 20-30 hours into this game single player only (commonwealth) and I was pleasently suprised. After I wrapped around the controls which for whatever reason seemed backwards (left and right mouse buttons would be vise versa if i made things lol), I got pretty into the game and keep coming back. Although I could say a lot more, I am going to summarize things in bullet form as best i can and I will likely miss some things:Thinks I think that could be improved:-The research tree is still rather baffling if you want to plan ahead or unlock certain things unless you have played a lot. If it was set up like in civilization with some kind of flow chart it would be a lot easier to prioritize.-Combat animations are kinda crumby with the units (i'm just whining nothing that harms the game)-The hero cannot die clause. Warcraft 2 all over again. In the campaign you basically just keep your hero in the back away from harm and cast spells unless you want him focus'ed by the AI and to reload your save. Personally I think the hero's need more durability else they essentially just play a support role for most of the fight, cuz when they die everything stops. You aren't going to siege a city without those wonderful buffs they give all the units in the army pack nor will you go and explore ruins/want to fight if a hero isn't milking exp.-The exp system, it should essentially award everyone in the army attacking or not. Win a battle: gain most exp, lose a battle: hero gets some exp everyone else is dead lol, Run from a battle get no exp (since running could be abused). I essentially just have hero use a ranged ability to kill off whatever i can (safely) as to net more exp.-The AI during sieges, if you have 2 trebuchets you can basically funnel all the enemies through a narrow hole in the wall, ive beat a few ""very likely defeat"" situations abusing this with a very small army. If the enemy is more numerous then you past a certain extent they should just bum rush you out the gates and cut u off instead of hole up and get picked off.-Spellcasting seems kind of wonky, losing your hero for casting oil skin almost doesnt seem worth it... some spells should perhaps count as your cast and not your hero turn and the more powerful will take both... Things I dont understand yet....:-I still have no idea the use of teraforming whatsoever. Ive never encountered any situation where i would want to change my land type. Nor have unhappy people, nor really see any issues being good/evil.-Why we have so many damn resources, gold is fine for the most part, but mana crystals im always swimming in them early on and for the rest of the scenario.Things that shine:-Battles are really fun when in the open areas with a lot of obstacles around.-The unique units are quite diverse so far from what i see-Game isn't the prettiest but I really like the looks of everything-campaign is enjoyable and each level takes a fair bit of time to complete thoroughly and im just playing on easy mode to speed through~ u get a lot of playtime in this game!-The voice acting is quite good, I love the intro dialogues they are read very very well.If you want my comments on anything be sure to post and ask ill give my 2 cents.Hope this is useful lol			"

												Should you buy Age of Wonders 3? Yes, but there's a catch.ABOVE AVERAGE for its priceThe game is visually impressive with a lot of love and care taken to make the game the best it could possibly be. The problem is, the game lacks... ambition. The combat is really all there is to the game and while its fulfilling early on, it tends to drag on late game. You'll spend hours clearing the resource points of monsters and enemy camps to build a safe and sprawling empire only to realize that your empire is just to feed your warmachine, nothing else. At which its very easy to proclaim yourself the winner because what reward is there to finishing a solo game?Which leads to the other problem, multiplayer. 4x strategy games are really meant for multiplayer matches. Its a wonderful race to see who can build what faster, stronger, and diplomatic better. However AoW 3 doesn't lend itself well to MP games because of time and lack of any real substantial diplomacy.-time, essentially you either sacrifice time to enjoy the game and its combat the way its meant to be played, or you turn the quick autobattles on and skip over the big tactical portion of the game. Its a lose lose either way.-Diplomacy is lacking because there is no real benefit to peace other than a secure border but, who's to say your peaceful neighbor won't just backstab you? As there is no consequence for breaking your word, no morale penalties, no reduced gold income or productivity, nothing. The flip side is also true, no economical advantages to being at peace :(Despite all that its still a good game and I enjoyed very much of it, its just sad to see so much potential fizzle out.+Graphics, a very rich, visually appealing game+Tactical combat is very satisfying+-Replay value is there, but late game becomes tedious management and busy work... I've yet to finish a single random scenario-No tech tree, research randomness in a strategy game is a bit disappointing-Good luck finding a rewarding mp experience for a game that is by design, not meant for multiplayer-DLC is a bit disapointing			"

Age of Wonders III and its both addons offer:- 9 different races, 7 unique hero classes and additional specialization possibilites for the main hero- Allows for fancy leader customization, e.g. chaotic evil Halfling Warlord with devil horns yearning to take over the world.- Beautiful soundtrack, consisting of 46 tracks- Solid modding tools are available for adjusting the game to one's own liking- Random map generator provides you and your friends with countless hours of entertainment after (actually whenever you want) the four campaigns and the scenarios have been completed.- Excellent multiplayer stability with almost nonexistent connectivity problems, even during long session			"

I've been waiting for some quality fantasy 4x for years, after getting a taste for them with a mod for CIv IV.

												If you like to play strategic games then this is a game for you. It is different from the earlier games, it really misses the aow feeling from the old games but it also makes it a kind of refreshing. I'm still missing the old wizards and there ways and secretly hope they will return. This games keeps me playing the campains and other multriplayers so for that alone i would reccomend it, if you are new to aow I also would reccomend it. if you are and old player from the older versions you are in for a big change, don't get your hopes up to high and look trough the new design.

												This game is just getting better and better. At first, I was a bit disappointed but for each expansion added they just added more and more content to the game. More campaigns, more scenarios, more races, new class. It start to feel more and more like Age of Wonders 1 again but with a class system and city building for more controlled expansion. For each patch, for each expansion it just becomes better! It should be a game in every X4 fans collection. To put it on something familiar, add a dose of Heroes 3, add a dose of Civilisation, add a does of roleplaying. You get Age of Wonders III.  A 9 out of 10 game right now for me. But I might be a bit biased, being a long term fan of 15 years with this series. But I recommend it to everyone who enjoy this kind of games.			"

												As for someone, who spent quite some time of his childhood playing Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic, information about sequel get was like a god's gift. Which of course lead me to fear, that AoW 3 will be one of the many disappointing sequel's of amazing games (like Heroes V and onward, Disciples and Majesty to name a few).I couldn't be any further from truth! This game is not only as good as it's precedessor, but I could even argue that it's better, getting rid of some annoying mechanics and replacing them with something actually more fun. While the game isn't free of mistakes, the developers work hard on it, and actually already have fixed a lot issues with gameplay I had when I started playing this.If you wanna try something of a mix between Civilization and Heroes with an actually pretty interesting story and climatic world... Well, I'd recommend you exactly this one.			"

												I have sunk a great amount of time on this, and for good reason. Age of Wonders III is as of this review my favorite fantasy 4X game of all time, the only one capable of (in my opinion) standing up to the original Master of Magic.I could stay here all day and talk about every single little thing about this game, but it's frankly unnecessary. Age of Wonders III is a fantastic game from top to bottom, with a wealth of races and classes which mix up the gameplay in an endless stream of permutations and possibilities. The combat is fun and equally diverse, the overworld maps are filled with different types of structures, resources and powerups, different alignments and biomes and events, and with the two expansions, there are a whopping four new races to pick from. The skimirsh may be the game's heart, but the single-player campaign is surprisingly competent, and it comes with all the multiplayer standbies which you've come to expect from the genre.If there is a single thing I would fault this game for, is the old evil that plagues the entire genre - an underdeveloped, dysfunctional diplomacy system. Then again, it would be exceedingly rare to find a 4X that actually gets it right.Honestly, it's almost too much of a good thing. But if you love 4X, you probably don't need my review to know that this game is worth every penny. And if you don't - hey, give it a go anyway, you might just fall in love.			"

												One of the best games of this genre since Heroes of Might and Magic II... seriously amazing!  It follows the same style where you pick a main hero who has a race and a class, with three specialties (Spell Masteries, traits etc).  You build cities and go exploring and BATTLING.  Yeah, the game is all about the combat so if you're looking for something like CIvilization you will be sorely disappointed with this one.  The combat is excellent and strategic.  Units can level up during battles, and eventually, can become quite strong if they've been with you since the beginning of the game.  The game has flanking, attacks of opportunity, line of sight bonuses and penalties (however, no friendly fire with ranged attack, so that's a plus), Overwhelm, Status Effects, Special Movement Types... I don't know what more you could ask for in the combat part. In terms of things that aren't combat like city management, etc... Yeah - it's limited.  Diplomacy leaves me scratching my head and there's no options to make other players necessarily like you, just peace treaties or alliance proposals.  City buildings basically fall into either resource production (for that glorious army you're building) or unit recruitment buiildings so it's easy enough to get into.  It may be rather simple, but that's how Heroes of Might and Magic II was and man if this isn't the spirtual succesor to that game I don't know what is.			"

Rewarding skirmish matches, an exemplary campaign experience (and if you purchase the DLCs you'll have more campaigns to enjoy!), wonderful character creation, great mods, and a smooth as silk feel to it makes this a real hidden gem in the 4X category.If you're looking for a great game to pick up and sink some hours into, this is the time to buy folks!

This game really gets you into both the roleplaying and strategy aspects through customizing your hero through trying to figure out what spells will help you beat down your opponents.I suck at reviews, just buy it already.

Yeah, the game is all about the combat so if you're looking for something like CIvilization you will be sorely disappointed with this one.  The combat is excellent and strategic.  Units can level up during battles, and eventually, can become quite strong if they've been with you since the beginning of the game.  The game has flanking, attacks of opportunity, line of sight bonuses and penalties (however, no friendly fire with ranged attack, so that's a plus), Overwhelm, Status Effects, Special Movement Types... I don't know what more you could ask for in the combat part. In terms of things that aren't combat like city management, etc... Yeah - it's limited.  Diplomacy leaves me scratching my head and there's no options to make other players necessarily like you, just peace treaties or alliance proposals.  City buildings basically fall into either resource production (for that glorious army you're building) or unit recruitment buiildings so it's easy enough to get into.  It may be rather simple, but that's how Heroes of Might and Magic II was and man if this isn't the spirtual succesor to that game I don't know what is.			"

												As for someone, who spent quite some time of his childhood playing Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic, information about sequel get was like a god's gift. Which of course lead me to fear, that AoW 3 will be one of the many disappointing sequel's of amazing games (like Heroes V and onward, Disciples and Majesty to name a few).I couldn't be any further from truth! This game is not only as good as it's precedessor, but I could even argue that it's better, getting rid of some annoying mechanics and replacing them with something actually more fun. While the game isn't free of mistakes, the developers work hard on it, and actually already have fixed a lot issues with gameplay I had when I started playing this.If you wanna try something of a mix between Civilization and Heroes with an actually pretty interesting story and climatic world... Well, I'd recommend you exactly this one.			"

												4.5 Stars - An engaging strategy epic that will easily hit home for fans of games like Civilisation and the HoMM series.I hadn't played the earlier AoW gamess when I started this but was very happy with the mix of emprie building and tatical battles. The core game contians two campaigns which alone can be 100+ game hours.The combinations of racial benefits and class skills give you strategic freedom into your city buiding and army mix. Heroes have RPG elements and will become significantly powerful with both levels and loot over the course of the campaign.Pros -Tatical BattlesReplayability & game sizeEmpire designCons -Artwork can appear clumsy on lower resolutions tho the prevelance of small detiails will overcome this if you can play on higher settings			"

Hours tick by as if they were minutes. Sometimes I wont rest until Ive explored every nook and crany of the map, hoping to find special treasure for my generals like an amazing staff that acts as a magical melee weapon, and the ability to call down an aoe storm.

												The game is a winner, as far as I have played it so far. I have always been a fan of strategy, whether it be turn-based or real-time, but also have like many other genres too. I have many games that compete for my limited game time, but this one is winning hands-down at the moment. While there are some definite 'Heroes of Might and Magic' parallels, it feels much more holistic. The tactical fighting is great, and just gets better the more I learn about the units and the mechanics. The leveling system for each unit is great, and makes you really try to keep the unit alive, granting better powers and giving each experienced unit a sense of being less 'replaceable' by the next newly produced unit. This means that rather than sending them to their doom just to finish the battle faster, or being too careless or clumsy, you really want to make sure they get involved (to get more xp), but keep them from sacrificing themselves for a worthless cause.The Heroes are great, and with so much customisation as they level up, it leaves you forever wishing you had more points to throw at their skills. This also makes it juicily special when they level up. And, even better is that it can really make a difference to the battles, whether it be the spells that enhance your 'shock troopers' to take and dish-out a heap of punishment, or enhancing your hero so they themselves become a mobile game-changer wherever they tread.The city development is interesting too. It does not boast the most exhaustive list of buildings, but in the early-mid game it promotes the development of a city so that it specialises in one or two troop types. I really like this because it means you can plan your overall strategy with more effectiveness. Including thinking about how to get your slow-moving troops to the enemy - do you build them in the close cities, or build roads between cities, or keep each city more generic and have lower level or lower tiered troops. Lots of delicious approaches.Another big plus is the ability to play offline. Which is great as I often travel. Cloud auto-saves can also help me progress on either my PC or laptop.If you like strategy, and multiple approaches to victory - then this game is for you. Heroes class and race make a difference, and the constant difficult choice of which spells and skills to choose is fantastic. Runs surprisingly well on low specs too.Cons - can't save the game mid-way through a battle, music is not amazing (but who really plays these games for the music).Please enjoy!			"

												I recommend this game but only just and here is why. First of all, let's start off with the positives about this game. The graphics are excellent and there is a lot of replay value in this game. The storyline is very interesting if these type of RPG games interest you as this is one of those turn-based games with a somewhat unpredictable outcome. So carefull planning is advisable. I like the scenario mode the best as the Draconians is my preferred clan that I like to use that is leaded by Rish Kyan. While I am not going to spoil anything. You will have to play the game yourself to fully experience it. The game also has multiplayer mode when you can play matches against your friends. So that is some of the good parts that this game has but the major downside is with the AI as in my experiences and with two days of not much progress. From what I have learned is that if you upgrade and max out your units. The AI will be much stronger and tougher to beat and in some cases. The AI is not that well balanced from my experiences of playing this game as it is just too aggressive in easy mode for a casual gamer which can be frustrating. All in all. that is the only one major downside to an otherwise a very enjoyable game :).Overall Rating: 7/10.			"

												Have to give this game the highest recommendation- it's currently the king of the fantasy 4X genre (and this is despite me loving Sorcerer King as well), provided you get the expansions.It's lots of fun using Goblins in this game- how many games have fun Goblins?   You can also kill Notch if you feel like it.That said, Notch is good people in my book just for helping to fund this game.Lots of options to choose from,  good MP options, lots of variety.The only real knocks I put on the game is that it's a bit slow to launch , and the AI can't play by all of the rules of a human, unlike GalCiv3, but even there it does a competent enough job.PBEM option is great as well.

												7/10Age of Wonders III combines elements of basic city building with tactical combat and simplistic RPG aspects. The tactical battles are fun and are Age of Wonder's main component. On the downside, the storyline gets tedious as you seem to reset your progress as you move to each map. Instead of following one team of epic heroes from the beginning to the end, you are constantly introduced to new heroes that you need to level up to make them useful in a fight. Following a single team throughout the entire game would have been a more fun and rewarding experience. After completing several scenarios I grew bored with the structure of the game and continuously having to burn through turn after turn just to explore a new map. If you don't mind the tedium, the tactics battles are worth the meandering storyline and slow-paced campaign interface.			"

												At first I did not know what to make of this game. But I felt intrigued enough to keep playing. Then I slowly started unraveling the intricacies and the secrets and I got absolutely hooked.The biggest draw for me, is the degree of customisation it offers. There are literally dozens of combinations of race/class/specialisation combined with random maps which are quite configurable, and a lot of different tweaks for each game map. One game you might be playing a Frostling Sorcerer with master destruction and rain death (and stun) on your foes, next game a Dwarf Theocrat rising from the caves below the surface to conquer everything, specializing in wild magic with unpredictable results. Then a Tigran Warlord Grey Guard, bashing down all opposition. Then later you might revisit the Frostling sorcerer, but be lucky enough to have a building that makes your Ice Queens practically immortal (if you end up winning the fight) inside your domain. What I'm getting at, is not only are all of these options extremely fun to play around with and figure out interesting and powerful combinations, but they offer a replayability rarely seen in games.Really this game is amazing and you should check it out if you are a fan of Turn Based Strategy games. If only HoMnM games were half this good these days...EDIT 24/11/16 This game is still being updated. Triumph Studios rock!			"

												TL;DRAwesome turn based strategy game. Main campaign is frustrating in spots, but very doable on normal difficulty. I've put in over 100 hours already and still love the game.I have been on the look out for a modern replacement of Master of Magic. I can honestly say that this game may be the game that takes Master of Magic's place for me. Only time will tell, but the initial testing seems to point to a yes. The Heroes and items in Master of Magic are still possibly better. The main thing is that there are multiple ways of making a hero in Master of Magic that is for all practical purposes invincible. Some may say that's a bad thing, but I always liked it. Also, the spells in Master of Magic are truly awesome and there are a ton of spells. There are very few bad / useless spells in Master of Magic. And, so long as your heros have mana, they can each cast a spell every turn. The main disappointment for me in Age of Wonders 3 is that you can only cast one spell per turn in combat. The upside, is there are some cool abilities that are essentially spells, but don't count as a spell. Call Lightning, Thunder Storm, Guardian Flames are a few good examples. All in all, I am seriously enjoying the treasure hunting, city smashing, and magic. I may still go back to Master of Magic from time to time, but Age of Wonders 3 is a true contender in the niche that Master of Magic has been the Master of for so long. (The Age of Wonders games before this never captured my attention as much as Age of Wonders 3 and while good, weren't as good as Master of Magic.)			"

												In the era, when the huge companies are either streamlining the previous games with usualll tendency to loose anything from the atmosphere of the old best sellers (yes, Heroes, im talking about You...) or even trying to squeeze Your wallets with so called HD feature stripped reedition (Yes, again Heroes of Might and Magic) asking You to pay a full price there it is - something out of the today standards.Despite always being somewhere in the shadow of HoMM series, AoW series is nowhere behind the legacy of turn based fantasy strategic games. And even if it obviously was overshadowed by allmighty Heroes III (which is probably the best game ever for majority of players reading this review - me included) at the times where Age of Wonders 2 was published (even, despite my opinion it was pretty much equally good in some terms), its no longer a case.Heroes series lost all of it glory throughour the years. Age of Wonders, resurrected not so far ago. And in a contrast of really average attempts to recover HoMM franchise, Triumph Studios made it done. This is the game every AoW fan was waiting for, and this is the game all the turn based fantasy strategic games fans should head into now. There is absolutely no other game in the genre with so much detail, fun and polish.Of course, the game has some issues (like multiplayer connection which for no reason tries to establish p2p connection which is kind off archaic method) but developers are constantly updating the game based on our feedback.So if You really enjoyed playin HoMM 3 twenty years ago, and You would love to feel something similar today - go grab it. You'll love it. "

												This by far is one of the best 4X strategy games that i have played in a long time. If you are one who liked civ5 then you will fall in love with this game. Unlike civ5 this game is less based on empire building and more focussed on the battles. 6 units to each army, may not sound like much but a total of 42 units can be in a single battle. Battles normally last anywhere from 5 minutes to nearly a half hour.Then the soundtrack of this game is just amazing. Im one of those people who like to sit back and listen to music and play games. Well in this game the ingame music is actually pretty sick. Online is working and there seems to still be a large community although this game is starting to get a bit old.Performance wise, this game should be able to be ran on almost anything. Very nice graphics for a 4X strategy game and the environment is very detailed.So yes i do reccomend you purchase Age of Wonders III			"

												This game is very complex, it doesn't compromise its complexity trying to streamline it (like Civilization: Beyond Earth which I recently played and didn't like). This game, instead, celebrates its complexity by finely balancing it and making everything in the game be worth using, even Tier 1 units which in nearly every other game (including its predecessors) become obsolete by mid-game.The turns play fast, battle auto-resolving works acceptably well and actually simulates the battles instead of making an oddball calculation based on numbers. You have the option to make your heroes survive auto-resolved battles if you win them (to avoid the strong annoyance of the CPU suiciding your heroes), thus relieving you of a lot of unwanted micromanagement.The tactical battles in the game are detailed, very enjoyable, and also optional! —since the auto-resolve feature plays fine—. You can replay auto-resolved battles to learn the game's complex tactical combat by watching the computer (I learned partly that way).The graphics, music and interface of the game are excellent. If you play with low detail graphics you may have Age of Wonders II flashbacks  =)  specially with antialiasing off. You can run this game in moderately old hardware (something other modern games can't).Excellent Turn-Based Strategy Game, a personally refreshing sight after failures like Civilization: Beyond Earth and Heroes VI. Get it on a discount sale if you're hesitant. I'm sure you'll be buying the expansions rather soon  =)( The expansions added new victory conditions and even more variety to an already spicy game. The base victory mode in random scenarios in this game is conquest. Check the reviews ) "

												Phenomenal game.  I've not experienced that ""just one more turn"" like this since the original Civ.  And the amount of settings you can arrange when creating a randomly generated game is robust enough that the replay value is huge.Update Dec 2016:  With the recent patch just released (how phenomenal is it the devs are still patching this game!) I fired up another campaign and got sucked in all over again in that ""just one more turn"", this game has stood the test of time in my book and now ranks for me as a classic I'll be playing for years to come.

												As a long time fan of the series I wanted to like this game I really did, but it is simply one large dissapointment. If you take the last game in the series and remove things you get the new game. Smaller droops stacks, less races, less units, less unit types, weaker AI, Less spells, less spellcasting (1 per turn limit), less fantasy. Combined with a poorer less useful interface and you get a vastly sub par game. The troop stacks have been reduced from 8 to 6 removing much of the tactical play. You now place your 6 biggest units in your stack. Flying has been removed as a feature (can be attacked by ground units) and speical abilities are resisted more often. There is no room for oddball troops in your army. Spell casting is 1 per round, even if you have multiple heroes in your army. The interface is far less user friendly? Want click through armies without orders? Can't unless you end your turn, which leads to ending your turn while some units still haven't gone. Want to accept a diplomacy negotiation? You have click 3 screens deep instead of just saying ""yes"" when someone askes for 100 gold for mana swap. Races now have all the same exact units, class units differ but classes wre wildly unbalanced. This game needs a lot of work in a lot of places. I'd rather play AOW:SM today than this new one. Other than better graphics (which everything else was sacrificed to provide) this game is worse in every way.			"

												Did you see there are a lot of games like other games made many years ago? It's like Hollywood. No new ideas are better than old ideas, so they keep making movies like the ones 20-40-60 years ago.The thing with those ""re-new"" movies is that most of them are a pale homage to those great movies we watched and loved (yeap, I'm old).Well, with games is the same. And this here AoW3 happens the same that with another game that was the third instalment in a series that has an ""o"" as the second of four letters (if you need another clue, the last one is the same as the third).  ;)Lucky for us, this game IS a good homage for that great game. Is it AS good? Hard to say, I didn't play that one in a loooooooong time now, but this one makes an honest effort, and brings back a lot of fond memories. :)Also, it's totally moddable, has 4 campaigns (if you add the DLCs, and you totally should), and it works wonderfully as a port on Linux (which is why I bought it). :)So, if you remember that old ""four letters and a 3"" game and you liked it, give this one a try. It's worth the money. :)			"

												 It's kind of like playing five or six games of Civ V at the same time, on two maps. If fantasy themed stuff don't turn you off, and if you like 4x strategy of the Civilization variety, it's well worth giving this a try. I'm the type who searches and searches for the perfect game, so I've tried Endless Legend, and Galactic Civilizations, and Empire Earth, and Age of Empires, and Beyond Earth, and on, and on. Age of Wonders 3 is the shizznit.I will say this - if you only play this game for an hour or something and think you've seen it all and it's just silliness.

												I honestly tried my best to like this game. My review concerns the custom map set up. The AI in this game is atrocious and bothers me to no end. Playing on a  higher difficulty does not provide a balanced challenge but a number of AI wizards that zero in on your location. They declare war for seemingly no reason. Along with the annoying AI the game also becomes tedious far too fast. In forcing myself to play this game so I can get to the fun part I realized there was no fun part for me. If you are looking for a good sandbox fantasy strategy game I would look elsewhere.			"

												I'm really torn about this game, because it does so much right and I hate to be negative about a game that's so close to being great. I'm going to hit on the negatives first so that at least I can end on a positive note.Negatives:There is basically no strategic depth. There is absolutely no reason not to use the highest tier units as soon as possible, none of the units really fill a unique role, and in the end there's really just no point in building lower-tier units if higher tiers are available. The strategy boils down to ""who can get high-tier units produced the fastest"". The Total War series is an example where this was usually done fairly well, though admittedly not anywhere near perfect.The classes aren't very well balanced: Sorcerers are incredibly powerful, since they can summon tier 4 units wherever they are and it costs no gold to do so. It allows them to effectively push forward and defend anywhere at any time. On the opposite end of the spectrum are Theocrats, who have basically nothing worth using in their own trees and must rely entirely on specializations.The specializations aren't very diverse: The elemental ones are all almost exactly parallel with each other (not in relative power, but in the fact that the powers are all the same with reskins and a number or two tweaked), the destruction and creation specializations don't do anything meaningful, and the explorer specialization is entirely useless. Honestly I think I'd've scrapped this entirely. It feels bolted-on. You can completely ignore your specialization and it'll have no effect on your gameplay most of the time.The races all feel exactly the same. I don't know if there are differences outside small hit point variances in the units or not, but if there are any they're very minor. For an example of this done better, see Heroes of Might & Magic (2, 3, or 5, if you want a specific one, basically any but 6 because that game is sadness in game form.)The research tree is an absolute mess: it requires rote memorization to figure out what research leads where. In some cases it's fairly obvious, in others it seems random if you haven't sunk a significant amount of time into the game. This is a really common problem in strategy and tactical games. Sins of a Solar Empire had this done fairly well, as did XCOM's newest incarnations (in different ways, obviously).Tactically there are a few options, but the tactical combat is incredibly and painfully repetitive. The A.I. has been improved some, but still isn't especially good. In truth I don't have a great answer for a game where this was done exceptionally well. In RTS games it usually isn't a problem, since the computer is just made more aggressive with more resources. Turn based games are a tougher nut to crack, though. Shogun 2 was one with a reasonably good A.I., but certainly not an excellent one.Multiplayer games with simultaneous turns are abysmally un-fun. Simultaneous turns in general don't work, with some units freezing in place when attacked by an enemy (when you would normally move away before the enemy could get in close), and generally team-turns would work much better than the way simultaneous turns work now.Now for the good stuff:Each of the classes does play in a unique way. The specializations may not make much difference, but the classes are incredibly varied and have a good blend of niche and flexible abilities.The game looks remarkably good for the most part. It's not graphically brilliant, but the art design was well put together, you have a lot of options for how your main hero will look and nothing looks cheap.While it's a bit of a mixed bag, the spellcasting/ability use in general is generally entertaining and can have a fairly significant effect on the tides of battle.The UI is mostly intuitive, though it too has a few areas that would benefit from clearer labelling.That's what I've got. Hope it helps!			"

												A 4x fantasy game that has all the elements you could wish for, allowing it to make a real challenge at being arguably the best in its genre. But does it live up to its sparkle ?If you're old enough to remember Master of Magic, then you will know the precursor game that AoW III has built itself on. If you're not old enough, then AoW is a game of the same family as Warlock, or any of the fantasy mods for Civ. A turn based fantasy game you will spend your time exploring a map, expanding your empire, exploiting resources and finally exterminating your enemies. A 4x to the core. Whilst there have been innumerable takes on this formula, AoW III promises to bring all these things together with a decent rub of polish and just enough depth to really please the 4x audience.And in many ways the game does just that - a nice tactical combat system that brings depth to the strategic map manoeuvres without overstaying its welcome. A diverse and interesting number of resources to exploit. Bucketfuls of different army units and racial types. And so on.But despite all this, and despite it looking great, the game has some flaws. And when you get to playing it, those flaws really start to bite.The first flaw is the simultaneous move implementation. Turn based games can turn into a tedious snore fest if they opt for a me go you go type mechanic. Fortunately in this day and age such things are rare ( with the exception of the woeful coding of Warlock ), but in AoW III the simultaneous movement has a hitch. Everything and everyone moves simultaneously - players, AI kingdoms, independents. And the AI has a beautifully machine like grief play style where it can wait for you to make a single move somewhere, before rolling forward its units to sneak in the back door and take that town from you.Woops.So maybe you shouldn't move out of that town. At all. Ever. A bizarre nervouse mexican stand off ensues where the AI stares you down waiting for you to misclick or even just investigate a passing army before rushing in to capitalise. And it's no good clicking once you've taken that step - particularly if you are playing in a multiplayer network game - as the whole thing then lags and chugs busy processing its own fabulously griefing move whilst your frantic clicks can sit and wait.In practice the simultaneous movement with AIs on the field of play quickly becomes irritating - and it starts to warp play into some neurotic twitch fest. It's not the first game to implement this type of nervous who clicks first simultaneous play, but here, combined with a simplistic ""IS IT OK FOR ME TO ATTACK NOW"" state AI, it can often prove enormously frustrating.Fortunately simulaneous movement is optional.Non simultaneous movement then goes back to the tedious me go you go turn order. But at least you can go out explore something and be home for tea without the griefing AI kicking your door down mid journey. Well. Mostly.The second flaw to the game is that towns don't have an implicit defence. That is to say, if a town is empty, anyone can just walk in and take it. Sound reasonable ? Sure. What's the problem ? Remember that hair trigger wait for you to move ""IS IT OK TO ATTACK NOW"" AI ? It's still here. And as soon as you even look like you are leaving somewhere empty or under strength, then with annoying regularity the AI marches an army up. I couldn't swear to it, but the AI also has an uncanny knack to ""know"" when you have left somewhere light, and proceeds to quickly march from over the horizon to its target goal. Meh.In practice with the AI staring you down waiting for you to set a single foot outside your door, you end up with the gratuitous full army stack just sitting kicking its heels defending a town. FOR THE REST OF THE GAME. You can see why many games just abstract city defence away, as it's a no brainer you want to always defend a city.But maybe you're ok with that. Seeing a stack of troops in every town, and the maintenance of them - the retiring of old redundant units, the creating of new  better ones, and the whines from their heroes as they slowly level up, and the movement difficulties getting around that fat stack is fine. No problem.Third flaw in the game. Unit balance. As you proceed up your tech tree, most units become pretty much worse than useless. In fact, if you are not spamming out your top tier units, then you're probably doing it wrong. And if those low tier units do engage those high tier ones ? Splat. Well ! That's just the march of progress ! That's to be expected ! Except it's kind of broken here. In something like Civ your units in the field will get dragged through the ages with an upgrade - that unit of Warriors you've had kicking around since 4000BC are now some fancy 20th century Infantrymen. And you will no longer be able to produce those ancient warriors. In AoW there is no such handling. Those idiot Tier I guys will still be walking around. Sucking up resources. Bloating out stacks. And you can go right on producing those stick wielding primitives right into the era of ""space travel"" - the highest tiers. Which is kind of pointless. And irritating. So for all those fancy units, it ends up just a race for the highest tier - with a few exceptions. The subtleties of rock paper scissors are quickly washed away in a My Tank beats EVERYTHING you have.Fourth flaw in the game, and this really does spoil the game, is the nature of the AI. The AI is the worst kind of griefing AI - the kind of player that will happily sit there and repeat play the same chequers move until eternity, just so they stop you winning. It's a sad fact that to placate the human player customer base, an AI has to sometimes take the higher road, the non optimal choice and  break out of that loop of incessant taunting moves. In AoW the AI has no such good sportsmanship tendencies and will happily bounce armies back and forth as you trigger each AI decision tree. Move to the left ? Your enemy to the right will charge. Move to the right ? Your enemy to the left will charge. Quickly go back the other direction ? Your enemies will mirror your move. Rinse and repeat.So the AI is tricky you think. What's the issue ? You're just whining about a hard AI !The AI is not hard particularly. Just annoying. As are the other issues with the game. All of which combines in a perfect storm to produce a game that after a while becomes just plain irritating. You don't have fun. It becomes like managing an annoying spoiled nephew. Until you question why you are even playing the stupid game, and hell doesn't Civ or Warlock give a  much more enjoyable experience ?And there's the problem. AoW has all the right bits, all the right polish and yet... through a few interesting design choices... manages to trip over and face plant to produce an annoying not quite there game.The irritating aspects of the game do shine through - and until recently another annoying ( And pointless ? ) aspect of game play was an AI that would endlessly spam dispells. Sound tactics ? Sure. Annoying griefy play that tends to break any possible use of global spells ? Yes. It's something that you can see hasn't really been thought about how it plays out. It's an AI which is not good at playing humans - it's good at playing itself.If you were being very harsh, you might almost say someone looked at all the requested things for a 4x, mixed them together and baked for half an hour - but without any clue whatsoever as to what *tastes good*.At its best there is a good game somewhere in AoW. At it's worst its an annoying experience with a minor sprinkling of bugs to spice things up a bit.Personally I am still perservering with it - I like the bits that are good, and it can play for a while as a nice game, on the other hand I really hate the bits that fail, they really jar you out of the game and produce a frustrating, lets go play something else type vibe.

												AOW3 is an empire building game/ combat game with a fantasy theme. On paper, it sounds great; but in reality it isnt massively interesting.  The variety in gameplay comes through the tech trees in both what your cities are producing and on the special abilities that you can impose on your empire. But both trees are relatively short and you can reach the end of both a long way before you end a game. Like a lot of empire building games, the more cities you build, the more tedious it becomes. Sadly, the combat is also repetitive - the same maps with the same enemies in the same positions. It takes a short while to get used to, but once you do, you will be applying the same tactics over and over again.In short, there isnt much to recommend the game. Its not terribly programmed, but there just isnt enough depth to keep you interested.			"

												Firstly, I am a big fan of the Age of Wonders franchise. However, this game was not entertaining compared to the previous titles. Besides better graphics and a new class, the game does not have that much new content to offer. Every match I found to be repetitive and slow. In previous Age of Wonders games I found each conflict to be new and require unique different ways of playing. In this release, I find myself repeating the same tactics over and over. The story in this game is not exciting and I found myself skipping through it in both campaigns. Overall, I give this game a 5/10. Pick up AoW 2 versus this title. You'll save some money and have a better experience. All in all, this game is not worth the buy.			"

												Age of wonders 3 is another installment into the age of wonder series, a fantasy, 4X game with hex grid-turn based combat.Now, normally when i write these reviews, i'd go into depth about the plot or the world or both. But, considering that i spent a significant amount of time playing against AI and some friends in multiplayer, and avoided the single player aspect of it all together, i cannot give you a decent summery beyond saying that the common wealth, a joint group of races, have taken over a large section of the world, there is a court of elves who have not joined, and in the DLC, you can explore new lands with new races, and play as a cold blooded necromancer. Age of wonders functions like any other 4X game to an extent, you are placed on a randomly generated world (customised to your tastes, with a rather extensive range of options) as your chosen hero. Each hero is of a different race, class and has different abilities, each one drastically effecting how your nation will function. You can also make your own custom hero as well. I ended up making a necromancer dark elf called thul'duarn the shadebane, a master of destruction magic and expanding. Your race effects what kinds of units you can make, what type of areas your people like to settle in and what they can build inside cities, it also effects what things increase and decrease your moral. Each city has moral, depending on a number of factors, high moral is good and can lead to festivals, increased production and free money, low moral can lead to rioting and other bad things. Your class determines what kind of spells you can use, the powers your specific hero unit can use and what special units and buildings you can make. your chosen abilities will also determine your spells, unique units and so on.From there, you build up your city, but unlike other 4X games, there is a heavy insentive to go exploring with large armies, because, all around the world there are dungeons, minor factions and free loot to pick up. The dungeons, once cleared, grant bonuses to any city that has it in its borders, the minor factions can be brought into your empire by either doing a few easy quests for them, or just crushing their city with your forces. There are also random map wide events that occur, such as the penguin king and his army of penguins.Like most 4X games you do need to research new tech, you do this with knowledge and mana, though, you can also research new spells for your hero to use. If your hero is taking place in a battle, they can cast it at normal cost, if they are not, you can pay double the mana in order to use it. These spells range anywhere from a simple fireball, to a mass raise army spell, allowing you to summon literally limitless units until the battle is over.Then there is alignment, every character starts off as neutral unless they have taken a specific specialization. From there, you can go evil or good, depending on minor choices you make in game. However, there is no reason to be evil, as it drastically decreases the moral of your people if you go too far down that road, and other nations will outright hate you for it. But on the flip side, there is only a minor penalty for declaring war, so you can happily be the nicest warmonger you want without fear.The main ways to win the game are diplomatically (have everyone agree to become your sworn ally), or via war (kill all the things to win).  Naturally, i went for war every time, because otherwise there is no way to win against human opponents unless they surrender. There is no third or forth option, like a religious victory or a science victory.At the end of the day, Age of Wonders 3 is a 4X game for warmongers, there is literally no better way to win than to swarm your enemies with units, which can get extremely boring after a while, even if the combat is very good. The moral system is nice, but there is one issue, the necromancer class. You see, necromancer controlled cities that have been turned undead are not effected by moral what so ever, meaning they don't have bonuses or penalties to anything, they are just very good at pumping out more undead. Combine this with the fact the necromancer class has access to extremely powerful units in early, mid and late game, and the fact that they have some of the best spells in the game, really breaks it. There is nothing really to concern yourself with in terms of minor details like food and your alignment either, since you are a necromancer.I found the game very fun at first, but after a few matches i really grew tired of the process and found it far too easy, even on harder settings. Its not as deep as some 4X fans might be looking for and its too shallow for new people to be able to experience all the aspects of a 4X game. The only thing i can praise is the soundtrack, just, the pieces vary in quality, alot of them are solidly ok, some bland as paste, others really enjoyable. It makes for good background for a tabletop rpg, but thats it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but i wouldn't tell them to avoid it either, if i could give an ok rating, i would, but thats not possible sadly.I will tell a little story of how my necromancer won his first campaign, if only because it might help you understand how the game goes. So, off in the corner of the large map, my undead city rose from the earth and proceeded to declare the location chosen as ""fort bosturd"". Right outside my city was a hero, offering to be hired for a handful of coins, despite the fact he was a better necromancer than me. i split my armies up and roamed around the country, doing my necromancer thing, until i encountered a lovely group of faries, instead of running in terror, they greated me nicely and offered to become my allies if i killed a giant, two turns later, i had a giant corpse following me and a new ally. after a bit i turned them into part of my kingdom, and my first act as a new ruler was to convert their city into an undead one...without realizing they can't make the facilities that allow undead cities to grow. the city had a population of zero. i gifted it to my general, he seemed pleased.Jump forward about fifty turns and i had conquered about one third of the map, thanks to my amazing charisma, gleaming repulation as a merciful ruler and the massive undead horde that mindlessly agreed with me. i ran into another nation, ran by a goblin rogue called (insert ♥♥♥♥♥♥ goblin name here) the pretty. Naturally, she was smitten with me, a rotting corpse man, and we became diplomatic friends. I then ignored her and went to capture a city on my borders with my armies, which was a tougher nut to crack than i expected, losing a good number of troops. But i knew next turn i'd have it, until the goblin swooped in, stole the city from underneath me, then told me to ♥♥♥♥ off out of her lands within the next turn. my units all moved out, except for one, whom she destroyed and declared war on me. My armies were rather spread out, but i soon sorted that out, and just as i was about to murder her, she offered peace, and joined my empire, giving me a boost to peace and earning me the good alignment reward.I spread death and plague about for another fifty turns, everyone loving me as i turned them into walking corpses, when the penguin king event happened. in a few turns, i had lost two cities to penguins and was fighting off hordes of them. On that day i swore vengence against the penguin king and all his snowy followers, taking back my cities and cursing how far i had fallen behind in my conquests because of the delay. when i returned to the front, i met evil jesus. the guy who had won the true evil alignment reward, naturally, we did not get on very well, he was a theocrat, and his units could hit mine like trucks. but before he got the chance to, he surrendered to the other AI player. whom swore himself to me after i gifted him two really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cities. and that was how i won.

												It's an amazing game. It's just like Civ V, but in a fantasy world. All of the races and classes play distinctly differently. Ex: As a Necromancer, you don't have to worry about morale. Also, the combat is deep. You have flanking, elemental attacks and resistances, and attacks of opportunity. Completely worth the money.			"

It has less complexity in the diplomacy and city building aspects than the giant that is the Civ franchise, but make up for it in the combat aspect. Definitely recommended for any 4X players who enjoy combat victories over diplomatic ones.			"

												Absolutely the best strategy turn based game ive ever played with my friends, the turns are fast and rapid as you dont need to wait long compared to other strategy turn based games. the combat is great in the form of flanking, blocking, tanking and casting spells even strategically planning where to have your heaviest units doing the most damage. as you can even join in on battles your ally start or yourself if they are next to the attacked target, forming some form of cooperative experience. the city management is alot of fun especially once you decide what your city will become for city, if you want it to solely focus on making troops or turning it into a city of mana to gain lots of mana to throw alot of spells is up to you as well as dependant on the leader you have. when it comes to the leader the customization is enough even if its not a whole lot but its enough to be satisfying to some extent, once it comes down to class and choosing specialization the real fun begins if you want to be a badass warmonger or a peace loving druid even a villainous necromancer its up to you. i really recommend playing this with friends as it will nearly ensure endless of fun.

												LIkes:* Unit-by-unit control on an overworld and battle map.  The number of units you manage throughout a single game does not become unwieldy either.* Flexible spell casting system, which can often turn the tides of a battle (or war); in your favor or your opponent's.* Extensive and challenging (in hard difficulty) singleplayer campaigns.* The euphoria when you defeat a numerically or qualitatively superior force through tactics and wit.* Multiple different races and classes, each of which is easy to pick up, but hard to master.Neutral:* City building and resource management is vital, but lacks much in terms of customization.  After you stuff every possible building in a single city, you repeat for other cities.* Research (spells and bonuses) is a nice system (you are unlikely to research everything in a single game), but opaque in terms of what unlocks what.Dislikes:* Multiplayer generally requires auto-combat to go at a reasonable pace (combat holds a global lock on the game state).* Lower tier units become worthless quickly (except, to some extent, archers).  This generally leads to monolithic army compositions later in the game.* Spell disjunction, especially in games with many players, is somewhat annoying; and constantly hampers your ability to do much with spellcasting besides re-casting disjuncted spells.

												Age of wonders 3 is another installment into the age of wonder series, a fantasy, 4X game with hex grid-turn based combat.Now, normally when i write these reviews, i'd go into depth about the plot or the world or both. But, considering that i spent a significant amount of time playing against AI and some friends in multiplayer, and avoided the single player aspect of it all together, i cannot give you a decent summery beyond saying that the common wealth, a joint group of races, have taken over a large section of the world, there is a court of elves who have not joined, and in the DLC, you can explore new lands with new races, and play as a cold blooded necromancer. Age of wonders functions like any other 4X game to an extent, you are placed on a randomly generated world (customised to your tastes, with a rather extensive range of options) as your chosen hero. Each hero is of a different race, class and has different abilities, each one drastically effecting how your nation will function. You can also make your own custom hero as well. I ended up making a necromancer dark elf called thul'duarn the shadebane, a master of destruction magic and expanding. Your race effects what kinds of units you can make, what type of areas your people like to settle in and what they can build inside cities, it also effects what things increase and decrease your moral. Each city has moral, depending on a number of factors, high moral is good and can lead to festivals, increased production and free money, low moral can lead to rioting and other bad things. Your class determines what kind of spells you can use, the powers your specific hero unit can use and what special units and buildings you can make. your chosen abilities will also determine your spells, unique units and so on.From there, you build up your city, but unlike other 4X games, there is a heavy insentive to go exploring with large armies, because, all around the world there are dungeons, minor factions and free loot to pick up. The dungeons, once cleared, grant bonuses to any city that has it in its borders, the minor factions can be brought into your empire by either doing a few easy quests for them, or just crushing their city with your forces. There are also random map wide events that occur, such as the penguin king and his army of penguins.Like most 4X games you do need to research new tech, you do this with knowledge and mana, though, you can also research new spells for your hero to use. If your hero is taking place in a battle, they can cast it at normal cost, if they are not, you can pay double the mana in order to use it. These spells range anywhere from a simple fireball, to a mass raise army spell, allowing you to summon literally limitless units until the battle is over.Then there is alignment, every character starts off as neutral unless they have taken a specific specialization. From there, you can go evil or good, depending on minor choices you make in game. However, there is no reason to be evil, as it drastically decreases the moral of your people if you go too far down that road, and other nations will outright hate you for it. But on the flip side, there is only a minor penalty for declaring war, so you can happily be the nicest warmonger you want without fear.The main ways to win the game are diplomatically (have everyone agree to become your sworn ally), or via war (kill all the things to win).  Naturally, i went for war every time, because otherwise there is no way to win against human opponents unless they surrender. There is no third or forth option, like a religious victory or a science victory.At the end of the day, Age of Wonders 3 is a 4X game for warmongers, there is literally no better way to win than to swarm your enemies with units, which can get extremely boring after a while, even if the combat is very good. The moral system is nice, but there is one issue, the necromancer class. You see, necromancer controlled cities that have been turned undead are not effected by moral what so ever, meaning they don't have bonuses or penalties to anything, they are just very good at pumping out more undead. Combine this with the fact the necromancer class has access to extremely powerful units in early, mid and late game, and the fact that they have some of the best spells in the game, really breaks it. There is nothing really to concern yourself with in terms of minor details like food and your alignment either, since you are a necromancer.I found the game very fun at first, but after a few matches i really grew tired of the process and found it far too easy, even on harder settings. Its not as deep as some 4X fans might be looking for and its too shallow for new people to be able to experience all the aspects of a 4X game. The only thing i can praise is the soundtrack, just, the pieces vary in quality, alot of them are solidly ok, some bland as paste, others really enjoyable. It makes for good background for a tabletop rpg, but thats it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but i wouldn't tell them to avoid it either, if i could give an ok rating, i would, but thats not possible sadly.I will tell a little story of how my necromancer won his first campaign, if only because it might help you understand how the game goes.

												I remember playing Age of Wonders 1 and 2 so long ago.  I can't recall how many hours I dumped into those games, especially the second one.  It was the reinvention of Master of Magic, and I loved it.  You get the great world map combined with many fantastic races and tactical combat on separate maps.  I could not have been happier.  It was the fantasy version of Civilization in many respects.When I saw AoW3, I got anxious.  Finally it released, and I got to play it.  It truly has everything to remind me of the previous versions I loved, and then some.  Random Maps, finally.  Relevant units, yay.AoW3 has random maps.  This seems normal, but previously they did not.  So after a while, it becomes mundane with the same strategies and outcomes per scenario.  You can build cities!  Couldn't do that in the old days.  It was all preset and you took what was already there.  Units are relevant now.  In AoW2 the best strategy was to raze every single building and town you took (except your starting city), then destroy the neutral armies that appeared, and farm all the xp and items you could for your starting hero. He becomes nigh invincible, even to tier 3 units, and has absurd movement with flight, so he can just zoom around the map with a scorched earth strategy.  I have not tried to do this in AoW3, but I suspect it would be ineffective.If you liked the previous games in the series, you will still like this one. I cannot say anything bad about it. It is in line with everything I expected it to have. It stays true to the series, and offers some new things. The only thing it doesn't have, is the number of races that the priors had.  No Dark Elves, no Undead, etc... DLC right?  Seems fine.All that being said, I would go 8/10 if you like the genre or the old games.  Personally, it's a 7 for me, and that is just because although I want to enjoy the battles and fight them manually, they become something of a chore to me and I end up auto'ing most of them, even if its a huge super important fight.  I would not have the patience anymore for multiplayer if people do manual fights, yet the prospect of not having the option to manual fight seems to gut a large aspect of the game's draw for me.So I recommend this game overall, but you mind get a little bored with it if you have leaned towards RTS style games since playing AoW2, and maybe that's not worth the cost of the game for you.  Even so, it's a fine product and I am happy to support it, even if I don't play it as much as I thought I would.  (so many good games these days)			"

												Fast paced turn-based strategy game, more fight oriented than other games in genre. There's lots of ways to play the game, with several races, different neutral creatures/cities, lots of spells available, etc. The maps are also pretty nice, with lots of variety, its fun to try to explore it and see what you can find!

												While the empire management might not be as robust as something like Civ, and the only win condition (at the time of this writing) is through warfare which I feel makes the game a little more limiting in your endgame strategy, the tactical combat is great and AoW 3 is overall a very fun game.8/10			"

												For me, this might be my favorite game of all time. The truth is I've barely scratched the surface of this amazing game! First off if those was familair with the Heroes of Might and Magic Series (Not to be confused with just Might and Magic) and that of civilization will find that this game uses aspect from both games to great effect! At first I thought it might a bit lacking of the other genre but it combines the very best of both franchises! You player a leader which you select a race, class and three abilities of in a 4X overworld, with town building and such, but rather then getting the lacklust combat of Civ, you go down into battlefield, were you really take hold of the situation, giving you that HoMM combat style over a Hex Board. There are six races, which can be any six classes, which can pick 3 from 14 abiliites, allowing you to shape the game as you want!I'll make it short: Buy this and your gonna love it. Promise!			"

												Ya, this game is really solid. I should preface this my saying my favorite genre of all time is turn based strategy, and while I usually prefer more focused experiences like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem, every so often I like to go for a grander 4X game. That said, as a long time strategy fan, this game hits almost every note right with me.First off, while this game is great, it does have a few minor issues that I would like to address before betting to the good stuff. The pace of the game can get very slow, especially when running large maps with many opponents. This can be compounded by the fact that you cant auto manage your cities and my inherant distrust for auto-resolving battles. Additionally, The simultaneous turn system feels a bit funky, and will often cause you to be ambushed mid turn before you can move your armies. This of course is easily fixed by changing the turns to classic.Aside from those issues, the game plays great. There is a tone of variety in units between various combinations of races and classes and tons of neutral units that you will fight in your travels. The customization of heroes is insane and will give any hardcore strategy fan something to sink their teeth into. Best off all though is the execution of strategy in battles. Units die very easily which causes you to apply proper strategy to keep your army alive. Additionally, the game averts the turtling problem of many games of the genre by allowing multiple armies to attack a single hex at a time. This creates huge epic battles that blow games like HoMM out of the water while averting the frustration that comes from having a vastly superior army but being unable to take a single well defended city. Finally, the AI feels smart and a worthy advisary to challenge your dominion.Overall, this game outpaces most of its competition in its genre. It has more than enough depth for any strategy fan while still being accessable and easy to pick up. If you are a strategy fan, you owe it to yourself to try this game.			"

												Having played a couple of hours and read my share of reviews I decided that I love this game as a whole but it has it's flaws and aspects that need to be looked at. First and foremost is a somewhat lacking endgame. At a certain point you have a fully developed tech tree, all cities you own have all building and upgrades and are nothing more than either gold farms or unit factories and the next 3 hours you spend on it consist of you trying to enter the enemies territory (who is usually the helpfull AI that betrayed you because it decided you were the only remaining thing to kill).Every single turn after that is seeing you army get hit by spells that do nothing more than clip each units health. The enemy on their side is able to strut their armies to your capital because movement range is gigantic and every remaining spell you have cast gets dispelled the next turn.I feel like a single turn is too much. One turn equals a unit in every city, a move that equals crossing 50% of your domain, a spell that is fully prepped and a skill that is fully reseached. Having this happen every turn is too much to handle and i feel like managing your precious fantasy empire is very brute. In my opinion, making four turns worth the current one turn would smoothen the managing of your empire and allow you to react and time your moves better. It would make hurrying production worthwhile and it would make prepping a spell or building a unit more fullfilling once completed.TL:DR a great game with some design oversights that I believe could be taken into account to allow more precise control "

												Age of Wonders III has combined the grid-based exploration systems of most cultural building games (such as Civilization, and Age of Empires), and combines it with the turn-based combat systems of a generic Tactical RPG. The only real gripe I HAVE with the game is the inability to construct things like farms and mines, so if you spawn in an area that doesn't have any nearby, you'll likely be screwed upon starting. Other than that, the game is fantastic. Not to mention that the musical score is such a delight.			"

												Age of Wonders III is utterly amazing.My view may be skewed due to putting 100+ hours into the original, but for newcomers to the series I highly recommend this title. The game play is 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) much like the Civilization or Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is set in a high fantasy world ripe with monstrous creatures, dungeons and undead armies. When playing a map (either a scenario, the campaign, or a randomly generated map) you start with a leader unit who, in scenarios or random maps, you create yourself and usually a small army based on one of the five races that you can choose with a city or a city building unit to start your empire. Your leader can level up as they defeat enemies with your armies and gain points to put into unique abilities based on their class and their offensive and defensive statistics. These abilities will help bolster the armies that they lead and push you ever closer to victory. The infantry units you command also gain experience and levels up to four but their abilities and stats are predetermined. Also based on the previously mentioned class and the actions you take to solidify an alignment, either good or evil, are the spells that you research along the way which is reminiscent of technology from the Civ franchise.Along your journey you will more than likely run across heroes that will offer to join you, these characters are much like your leader, they level up the same, they gain abilities based on their class, and they are meant to lead armies. The big difference being that if you lose one of these heroes they are gone, much like other units in your army. Your leader will respawn at your throne city, assuming it's still standing, after a few turns but their friends will not. This makes the battles intense and the losses devastating. The battles are turn based on a hex map based on whatever landscape you're occupying and these maps are gorgeous. They really give you a look at the landscapes that your troops are marching through.The class system mentioned above is a change to the series that after experiencing I can say is welcome. There are very distinct ways that each class works from the technology based, steam punkesque Dreadnaught to the classic magic juggernaut that is the Sorcerer. The Theocrat leads through belief and divine retribution with their crusaders, leading holy wars against their heretical enemies while the Rogue leads through deception, riots, and stealth. The Archdruid taps into the power of nature, summoning animal companions and nature elementals to their side while the Warlord rampages their armies with limited use of magic, ruling through blood, and battle.  Overall the game is a very unique and very fun experience. The soundtrack is breathtakingly beautiful with a few songs being a throwback to the original. Clearly I don't write reviews for a living (I know. ""Too many commas."" ""Where's the sentence structure?"") but I feel like if I were to Age of Wonders would get a 5/5, 10/10, or 100/100. The only gripe I could make is the lack of a few races from the previous games but that's nothing that an expansion or two won't fix. That, and the fact that I can't buy the collectors edition of the game. But life goes on. I'll be spending hours of mine in the Age of Wonders.			"

												I don't see what all the griping is about.  This is a top notch game!  I have loved AOW since my buddy got in on the beta test when Epic was just a 2bit company.  AOW III could have more in it from Wizards Throne (AOW II) , but I am trusting Triumph to get a good amount of DL content.  This game kills HOMM, and Fallen Enchantress.  It was the first game to utilize the Underworld, and Environmental spell effects.  While they have borrowed a little too much from HOMM and dumb down some of the dimensional combat, it's still a great game, could it be better?  Yes, but it is worth the money.  A Huge map will keep you busy for a few days.  The longer you play, in my estimate the more you will get into the mechanics and the depth of the game.  You can choose your own destiny Evil or Good, it all depends on whether you want to slaughter a bunch of friendly nymphs and ferries or make peace with everyone.  Graphics are good, not great but the game play makes up for everything.  If you enjoy HOMM (Hero's of Might and Magic) or Fallen Enchantress then get this game.  You won't regret it.			"

Really great job of mixing the elements of the first two games as well as adding in its own features. Especially a fan of the Sorcerer class, and the Soundtrack is magnificent. If I had to pick one issue, it's with the races. The Goblins continue to be fairly lame, some of the races are utterly useless with the wrong class (High Elf Dreadnought, for one) and I just feel that there were TOO many races cut. Really missing the Tigrans from 2, and the Nomads from Shadow Magic. Overall, though, very excellent. Highly recommend.			"

												The strategic level plays very simialr to Civilization games, with considerably less managment involved, with more focus on exploring and fighting than diplomacy. Fighting is the centerpiece of the game with all the myriad units filling thier own niche. The different races have rosters of simialr core units, but each one puts some different twists, either stat or ability wise, such as goblin infantry being the cheapest but having the lowest hitpoints, or orc archers causing bleeding damage and so on. The additon of all sorts of spells across the different classes always makes combat more interesting from chain lightning to cherubs you can usually zap, burn, blast, heal, shield something in the fights.It is a good thing the combat is so interesting though as the strategic level mainly serves as a conduit and context for the turn-based battles, the only way to win is to defeat your enemies, you can form alliances and there is a diplomacy system with dispositions and item and city gifting, but the end goal is usaually either kill everyone, or make a few friends, and kill everyone else.The one sorta exception to that is the independents (minor non-player or cpu factions). These will often be something not found in the normal factions, like giants or faeires or skeletons, and if you can ally with them they will give you a quest, usally involving killing something, and then after 1-3 of these will join your faction, allwoing you to recruit the special units. Of course you could always just kill them and absorbt thier dwellings, effectively accomplishin the same thing.All in all, game is a lot of fun with a lot of replayability, it seems to  trade strategic depth on the imperial level for very high quality on the turn-based battles.

												For those who have played ""Age of Wonders 2"" or ""AoW: Shadow Magic"" you will find that this improves upon them both by greatly speeding up the tactical combat, adding depth to terrain and abilities, all while maintaining the same feel. The research has been streamlined as well, and while there are a LOT more tech trees they have all been pruned to accommodate the scope. IE: before you picked your school(s) of magic and that was your tech tree. Now you have 6 classes each with their own tech tree, spell schools, and optional tech for expander or explorers (they got rid of the 20 traits from before) For those who have not played any AoW games, you will be happy to know that this game is the most faithful spin-off / clone of the original ""Masters of Magic"", the game that started it all for many of us. AoW 3 feels like a bridge between Heroes of Might and Magic and Civilization 5. Great game with only minor bugs so far... many multiplayer issues but I am sure that will be ironed out with time. I have not tried the campaign, and probably wont get to that for a while because the random map generation is just so good. Easily a 9/10, and one of the best 4x games on the market (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate).I value this game at $30, and would be willing to pay more if they had the number of races Age of Wonders 2 had.

Luckily, I know a fir bit about other 4x games to fill in the blanks. But research is still a mystery to me.Also, in  the tutorial/campaign some of the starting research options were different when I restarted (Yes, I died in 2 turns - damn auto-combat)But does look very promising and I am enjoying it so far. I particularly like how the map changes to a drawn map when fully zoomed out.It is a solid game and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes strategy games. Plus, it has a lot of information in its in-game ""wiki"" book about lore ans units for those who are interested.			"

												Well, First off I want to start with saying that I love strategy games. (Even though I usually aint that good at them, I still love 'em.) And one of the first strategy games I fell inlove with, was Age of wonders 2: Shadow magic.So it was only natural that I'd buy this game as soon as it came out. (I shouldn't have done it, in hindsight- It was not in my budget) But I dont regret it one bit. This game has provided me with countless of hours of fun, and I dont think it will stop there. The only downsides I can think of at the moment, is that there is some connectivity issues on the multiplayer side (But that tends to happen for most games, one way or another) And that there is a lot less races now than earlier.But that will probably get fixed, with DLC's and such in the future. I know that there has been talk about a Necromancer DLC actually.So if you love fantasy strategy, I recommend this game heavily. Whom would not want to play an Orcish prophet of Orc Jesus- Whom died for our Dakka? Spread the gospel, Brother!Or perhaps you prefere to be a sneaky goblin rogue, whom uses political backstabbing and foul  tricks to achive your victory? So in short, I love this game, and I'd like to heavily recommend it to everyone whom reads this.			"

												Well, First off I want to start with saying that I love strategy games. (Even though I usually aint that good at them, I still love 'em.) And one of the first strategy games I fell inlove with, was Age of wonders 2: Shadow magic.So it was only natural that I'd buy this game as soon as it came out. (I shouldn't have done it, in hindsight- It was not in my budget) But I dont regret it one bit. This game has provided me with countless of hours of fun, and I dont think it will stop there. The only downsides I can think of at the moment, is that there is some connectivity issues on the multiplayer side (But that tends to happen for most games, one way or another) And that there is a lot less races now than earlier.But that will probably get fixed, with DLC's and such in the future.

												I really thought this game was  letdown.  Sorry, Triumph, but what I liked about this game series was the epic-level wizardry, and you've totally dumbed it down.  It really all comes down to the downgrade from domain-level spell to city-level.  Now you cast the same spell over and over, only to have the compy players dispel it randomly around your empire.  The troops are all weaker, too.  Playing daconians?  No red dragons for you.  Your best unit is now... flyers.  Yay.  It's like they cut the best options out and then expect you to be happier with  the stupid bottom tier troops.  Oh, and your wizard (or whatever) is now just another hero.Maybe you'll get some of the old awesomeness back with an expansion or something, but right now, though, if you're looking for an epic sequel.  Look elsewhere.  This is decidedly NOT epic.			"

												Short Version: The game looks gorgeous, has tons of replayability with a solid battle AI, and some of the most fun tactial battles of any game I can think of.  If you want fantasy battles look no further.Longer Version: A lot of people compare this game to Fallen Enchantress or Civ, and I think that comparison does very little justice to any of the games involved.  All three games are 4X games in that you can explore, exploit, expand, and exterminate enemies, but have very different focuses.  In general, Civilization games thrive on the first three ""x""s but have awful, boring warfare.  Fallen Enchantress is well-rounded, with decent battles and interesting RPG mechanics, but ultimately leaves a lot of the exploitation to be desired.  AoW 3 would be at the extreme opposite Civ: the battles are great, and, nominally, so are the other x's, but there is very little to do with any resource except use it to eXterminate.  The good news is that battles are a lot of fun with dozens of well-balanced, interesting units and lots of great spells.			"

A great fantasy strategy gameAlthough I think this game doesn't fully capture the ""wonders"" part of the old Age of Wonders it's a great addition to the modern fantasy strategy genre. This is primarily a quibble on the look of the game based on versions 1 & 2. Particularly in the strategic map, I feel that the new version lacks on a certain visual feedback that the old ones had that made them look more woundrous and magical than the new version does. You may not agree with me on this, and that's fine, it really doesn't affect the gameplay.The hero creation is interesting and varied, and the hero that leads your army has a significant impact on gameplay as the units/spells available vary depending on your choices. There are interesting items you can get, including a variety of mounts. I still wish this part was a bit more fleshed out, but it's still enough to make that part of the game interesting.Large campaign maps take forever and a day to complete, which sounds great but I still have yet to finish one. I've spent very little time in the game's campaign, I usually just play random maps.			"

												To those who love games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, XCOM, etc..., I would highly recommend this game. It takes the core elements of great tactics style RPGs, and throws them inside a slightly simplified empire building game a la Civilization V.I can acknowledge that the strategic portion of the game lacks some of the depth that can be found in the most hardcore strategy games, but I do not feel this is a flaw. One of the greatest games ever devised, Chess, has only 6 unique pieces, and in its standard style of play, only allows for 1v1 competition. There is a delightfully simple elegance to the units and technologies available in AoWIII (which offer many more choices than Chess). Taken from a purely turn-based strategy game perspective, they would seem shallow compared to the game's peers, but in the context of a deep turn-based tactical RPG (with heroes levelling from 1-30, earning skill points to allocate each level, and spells to research, and gear to equip) it is plenty complex enough.My favorite thing about this game is how amazingly stable my multiplayer experience has been.  My first time launching online multiplayer, it checked my connectivity rating, and told me it was poor due to firewall settings. I clicked a link provided in-game, and in a totally crisp and not buggy fashion, minimized my client and sent me to the company's help page, wherein I was given the neccessary port to forward. I did so, had the game check again, and was good to go. A friend and I have long searched for a good co-operative tactical RPG experience. The best I have yet found was FFT: The Lion War for PSP. It's a shame that a hand-held game system has trumped PC for so long in this niche. XCOM lacks co-op campaign functionality, Eador is horribly buggy and unstable, and the others I've tried are all crumby. In AoWIII, I've found that harmonious combination of enjoyable gameplay and completely (and I mean 8 straight hours of addictive, no crashes or disconnections) stable multiplayer.Watch some videos of this game and decide if it suits your interests, but as for my opinion, I can give this one an A+.

Looking forward to getting as good as I was in 2, and playing it online.By the way, the person who bought me this game (you know who you are), if you're reading this? I hate you.

												I remember playing Age of Wonders 1 and 2 so long ago.  I can't recall how many hours I dumped into those games, especially the second one.  It was the reinvention of Master of Magic, and I loved it.  You get the great world map combined with many fantastic races and tactical combat on separate maps.  I could not have been happier.  It was the fantasy version of Civilization in many respects.When I saw AoW3, I got anxious.  Finally it released, and I got to play it.  It truly has everything to remind me of the previous versions I loved, and then some.  Random Maps, finally.  Relevant units, yay.AoW3 has random maps.  This seems normal, but previously they did not.  So after a while, it becomes mundane with the same strategies and outcomes per scenario.  You can build cities!  Couldn't do that in the old days.  It was all preset and you took what was already there.  Units are relevant now.  In AoW2 the best strategy was to raze every single building and town you took (except your starting city), then destroy the neutral armies that appeared, and farm all the xp and items you could for your starting hero. He becomes nigh invincible, even to tier 3 units, and has absurd movement with flight, so he can just zoom around the map with a scorched earth strategy.  I have not tried to do this in AoW3, but I suspect it would be ineffective.If you liked the previous games in the series, you will still like this one. I cannot say anything bad about it. It is in line with everything I expected it to have. It stays true to the series, and offers some new things. The only thing it doesn't have, is the number of races that the priors had.  No Dark Elves, no Undead, etc... DLC right?  Seems fine.All that being said, I would go 8/10 if you like the genre or the old games.  Personally, it's a 7 for me, and that is just because although I want to enjoy the battles and fight them manually, they become something of a chore to me and I end up auto'ing most of them, even if its a huge super important fight.  I would not have the patience anymore for multiplayer if people do manual fights, yet the prospect of not having the option to manual fight seems to gut a large aspect of the game's draw for me.So I recommend this game overall, but you mind get a little bored with it if you have leaned towards RTS style games since playing AoW2, and maybe that's not worth the cost of the game for you.  Even so, it's a fine product and I am happy to support it, even if I don't play it as much as I thought I would.  (so many good games these days)			"

												This game is a puzzle. Not a puzzler game - it is a jigsaw of likes and disklikes. It has medicore graphics (both models and effects), sound gets a bit annoying at times and the creator of the UI could learn a lot from authors of those implemented f.e. in Might and Magic Heroes VI. BUT!The research is quite fun. The magic is awesome (and I mean owesome in an old style way; if you played Master of Magic, you'd know what i maen) and the resource system is simple and neat. Also you have bazzilion of skills for your heroes (because when they lvl up, you can experience a point based skill buying system - and it's good IMO) and the number of units in game is sick.The way the map is composed is known from titles such as Civ and other 4X fantasy themed games, BUT it also contains ruins, vaults, ancient burial ground, dragon lairs, mana sources, all sort of ""pick me up"" goodies and more.Conclusion: at first I hesitated even considering the game worth playing. But now, after some hours into it I'm happy I have it. If there would be a scale to judge the quality of a game, I would give it a strong 78 out of 100. AND if the devs get to work and create some patches fixing the UI and animation glitches - it will be much more.			"

												The game I didn't know I was looking for. As a young man I loved Lords of Magic despite its many faults, and this game succeeds in delivering a fantasy strategy game with a good amount of turn-based tactical combat layered onto a fairly simple empire-management system.If I had to criticize, I'd say that defeating the campaigns relies a little too heavily on mass-produced cannon fodder than I'd like, as I prefer cruising with one super-army of elite troops and superior tactics to the war of attrition the AI plays for. This need is fulfilled by setting up a custom scenario and basically dungeon-crawling through the world.			"

												Where do I start...let me first say this game has definitely bkown away my expectations and what a turn based game should be. I have been a follower of the Heroes of Might and Magic series since the beginning. Developers at the Heroes camp need to take a page out of this book and use it. The biggest thing I like about this game is the option to ally with either a human or AI opponent and then play on whatever map you like. There are no restrictions to this at all. Just like in Civ games where all the options are open and you create the game for how you want to play. Same thing here. Being able to go around the map with your hero and its accompanied army just seeking out riches and enemy armies is so cool. Also your allies can travel with you and go into battle with you. First time I have ever seen that implemented into a game before. Juat imagine taking on a enemy faction along with your buddy online or hotseat taking on whatever came your way. Casting spells and supporting each other. This game does it right. I recommend to anyone this series of games. Plus two huge dlc addons available as well. Can't wait to take anothwr turn!			"

While I can understand since subterranean empires are automaticly at a great advantige I still find this development bothersome. Maybe in a future DLC or in a mod I may overlooked due to no rating there is a race or modification that allowes such a change however I would also like to see a custom race builder in the sense of Endless Space. You pick a template (aesthetics and native empire race (which would include the type of units)) and then be able to do a point buy system to create a varient race from the ground up. I wouldn't mind to see the same with classes but I understand that would be WAYYYYYY to difficult.

												Fantastic game.  A wonderful game for fantasy turn-based strategy gamers.  A rich fantasy world on the strategy map, plus a rich turn-based tactical combat.  It has a feeling of high quality throughout.  As I write this it is version 1.704 with two expansions, so there has been a lot of polishing.  There is sufficient richness to keep it totally aborbing at both the strategic map and tactical map levels.  I always get the ""I want to take one more turn"" feeling from this game.  It's like living in a rich fantasy world of the imagination.  I like this type of game more than the strategic map only games such as Fallen Enchantress, Sorcerer King, or Endless Legend.  I respect those games, but I find I spend my time playing this one.  A nice tutorial campaign and a searchable tome of knowledge make this game accessible to new  players such as myself.  A tip of the hat to the developer, Triumph Studios.  I'm won over as a fan of this game.			"

												Classic 4X gameplay, with a stronger focus on combat that diplomacy and a stronger focus on unit managment as opposed to city/kingdom managment. The tur-based strategic batles allow you to spectate and interact with the units in a way most other 4X games lack. The customization in Class and Race allow for hightened replayability and a greater sence of diversity amoung the units and opponents. I would highly reccomend this game for anyone who enjoys 4X and strategy games. Graphics are colorful and detailed as well, and the music/sound is good enough. 9/10			"

												With the strategic and tactical mix, AoW3 has that Master of Magic feel while retaining the familiarity of the AoW 1 and 2 games.  I have enjoyed this game very much.  The classes seem to be very similar and playing them doesn't really require a different strategy for each.  Fewer balanced classes that played differently would have been more enjoyable but very few games have ever gotten that formula right.  I also find that occasionally I can win a difficult battle with autocombat ex:  (two six man armies each led by a hero against four fliers and a hunter in a city) that I couldn't win manually and vice versa ex: (I beat an eight man army lead by a hero with three elven archers).  Not sure what that's about but if I redo a battle a bunch of times and get my butt kicked I can occasionally win it with autocombat.  Also a little frustrating when my hero doesn't get disjunction to research during a random game but oh well makes for a challenge.			"

												The game has great promise and is initially fun to play.  The campaigns are kind of fun.  There is no real story behind the campaigns, from what I've seen so far.  The graphics are very good.  However, after several games played through to the end, you will find that they all wind up coming down to the same thing, a bunch of the same types of units slugging it out.The game only has about 2 dozen playable units, but they changed the names slightly (depending on race) and changed the appearance.  Example Dwarf Manticore Rider, Draconian Manticore Rider, Elven Manticore Rider.  They all have almost the same stats, but look different.  The racial differences are too insignificant to make a difference.  The spells and traits, although there are many types, are for the most part not enough to make up for the overwhelming power of Tier IV and above units.  You can use different battle tactics, such as flanking, and get a bonus on your attack.  Currently, wounded units fight at full strength.  Heroes are limited in how many can be acquired in the game, but you can have as many other units as you can afford.The balance is horrible overall.Instead of creating a complex version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, they made it so it is just a bunch of Rocks fighting it out.  The rocks all look different!  But they are still Rocks.Every high quality strategic and tactical game out there is designed in such a way that the units/skills/abilities/spells are either complimentary to one another, or a counter to one another.  These high quality games have tremendous depth because there are so many options in how the game is played.  They understand that there should be strengths and weaknesses to almost all choices.  If, for example, I rushed in with a bunch of tanks I would get chewed up by the anti-tank helocoptors, which are themselves weak to anti-air units, etc.  AOW III does not really do this.  Instead it is a slug fest between the hardest hitting, high hitpoint units.  Basically, it's just a bunch of tanks fighting it out.  Booorrring.I really want to like this game...*Update* I'm still playing it, bugs and all.  Until they balance the game better and offer more depth, I will continue to give it a thumbs down.			"

												This game is a wonderful continuation for a long-time fan of Age of Wonders.  It polishes up what was lacking in the previous games while also bringing in welcome changes such as removing forced alignment from players and new spells.However, one of the most glaring issues with this game is that it suffers from you not buying the entire game.  While this isn't a severe problem for this game specifically compared to other games, it will not be as complete as older games.  There are not as much races (you can complete the race splash by buying DLC), not as much content, not as much pre-made scenarios, etc. than the previous games.  It feels like the game was intentionally cut up to serve the players the rest of the content with DLC.If you can live with the DLC, this is a fantastic game to buy.			"

												This game has become so much ""YESSSSSS!"".I considder AoW3, including it's DLCs ""Eternal Lord Expansion"" and ""Golden Realms Expansion"" a must-have for anyone who loves him some Strategy and tactics, mixed with a little bit of RPG.* The Main-Game without those DLCs is nice, but lacks content in comparison with the old AoW or AoW2. Not being bad itself, it's pretty bland. Technically: *Do your Main-Thing and win*.* The DLC: Golden Realms introduces some minor appetizers, giving you some features to play around with.* The DLC: Etermal Lords is, by far, among the best DLCs delivered for any game, if you'd ask me. Just for being able to play undead kitties makes this worthwhile.* The DLC:Dunno the name, is like ""Okay."". Rather a personal achievement for throwing out money, but still: Content is content. I recommend it. Except in the case of: You only buy the maingame. This may or may not give you a bad perspective of the game, which actually has alot of possibilities.It is nice and you will, someday, know that too. "

												Did you or do you love the Heroes Might and Magic games?!Did you or do you love the Disciples games?! (I have heard bade things about Ressurection so ignore that one!)Then you will LOVE this game! Do not fret so much on the people talking so negatively about this game.If you love long hours for one game (I have been playing the second campain mission for days now. Yea its that intense)building or taking over cities to widen your territory for more resources, and intense turn-based battles (or auto-battle), get this game! It has the large maps of Heroes, with the army formations of Disciples--- (6 whatevers per army including heroes and its not quantity like the 'zongz' or 'hordes' in Heroes, only one each unit (althought there can be 1,3, or 6 ""people"" in one unit formation)and instead of changing like they do in Disciples, they ""level up"" and get stronger.)--- while adding its own spin. You can make builders and settlers that make roads, cities, forts, and watchtowers. Its own spells and such.Like Heroes you have all kinds of spells you can research and use (although you do not have to build a mage guild). Unlike Heroes you do not ""go into"" a city, a panel just pops up and you select it. Although the city look does change over time. Sort of like a TW 2 Rome, where little houses spread out around it. So who really wants to read every little detail. You can go watch Youtube vidoes of actaul gameplay right? Games like these arnt for gamers who want a Ryse Rome kind of game. A salute my fellow, slowly take over every inch of the map and clear it out, plus build it all up how you want, gamers! Go Warcraft 1-3 and BFME games XDI will say, at first I regretted buying this. OMG why did I buy this when I can just play my Disciples II and have basically the same thing. HA! Discpiles is (while I have not played the new one from this year (2014..drool....) no where near as intense and LONG (again think Heroes!) as AoW. Granted it is limited. Each race has the exact same building, and each unit while looks, attributes and powers are different, each tier or class (Tier 1 Calvary or Tier 3 Archer) is comparribly the same. If you want a good, intense, in depth fighting game that you can or want to spend huge amount of time ------- (I have put in 17.5 hours as I post this, maybe 2 of which was on the first mission, the rest on the second campain mission AND I am only half way through the map....well the top level anyhow ;) I have barely done anything on the under level. OH I FORGOT! With builders or special units like the giant beetle you can 'dig; through certain walls and explore more, while more or less combining the whole under level....be careful you arnt the only one who can :P)-------- get this game!Even do like me and put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale.Hope this helped. Feel free to ask any questions to me!If you do not know what Heroes is OR Discplis. Go explore and enjoy:) Trust me. You will love it.			"

												This title reminds me of the Heros of Might and Magic series and has many similarities to it.  Fans of it will likely enjoy Age of Wonders as well.  It improves on the familiar formula with ideas from other strategy games such as cities which expand over time and generate income from resources withing their spheres of infulence.  Unlike Heroes you are able to estlablish new cities on the map as well as fortifications and road networks.  Armies made up completely of flying units are able to cross lakes and mountains and terraforming spells can improve your territory or ruin your enemy's, effecting the morale of cities, which have terrian preferences and dislikes depending on their racial characteristics.  A unified research system unlocks new spells, units, traits, abilities, etc.  Like heroes the map has an overworld and underworld providing difficult stategic oppertunities for surprise attacks and shortcuts.  Unlike Heros, multiple armies in adjactent hexes can participate in the same battle for epic scale combat and seige warfare.  Multiple unique army leaders can band together into a fighting unit along with expendable military units in groupings of up to six, and will fight alongside their troops in battle as cavalry units capable of both ranged and melee attacks as well as spells and special abilities.  Leaders also gain experience and can be improved with increased stats and other perks upon leveling up.  Familiar fantasy races compete in this setting such as Elves, Orcs, Draconians, Dwarves, and Undead, amoung others.  Two campains are available with the game as well as custom maps and multiplayer options.			"

												Did you or do you love the Heroes Might and Magic games?!Did you or do you love the Disciples games?! (I have heard bade things about Ressurection so ignore that one!)Then you will LOVE this game! Do not fret so much on the people talking so negatively about this game.If you love long hours for one game (I have been playing the second campain mission for days now. Yea its that intense)building or taking over cities to widen your territory for more resources, and intense turn-based battles (or auto-battle), get this game! It has the large maps of Heroes, with the army formations of Disciples--- (6 whatevers per army including heroes and its not quantity like the 'zongz' or 'hordes' in Heroes, only one each unit (althought there can be 1,3, or 6 ""people"" in one unit formation)and instead of changing like they do in Disciples, they ""level up"" and get stronger.)--- while adding its own spin. You can make builders and settlers that make roads, cities, forts, and watchtowers. Its own spells and such.Like Heroes you have all kinds of spells you can research and use (although you do not have to build a mage guild). Unlike Heroes you do not ""go into"" a city, a panel just pops up and you select it. Although the city look does change over time. Sort of like a TW 2 Rome, where little houses spread out around it. So who really wants to read every little detail. You can go watch Youtube vidoes of actaul gameplay right? Games like these arnt for gamers who want a Ryse Rome kind of game. A salute my fellow, slowly take over every inch of the map and clear it out, plus build it all up how you want, gamers! Go Warcraft 1-3 and BFME games XDI will say, at first I regretted buying this. OMG why did I buy this when I can just play my Disciples II and have basically the same thing. HA! Discpiles is (while I have not played the new one from this year (2014..drool....) no where near as intense and LONG (again think Heroes!) as AoW. Granted it is limited. Each race has the exact same building, and each unit while looks, attributes and powers are different, each tier or class (Tier 1 Calvary or Tier 3 Archer) is comparribly the same. If you want a good, intense, in depth fighting game that you can or want to spend huge amount of time ------- (I have put in 17.5 hours as I post this, maybe 2 of which was on the first mission, the rest on the second campain mission AND I am only half way through the map....well the top level anyhow ;) I have barely done anything on the under level. OH I FORGOT! With builders or special units like the giant beetle you can 'dig; through certain walls and explore more, while more or less combining the whole under level....be careful you arnt the only one who can :P)-------- get this game!Even do like me and put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale.Hope this helped. Feel free to ask any questions to me!If you do not know what Heroes is OR Discplis. Go explore and enjoy:) Trust me. You will love it.			"

												Great throw back to the original but with many new twists. Hard mode is truly hard. Each race is unique and each class is unique. Combine that with the many neutral monsters throughout the world map and you have a game with more enemy variety than most MMOs. The campaign is dynamic compared to most modern strategy games. Sadly it is not as dynamic as the original game, either way they do a pretty good job. The storyline itself is unique and well narrated. All in all AOW III is by far one of the best games in its genre. The only criticism I have is with the genre itself and that is games and the campaign take a long time. Excellent game. Buy it for 50% off ftw.			"

The game doesnt have things like base building but allows you to terramorph and expand your domain and some things like a better diplomacy system and more ways to customize your characters and cities would improve the game a ton.

												I don't even know where to begin to describe the high amount of production quality and really how deep this game is. To start its fair to say this game is the offspring of Civilization 5 and XCOM: Enemy Unknown all set in a fantasy realm with magic and different races. You have large scale geographically diverse maps that allow you to build individual cities and armies to form a massive empire. Strategy and tactics have to be considered as all combat is done in standalone battlefields, not the overworld. The tile of the defender determines the actual battlefield; I was on attacked on a bridge, outnumbered 2:1 and I won the fight because I funneled the attackers onto this narrow bridge and let them have it. Age of Wonders 3 merges the best things about Civilization 5 and tactical games like XCOM to make a game that really reminds of you the choices you've made and the paths you lead. Pros:- Stunning graphics- In depth tactical battles- Intelligent AI- Varied multi-tier units and spells/abilities- Robust leader customization- Two campaigns; divided by difficulty and are very lengthy- Features Underground tunnels/caves to add an extra layer to the map- Alt+Tab friendly :)Cons- Steep learning curve, most advanced concepts aren't taught in the campaign until you've learned them the hard way- DRM online only, have to sign up for a third-party account to play- May take over your entire day if not carefulFinal Score = 90% / 100% "

												I think I need to write something to up vote this. It's an awesome war strategy game with a lot of options to customize your hero, and your armies. The battles can be small, or massive, and take place in a lot of well designed battlefields. The world map is randomized for custom games, but still has a lot of options to determine what the map will generally be like. The cities have a fairly basic tier upgrade system, but the game is definitely based on the warfare.			"

												So, I just finished my very first complete game scenario (and won!). And I must say I love this game. I took my time, watched some how-to videos (a couple hours worth) to figure it out, and enjoyed the heck out of it. There is a defnite uphill learning curve to it, But those youtube vids were great in helping me figure out combat, spells, upgrades to empire, cities, units, etc. While I have come to enjoy turn-based strategy games, fantasy games have never been my bag. So the fact that I couldn't put this down once I found the rhythm of the game says much. In fact I am thinking seriously about buying the DLC to give it another playthrough with some of the new classes/races. Then again, I just made a Human Theocrat because I kind of fell (several times, LOL) for the enemy Human Succubus's I came across in the game. So, I may just give them a go. 8/9 out of 10. Def worth playing!			"

												I must say that my first impression when playing this game was not very positive. It seemed to me that the focus was too heavily on battles, and that the game was forcing every turn the player to do some actions dictated by the progress of the cities, rise of new heroes, etc. I felt a general lack of freedom. But playing again after some time (and a couple of expansions) I have changed my mind. This is a very well done game, and I tend to agree with someone saying that this is one of the best modern successors of the venerable Master of Magic. Extremely good game for those who love fantasy turn-based strategy, with a large variety of troops and spells, and challenging AI players.			"

												If you like games like the Civilization series, or the Heroes of Might & Magic series, and are hankering for a new high-fantasy strategy game to play, do yourself a favor and check this game out! This was my first experience with the Age of Wonders series, I was looking through the Steam store for something new, saw it and decided to give it a go. I didn't expect much given the usual quality of today's games but man was I surprised!Here is my pros and cons list based on my experience playing the base game, I haven't bought the expansion packs yet but I definitely plan to.Pros : - Challenging gameplay that requires you to think ahead, as well as think quickly on your feet.- Good AI.- Wide variety of fantasy creatures to go up against, or enlist in your own army.- Active modding community on the Steam Workshop.- Beautiful visuals.- Large arsenal of spells, abilities, upgrades and equipment that make each Leader feel unique.- Nice soundtrack that does a good job of adding to the immersion.- A character creation system that offers a good deal of customization for this sort of game.- Boatloads of replayability.Cons : - Some units and abilities seem rather imbalanced, but nothing gamebreaking.- Challenge can sometimes ramp up drastically.- Cities could use a bit more diversity, while it is possible to have a city that is specialized in performing a certain role, I haven't yet found that to be necessary and as a result all my cities have pretty much had the same buildings. I think this could have been improved by making a tech-tree for cities so you would have to decide what you want that city's main purpose to be. But, since the game is focused more on armies and combat rather than city building, this isn't a huge deal.- Very few visual changes on your Leaders and Heroes in regard to their equipment, the only items that change your appearance are your mount and your weapon. This is more of a personal desire and not so much something the game did wrong,  it IS a strategy game after all and would require alot of effort to implement. but still, I was a bit let down when I looted a very awesome looking helmet and chest piece only to find that it didn't affect my appearance. Once again, not a huge deal though.			"

												One of the best TBS games of all time. Pays homage to MoM, but is better for all around addiction and playability. My favorite features of this game is the team combat option and the map view at full zoom. Everyone should have this game in your library.			"

												I'm a bit biased, been a fan of the franchise since i was little, but this game is really good. Pro's:- Lot's and lot's of different customisations, giving you the opportunity to enjoy a different game each game- Campaign is fun, but the multiplayer works like a treat, different settings give you an option to view what your allies are doing, or just kick your friends asses with your army of the allmighty baby shock serpents- Simultanious turns are fun if you play with friends- A load of different units and unit types, the classes work a treat giving you even more options to play the game you want to play- scenario's, random maps, the works for a turn-based strat. Cons: - It can be a bit frustrating to be attacked by 5 archon titans- Or bone dragons- Or queen spidersBut hey, it's a fun strategy game, a multiplayer game can be done in about 60 turns if you're playing mellow. You can customize a lot, meaning you can set up your random map for a fast game, or slow.And it has baby shock serpents.Best AOW in my opinion, 8/10			"

												Age of Wonders III is an incredibly fun, turn-based strategy game that is formed around its ""deep fantasy"" theme. Rather than progressing through a series of eras, as other popular turn-based, world-domination strategy games do, this game puts the player in charge of one of many fantasy races and it is the player's job to push their people to victory.One mechanical element that draws me to this game, and one that is fairly unique to AoW3 (as far as I know), is the tactical hex-based combat. Unlike the Civilization series (which I also recommend), AoW3 allows players to take direct control over their armies when they are engaged in combat with enemy forces. Instead of forcing an odds-based animation and resolution of the battle (which is still an option, but not required), the game allows players to enter into a battlefield that is generated based on the terrain types of the embattled hex as well as its special features and those of the neighboring hexes. This provides tactically savvy players the opportunity to achieve satisfying victories in the face of almost guaranteed auto-resolve defeats.Another element of the game that I find quite satisfying is the ability to create your own hero character who serves as your civilization's leader for the duration of the game. There are a significant number of races, classes, and looks based on each of those that players can choose from, and there's even a rudimentary skill selection process for your leader that can help players who want to lead their race by pursuing a certain playstyle during their game. These leader units not only represent your race in diplomatic encounters with other players, but they also serve as actual, usable units on the battlefield that can lead players' forces to gallant victories (or crushing defeats).The base game has a lot to explore for new players, so definitely start with that if you're just trying the game out. Once you get the hang of it, and also develop an inevitable liking for the game, I would highly recommend the DLC that introduces new races and campaigns. This DLC adds to the already numerous choices for leaders, races, and playstyles, and should give players who like the campaigns many more hours of content to play through.			"

												Definitely a game worth buying.  I didnt know what to expect when I first purchased this game.  I thought it would be a half ♥♥♥ version of civilization.  But really comes out on its own as a 4x game mashed with class levels.  I wish they make a sequel to this.  Replayability is pretty damn high with modes you can play. I usually play this game in 4x mode. And the customization for each race you can be is pretty in depth. Definitely worth a buy at 29 dollars or if it falls on sale. "

												Classic 4X gameplay, with a stronger focus on combat that diplomacy and a stronger focus on unit managment as opposed to city/kingdom managment. The tur-based strategic batles allow you to spectate and interact with the units in a way most other 4X games lack. The customization in Class and Race allow for hightened replayability and a greater sence of diversity amoung the units and opponents. I would highly reccomend this game for anyone who enjoys 4X and strategy games. Graphics are colorful and detailed as well, and the music/sound is good enough. 9/10			"

												With the strategic and tactical mix, AoW3 has that Master of Magic feel while retaining the familiarity of the AoW 1 and 2 games.  I have enjoyed this game very much.  The classes seem to be very similar and playing them doesn't really require a different strategy for each.  Fewer balanced classes that played differently would have been more enjoyable but very few games have ever gotten that formula right.  I also find that occasionally I can win a difficult battle with autocombat ex:  (two six man armies each led by a hero against four fliers and a hunter in a city) that I couldn't win manually and vice versa ex: (I beat an eight man army lead by a hero with three elven archers).  Not sure what that's about but if I redo a battle a bunch of times and get my butt kicked I can occasionally win it with autocombat.  Also a little frustrating when my hero doesn't get disjunction to research during a random game but oh well makes for a challenge.			"

												The game has great promise and is initially fun to play.  The campaigns are kind of fun.  There is no real story behind the campaigns, from what I've seen so far.  The graphics are very good.  However, after several games played through to the end, you will find that they all wind up coming down to the same thing, a bunch of the same types of units slugging it out.The game only has about 2 dozen playable units, but they changed the names slightly (depending on race) and changed the appearance.  Example Dwarf Manticore Rider, Draconian Manticore Rider, Elven Manticore Rider.  They all have almost the same stats, but look different.  The racial differences are too insignificant to make a difference.  The spells and traits, although there are many types, are for the most part not enough to make up for the overwhelming power of Tier IV and above units.  You can use different battle tactics, such as flanking, and get a bonus on your attack.  Currently, wounded units fight at full strength.  Heroes are limited in how many can be acquired in the game, but you can have as many other units as you can afford.The balance is horrible overall.Instead of creating a complex version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, they made it so it is just a bunch of Rocks fighting it out.  The rocks all look different!  But they are still Rocks.Every high quality strategic and tactical game out there is designed in such a way that the units/skills/abilities/spells are either complimentary to one another, or a counter to one another.  These high quality games have tremendous depth because there are so many options in how the game is played.  They understand that there should be strengths and weaknesses to almost all choices.  If, for example, I rushed in with a bunch of tanks I would get chewed up by the anti-tank helocoptors, which are themselves weak to anti-air units, etc.  AOW III does not really do this.  Instead it is a slug fest between the hardest hitting, high hitpoint units.  Basically, it's just a bunch of tanks fighting it out.  Booorrring.I really want to like this game...*Update* I'm still playing it, bugs and all.  Until they balance the game better and offer more depth, I will continue to give it a thumbs down.			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is an excellent 4X strategy game that is hard to learn, but rewarding to play. Compared to other games of it's type, AW3 offers a much deeper combat system and a wide veriety of strategies and compositions. If you have a lot of spare time, love/are interested in grand strategy titles, and/or like the themes of traitional medieval fantacy, I would highly reccomend this game.Pros:- Excellent turn based combat system that favors strategy over raw stats- Races and Classes feel unique to play and favor sometimes wildly different strategies. Lots of options.- Optional, yet deep, character customization.- The world is fun to explore - and very rewarding. There's always something productive to do.- DLC adds game changing elements that are worth investing in if you enjoy the base game- You CAN add more races into your empire, leading to even more wild compositions- Campaign mode offers a more flavorful world, and each unit has a flavorful story tied to it. World is more immersive.Cons:- Some race/class combinations are much weaker than others.- Tutorial is very bad - game is hard to learn, and harder to understand.- Campaign maps favor rush tatics over late game strategies. Also, unfathomable gaps exist between difficult levels (easy being almost braindead, and normal being infuriatingly hard.)- Barebones diplomacy system. - The base game its all about domination. Mre options are availible with DLC, but I would advise rushing to buy something if you don't know whether or not its right for you.- Cities lack much thematic diversity, are like the diplomatic system are more barebone.- No ""just one more turn"" button.I give Age of Wonders 3 a 9/10. Its pros outweigh almost all of its cons, and with a more in depth diplomacy system and optional post victory gameplay, it could easily have earned a 10/10 from me.			"

												The scenarios take a long time to accomplish and it feels like a grind for the majority of it.  Most of the research that the game has you do has little to no effect on the outcomes.  The game feels somewhat like a demo.  A lot of the flavor art features races that are only available after the expansion is purchased.  I can't say I didn't have some fun and if sitting down for a three hour scenario is your cup of tea, game on.  Otherwise, maybe find something else.			"

The wide variety of units and abilities ensures that there is always a new factor to force you to change your pattern.

I love the graphics and battle system. 1 Thing I would add would be something like make custom heroes as well. Like some sort of tavern where you could make own heroes like the king one.

No more uber stacks as in the previous titles, the devs have done a great job to balance all the stuff The mod system is very powerful. and allow even more variety in the play style!  the AI is quite smart so even in solo play you have a good challenge ; ""cherry on the cake"" the random map generator is good.If you're looking for a very good game with a long durability, you have found it!

												I love this game, the units are great, sub factions are larger than in other games (Kinda like the city states in civ) You get to have a hero that you can fully level and customize. Explore dungeons for rewards and play multiplayer with friends.Fully customize your race.Great graphics.Terrain makes a HUGE differance depending on the modifiers of your hero and units.The manual combat is very fun and interactive. (Turn based also)One thing to note, the AI is very easy even on the hardest difficulty level. If you want a challenge play with your friends or online with other people. I do hope the devs make the AI harder in the future.			"

												I am partway through my fist co-op game with my g/f (9 hour straight play session...), and I am hooked. Its my first foray into 'age of wonders', but its pretty easy to figure out whats what if you are familiar with Civ (the UI is very similar). I like the option to simulate battles or play them out, it lets our game move along at a nice pace for the little not-so-important battles against misc defenders, but lets you have epic battles played out manually when it matters. There are a ton of different (awesome) creatures that can make up your army, and I get a great kick out of attacking someone with my army of snakes, spiders, dire pengiuns and an ogre :)All in all, highly enjoyable.

												I enjoy AoW3 quite a bit, but the more I played it the more stale the AI got for me.  It's not that it's bad per se, just that it's predictable and usually very passive.  Usually they will turtle up in their cities if you are roaming nearby, even if they are a fair bit stronger than you.  This forces a lot of siege warfare, something that I don't think the game does very well.  You can't sit outside their gates and siege them down, you have to fight their forces full strength every time at their walls.  It gets tedious.  There are ways around this (happiness penalties/strategic spells mainly from Rogue) but the AI gets pretty significant boosts to its economy and happiness which makes it kind of moot.  That said, I still think the game is great.  The units are diverse, the asymmetrical balancing is rather good, and a lot of the racial specializations are nice to have.  Things that I'd like to see in the next iteration:- Smarter, less cheesy AI- Proper siege mechanics- More emphasis on skirmishes/raiding- More cultural/racial buildings and the addition of monuments/wonders- Option for fast move in combat with online play			"

												Update: As I play it more I must say I think the patches have been critical for the longevity of this game. The 5 stacks of T4 rush was getting a bit annoying. Finally: I must admit I am missing some of the Empire management somewhat more than I thought. Still a great game and better than W2. But the Empire side is better in FE: LH  even if the battles and hero development in this one are much better here. _______Overall great war game with light empire managment. Tact battles are really neat. More like HoMM than Civ. Cons: Tech tree is very confusing as there is no tree/path to follow. Just a book with stuff. Needs some minor fixes with next hero, city, etc... BUt they got the big things right. Wish diplomacy and Empire management were more fleshed out a tiny bit and alternate path to victory was there (End game spell). Overall a very solid game and look forward to the minor issues being fixed by patches.			"

												Age of wonders 3 is a turnbased strategygame, with some basebuilding but with a heavy focus on exploration and combat. The look, feel and even some gamemechanics of the game draws heavily upon game like Civilization, Warlock and Heroes of might and magic, wich makes for a easy start into the game, if you are just a bit familiar with these titles. The game offers huge maps to explore, with a lot of sidequest, powerups and ""dungeons"". The terran does impact things like movement and combatwill of your units/armies, as well as the output of certain cities upgrades and even the area in wich combat takes place. The game offers very different ways of upgrading the skills of your heroes, as well as your spells (combat and world) and it really feels like every decision have an impact on the gameplay.Flaws and bugs are few in numbers and rarely more than an slight irritation and never a deal breaker. Definately worth your time and money, if you're into strategy, rpg and empirebuilding.			"

												It's a good game. I think it's more fun than Civ 5, but I agree with some of the reviewers that some of the game mechanics don't make sense. A squad with 1 hp still doing full damage and the flanking rules don't work really well. It's better in many ways than AOW: Shadow Magic with the more 4x elements. But there are some problems... The tools for managing lots of cities and armies are lacking. There's a global spell that the enemy can cast that lower all your armies moral so you can't win any battles and everyone leaves you by the time you can cast a disenchant strong enough for it, so that's pretty unbalanced. It's difficult to get used to right-clicking all the time after playing modern games, so it'd be nice to have an option to have that work differently.			"

												As fan of the Series since AoW1 the reader of this positive review might think, that I'd just be a good fanboy to a well made series. However after being frustreted with 2 other spinoff of Roundbased Game Series, AoW3 was a very positive surprise for me!Other than in those mentioned other ""improved"" game experiences, the developers took to heart the initial strengths of the game, and preserved them, while adding new concepts like the neutral cities and the commander classes.And so you can be pretty sure what to get: a solid Age of Wonders experience with various cool new Ideas built in.There are a few minor things I'm not too happy about.For once the actual number of neutral cities is rather low (4, I believe). When I first met those new type of cities, I imagined them being a core concept of the game, with having 8, or even a dozen of them, seeing as the count of playable races shrinked to 6 . I thought the big diversity of units we know from the predecessors just wandered off into neutrality.So I was kind of depressed to see that you mainly got those 4 neutral cities, and the positive ""first contact""-experience was just something for the first few maps.Later on however, I realized why the race count went down like that:The race you play is entwined with the class you choose, giving you certain racial units with custom skins, which do have some of the racial benefits, but are actually a boon from your class.This makes the effort to create an ingame race exponentialy as high as in the predecessors, and because of that, I can very well understand the seemingly low number of races.On the positive side however, it adds diversity to the game, since the playstyle is not only about racial pick and magical spheres anymore, but adds a third layer of personalisation through the classes.There are some other minor setbacks from the original series in my point of view: The number of buildings on the map to recruit neutral units has been reduced to 1 (tavern); There are randomized heroes with basic class startups to get, instead of the heroes from AoW2, which kind of grow on to you because of their funny descriptions, and their prepicked own advantages; And also the later stages of the campaign become incredibly hero-dependant due to the leveling commander-heroes and the neutral heroes you transfer from map to map.But enough nitpicking.If you enjoyed the predecessors or are generaly into well-balanced tactical round-based game experiences.. make sure to get this one! The classes and races are very well designed, and the campaigns are bit straightforward storywise, but still diversified and interesting. The few experiences I made with online gaming so far were positive as well.			"

												So, I played the original Age of Wonders and Age of Wonders 2, as well Shadow Magic, which was a stand alone expansion for Age of Wonders 2, so I was naturally quite interested when I heard Age of Wonders 3 was coming out. Somehow I'd managed to miss that it was even in production until about a month before it was released. Nevertheless, after starting to read about the game, I was a bit wary as some of the changes did not seem positive. However, being a fan of the series as a whole, I had to at least give it a try.So... is Age of Wonders 3 a good game? Well, your answer to that would no doubt be influenced by whether you have played any of the previous games in the series. Having played them, I would say, yes this is a good game but, relative to its time, the game is perhaps not as good as the previous titles in the series. For those of you who don't know, Age of Wonder is a fantasy turn-based strategy, with large amounts of magic, heroes and different races. In Age of Wonders, your leader was a hero and he or she travelled about with your army, gaining levels, exploring ancient ruins and so on. For Age of Wonders 2, your hero became a wizard who spent all his or her time sitting in their tower casting spells. With Age of Wonders 3, the system has gone back to that of the original Age of Wonders (i.e. your leader being an active participant in the world) so in this sense it has been an improvement from 2.Also the graphics are quite good and has a certain fantastical feel about it, I don't know if it's the shades and the hues, but it does feel quite vivid and rich. Also when you zoom out in the world screen, the view changes to a stylised map, as drawn on parchment, think the map of Middle-Earth, which I think looks really good.One of the biggest issues I had with the game prior to getting it was the massive cut the number of races, now there are only six: Goblins, Orcs, Dwarfs, Humans, Draconians and High Elves. This basicaly means many of the races from AoW2 are gone: Dark Elves/Wood Elves (although there is an in-game reason why they no longer exist, basically they kissed and made up and reformed as the High Elves), Frostlings, Halflings, etc. And yes, I would say the lack of races is quite noticable. I've played just 2 levels in one of the campaigns and during that time I've captured and held cities belonging to every single race in the game except for the dwarves. Considering I've only just started the third level, it seems odd that I've nearly played as every single race already. So, yes, I suppose there is certainly much less variation than there was.One of the ways that is suposed to reduce the imact of this lack of variation is by having small settlements belonging to 'minor races' which you can capture and then train units from other races. For example, I captured a fey settlement and was thus able to train various fey units, and construct buildings to improve them, as well as unlock different units that could be trained. I was actually quite surprised how much depth there was in this. You seem to be able to train 5-6 different units, and a fair number of buildings. I was expecting 2-3 different units at most. Nevertheless, they're still less in depth than a city from one of the main six races, and of course you can't build them.Combat is pretty much the same as the previous Age of Wonders games, and the additions with the new 3D engine are nice, for example having units consist of multiple men, the numbers of which go down as the unit gets injured. The system regarding magic spheres is a bit different to the previous titles in the series. Essentially, each hero has three different specialisations and if you're creating your own hero you can pick three from a list. These consist of 6 different areas of magic (water, fire, air, earth, creation and destruction), expander and explorer. Because of this, you can select a minimum of one area of magic and a maximum of three. This influences what you can research and what can subsequently use. When you do create a hero, you get quite a lot of customisation options in terms of apperance. You also have a range of different classes you can select for your hero: dreadnaught, druid, sorcerer, etc. Each of these gives you at least one unique building (which may be upgradable) and unique unit, however apart from that there seems to be little differences between the different classes. Being one class or the other doesn't influence the specialisations you can select for example, and these specialisations seem to have a much greater influence over your character than what class they are.The music in Age of Wonders 3 isn't anything special in my opinion. It's alright, but it's not amazingly noticable and there haven't been any songs I've particularly sat up and particularly enjoyed, compared to Age of Wonders 1 where there were a few songs I particularly liked, such as the March of the Halflings.People have reported having FPS issues, and I get them myself, but for me personally it's mostly fine, just a bit slow but certainly playable. The developers are aware of this and are currently working on fixing it.Also, I have to comend the voice acting in Age of Wonders 3. I've only played one campaign but the voice acting for the main character from whose point of view the stoy is told is actually very good. I admit this review hasn't been the most well structured, but to conclude, I think Age of Wonders 3 is a good game, perhaps a very good game but not an excellent game, and not as good as the previous games in the series and it does have some flaws. It is certainly is screaming out for some kind of expansion/DLC just to add a bit more variation and depth. Even with the minor races you can find and recruit, six major races does seem a bit few but I certainly don't regret buying it.			"

												This game is excellent. It has good graphics, good gameplay. It was the game I was looking for after being disappointed by Fallen Enchantress : Legendary Heroes.  The tactical combat in this game is much better with varying terrain and destroyable obstacles.  If you are a fan of Master of Magic, then you will probably like this.  I have just started the game so I have not seen all the features/limitations but overall it is a really good game and is actually worth full price, altho it is a bit expensive at 43$, but it is still worth it. The game is also integrated with Steam Workshop so user made maps are easily obtainable.edit: I also have come to find out that this game is gets regular updates that even bring in some new game mechanics and it also has to original expansion packs, not just dlc.  The same thing about updates and expansions can definatly not be said for Fallen Enchantress : Legendary Heroes.Edit: Despite looking much better than Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes, this game is better optimized and coded and doesn't suffer from any stuttering whatsoeverI can't stress how much better this game is over FE: LH.  These people did a much better job than those people.This game is always challenging and keeps getting better and more enjoyable for me as I become a better player.

The battles are quite a bit more in debth then Heros of Might and Magic and I consider it the best part of the game.You can build new cities and the world strategy feels a bit closer to Civilization but unfortunetly not nearly as polished and strategic as the turn based army battles.I lost intrest in the game whenever I became succesful at the game. The moment you start to achieve a lead on your oppents via having the better armies you no longer have challenging wars with other armies which is the most polished part of the game.

												As one that hasn't really been appealed by the turn-based strategy based games, but I really have to say that this was a very good game, and incredibly addictive. If you need some help with keeping you're armies alive, I'd suggest to use at least 1 hero per army, with human musketeers and engineers (this is as a Human Dreadnought). But this is defiantly worth the buy, although the multiplayer is a bit slow (since its a turn based game) it is still alot of fun. 9.5/10 worth it.			"

												Out of most of the 4x games I have tried recently, this one has managed to impress me with its richness of feature so far. Not into it too far yet, but it seems pretty solid and worth picking up. It's not overly difficult, and it has a bit of variety. It manages to blend a bit of roleplaying and strategy together well without making either of the parts seem watered down.			"

												This game is pretty fun, but it gets frustrating once you find all the little flaws. For example, you engage a stack of creatures listed as ""Very Likely Victory"", use the auto-combat to speed up the game. Bam, your entire army is dead an you didn't kill a single opponent. Either the probabiliy indicator is a piece of crap or the auto-combat is a piece of crap. Either way, longer games are horrible since you have to do every combat manually unless you want to risk losing your entire army, which essentially means you lose the game as well.			"

												Give this game a go. It may look like there's enough variation there but in fact there are hundreds of units with abilities and perks that matter.

												TLDR: 7.5/10It's very good but there are so many things that drive me mad that I can't honestly say it's a classicAge of Wonders is basically what Heroes of Might & Magic should have become after the countless crapfest sequels that didn't try anything new. The game has a wonderful tactical combat system that puts most regular tactical combat games to shame, it's really exciting and there are so many cool abilities and spells to use. Overall there's a lot of content (I'm just reviewing the vanilla game) and plenty of variety for a good 1-2 playthroughs of each Class.The downsides? Well like most 4X style games, it doesn't handle scale well. The economy is super simple and isn't the focus of the game (unlike Civ V for example), so it falls into the trap of ""I don't ♥♥♥♥ing care about these 6 cities I've built"". I know I should care, and I need to care in the late game... it's just too much tedious management with very little impact on your game as a whole, especially compared to the early game. Likewise for armies. You start with 1x 6-unit army, including your hero, and have nice little skirmishes. Then you get Hero after Hero with army after army and before you know it you've got 10 armies you have to manage and fight with. It's just too much and I find the turns take so long and the decisions become so diluted down that I quit most games once I've killed my main rival. It's a pain to finish an Age of Wonders game.Minor gripes;  Bone Dragon independent parties flying around from outside the fog of war and destroying your entire army isn't fun. It spams you with 'This hero wants to join' every ♥♥♥♥ing turn, which is soooo god damn time consuming over the course of a 100-200 turn game. Furthermore, the extra heroes you get are very sub-standard and some, like the Dreadnaught, are basically useless as you lack the Class buildings for your cities to get any of the units that Hero would need. Auto-Combat is sometimes a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, killing dudes that obviously wouldn't have died if you'd done manual combat... then again, the combat does take so long that you find yourself using Auto for most situations that aren't an 18vs18 city siege.Tiny gripes which might be my fault for sucking? I find the whole economy and tech side of the game a little shallow. It seems that for most classes it's all about just getting as many Shadow Stalkers or Eldrich Horrors as you possibly can, removing any unit diversity and relegating most units to the 'useless leagues'. The game does do a good job of keeping diversity high into the mid-game, but end-game it's just dull. Also that Call of the Wild spell that summons 3 beasts every ♥♥♥♥ing round is so stupidly good, ♥♥♥♥ dat ♥♥♥♥!			"

												So far a very good turn-based strategy game and easy for someone who's more than a bit rusty at the genre to get into without much frustration. Some pros and cons so far:Pros: Easy to learn, tutorial pages are fairly informative and not intrusive if you hate having to go through tutorials that either are too long or too detailed...or the reverse. Fantasy setting is fairly straight forward (elves vs. orcs in basic campaign with human scum everywhere) but engaging storytelling and voice acting works wellTurn-based design is very comfortable if you've played this type of game in the pastCons:More than possible to wall yourself in a corner by accident (sort of comes with the turf though)Autosave will occasionally save right before a move you really wish you hadn't taken (so save often)YMV on this but I have found on occasion that I think I'm clicking to attack one troop and get another by accident. Not sure its a game issue or operator error (probably the latter)Anyway so far a 9/10 for me would get 1 more point if the fantasy elements were more exotic and interesting but otherwise quite easy and enjoyable to get into while being challenging to overcome. Will update if further play changes any details in this review (I'm only about 6 hours in to the initial campaign).			"
