												It's very retro graphics, on par with say SNES, but the gameplay is exquisite.You cannot Level, but the girls you take with you can. You can still accrue EXP, though, and you can give it to your girls, or use it as currency elsewhere.You get beat down by a SLIME in the intro, and resurrected in a tavern by a man called the Haremancer, who summons two girls to help you.Each townsperson you talk to gives you ONE MAXHP bonus, permanent. Since you start with a MAXHP of only 100, that's quite a bit more generous than it sounds! (Hint: This is a game where at high Levels, you regularly give and take blows of OVER 9000!)Buying or selling in town gives the TOWN EXP!That's right, THE TOWN can Level, but not you! You can still gain stats, though, from various ""Stat Up"" hearts or veggies. Rare, and if you find a merchant who sells them, very expensive. It's all about grinding, but it's not tedious.Eat your veggies enough, and you can become King of Level 1! (As in, your Level 1 self can fight alongside your Level 250 girls, and actually make a difference, rather than have to be coddled and protected, as you'd expect.)You can capture SOME monsters (The ones that don't move, either to chase or avoid you), and use them to defend the Town, if the girls you left behind are too low-Level to do the job. The monsters movement gives an element of strategy, in that if you get behind them, you and your girls get first strike. If they get behind YOU, THEY get a free hit on YOU!There are also Bonus Bosses, who are WAY harder than any other monsters in a given dungeon--UNTIL you figure out their ""Gimmick"", at which point they become basically pushovers. In other words, Puzzle Bosses.(One of them, in an EXCEPTIONAL creative twist, asks you trivia questions about the game, and if you get it right, she damages herself to the tune of half her MAXHP!)However, even Puzzle Bosses can be ""solved"" by simply Leveling your girls up enough and then walking all over the enemy.If your whole party dies in normal play, you get teleported back to the Haremancer, to get back up and fight again.And there are Bonus Dungeons, from the Challenge Tower to the Other World. In the Challenge Tower, you get to see if you actually contribute to the group or not, because YOU can't join, only the girls can go into the Tower. Every 5 floors, either your main character gets a 5 point buff in each stat, OR the game shows you a cutscene. You cannot use Items in the Challenge Tower, only Skills and Spells.Cutscenes are hilarious, though still low-res.Think of Lufia II's ""Ancient Cave"", if you ever played that on the SNES.The Other World is where all the Bonus Bosses you've already killed go so you can beat them again and get ""Other World Points"", which can be traded for the best weapons in the game, and the all-important Stat Up Items. Be careful, though, in the Other World, DEATH IS PERMANENT!There's even a fortune-teller who allows you to make temporary changes to the NEXT DUNGEON RUN ONLY!· Fewer monsters· More monsters· Only Armor in chests· Only Weapons in chests· Only Items in chests (As in potions or Stat Up Items)· A specific seed value for the next dungeon (Useful if you are trying to capture a monster or find a particular Bonus Boss)You can order ONE change. It will take effect on your next dungeon run, then the dungeons return to ""normal"", whatever that might mean in the case of such a whimsical game.And the girls themselves not only Level, but have Affinity with you. You can gain Affinity just by fighting with them at your side, or if you have money to burn, you can buy baubles at the ring store (Or sometimes find/get them free from townsfolk) and give those to a girl to boost her Affinity. Boosted Affinity boosts stats, at least that's what it says. There's supposed to be an onsen cutscene when you get your Affinity high enough...And one of the girls IS your daughter. At first, I thought they had just mistranslated ""Musume"" from the game's original title, which can mean ""daughter"" or just ""girl"".﻿The girls are wonderfully varied and well-written, from the standard schoolgirl and healer type (The healer is depressed because she's ""average"" and there's even a running joke that if she's not in your party and you talk to her, her name shows up as ""Passer By"", until she corrects it!), to an assassin, a steroid freak, a ghost, a witch, a robot, a maid, a street-waif thief (Who is a LOT more damaging than you'd expect from that description)...and another overpowered character who is holding back because she WANTS to instead of FORCED to like your character!Plus the daughter of your own hero, who looks very much like your hero, and has junior versions of your Skills.You can talk to them and learn more about them as their Affinity rises.Each character has different Skills, some are specialized to heal, some do massive damage to one target, some damage a whole enemy party (And enemy ""parties"" can be up to 20 monsters, or at least that's the highest I've encountered so far), so you will need to customize your party to your NEEDS, as in whether you're grinding on normal monsters, or tryring to speedrun the Final Boss of a dungeon or maybe one of the Bonus Bosses.Arguably the most important loot you can find are Summon Stones. Bring them to the Haremancer, and he can summon you more girls, or if you have all the girls that are currently available to you, then you'll get ""Memories"" instead, which allow you to gain the girls' Skills on your own character!All-in-all, it's a wonderful game, if you don't mind SNES-Level graphics!﻿ Or perhaps if you PREFER retro graphics.

												Don't be daunted by the negative reviews. From what I've gathered, most of them was a result of the game crashing, which to be perfectly honest does happen. But lo and behold! Open the discussion forum for this game and you'll find an easy fix to the issue. The developer pinned the discussion thread in the hopes that it could help us unfortunate souls from lost progression torment.For those who have difficulty locating said solution need look no further. Just follow these simple easy instructions.- Close game- Open ""Run""- Type ""regedit""- In the menu bar at the top, go to ""Edit"" and then ""Find""- Type ""Enterbrain"" and press OK- Wait for search result to populate- Right-click on ""Enterbrain"" folder and deleteNow for the actual review. I gotta say, I enjoyed this game more than I thought I would. I found some of the conversations to be witty and charming, with a dash of humour all-around. Thyere's not much that hasn't been already said by others but a feature I found interesting is that if you take the time to read some of the item names and descriptions, you'll find that the humour is present there as well. An example would be the weapon Cross Sword.It's description is a 5 letter word that starts with S, the answer is Sorry. It took me a couple of moments to recognize the joke, but when it did, I actually laughed out loud (lame I know). Cross Sword = Crossword.But I do wonder how in the world did I have 2 save files with leveled up characters in the first 2 save slots, before even playing the game. I've heard of others whose save files have been overwritten. My condolensces, my advice is to save on the lower save files, or even better, have multiple save files so that the probability of your save files (and progress) disappearing would be lower.			"

												I would really like to recommend this fun game.  Unfortunately, later into the game some players are getting an ""RGSS3 has stopped working"" and it force quits the game usually in the middle of a dungeon losing all data since your last save (and you can not save in dungeons).  You can read more about this in the community discussions of this game.  If this is fixed, I will change this to a recommendation.			"

												I have a Dissertation projects, courseworks and Engagement party that need to be sorted out in less than 3 weeks.Spent 24 hours playing this game. Worth it. No regrets. My fiancee and my supervisors wont however. On a serious note. This game is fun. The comedy and even some plot twists on the story are excellent. Provides good laugh and pretty interesting dialogues and names in the terms of the summoned girls and the characters in general.You start as a pretty much useless character that cant level up. But depending on your dedication, Ralph, your character, have the potential to grow through non level related item boost. Dungeons are usually short. 5 levels each. With a boss in the end (well except 1 dungeon ) and a 9999 floor dungeon.There are more than 30 girls to summon and play with. Each with different personality and skills. They will be your main fighting force in the beginning through most part of the game, while Ralph would became the support member until he can hold on his own.Graphic is pretty decent for an RPG maker game. Same thing cannot be said for Sounds, as in they are TERRIFIC. The battle theme songs are catchy and are well made into the game.MINI SPOILERS (No worries you probably should read this)The tiny island with 3 dungeons are just part 1 of the game. Medium spoiler would reveal how many parts there are now. As the game keeps getting updatedMEDIUM SPOILERS (Answer to question on Mini Spoiler)There are 6 parts for now. Games would be updated as promised by the developers over time "

												This game was well done and did actually live up to its claim of being humourous. The writers did a good job of making dialogue that was interesting to read. The story, although slightly generic (you are sitll saving the world from a dark lord) takes some nice twist and turns, along side alot of content and fun companions. You can check out full review here on the game : http://www.thegamerholics.com/hero-and-daughter-review-rpg-comedy-at-its-finest/(I mainly dicuss the features of the game and what was well done in it.) Overview: As mentioned before, the game features some good and funny dialogoue between all characters (NPCs, Bosses, Summoned Girls, Creepy Guy who summons them). Of course some lines are cheesy, but the english translation of the game doesn't have any errors and is easy to read. The gameplay is the norm of RPG maker games, with magic, normal attacks, and special ""self skills"". These are special skills specific to each girl that preform a variety of abilities such as boosting thier crit chance, buffing everyone in the party at once, or like ""High Schooler Machinegun"" which puches each enemy 5 times, usually clearing the battle out in one turn. The game has a good amount of content, there are about 8 dungeons with 5 levels to fight through, with each level being full of chest and enemies mobs as well. I got as pre-release copy from the developers so I put in my twelve hours and still am maybe about 60% through the game? If you play and beat the first part of the game, you will understand more why this is a question rather than a statement. Pros: Humourus DialogueGood cutscenes between characters Companions are distinctive and really stand out with thier personalities when you talk to themFan service ? (Personally I don't enjoy it, but if you like it, it does add a thin lay of humor)Custom art and icons for each girlALOT of content (9999 levels of the challenge tower, over 40 dungeons, Otherwold where you fight bosses you previously killed)Decent soundtrack, sometimes a bit too loudWell done story Cons: Fan service? All on screen models of bosses are same. (Not a huge issue, since once you are in the battle scene, they are all distinct enemies with different abilities and a decent challenge usually)Balancing for AOE abilities for your female companions (a couple like the steal item abilitiy and Highschooler mahcinegun really do just clear mobs alone at later levels - bosses were still hard to fight though)Very nit picky, but a larger sound track would have been nice, as well as audio level adjustments for the battle sounds so they weren't so loud			"

												This is a perfect example of not judging a...well, a game by its cover.Hero and Daughter: not the best name. RPGMaker: a bad first impression. A bunch of pictures of...let's say fanservice-laden ladies as your cover picutres: not great.But don't write this off! Hero and Daughter is a roguelikelike JRPG. There's an almost limitless amount of content. You build a team of extradimensional summons--for instance, a cyclops, a high-school overachiever, and a wrestler--and go off into random dungeons, building them and your town up to dizzying heights.You don't level, but don't let that get you down. You eat a lot, and eventually grow into a functional level one here.I dunno. The systems click together well. If you enjoy building a team out of miscellaneous parts, and also somewhat strategic JRPG combat, this is possibly the game for you!			"

												Very good game. I put more hours into this than some AAA games. The story and dialogue were humorous which not only make the interactions between main characters but also enemies interesting. The only complaint I have is that the grind towards the town lv100 achievement is extremely tedious. Funny how the best character is Lara, the first girl you summon at the beginning; Ralph loses his levels only to get fair compensation.Ending team composition: Ralph, Akari, Lara, LiriaTower lv9999 team composition: Carrot, Spirit Queen, Red Witch, SutoregaOne thing to note is that buying a house does not contribute to village level. If only I knew this when I started out, before I bought the 1M house.			"

												I haven't beaten the game yet, but I am about halfwayish, and have all the girls, level 20 village, and each girl is like a whole new class, so many different skills. Each girl has self-skills that are unique to them, and they learn a decent amount of them, setting them apart from each other. The story is very good as well, and the girls personalities are as varied as their skills, and fit many different tropes. I love their interactions with the hero and the ""Haremancer"", and you can raise their affection by taking them to battle with you, or buying them gifts, and you can learn more about their backstories. There could be more challenge, but I think the reason the girls level so fast is because the creator wants the player to experience all the content at a decent pace, and there's still the Other World dungeon.

												This is a great game, and as someone who who works a lot with RPG Maker VX Ace, I'm amazed how good it is.The plot is cliche and won;t win awards, it's the bog standard RPG cliche of toppling some random dark lord, but that aside, this game is very aware of it's cliches and mocks the crap out of them.Of course, it's kinda meta, but even that isn't all. This game has the unique twist you are Level 1 and cannot gain levels at all, meaning you have to farm stat boosters and rely on allies (if you are into waifus, which all your allies are, you will have fun getting them all, like a non pornographic Pokemon meets harem anime, though it's a bit ecchi though, be warned if that turns you off)The gameplay is mix of Diablo style dungeon crawling (with maps that are semi-random like the bonus dungeons in Final Fantasy 1 & 2 Dawn of Souls and classic front view RPG turn based combat, though with the twist all you allies are very specialized and you must pick and choose wisely.However, you must try to keep all your summoned waifus leveled and well equipped, as the game includes a sim element where you ""level up"" a village, and as you do, the village get attacked from time to time, with the waifu force as the defenders, so can't just bench and ignore part of your harem force either.It's very forgiving for the most part, so a noob need not fear jumping in, it's pretty self explanatory on the game mechanics and while it's a pain to keep your main character from dying early on, the game includes tons of ways to make him not suck so much, not to mention is kinda encourages you to have the waifus do most of the work anyway.Overall, it won't win awards for originality, but it's VERY fun in a Diablo style way, and as a big Diablo II fan, this game is like that, just more colorful, slightly easier, and with a lot of waifus as support.

												This is one of the most clever games I've played. It simultaneously uses and lampoons or twists not just RPG tropes, but also anime girl stereotypes. Every time I think I've figured the game out, it throws some new surprise at me. All of the side stuff feels valuable in terms of either mechanics or story; I really can't think of another game that does that so well. And for a game which from the very start sets you up as needing to grind, the grinding is really quite pleasant.TL;DR: I can't recommend it highly enough. It never feels like this game is wasting your time and it is hilarious.

												Finally. A light-hearted RPG Maker game of some quality. The girls' character designs are all great, the dialogue is short and to the point, the story is goofy but not tedious. There are lots of unlockables and a constant flow of treasures and abilities to unlock from each of the girls who resemble a variety of typical classes like Fighter or Mage.It's the frivolous, high-paced Dragon Quest knockoff you've been waiting for. Recommended to fans of Half-Minute Hero or Azure Dreams.The only caveat: this game is anti-grind, like Half-Minute Hero. You do a lot of running at high speeds and slaughtering parties of enemies at high speeds. The game makes fairly thin pretense at gameplay. That's why the steady stream of party member discoveries and unlockables is good, for feeding the frenzy. You're basically bingeing on cute unlockables.			"

												So a cram school student, a cyclops, a robot, and a reaper walk into a bar...I tend to turn my nose up to most RPGmaker games that ask for money to cross the toll into the title screen, unless I see some significant work put into the game's assets by the developer - if you can't be bothered to put some time doing your own thing to make it look like it's higher quality than some of the best of the free games done in the RPGmaker program out there, then it's not worth my money.At first glance Hero and Daughter+ doesn't seem to do much, using basic art and sound assets, the only new assets I've noticed being the party member portraits.  Instead of focusing on making new graphics or sound, the devs have done significant work on mechanics and gameplay systems.The game goes through a pleasurable feedback loop of handling preparation of dungeon romps in town with facilities that level up as you spend money on their wares, increasing their inventory or effects, and interacting and leveling up your team of summoned party members before heading out.Dungeons themselves run off of a mild RNG permutation system, where the dungeons have at least 10 possible builds for each to go through, but the treasures/amount of monsters is diffrent upon each entry, certain dungeon builds will also have certain special bosses to fight, and you can adjust some of the variables of a dungeon before entry via a facility in town.  Monsters appear on the field, where running into them initiates a fight, and you have multiple enemy group types you can tell via their sprite, such as normal groups, mini-bosses, and special metal/gold slimes.  Special NPCs will also populate dungeons that add some variety in the form of mini-games or random chance events that can gamble with your stats/money in exchange for rare items.  Anytime you leave a dungeon, either via beating the dungeon's boss or being wiped out, you get to keep your experience and any items you've found.  There is also a chance of a random event playing out between characters when coming back from a dungeon.The game is very freewheeling with how it doles out improvements to your group, while your main character cannot level up, he can still accumulate experience which can be used as a special currency for certain facilities or as bonus experience for party members, and your party members already can level up incredibly fast. But most of all, your party members are powerful.  Any given character will feel like they would be completely overpowered in any other game given their special abilities.  Especially early on, unlocking a character's abilities is a treat in opening up new ways of completely stomping the opposition, and several characters can easily keep single enemies - bosses included - on lockdown.Do you need your party to have every stat buffed immediately with the possibility to constantly stack buffs?  There's a character for thatDo you need to do armor piercing multi hit combos to an entire enemy group? There's a character for thatDo you need to charm a boss?  There's a character for thatDon't take this as an endorsement of the game being easy, party synergy is a big part of this, but later game situations will take into account that you can do all of this.Getting said overpowered miracles of destruction requires summon stones, which you can get in chests, from bosses, or special challenges.   Any time a summoning stone is spent it gives you a random girl from the playable roster, and they take up place in the town's pub, where you can talk with them, give them gifts, or pour EXP from your personal stash into them.  It's ok to be greedy with snatching girls from various places across the multiverse, as any you leave in town while dungeon romping will help level the town up.The writing for all the game's characters is light hearted and goes for a rather teenage sensibility, there's not much in the way of long winded rants or incredibly serious and dire emotional scenes, everything is in service to the comedy and doing mild exploration of character personalities and backstories.While the game's content might seem sparse at the first glance of what you are dealing with, you can be assured it will offer up plenty of new features and optional challenges to do as you advance forward.   And if you should ever feel you might be getting a bit too overpowered, there are features down the line that allow you to adjust character stats as you see fit.I whole heartedly recommend this, it reminds me of the simple joy older console RPGs use to go for in the 90's, and if you recall the ""Ancient Cave"" from the lufia/estapolis series, then you have a similar idea at play here.

												Waifu collecting game that never ends anime/10-Serious Review-A nice traditional RPG with a pretty anime-esque plot.  It's already pulled the credits on me 3 times and there's still more to do, I just discovered an entirely new area.  The girls all got plenty of variations and if you get a lucky first few summons  you can  have  a solid party that you go with throughout much of the game.  The artwork  is a nice kinda simple style, some characters well  dressed and others.... hardly dressed.  There's also loads and loads of side stuff besides the main story to keep you busy.  Probably more busy than the main story.  Besides the girl's portraits and battle sprites, as far as I can tell a lot of pretty much everything else is straight from the RPG maker starting pack with some nice touch-ups and edits here and thereI guess something I would nitpick is that there was a fairly large level gap at one point that I hit because my party set-up was really good for bosses, and now dungeons are a big hassle.  That's just me not grinding  a bit, so if you're totes fine with grinding, good amount of hours to kill with this.9/10would be 10/10 if more custom-made sprites and portraits instead of default RPGmaker and 15 if steam didn't  want censoring			"

												This is a great example of what RPG maker can bring to the table. Not only is the story funny, its laid out very well and flows perfectly. Its almost surprising how well the game is made. While the story is a bit cliche, ( go out and defeat a dark lord and save the world ) It brings a new experiace to RPGs. It's halarious, fun, exciting, and at times a bit cring worthy, but its all put together so well that you cant seem to step away.I love how; while your entire party is made up of girls, its not over sexualized. Every new girl brings something new to your game, and while you'll end up favoring just a few, the combos of girls are unlimited. Angel, Red Witch, and Princess, are my personal favorite companions but I have not even begun to experiment with all the girls, let alone unlock them all.This game is worth playing if you are looking for a bit of light hearted comedy and adventure.

												I would recommend this game.  It's weird I hate games that base their entire system around grinding but this one is actually doesn't really feel like you are for a while. My one and biggest complaint is that there seems to be a scripting error that occurs when you get higher level in the game. It seriously pisses me off to be honest I can't go 1 hour without an SS3 error occuring and wiping my insane amounts of progress in challenge tower. But up until that its a good game to use as a cool down mindless game until you switch back to the hardcore like Dark souls 3 or Fallout 4 Survival mode.			"

												Fast-paced and addictive dungeon-diving fun, but grindy-in-a-good way -- lots of progression if you want to sink your time in it. The game is a typical JRPG, with a minor social/dating aspect talking to your party members. Its strengths are definitely in its variety (you can experiment with over 35 characters to take on several dungeons) and amount of content (as you progress further, more functions get unlocked).You can play this as complex or as a simply as you like -- either a strong main party that absolutely wrecks dungeons to speed through content, or a rotating party to eventually achieve 100% completion. I'm playing a mix of these styles, as I use a main party whenever I want more gold to skill up my other party members whenever I want to backtrack and hunt down more Bounty bosses. One nice function is that the main character, despite being locked at level one, still gets EXP which can be then given to other party members, allowing you to power level new characters. This, combined with the gift system letting you buy affection, means that it's completely possible to play with just a main party.One thing I hate about poorly-made RPGMaker games is that they take forever to progress through the text and combat. In Hero and Daughter, you can hold down the main action button to absolutely fly through combat. An auto combat button is also added, with the ability to modify your characters' AI to avoid wasting abilities when they don't need to, but so far it's faster just holding down action and spamming the default attack.The story itself is generic outside of the level one gimmick, and the characters know it -- it's just a silly, funny romp.Overall, this is one of the most user-friendly and plain fun games I've played. I found out about it from the DegiGames newsletter as an award-winning game, so I knew it would be good. I picked it up because the concept seemed interesting, but I've been continuing to play it because it's just that fun.Note that I too have experienced the RGSS3 crash error -- hopefully this is not a common bug, and I think that it was caused because I kept having this game open while doing other things.

												(Edited Review)I am updating my review due to the fix of the issue I had previously. Since the below issue has been resolved I will gladly re-recommend this game. I've been having a ton of fun playing this game so far. I had built 2 parties, a main and secondary, the former hitting about level 80 while mid dungeon. While the game is relatively simple in terms of play, the amount of content involved clearly took a lot of time to develop. There are plenty of small aspects that add up to make this a very worth-while play. I did, however, run into an issue: mid dungeon after my party had gained about 10 levels my party bugged after a battle and would only run straight down. Not just that, but in the menu and in combat the down key did not work at all. I tabbed out to see if my key had broken but it worked fine elsewhere, so it was an in-game issue. After trying to figure things out for about 10 minutes my game closed out (no chance to save as you have to move UP in order to get to the save point in the tavern). Upon restarting my game most of the characters I had acquired (and I had them all) were gone. It did not revert to a previous save as the first characters I had acquired were missing. The remaining characters were missing almost all of their levels, ranging from 5-12, only random characters were remaining and only a few of them. Another thing of note was that I somehow had 2 save files when I had only ever used one. I would have liked to send this message to the developer directly to try to provide anymore information as to help solve this issue but I'm not sure how to do that. Before this happened this was an amazing game, very well thought out and had great gameplay. As of right now this is kind of a big issue though... there isn't much of a point to building something up when you know somewhere down the road it will just be torn down. I will gladly update this review if they can get the problem solved.			"

												Okay, I'm going out on a limb a little bit here, and recommending this game.Its fun, grindy, and a serious call back to old school rpg's.HOWEVER.This game is a little...Glitchy.I've had a number of issues, where members of the summoned party members have rearranged themselves. The game has crashed, and completely erased summoned characters. Its even radically changed what level I was on, and opened tons of other areas I hadn't even been to yet.It has made playing a bit more random, and in a way, has kept it from getting boring...BUT, I like to know that spending 4 hours leveling a set of characters wasn't completely wasted when I log back in and suddenly find them all at level twenty when they were previously 100+That being said, I find the Level 1 hero to be an interesting and creative twist, if somewhat time consuming in terms of dungeon crawling and lady leveling.Other then the issues with in game glitching, I've actually really enjoyed the game.OF course, I'd enjoy it more if it didn't feel like a beta run, but that could just be me.

												I love this game to death, I do. Music's fantastic, characters are interesting, the art is good, and the gameplay is straightforward and simple yet still fun. But something is seriously screwy with it lately. All of a sudden one day I loaded it up to find two completely alien saves where mine should have been. Characters I hadn't unlocked, relationships and levels swapped around. Honestly, it sorta pisses me off.Again, I love this game to death, but I can only hope they get their stuff together. I don't think I'll be willing to play again until my saves and progress are safe. Regardless, I can confidentially say people should be interested in the game. With the amount of updates it gets, you'd figure it's only a matter of time until the fix whatever's wrong. Buy it now, or hold off until the air clears.			"

												Not a bad game at all.In fact I would consider this as one of the greatest RPG maker games I've ever played.Despite what steam is saying, I've still only played 72 hours on it, but it has been worth it, and its still fun. The best part is you get to choose your own party member,so you can pick a girl that gets your attention, or love a lot an fight with her.This might also tell others what kind of fetish you have....A sadistic AngelA no-memory curious Robot girlA yakuza girl. (Or a girl that just wants to pick fights)A high Schooler. Yeah, the usual.Cat girl.And a whole lot more!I would reccomend this game to any RPG lover!And stay alone while playing this game!			"

												Story:Minimal, but also lighthearted and made fun of various JRPG and anime tropes.Visual:Uses a lot of vanilla RPGMaker resources except the girls. Your mileage may vary on the girls' art and CG.Gameplay:Tons of grinding but battles are very quick and fun. The girls' skill list pretty much categorize the girls into three categories: melee attacker, magic attacker, and support. But you can make any of the characters learn all the magic available in the game. The main character cannot level up but there's various ways for him to raise his stats and learn skills, making him very powerful later in the game.There's also tons of other stuff to do in the game. There's village and town upgrading (via levels), arranging furniture, challenge tower for the girls, extra dialogues and hot spring events for the girls, and more unlocked the further you go into the game.Recommended for those who are looking for:- JRPG with tons of battles which are quick and fun- Parodies of various JRPG & anime tropes- An RPGMaker game with more stuff than a straight RPG- 2D girlsNot recommended for those who are looking for:- A deep story- An RPGMaker game without any of vanilla RPGMaker resources			"

												This is an highly amusing game. The hero starts starts at level 1,000,000... and everyone is afraid of him. that is untill he gets knocked down to level 1, and can't defeat even the weakest enemies. Now he has to recruit help to get his stats back up so he can defeat the Demon Lord. After which he can get his level back to where it was. The range of allies you can ""Summon"" is varied, and each girl has her own story. A MUST play.			"

												I wouldn't have believed that I'd ever call an RPGMaker game about anime girls as one of my all time favorite games, but here it is. I don’t normally even buy RPGMaker games, although after playing this for quite a while I’ve started paying more attention to them.Anyway, this is just an incredibly entertaining game. Your hero gets stuck at level 1, so he has to summon girls from other worlds to do the fighting for him. There are quite a lot of these girls and all of them have different skills. Apart from the first girl you can’t really know who you’ll get, since the summons are random, so you’ll have to come up with strategies which work with whoever you have.The story actually does eventually progress from there, but I don’t feel like spoiling it too much. I’ll just say that there is much more content in this game than it initially seems. I literally thought about 10 times I had finally beaten the game, and more content just kept appearing... The difficulty also builds up gradually. The game seems to be very easy at first, but it’s only because you aren’t as far into it as you think. There are also characters who seem to be quite crappy, but whose skills are actually good at some point later on.So yeah, the fighting is quick and entertaining, there is lots of things to do, the girls are cute, the music is great, the humor is funny, what can I say except highly recommend this game?

												'Hero and Daughter' is a silly game at its core, so don't expect a serious storyline. The interactions and cut scenes are fun though, and there's a ton of characters (girls) for you to choose from for you team.Once you unlock them by finding enough Summon Stone's that is.Beyond that, the game's a dungeon crawler that has you repeatedly delving into four different areas (based on your level), gathering treasure, fighting monsters, and moving toward the Dark Lord at the end of the fourth dungeon. Simple, but hard to put down. For the price, definitely recommend it.			"

												It's an RPGMaker Game...Your milage may vary depending on how you see things and I've seen some really good ones...and some really bad or wierd ones out there throughout the years.This one? This just makes fun of itself I believe. All you need to know is already on the tin so to speak. Your character, is stuck on being a level one weakling (although you can gain stats from a few sources) and you need to summon girls (who are at the beginning, stronger than you) to defeat the Dark Lord.By the way, take a very wild stab at why the title is what it is. You may get lucky very fast. It's either that or a mistranslation of what the word may be.The original artwork is...well while not horrible per say, seem off in certain (female) characters that make them look a bit...creepy at the most. Even though it's not on a 'professional' level, you have to give props for effort. Maybe the fellow's next game (if they decide to that is) could have better artwork if they tried.People would probably wait for...probably a half off sale, but it's nice for a laugh and you can't put a pricetag on laughter.

												If you'd like a ton of 2D waifus to fill that empty gap in your heart as well as a super simple yet fun rpg game to play mindlessly, you've found the game that provides all of these.Some things I especially appreciate include:The impressive variety of girls.Hording stat boosts can quickly turn Ralph from the weakest into the strongest character in the game imo.The humor. The soundtrack is pretty chill so it never really gets to be annoying.If I had to complain about something, it'd be the grinding. I despise grinding in games but with a buffed Ralph you can breeze through lower levels to get your girls caught up in no time, so it helps tremendously.It's worth $10 no doubt. I don't think I'm even halfway, been too busy getting it on with (almost) every girl I come across.			"

												*DISCLAIMER: I was provided with a preview copy of the game by the publisher.Hero & daughter+ is a fresh new approach to an already very saturated jrpg market what with the availability & ease of use of RPG Maker, almost anyone can make an rpg game these days. The only thing is that this one truly stands apary from the rest.Basically the story goes like this...Having been setup by his own kind, our cocky hero loses his hero level & is forced to fight the forces of evil by teaming up with a selection of over 30+ quirky & beautiful girls who can hold their own in any fight. These beauties are his only option and any experience he accumulates in dungeon battles, he has to pass over to them. Genius. Absolute genius. My only gripe is that it has very low resolution & full screen just makes everything look fat & wonky. Other than that, this game is my favorite rpg of 2016 so far. Gameplay video:

												Ok, this game feels, and Plays similar to games like ""AZURE DREAMS"", or more recent ""the Guided fate Paradox"". This game has you go into dungeons collecting loot and experiance over and over like a grind fest. ITs not bad especially if you enjoyed the previous two titles I mentioned. This game requires time and stat building. The characters are quirky. The developer put in alot of time and effort into the game. So far I have seen one grammar in the dialogue. yeah the INTRO is out there but I think its man hype is to get people to look so I think it works lol. you can even Level your town. Just not you. I think it's better since you can customize your hero anyway you like it. and not go down the typical warrior build that most heros start out with. stat build him as a magic caster and have him learn spells. I went down the Luck stat because lets face it. RNG is a pain, and the higher the luck stat the better.			"

												Great game for those who love the thrill of a good grind and the doozens of possibilities from creating your own unique party. With dozens of girls to choose from and tons of growth potential from each character it really can get crazy. My only complaint would hav to be the random crashes that occur from time to time. With that in mind still a great game to play.			"

												I got this game on one of the sales and was very pleasantly surprised. There's quite a bit of length to the game and a huge amount of party variations since there are so many heroines. I really enjoyed playing it and plan to come back and finish all the trophies!			"

												Nice little game to while away time with.  Only play if you won't take it too seriously.  A lot of references to other small games and stereotypes.			"

												I had played this game quite a bit. Somewhat grindy, but I still loved it.A pretty novel (to me, anyway) concept of a level 1 hero and relationships and such, along with all the battles and home building from rpgmaker.Though now it seems that my save file were replaced with two I never seen before, rendering all my progress for naught.Due to that, I can't really recommend this game until it's resolved as I'm sure that losing all your progress is something nobody likes.Edit: It turns out the problem was addressed, though my own response to this is very late, will try out the game again!
