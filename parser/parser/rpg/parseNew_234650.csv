												Now I've never played a Shadowrun game before, however I'm not exactly new to  turn based/strategy RPG games, having played games in a similar vein like the Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor series and Fire Emblem. However, I'll be the first to admit I'm far from a veteran in the genre.One of the key things I think Returns did right, is the tricky task of drawing me into the story immediately. It's pretty simple: your friend is dead, he's left you a ""dead man's switch"" - a recorded message promising a hefty reward if you can find the killer. OK. I'm in.As for the ease of playing the game... as someone who's often daunted by complex RPG interfaces with endless choices, decisions, and items to equip, I thought Shadowrun's interface is a breeze. It clearly shows you your weapon slots, inventory slots, and which body parts you can equip on armor or modifications. As for playing the game itself, you can simply click on your HUD to switch between weapons or end turns, but there are hotkeys for the more practiced player, too.You encounter many characters on your way to solve your friend's murder, and you get to pick and choose your own team of Shadowrunners to go on every mission with you. Each has their own specialty - summoning mechs, specializing in ""decking"" (hacking), melee combat, guns, magic, and so on, and I had a great time testing out all the different classes.All of the characters have their own specialties, but the game is forgiving, and you could probably get by just using guns on everyone. I realized one of my runners had a healing ability 3/4 of the way through the game, and had been getting by just fine without knowing that. So if you're worried about difficulty or complexity, don't be.Another positive for me is the game is heavily text based. There is a lot more discovery and reading than combat. You can also save anywhere except an NPC turn in combat, or in conversation. So I could get up to answer the door or grab some food without bothering to pause, or quit at a moment's notice if my friends asked me to play a multiplayer game.I know I'm writing a review no one will ever read, for a two year old game, but it gets an easy recommendation from me, especially if you're a busy person who can only enjoy games in bits and pieces before you're on the go again.

												Strongest point of Shadowrun Returns is its writing. In best tradition of older RPGs, game describes what you character sees in flowery language. Character introductions, location descriptions and dialogues are smart and charming. The setting of Shadowrun is a blend of cyberpunk and urban fantasy - don't think I knew something like this exists before. I wouldn't mind experiencing Shadowrun Returns in book or graphical novel form.As a game, however, it is not so magnificent. SR was made by relatively inexperienced developers on tight budget using Unity and it shows. Graphics are mixed bag - wonderful character portraits, bright and detailed, if somewhat cartoony 2D backgrounds, but awful character models and awkward animations. Sound direction feels cheap overall - music are fine, but forgettable and there is absolutely no voice acting. Combat mechanics ripped straight off X-COM: Enemy Unknown.The biggest flaw of SR is its linearity. I just didn't have the opportunity to explore the world of Shadowrun - game kept railroading me on one story after another, with brief breaks in same   small hub. All two side missions are one chance affairs - go on them right now or miss it forever. While writing itself is great, spending points to improve charisma and get new dialogue options felt like total waste - game is too short and there is almost no opportunity to use your mad speech skills - I think I used each etiquette only once or twice in whole game. Story starts as a noir-like murder mystery, but after halfway point abruptly turns into ""save the world"" scenario and ends with series of boring battles against bugs. Absolutely unnecessary twist, in my opinion.My final impression: SR is an enjoyable short RPG; not without flaws but if you are able to overlook them, you will have a great time playing it.			"

												First all, let me tell you about my background - 39, working professional, married with kids. Was looking for an RPG game that I can really sink my teeth into without getting bored, and coming from a gamer background myself, not many games can catch my attention.Then saw a recommended game review somewhere about this Shadowrun, so being the typical gamer that I am since I dont like to pay for something I haven't tried yet....so I *cough*cough* got  a copy of the game to try........and then I closed the game, went to the Steam website, and purchased a legitimate copy. Let me tell you why :-a) this is an RPG - story, story, story - this is what's it all aboutb) the interface and game - slick, modern XCOM style combat, with that turn based system thats good for my pace and strategy.c) the real world/cyber world - the transitions are nice, a good break from the routine.d) Story - did I mention story? I like how I have to slow down to read, even the freaking Splash screens got something to really readSo I parted with my cash to show support to this developer. Keep up the good work and I look forward to purchase Dragonfall and any more of DLC of this kind :)			"

												Review for DMS (Dead Man´s Switch) & DF (DragonFall) CampaignsWhen Shadowrun Returns DMS came out, i liked it, but wasn´t really happy.The writing, atmosphere and graphics were nice and fitting, you really could delve into the Shadowrun universe and have fun.What was not so nice, were the lack of good/real party members and the unability to customize them. Also the story itself was pretty straightforward, with few optional decisions possible.What was horrible was the lack of a proper saving system.With DF Harebrained Schemes finally delivered the save system. So the horrible part is gone. They also tried to deliver some optional questing and a bit more interesting&permanent team members. B for effort, but for a truly good rpg the customization/inventory management of your party is still lacking, also the characters of the fix team members could still use some makeover, at least personal quests.The story once again is fitting, and the whole game has a bit more variety, without changing much of the base gameplay.So, to make this short, if you like Shadowrun and haven´t bought this game yet - do it! ;)If you like rpgs/cyberpunk, you now can give it at least a try.

SHADOWRUN RETURNS - Cyberpunk adventure/rpg with a compelling story   || 8 || Score Comment   Graphics 7 The game has top down isometric type view, graphics are very well done: the lighting, effects and areas feel very fitting and atmospheric.  At points, however, it feels like it would be nice to have a little bit more variety to the areas, some of them feel quite samey. Character creation and portraits are ok but you can't go into the level of detail of some other RGPs.  Audio 7 Music and sound effects are good, there is however quite a bit of reading to do in this game, do not expect voice acting for all of the story / dialogue.  Gameplay 8 I really enjoyed playing this game, its a nice mixture of adventure / mystery and rpg with turn based strategic combat (think xcom). You control a small team of characters (you collect them as the story progresses) who follow you as you play through the story completing various missions and solving mysteries. There are some good puzzles to solve as the story develops and you can choose to upgrade various skills as your character advances in levels. A really nice feature is the ""hacking"" that the decker class can perform, this takes a form similar to combat in the game but its you and your constructs against the computer systems defences.    Story 8 Shadowrun Returns is set in cyberpunk-esque world where magic meets machine. You can play different stories in the form of campaigns, the official ones are complemented by community created ones via the steam workshop. The campaigns are extremely well done and have a very noir feel to them. There's a lot of background and detail to the world (and a lot of reading to be done) and the story had enough intrigue and action to keep me interested right to the end. The nature of the game (your characters acting out the story) basically means that play feels quite linear and that sometimes the decisions you make don't really have lasting effects but this didn't effect my enjoyment too much.    Replayability 5 As much of the main campaign is story based, once you have completed the game there isn't that much to draw you back in. Having said that there is an excellent DLC (dragonfall) and there are community created campaigns and an editor which should add quite a few hours of playability   Overall 8 Excellent game for anyone who loves this style of gameplay or the setting. The community content really adds a whole new aspect and lease of life to the game, just be prepared to do a lots of reading.  More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree? Please leave me a comment "

												As an avid Shadowrun fan, I was psyched when I heard about the kickstarter for Shadowrun Returns. I immediately backed it and kept careful track of the progress. Based on some of the design decisions and the concept art, I was initially concerned. My worry proved to be unfounded though. When I first opened Dead Man's Switch I was immediately pleased with the depth of detail in story and graphics.It does a respectable job of emulating the pen and paper game feeling. There is room for improvement, and I certainly hope some of the issues are addressed in the future, but there is enough variety for you to at least customize a character to reflect you (combat) style. Lacking stealth is a particularly strong drawback. So is the way social skills like negotiation and con are replaced with etiquette, but a smart modder can work around that and present an experience which will tailor to your needs.Which brings me to my next point, the editor. Say what you will about the main story, give it a couple months and it won't matter. The game comes with the same editor the developers used to make the game. Based on the community, you can expect some amazing modules to come and I look forward to them in the future! As for the main game, I enjoyed it even though it was fairly linear. It had the feeling of playing shadowrun at a gaming convention, you needed to follow a set script, but there was a decent story to back it up.One of the biggest concerns myself, and the community had was the lack of a save anywhere feature. Fortunately HBS was quick to implement this after release. They are very attentive to their fans needs. Now if only they could do something to limit ammo!Overall though, I am happy with Shadowrun Returns. If you are an avid fan, get it. If you are a casual gamer, do your research first. This game is not made by a major studio, you cannot hold it to the same standards as you would something from EA Games. If you want voice acting, amazing graphics, and more options than you can imagine, this is not for you. If you are willing to give the little guy a chance, and want the feeling of playing Shadowrun with your friends, then you will probably be pleased with what you get. At the very least its the best Shadowrun game out there currently.UPDATE 6/29/14I was asked about the game's replayability, so here is an update to address that. I will (most likely) better update the review later, but for now here it is.Most of my hours were spent inside the editor, you can easily spend hundreds of hours making your own mods. If you want to tell your own stories, and share them with the community, this is the game for you. The editor is the same tool used by the devs to make the official modules. A regular player will get less mileage out of the official campaign. The base campaign, Dead Man's Switch is under 20 hours for a playthrough. I played through it 3 times with different style of characters, but the experience is more or less the same regardless of character type. The expansion, Dragonfall, was also under 20 hours of playtime. I have only played that campaign once. Its a much more satisfying experience than the base campaign, but still, limited replay-ability. There are a couple optional missions you can play, but they both are fairly linear overall.The place where you can get strong replay-ability is the fan made modules. Some of them are really incredible. The downside is that being fan made you need to be patient for them to finish. It is entirely likely that you will start one and then finish everything that is there and be stuck waiting for the next installment.			"

												Hype and expectation are funny things. They can invite even the most rational and level-headed into wish fulfulment FAR beyond the truth, and we all know how prevalent that is in video gaming. I honestly believe that this game's reputation absolutely suffers from precisely this, especially from the view of some players. So, Shadowrun Returns - the question is ""does it"", or rather ""does it REALLY warrant the return?"" Let's start with the expectation part I mentioned. When this game was proposed, those that were fans of the old tabletop RPG and the old SNES classic sat up and took notice, and for good reason. Nostalgia aside, both are truly excellent games in their own rights. The downside to this is that it tends to set the bar VERY high, expectation-wise.Fast forward to the game's release, and there were certainly mixed views; much of the criticism dealt with there being less on the action and more on the text and story. Also, length was cited too, or rather, lack of it. On the face of it, very valid criticisms, except that many of these either forgot or didn't understand WHAT the game was achieving - a new version of the classic games, adhering closely to the rules - in short, Shadowrun RETURNS. The clue's in the name. It does what it says on the tin.So, there's an abundance of text and story, and less of the action itself, and yes, it is a bit short. While they are valid concerns EVERY game buyer should consider before dropping their cash, context is also equally important. Apologies for this slightly overblown introduction, but I felt it valid to lay this down at the outset. Let's get on with the review.If you know what Shadowrun is (or was), then there's little point in going over this and you can skim to the last paragraph. If you don't, then as I've already said, there's the classic tabletop ""D&D style"" game - a pure, unadulterated old-school pencil and paper RPG. The hook here is that elves, orcs, goblins and all the staples of fantasy exist, but the one major difference is everything is a futuristic sci-fi bent. It probably sounds completely at odds with one another, but it works so very, very well, both in lore and in combat ... ESPECIALLY in combat. You can still hack 'n' slash if you want to, you can still use magic if you want to, but add to the mix firearms and a complete veneer of futuristic and modern tech, and you have Shadowrun.It rather goes without saying that anyone who has spent any time playing old-school tabletop RPG knows that story and text are perhaps the premier parts, and that is the case here, naturally. But the question to the critics remains ""ah, but it is any good?"" Thankfully, the answer is ""yes, it is"".I confess I'm a little jaded. I've been around gaming since the very start, and have never had a period when I've not been involved. I've seen a lot, played a lot, own a lot, and have even worked in the industry (albeit relatively briefly). For the most part, I care little for story in games - most times I'm merely concerned with the mechanics over everything else. I couldn't tell you the story of Halo, for example, as it never gripped me in any way. So, why on earth am I saying this game's story is good? Because it DID grip me right from the off. It works. You know the story's working on you when you can start to identify and remember the characters. So, being heavy on the story is an ASSET to this game, and in no way a hindrance. I shan't spoil it in any way, but it's a fairly standard story, but it does it pretty well, so in summary I don't see the critique of ""too much story, too little action"" in any way a bad thing unless it's REALLY not your thing.Now, onto length. Yes, it IS relatively short. However, you should at least consider the reasoning behind the game's existence - it would never have seen the light of day AT ALL were it not for crowd-funding. Sure, you can claim they made big promises and ran out of resources and/or time, but the conclusion here is that putting all those aside the end product is pretty damned good. As stated before, it very much does what it says on the tin. So, if you don't mind quantity being less if the quality's good or reasonable, then there is no issue here. What does render the length argument completely invalid is one thing - WORKSHOP support. There's TONS of user-generated content out there which not only mimics what tabletop RPGs are all about, but the inclusion of mod tools (which I haven't tried) ensure that it's pretty easy to dole out a good scenario, and it certainly shows. So, if you finish the game and want more, you won't be disappointed at all.The combat is best described as being very similar to XCOM. It's turn-based with the dual-turn set of movement/action phases per character, or a mixture of those: you move, you shoot/swing/etc, and your turn's over. Your playfield is peppered with objects that you can utilize as cover, with the shield icon offering how good that cover is. This all offers a lovely tactical play where you don't just consider dumping your character up against the enemy and swing away at them, but you have to consider balancing cover with line of sight, flanking, and a number of other little tricks to make the best use of the battle.Character skills are great. As you'd rightly expect from a combination fantasy/sci-fi, it lends you a VERY wide palette of things to mess around with. Fire-based magic attacks? Sure. Rifles, pistols, or SMGs? Yup, have at them. Fire-based attacks WITH your pistol? Yup, that too. It does the Shadowrun rules well, and the interface is clear and intuitive and you'll have no issues picking it up quickly.Visually, the game offers a very nice art-style that does the medium justice. Backgrounds are all pre-rendered and hand-drawn (or at least they LOOK hand-drawn) in a graphic novel style which suits perfectly. Nothing I can fault here at all. Musically, the soundstrack is really good. I'm not a big fan of music soundtracks - I'm not one who will listen to them outside of the game. To me, they're a background that serves to provide ingredient to the recipe. They should illustrate without hindering the game in any way. Not only does the style and mood of the music suit perfectly, but it's not repetitive, and remains interesting without hindering in ANY way. If you're someone who does listen to game music absent of the game, you might well find this one very appealing.So, final summary time. Is it worth purchasing? Yes. If you are expecting a good turn-based old-shool RPG, it's worth it. Steam Workshop really underlines this, value-wise. The only caveat I would make is that if you're either not sure whether this sort of game's for you, or the length of the official game really is an issue for you, I'd thoroughly recommend waiting for a sale - it's still worth picking up.Final note I'm doing with all my reviews now: I'm giving a ""what do I think the game's worth?"" instead of any score or other metric, as I think that's the most valuable metric anyone could have. I'd say this deserves a £9 (or your regional equivalent).			"

												Pros:-Some good writing-Turn based combat is great, slightly better than Fallout with cover system.-Beautiful hand drawn world-Game editor and User Generated Content. (from what I read, the editor is quite restricted.)Cons:-Clunky user interface, clearly meant for touchscreens-No voiceover.-Non interactive world. Everything that you can interact with is highlighted with the hand icon. Anything not highlighted is just a background. Makes the world feel empty. -Non practical inventory system: cannot trade items between party members. You can only manage your inventory during start of a mission and at the safehouse.-Too little choice of weapon and armor.-No lootable corpse. Perished enemy will simply disappear into the thin air.-Moving and clicking is a bit off, particularly because it's a tablet game in the first place.-Extremely linear campaign and no sidequests.On tablet this game easily score an 8 out of 10. The game was designed for tablets in mind, making the developers overlooked some of its flaws and ignored many of the aspect of a good RPG other than writing. In fact, Harebrained Schemes (HBS) is a tablet game developer, has only released mobile games.Bear in mind that Shadowrun Returns comes with an editor and a default campaign made by HBS. The campaign is restricting and painfully linear. You cannot go back to previously visited place and there's only a few sidequest that you can do for extra cash. Right now there is some user made campaign available on the workshop which was designed better than the campaign made by the devs.Shadowrun Returns is a disappointing RPG lacking of real depth with so many unfullfilled potentials. If you're really looking up for this title and has already run out of RPGs to play, just wait for a sale.Score: 6/10Edit: You can now save anywhere in this game. And they lower the price too.			"

												** My full reaction is here on my blog should you want it http://riksreaction.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/riks-reaction-to-shadowrun-returns-pc.html **I thought this was great, from start to finish. Excellent. It is difficult to know what else to say... I just thought this was great. I'll just ramble as follows.As an RPG it was the perfect amount of complexity, deep but easy to understand.The artwork is lovely, everything is well animated and it is just generally a really attractive game.It is VERY well written IMHO, the characters come to life through the text and written dialogue, it's great! I honestly felt like I was enjoying an interactive book, which is a feeling I tend to get when I am fully engaged. The locations, the people, the story.. all of it is vivid and believable, not so much due to the on screen action, but more through the filter of my imagination which the writing nutures throughout, things playing out in my mind's eye as I read the next interchange between characters, or digested the description of the place I'd just arrived at.The narrative is solid, and makes sense (within the world it is told) and pans out well, I thought the pacing was excellent.Some might dislike the linear nature of the game, I personally love it. Side missions are available, but they are in direct relevance to the main storyline at all times which keeps things moving, and therefore aren't always available for you to come back to tidy up and complete later, so bear that in mind. I am a fan of a well told story, and ""sandbox"" games are never as good as experience for me as being told a well crafted story. Shadowrun Returns nails this.I really enjoyed this game, took me 17.2 hours to complete but it felt like a lot less purely because I was enjoying every minute of it and was just waiting to turn the next page in this electronic short story and learn what was going to happen next. Like a good book, it was tough to put down.It has it's flaws here and there, like checkpoint saves (due to be changed in a patch or via the next DLC I understand), some sections keeping you in turn based combat mode when there aren't any enemies about and on some of the longer battles the combat music can get a little tiring, but those are small complaints. Excellent and I'm looking forward to see what they do next! Recommended.			"

												The SNES Shadowrun was the jewel of my cartridge collection. I've honestly lost count of how many times I've played through it. With that in mind I started up my journey into Shadowrun Returns with a healthy dose of nostalgia and optimism, and at the end of the journey I came away happy, if not entirely satisfied.Unlike the Shadowrun of yore, Returns plays like an odd crossing of point & click adventure and turn-based strategy. Your runner is investigating the death of an old friend, and in each scene spends most of their time navigating dense dialogues with the many NPCs on hand. You might also be tasked to click on an object or a door, but the vast majority of the non-combat gameplay is talking. It's good talking, though, with some very colorful characters and attentive writing. The parentheticals get a little too heady and poetic for my tastes, but they set the scenes well enough. Overall the game nails the Shadowrun setting, which goes a long way towards keeping me interested.Combat is the other side of the coin, and while it works better than the ancient art of ""stand in place and shoot forever"", it's not without its flaws. Your crew and the enemy forces each take turns expending the action points of their members on a grid map with cover objects, much like in the recent XCOM. AP is spent a little oddly, however. Each move within a certain range costs one AP, whether it be a single step or a dash to the edge of their range. With melee weapons this is fine because the melee attack is included with the move, but ranged weapons cost at least one AP just to fire, so getting into an ideal position and firing can be a costly proposition. Doubly so when the sight lines around the environments are not terribly consistent, and it costs a full AP just to reload. It's an imperfect system that works well enough, but could definitely use more polish.There are plenty of ways to kill people though, and enough skill points to earn through the game to make the most of them. You have melee, five different firearm types, drones, and two kinds of magic, and that's not even getting into the support skills. Unfortunately, there's not much reason to diversify, and the game even tells you as much. High ranks in skills are very powerful, and spreading your points around won't give you the ranks you need to pass skill checks or hit later enemies. Plus, you hire party members from a large roster of shadowrunners who can easily fill in the gaps for you.These gripes are really part of a larger trend with Returns. You can buy weapons, armor, and other upgrades, but they are unevenly spaced throughout the game. There's not much to interact with in the many levels, and no real branching paths to explore. You can be a decker and get into the Matrix side battles, but they are few and far between. Your hired runners have no personality and can't be interacted with other than ordered around in battle. Even the story, built on some genuinely good writing, is small in scope and lacks any sort of proper build-up. It all points to a game not fully realized, a lot of potential without a lot of substance. The whole time I was playing, Returns felt more like a demo for the game engine than a full product.That's not to say it wasn't fun. I thoroughly enjoyed the 8-10 hours it took to complete, and aside from a particularly annoying final mission, had no major complaints about it. The issue is more a lot of little shortcomings mounting to give Returns a very half-baked feel. It's definitely worth playing, and I'm very interested to follow it with Dragonfall, but I wouldn't fault anyone who checked out after a few hours. Shadowrun Returns is a good enough Shadowrun game, and now I want a better one.			"

												I love Shadowrun as an IP.  It was one of the first pen and paper games I ever played 20 years ago, and my friends and I still plat it regularly (though now we're on the 5th Edition). But this is a hard game to recommend.  The mechanics are fine, but it's very easy to run into unsolvable problems - if you roll a hacker, you're going to have very little to do in the main campaign and are going to rely on NPCs and hirelings.  And if you're not a hacker, every time you NEED a hacker you'll be provided one free of charge.There's more too it than that, of course, but that's pretty illustrative.  The game feels extremely limited in a lot of places, from missing mentor spirits to customization through what's available from the NPC stores.   Honestly you'd probably be better trcking down an old copy of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magicka Obscura.			"

												I think I had never heard of Shadowrun before a friend of mine gifted this game to me. When I started playing it, I discovered a great world, filled with an unique style and characters.The setting is fantastic. A futuristic world where people can replace their limbs with mechanical implants a la Deus Ex, mixed with magic and fantastic creatures. The gameplay is quite fun, it reminds me of the turn based RPGs I used to play when I was younger, although in this game the combat is more tactical, with things like cover and area effects.The character customization is great; you can select your character's gender, its race (Human, Elf, Orc, Troll and Dwarf), and its abilities, some of them being street samurai, shaman, and decker. Even then, you can further customize your character by spending ""Karma points"" to unlock new abilities.The story is quite good, and there's plenty of dialogue options during the conversations, even more if you have the proper abilities. Another great point is the soundtrack, which really set the mood.So, to conclude, I highly recommend this game.			"

												I hesitated in picking up this game after reading a lot about how terrible the original campaign was and how the game was dull and boring. It also didn't help that I didn't really know anything about the Shadowrun universe. During the Summer Sale though, I was in the mood for something new, and picked it up. I just finished playing through the original campaign (Dead Man's Switch - DMS) and have to say, I'm glad I bought the game.Getting the basics out of the way, I admit that DMS is very linear. There is a lot of reading involved. And besides combat, there's not a lot of interaction with the world. Still, as someone who knew next to nothing about Shadowrun before I started, I think DMS does a very good job of introducing the player to the world and the mythos surrounding it. The reading will probably be boring to someone who is deeply familiar with the setting, but I found it very useful. Gameplay is likewise straightforward which allows a new player to dive in without fear of messing up. I played a Street Samurai / Decker and had no trouble. I did find myself wishing I could build a party and level them up, outfitting them and whatnot ala Baldur's Gate, but perhaps that will happen in an expansion.All in all, this game was well worth the $4 I paid. I also picked up the DLC, which I read is much better - I look forward to trying that next. "

												There are curently 3 Shadowrun games from Harebrained Schemes. Shadowrun Returns is the first one they have released and clearly the weakest of the three. That does not mean that Shadowrun Returns is a bad game, far from it. The following titles are simply much better and deeper experiences, making Shadowrun Returns kind of no longer relevant. For people with limited free time, if you want to play a Shadowrun Game, go for Dragonfall first, Hong Kong second and, if you still crave more, give Shadowrun Returns a shot. The Good:+ Great, immersive atmosphere+ Well designed visual styleThe Mediocre:~ Combat needs polish, some character builds are overpowered, other almost useless~ Relatively short~ The plot is not very interestingThe Bad:- Extremely linear, the player does not have much say in how the plot unfolds			"

												If you're expecting an RPG with open world and long hours of playing, this is not for you.This is a short (I finished it in about 12 hours of gameplay, not rushing or anything) and linear (at no point there is even an option of doing something different, picking different ways, or other stuff you would expect from an RPG) game.That being said, during those 12 hours I had a nice time. The story is interesting, the gameplay & interface is enjoyable, and for a simple game with no voice acting, the atmosphere is amazing.I would definitely recommend if you find this at a discount. Well worth if a few bucks for the 12 hour fun - just don't expect it to be a super production. "

												Tactical RPG putting you in the role of shadowrunner - a freelancer merk with private motivation to do some investigation properly. World of Shadowrun is rich, full of postmodern and fantasy, yet it is a very pragmatical and cynical one. Lovely thing, just like the big world behind the window, only with magic. Sadly, unlike D&D universe, it was poorely pictured in the videogames (there was 2 good games, but only on 16bit consoles - Genesis and SNES).Aside from my previous experience with the Shadowrun universe, game's a good one. Solid cyberpunk story (and fitted to Shadowrun agenda, as well). Fascinating music. Good battle system (if only too easy for my tastes, even on the hardest). Decent rpg skills system, not without a flaws, but - fair enough.So, generally - it's good. Not excellent, but good. Like 7/10 in my book.Although. I love Shadowrun, and I would give the game more - just for good revival - if only they would made Matrix better. That's a major disengage for me in the whole game. They just did another field for shootouts in the Matrix, not anything near hacking. I've played many interpretations of Shadowrun, and that game made almost everything fine - but ruined cyberspace. It's like making a remake of ""Singin' in the Rain"" movie without actually singing in the process.Think I'll go and play some blues now.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a decently capable game and most of all is a good start. It will be interesting to see where the game ends up, as the game comes bundled with an editor allowing for a lot of potential from the community making Shadowrun Returns a game that is likely going to grow a lot over time. The current module, The Dead Man’s Switch, is an okay experience which is sadly awfully limited in story decisions and suffers from many little oversights and rough flaws such as underwhelming AI and a lack of simple quality of life systems such as manual saving, but does contain excellent writing that incorporates much of the interesting universe without overwhelming newcomers.As such, the potential is definitly there and what it currently contains will be entertaining and fun to go through for the RPG fan, but it isn’t anything that will happily surprise you or amaze you in any way. If you are looking for a decent RPG with good writing and a solid amount of abilities and skills to choose from, Shadowrun Returns is an easy recommendation. Full review:

												Hoi chummers! Welcome to Shadowrun Returns. This game has a wealth of content to explore, including full campaigns in Seattle (Dead Man's Switch) and Berlin (Dragonfall). After you finish the professionally made campaigns, try out more free content on Steam Workshop. You can also write your own stories in the Editor, kind of like using Legos. There is a large and welcoming community of fellow players and content creators and we hope you enjoy the game!			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a turn-based cyberpunk themed strategy R.P.G. developed by Harebrained Schemes and published by Harebrained Holdings. Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation nearly 25 years ago. Now, creator Jordan Weisman returns to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical roleplaying game. The year is 2054 and magic has returned to the world awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend as technology merges with flesh and consciousness. As a shadowrunner, you're a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. Shadowrun Returns harkens back to the classic old school roleplaying games from back in the day. The top-down isometic view, intense turn-based combat and non-voiced dialogue of a traditional R.P.G. are expertly blended in this fantastic indie title from Harebrained Holdings. The story is divided into campaigns which can range from solving murders to battling corporate espionage and a number of other different situations and once you've finished the games main storyline you can download new user created campaigns from the Steam Workshop or the Nexus which further extends the replayability of this great title.Besides the excellent story, the turn-based combat of course is one of the best features of this game. Progressing through the narrative will reward you with experience points and allow you to grow your character in any direction that you choose. Want to summon spirits as an elven shaman, be an expert hacker or go guns and blade ablazing as a Street Samurai? The choice is up to you. As the leader of the group, it's also up to you to choose the right balance of combat, tech and magical abilities in order to have a successful run. The gripping tactical combat system is quick and responsive and just a fun alternative to the combat of today's more popular roleplaying games.Graphically the game looks terrific in full high definition with its futuristic cyberpunk setting. The environments are also quite varied as you will travel from the slums of the Redmond Barrens to the extravagant offices of powerful corporations and beyond. The character portraits presented during conversations have a unique style that lends itself well to this title and I find the isometric backgrounds and set pieces delightful to view. One of my favorite things about these types of games are the small details in the world around you and this title is chock full of them and add to that some excellent sound effects and a terrific musical score and Shadowrun Returns delivers big time. If you're a R.P.G. fan looking for something a little different to add to your library or just enjoy old-school or retro games then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Shadowrun Returns! You will not be dissapointed with this title.			"

												A huge disappointment.  I was really looking forward to this game since it showed up on Kickstarter.  Fallout 1 & 2 are among my favorite games ever, and this was touted as a return to that style of RPG.  It...isn't.I find the combat enjoyable.  It's basically a simplified version of XCOM:  Enemy Unknown.  One problem with it is that once combat starts, it doesn't end until you move to another map, even if there are no enemies around.  So after a fight ends, you'll have to move your party through the map in turn-based mode until you get to an exit.The story is good by video game standards.  You receive a recorded message from an old friend who's been murdered and are tasked with tracking down his killer.  For the most part, dialogue is well-written.  There's no voice acting, which some may take issue with, but it allows for more robust dialogue.  Unfortunately, this game doesn't take advantage of that benefit.The game is extraordinarily linear.  There's exactly one path through the story.  A handful of situations where you may be able to get from point A to point B by a slightly different route exist (i.e., bluff your way past a guard vs. hacking through an unguarded door), but these are so few and so insignificant that they don't make any real difference overall.  Dialogue is pretty much the same no matter what:  Ask about story-related stuff, ask about general backround/setting information.  Very little opportunity to employ your character's personality.Sidequests are almost nonexistent, and the few that the game does have are simple ""go over there and get me that thing,"" or ""while you're on this run, see if you can find a thing I want"" sorts of things.The whole game is designed entirely around mobile devices and it suffers for it.  The UI is a bit clunky and unintuitive for PC, limited to what would work on a touch-based interface.  The save system is simply unacceptable.  The game has no manual save option.  Not even a save and quit function.  It's entirely based on reaching checkpoints.  This is supposed to be fixed with the DLC scheduled for January 2014, but until then, if you screw up a fight at the end of a mission?  You're replaying the whole mission.  Have to leave before you finish a mission?  You're replaying the whole mission.  As I understand it, this is because the game cannot save the current map state, which explains some of the linearity.  When you return to a location, you're actually loading a completely different map of the location with its own triggers, different versions of NPCs with dialogue appropriate to that point in the story, etc.  This means that the player can't affect any change in the game as every change or combination of changes to a location would require its own unique map, and I'm not even sure if the game is able to load different versions of the same map based on variables.I can't really speak to the user-generated content as I haven't used the editor or played any user-made campaigns yet, but from what I've heard from those who have, the editor is very, very limited in what it can do.  As a result, a lot of people who were planning on making content for the game have given up.Maybe the upcoming DLC will improve the editor, maybe (probably) it won't.  Either way, I wouldn't suggest paying more than about $5 for Shadowrun Returns.			"

												Shadowrun is an RPG set in a future version of Earth where Elves, Orcs and magic exist. It has a strong story, involving murder investigations, corporate espionage and supernatural rituals. There are many interesting NPCs and good dialogue choices, although sadly no voice acting. The stats/skills level up system has some nice depth, and some stats can influence dialogue options. Combat is like Xcom, turn based with a squad of 4, with action points to spend on moving, firing guns or using items/magic. Some squad members are hired temporarily before each quest, have no dialogue, and you can't customise their stats/gear, so unfortunately they lack personality. Levels are small and the whole game is quite linear, with not much scope for exploration. But the campaign lasts around 11 hours so value for money is good. The music is fantastic and really adds to the atmosphere. Although some things could be improved, its still very enjoyable and well worth checking out.Review update: DragonfallDragonfall takes the formula established in the original release, and improves on it in several ways. Its actually misleading to describe this as ""DLC"". These days, particularly in the RPG genre, that term conjures up thoughts of short quests and meaningless item packs. Dragonfall is more like the good old days of expansion packs, where you got a meaty chunk of gameplay to sink your teeth into.The story is excellent, one of the best I've played through in any game for quite some time. The action has shifted to Berlin, where you've joined a crew of shadowrunners on a contract to extract some data from a vault. Predictably, the mission goes wrong, dragging you into another deep conspiracy full of twists and turns, that also helps to explain more of the world's lore.Because your crew are fully fleshed out characters, instead of the original's mostly hired help, each character has much more depth to their personality. They have a past, they have feelings, and the story is given increased emotional weight through conversations with these characters.The gameplay mechanics, tactical turn based combat, and level up system all remain intact, and we now have the ability to save anywhere, rather than being limited to the original's checkpoint only system. Quest structure is less linear than before. You have some control over which order to play certain quests, and most quests have optional objectives that, if completed, provide greater (or alternate) rewards. You'll also have some tough moral choices to consider which affect quest outcomes, and many areas allow for the use of non combat skills, including talking your way past guards or hacking computers to gain information.Dragonfall took me 19 hours to complete, which is significantly longer than the original game, and represents excellent value for money at full price. I don't recall encountering any bugs at all.Overall Dragonfall is amazing, and I rate it as an absolute MUST BUY.			"

												My last reccomendation was unfair to the development team. I overlooked the fact that this game was pumped out by a minimal staff in a very short deadline, so I'm going to re-write my assessment.Boring, clunky, and linear. This game has great concepts behind it, but is not executed well. The storyline might be a fascinating read, but does not engage the player at all. The best scripted fight, the last fight of the game about 8 hours in, is almost as fun as the prologue of Neverwinter Nights. Almost.My biggest complaint is with the story, but the game has potential to give the community what they are thirsty for. I'm not overly impressed with the graphics, and I really wished I could have changed angles from the point of view on the field, but for the most part the combat and character navigation is easy enough to manage. The equipment is very simple, though not explained well (*cough cybernetics cough*), and you don't have to put much thought into micro-managing your character or your hire-by-mission squadmates. It's impossible to get attached to characters as they're just a portrait to represent the mathhammer you wield as the gamer.I did really like the etiquitte aspect to your character. The game gives you more conversation options if you have a higher Charisma stat, and with a higher Charisma you learn new jargon by which to speak with the appropriate factions (ie shadowrunners, security, corporate, or gang). Unfortunately, the dialogue is still linear and it only provides introductory ports for the equifinality of the storyline.Pros: cheap, potential for community contribution, non-demanding of hardware, neat concepts.Cons: easy, impersonal, clunky, and inconsequential.4/10			"

This is the order in which I suggest you to play the Shadowrun Returns games in order to fully enjoy the experience : Shadowrun Returns > Shadowrun: Dragonfall > Shadowrun: Hong Kong > Shadowrun ReturnsReplaying Shadowrun Returns last will allow you to really enjoy it, since going through the 2 others will allow you to better know the game's story and gameplay.

As of now it's just a cyber space with the same mechanics of the real world, just with different weapons and enemies.Little tips to new-comers: don't spend your karma points until you know what type of mission you're about to face, don't spend all of your money and make use of allies' items first of all.

Buying this game is like buying the books fro a Table-Top-RPG, youinvest upfront so that you can play mulple home-brew stories later. By the end of it, you will want to tryto build a character that can't be completed in just one run of the game, and since you can't replay the base campain with the same character... you do the math.I give it an 8/10, worth your time, chummer.

Short version: 76%Harebrained Schemes made a nice but not too spectacular attempt at adapting the rules of the original Shadowrun game books in a video game format. The end product is a bit simple but still enjoyable, medium-length turn-based tactical combat RPG in a great cyberpunk setting.Long version:Whenever pen-and-paper RPG rules are adapted in video game format, the results are always unpredictable. In the case of Shadowrun Returns though, there was no risk involved: one of the original creators of the Shadowrun universe leads Harebrained Schemes, the studio behind this game.On the flipside, the developers pretty much assumed that those who will play this game are already familiar enough with the setting. While this lack of handholding can be refreshing, it may scare away a few people who won’t have the patience to delve into the depths of the game mechanics.And learning is an important part, since Shadowrun Returns is an almost purely tactical combat RPG. There are plenty of dialogues and datalogs to read, but they have very little influence on the events; the bulk of the game is spent on the turn-based combat levels.Said levels try to offer many different layouts, settings, and even enemy types, but they lack in variety when it comes to approach. Out of all the possible classes, deckers (hackers) have incredibly limited roles on a handful of runs, and magic or hand-to-hand feel underpowered compared to a simple-as-a-stick assault rifle wielding warrior. (Not to mention that one mission will force the player to use a specific weapon type, even if they have zero points in that skill.)Some of these unbalances can be corrected with a good party, but by limiting the player in choices, one still cannot help but feel as if this game is only good as a first attempt, nothing more—which would be correct, as the later entries will open up a much wider world…			"

												One of the first big Kickstarted franchise releases, Shadowrun Returns had a great deal to live up to. Not only did it carry the torch for the next generation of crowd-funded games, it was also the first title in several years for a much beloved franchise. A sequel of sorts to the very well-regarded SNES title, Shadowrun Returns revisits the grungy streets of Seattle 2054, an urban wasteland controlled by mega-corporations, into which magic has re-awakened, and a variety of meta-human races have re-emerged. You play as a Shadow Runner, a sort of special agent for hire who offers their skills out to anyone willing to pay the right price. In this case, you’re contacted by an old buddy who wants you to hunt down a murderer. His own in fact.The campaign that comes with Shadowrun is being touted as a sort of sample story to inspire modders to create their own stories, but honestly it’s of sufficient quality that it justifies a purchase on its own. Dropping enough hints and allusions to the greater Shadowrun fiction to get hardcore fans salivating, it tells a standalone tale full of double-crosses, femme fatales, duplicitous corporations and shady cults that immerses newcomers in the world without bombarding them with unnecessary exposition and world detail.One of the great joys of the setting is the clash between familiar fantasy and cyberpunk tropes. Traditional fantasy races and concepts like mages and elves exist alongside mega-corporations and streetwise hackers, struggling to survive in the lawless urban wasteland. Over-familiarity with basic conventions is a common problem in fantasy, so it’s intriguing to visit a universe where that predictability has been largely removed. Although, unsurprisingly, elves remain pompous, haughty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥even in Shadowrun. It’s a world that feels both vibrant and entropic, colourful and bleak, and it’s brought to life through a vibrant and consistent art style. Character art stays just on the right side of cartoonish, each portrait giving you a sense of the character while allowing your imagination, and the excellent dialogue, to fill in the rest. Hulking trolls and lithe, graceful elves scamper about on a lush selection of neon-lit cyberpunk cityscapes, while the rain pours down and shreds of newspaper and cigarette packets are scattered by the wind. The thumping background score completes the sense of immersion. It’s genuinely one of the most visually stylish games released in 2013.While the visuals do their part to set the scene, it’s the writing and storytelling that really sell the setting. Characters are understandably painted in rather broad strokes, but they still feel believable and likeable, from your hard-bitten buddy Coyote to the streetwise Jake Armitage (think a ginger Han Solo with a penchant for sleeping in morgue trays) and the politically astute troll bouncer Mr. Kluwe. Even negotiations with background NPC’s feel real. Thugs and gangsters speak in an unfamiliar street cant, peppering each sentence with baroque and occasionally impenetrable slang. Grab a rank or two in the charisma stat and you can select an ‘etiquette’, essentially giving your character a familiarity within one of the social strata that make up the Shadowrun world, from high-flying socialites to street-level hustlers. Your character’s possible dialogue responses are also really great, allowing for a range of deadpan cynicism and/or colourful insults.The focus on one small cabal of runners is a great idea, as each character gets their moment in the spotlight, and the sense of a dysfunctional family of scoundrels is well developed over the course of the game. There’s even a surprisingly deft and touching final scene. While the main plot itself loses a little character in the final third, and there’s relatively few chances to dramatically affect the flow of the story, on the whole it’s an enjoyable adventure with a couple of nice twists and some dastardly villains to take down. Hopefully developers Harebrained Schemes will serve up some more adventures with this bunch of miscreants and rogues.When you head out to crack some heads, Shadowrun Returns offers a deep and satisfying turn-based combat system. Everything revolves around ‘action points’, which govern exactly how many moves you can make in combat. Firing a single shot from your pistol might take up one point, while carefully zeroing in on an ork thug’s eyeball takes two – the former frees you up to move into cover, while the latter eats up your movement but increases the chance of a critical hit. Adding to the mix are various abilities from different skill trees. While this is essentially a classless game, meaning you can build your character however you like, for new players it’s advisable to stick to one of the pre-arranged packages, which range from spell-slinging mages to riggers, who take the Robot Wars approach to combat by using controllable drones. You can branch out of your chosen package at any time if you fancy dipping into weapon skills or even grabbing some cyber-warfare skills. Jack into the matrix as a ‘decker’ and you’ll find you can circumvent some of the detective work you might otherwise be forced to do.Each play-style has a few unique tricks for you to discover in the heat of battle. Mages can find lay-lines of magical power, that if stood on increase the efficiency of their spells. Shamans can instead spot hidden elemental spirits that can be summoned into a fight. In one of Shadowrun‘s best combat features, controlling a spirit becomes a dangerous game of risk and reward. You can invest your summon with up to four action points, making them extremely dangerous in a fight. Charging them up too much, however, increases the likelihood that they can break free, leaving you with one incredibly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off fire elemental to deal with in addition to the other twelve ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Riggers can use their robot buddies to flank enemies through conveniently placed vents, allowing you to both scout ahead and get the drop on guards. My only qualm is that sound effects don’t quite carry the punch of the rest of the audio design. Some more weighty gunshots and spell effects would be welcome.Since Shadowrun is all about disparate operatives coming together for well-paid but dangerous missions, it makes sense that before each mission you can select your team. Contacts in your base of operations provide a list of agents covering each class, as well as some more unique multiclass characters. You pay a certain amount to each runner to get them in your squad, with some of the more devastating operatives only available to those with sufficient cash. It’s a nice touch that encourages careful selection,as each runner possesses their own load-out which may or may not mesh with your needs. However, the lack of customisation seems like a missed opportunity, as Shadowrun seems tailor-made for the same kind of attachment you had to your X-Com: Enemy Unknown commandos.Bugs seem largely non-existent, apart from the occasional grammatical mistake buried deep in the text. Despite these relatively minor imperfections, however, Harebrained Schemes have done a bang-up job with Shadowrun Returns. Interfaces are clean, slick and, despite inventory management being slightly awkward due to the need to keep cycling unused items back and forth to your stash, generally intuitive.Shadowrun Returns exceeded my every expectation. It is by far the best title in the franchise since the 16-bit era. Shadowrun fans and RPG enthusiasts who loved the late-'90s isometric games should definitely check it out.			"

												I love the Shadowrun universe, so I was pretty excited about the kickstart campaing and the eventual release of this game. As an old school gamer, my gaming history is based on games like Fallout(1&2), Shadowrun(original), XCOM(originals) and many other genre-defining legends, my expectations were pretty high I must confess.Once I finished the game (about 10h or so) I couldnt believe that it was over, it felt like something was missing.It was the realization that the experience I hoped for was never going to be delivered.The game is not a total waste but it's tremendously shallow, as linear as it can possibly be.Character creation doesnt feel deep enough: generic 3D models, character photos that do not represent your model, lack of customization, lack of classes information...During the course of the game you do not interact with the game-world but with overlays on it, you will never go up or down a stair, you interact with the overlay near the stair and then you go up or down.Leveling up feels boring, most of the time you don't feel like getting stronger. Also the possibility to wait for a stat check barrier (the game tells what values are needed) to spend your karma points feels really sad.All around It's an excessively minimalist game: graphical engine, art, interface, world, combat, skills, progression... everything.If it was a mobile game it would've been a fair accomplishment, but at this point in gaming history, a ""return"" to Shadowrun universe as a PC game shouldn't have looked like this.This game lacks depth for a Shadowrun universe PC game.Two good aspects of the game though:- story: Does a good job immersing you on the plot.- content creating community: The level editor and the content created by the community can keep you entertained if you happen to like the game. The community made a lot of other adventures for you to run if you wish.For me, that is not enough and, most importantly, not what I was looking for on this ""return"".For people with high expectations as mine I cannot recommend this game.

												Huge oversight on the design of this game, is that noncombat ""skill checks"" for interacting with the environment can only be done by your character.What this means is, say you have three hired mercenaries on your team.  One of them is the ""hacker"" role.  You go to a computer in a noncombat situation, and want to hack it.  You have no hack skill, but the hacker merc you hired has plenty of hacker skill level to break into the computer.  But the game doesn't let your use your hacker to open the computer - only YOUR character's hack skill is checked.  So, there is NO reason to hire a hacker, since they can't be used to hack in noncombat situations.  Utterly stupid.  If you don't take the hacker role for your character, you literally have NO ability to hack outside of combat situations, since your hacker mercearies can only hack in combat.  Thus, hacker mercs are pretty terrible. There's things like Strength checks too.  Like, your character is not strong enought to move a fridge, but the troll you hired has enough to move it.  But again, it's not combat, so your troll can't help you.  WTF.AND THERE'S SO MANY BUGS!  Scripted events fail to trigger, game freezes, can't progress in missions...Sloppy.NOTE:  The later sequels, Dragonfall and Hong Kong, have fixed the hacking oversight.			"

												This is a rpg game in a world where fantasy and technology mix perfectly.  If you enjoy androids, giant insects, cyberpunk, guns, and are a fan of ""Blade Runner"", you will enjoy the odd characters and turn based combat. If you enjoy reading narrative instead of hearing it, this is for you.			"

												This game has one official story, and it is pretty linear. You can complete the full campaign within hours, and there are no official post-game contents.The battle system is turn-based, grid-like strategy fight. You control up to 4 players, and fight againts enemies either by using guns, melee weapons, or spells. The battle itself isn't hard to understand, but it is very challenging if you are playing harder difficulties with an unprepared party.The main character is very customizable, it takes my first playthru a lot of times struggling on how to develop my character. However, after one playthru, I find the customization choice is pretty unnecessary, since you can always hire a full team of balanced shadowrunners to do all the work.The story or dialogue choices make very little difference to the plot, most of the time they just affect the next NPC sentence and that's all.The plot is interesting and fit in the game setting pretty well.Glitches still happens to me in this game, most of them forces me to restart the game and lose less than 20 minutes of playtime since the last checkpoint. But so far nothing game-breaking.I was a huge fan of the SEGA Genesis version. This game gives me some nostalgia because of the character and plot setting, but the gameplay itself is very disappointing. So I have a mixed feeling for this game.The game on itself is pretty decent, but it kinda ruins the impression I have for the franchise. In my opinion, this game is pretty good for players who are new to this franchise, but it is a disappointment for old fans.I wish this game have achievements.My Score: 6/10			"

												I played the classic on the SNES back in the day and only lasted 10 minutes before dying. No matter what I did, I died. I thought Shadowrun Returns might be as deadly as the original, but (thankfully) it wasn't.Shadowrun Returns looks amazing, and from the first moment it makes you wonder just what lies ahead in this strange cyberpunk world. The inviting world teasing you to explore and uncover the truths behind the deadman who wants you to find his killer, however... it never really got there.Don't get me wrong - the various maps look amazing, but there's little to them other than being a very impressive backdrop. There's no real reward for exploring, and the various NPCs that litter the sidewalks aren't much more than fancy decoration on an already good looking cake. Perhaps I was asking too much for this to be a deeply engrossing world, yet in a way it is an engrossing world thanks to the storytelling.What you are going to get in Shadowrun Returns is a great story, and for some it might even be too text heavy (especially if English isn't your native language). However, I enjoyed it, the story is basically a detective novel as you try to uncover the mystery of who killed your friend. The catch being the client is the deadman himself, which is great and is a nice nod to the old film noir movies of old.It's due to how well the story is written I can forgive it for being very linear with almost no plot trees or divergence due to your actions or selections that I noticed.In fact, that seems to be the theme of the game. It's a very well presented world, with a very well written story, but just seems to lack a little spice. There's very little loot, there's very little to explore, the skill tree looks rather impressive, but doesn't seem grab you at all. The same with character creation.I don't want to come across as overly negative with the game, as I really did enjoy what was offered, yet I feel like it could have offered so much more. Again, perhaps I'm demanding too much from what is already a very well presented game. On the plus side it has Steam Workshop intergration and there seems to be a host of community mods and projects underway, so a host of new content should just be around the corner. Likewise the developers have released DLC, which seemingly adds another layer to the game (perhaps that's what I'm looking for?). In short, a very solid game and a welcome return for Shadowrun, but it's not as brutal as the original and perhaps lacks that little something extra to make it a true great. Enjoy the detective story.			"

												While it could have been great, the game is simply flawed with the save system.I played Shadowrun in the late eighties, early nineties, and this game reminded me well known emotions during half an hour, after it was lost. Too few items, too few weapons, too little roleplaying.  "

												If you were to cross Bladerunner with The Dresden Files into a quality tactical strategy RPG hybrid, the result would no doubt be something very akin to Shadowrun Returns. Shadowrun Returns excels at story telling, the game is rich with lore, well written dialogues that feel more conversational than what most games accomplish, and a structured story full of plot twists and interesting characters. Perhaps my favorite point about the story is that it starts out small-scale, you are on a simple mission to look into the death of a friend, but it slowly ramps up into something larger as the story progresses. To top it off the game is set in a beautiful futuristic game world and has solid tactical gameplay to boot.More than anything this game to me was about an awesome sci-fi detective story. The mystery and intrigue suck you in, the stellar writing especially in regards to dialogue keeps you hooked. I'm not saying the game mimics what street talk may actually be like in the future, but it was great enough to get me immersed in the street life of futuristic Seattle. The characters within the game range from annoying (intentionally so), charming, grumpy, and likeable; chatting with the regulars throughout the story and going through the different chat options was something I enjoyed doing (shout out to Mr. Kluwe, you're the man, man!). The game's audio and visuals do justice to this story, bringing it to life with stunning hand drawn environments and appropriately mood setting music.The game's combat also leaves little to be desired. Although I felt the large scale management of the game to be a little inconsistent...for example the money you earn throughout the story can go into temporary lulls, and if you need to do a mission when you aren't expecting it you may find you don't have enough money to buy a full team of mercs. The game runs similar to most other tactical RPG games, especially similar to the XCOM series. You use the terrain to your advantage and in a turn based fashion you move your team about and order them to attack or use utility items/spells. On hard the game isn't terribly difficult and you shouldn't have to think deeply each turn on how to best arrange your team and how to best utilize there action points (how many actions they can take per turn). The combat is a bit sparse at the beginning of the game but as you progress further you start to battle the baddies more often and that's when the fun starts.Shadowrun Returns is a solid tactical RPG game, and with the addition of the Steam workshop can keep you playing well beyond the twelve hour campaign. The game's story is strong and the characters within are fun ones. It's nice to play a detective style game that isn't a point and click for a change. The game is quite gripping and just like any good detective novel it kept me at the edge of my seat until I got through to the end.			"

 Never trust people who you cant punch. Especially if they are already dead. Shadowrun Returns  is linear story-driven game with turn-based combat. You are a mercenary in a sci-fi world that also got few drops of magic and your goal is to find the murder of a friend of yours. Story and Writing The story plot is generic: You are called by your friend who was recently murdered and you have to find his murder. On the way you gonna meet other runners and people that will show you that there is more than meet the eye.Even with the generic plot, the writing is solid and often you see that there are several approaches in a conversation that is based on your stats and etiquette. But dont worry if you cant talk your way out, few bullets can do the same or maybe a few slashes or fireballs. Combat The combat in Shadowrun Returns is turn-based with Action Points and cover. If you played X-Com : Enemy Unknown , the combat will be old friend of yours if not then you will be in luck since combat is simple enough to learn but it can be hard to master.  First thing first : being melee you are allowed to walk and attack with 1 action point( more if the target is far away) while for range you cant run and gun. Instead  you will want to get in cover before you start spreading love/bullets/magic. If you arent fan of direct attacks you can instead use drones/spirit to do the dirty job. We should not forget and the AoE skills mainly because there is friendly fire so you have to be careful when you use them. Especially if there is low hit chance because if it misses, the AoE will hit somewhere near the targeted zone.Cover is mainly to reduce the chance to be hit but at times it may seem broken . Once I went behind a target that was in cover and my hit chance got reduced(in pointblank range) which was weird.Once you are familiar with meat-world combat you will have to encounted and the Matrix which can be accessed only by deckers . Combat in the matrix is the same but you use different skills and death in the Matrix means disconnect and damage to your real self. Equipment Thats one area which lacks content. While you have on your hands several kind of gear to use, you will find that there isnt much variety in it and you will just look for the higher numbers.First you have your outfit that provides armor and bonuses to different stats. Then you have your weapons melee/range/drones/ spells , Then you have slots for skills and last but not least you have consumables : medkit, revival kits,grenades , spirits.If you arent fan of using spells/magic then you will be glad to upgrade yourself with cyberware. Cyberware provides you with improved stats at the cost of your essence(the ability to use spells) which is a fair trade if you count on melee or range weapons.But still Equipment pool is lacking a lot. Character Customizatin Here we are with the best part of this game. I mean what is an RPG without a decent character customization , huh?While you can pick one of the 5 premade classes you are better off with making your own class and the customization deliver just that. There are 6 main stats : Body, Quickness(Agility), Strength , Intelligence , Willpower and Charisma. And each one of them got different branches that offer different skills(only Body doesnt have any those since its mainly to increase your HP). Quickness is important for your range gunners . It allows you to spend points on different gun types : Pistol,Shotgun, SMG and Rifle. It also let you increase your points in dodge which makes you harder to hit with physical attacks. It also allows you to specific actions in a conversation.Strength is important for your brawlers because it let you spend points on close combat : melee weapons or unarmed.In the same tree you will find and the throwable stats. And just like quickness, you can pick unique options during a dialogue.Intelligence is important for your techwizards: hackers or drone users. Hackers are useful when you are investigating because you will often find hackable objects that provides useful information. Also only Hackers(deckers) can enter the Matrix to provide you with extra information. Drone users on the other hand will be able to use higher level drones . On top of that Intelligence also contain the Biotech branch that increases the amount of HP you recover with medkits. And just like the other stats you are given unique dialogue options every now and then.Willpower is the main stats for mages. Increasing it will allow you to equip more and better spells. It also increases the chance to hit with them.Charisma is the main stats for spirit users and sweet talkers. Its most helpful if you try to talk your way out of a situation. It also allows you to have different etiquettes.Its worth noting that different races got different limit on some stats, And a friendly advice from me : Never try to be a Jack of all trades because there arent enough Karma points to let you do that. Instead focus on 2 stats and let other shadowrunners fill the weak spots(yes you can hire other runners on some missions). All in all is a solid game if you want to play a decent RPG nowadays. Often there will be different roads in solving a problem so its worth exploring and see the one way that fits you  "

												Note: this is for the base game without DLC/Dragonfall.I've never played a turn-based strategy combat RPG or whatever kind of game this is, before, so I didn't know what to expect. The gameplay mechanics felt so-so when I started. I played for like 30 minutes , gave up, then picked it up again a month or two later. Strategy isn't my forte so I was hesitant to crank the difficulty up for a challenge, it already felt frustrating to miss shots and then have to wait for things to happen during enemy turns. I got used to it after a couple hours, as I learned the game more and generally got smarter about what to do. I upgraded my opinion of the game play to ""yeah that seems alright then.""The class/karma point system is pretty interesting and I had fun toying with that. The decking/hacking bits were cool and I wish there were a lot more of those scenes/levels. Be wary if you go for a rigger build, there are a couple points in the game where glitches are possible to encounter, you'll have to unequip your drones to progress and it felt kinda sad considering that's the whole point of the build I wanted. The story is also very linear, I think there's only one optional mission you can do that diverges from the main plot.It's a 2d isometric game, so if you're not into that sort of retro style you may not like it. I thought it was gorgeous, and along with story-telling and the slang it was really easy to feel immersed and taken away by the plot. There's no voice acting, only text with pre-written options (of varying personalities) of your character's reply. After a couple hours of playing I didn't want to stop because I wanted to see what would happen next. The story and atmosphere are A+ for me and I plan on buying the new game solely based on that. There's a decently sized mod community as well. I haven't played any yet but I have a few user made campaigns to try out soon that seem worthwhile.			"

Shadowrun Returns is a isometric tactical RPG. In a dystopian future, where dormant elf, orc and troll genes reemerged in the population, where immortal dragons run mega-corporations that control the world, mercenaries run the shadows to do everyone else’s dirty work with the use of guns, magic and technologies. They call themselves Shadowrunners. This review takes into account the free Dragonfall DLC released later after the game.Pros: The first module, called Dead Man’s Switch, is a nice although straightforward introduction to players who aren’t familiar with the game and explores the Seattle setting. The second module, called Dragonfall, offers a lot more character development and additional flexibility and options to complete any given quest, all while exploring the anarchy-governed flux-state of Berlin. The game backgrounds are gorgeous hand-drawn stills, added with the techno-trance music gives the game an eerie atmosphere, each building and object seemingly having a story of its own to tell, while the music adjust to combat scenes before slowing down once you’re back from it. The game progression is straightforward, the skills are broken down into skill trees with a clear view of what you get from raising any attributes or skill. There is no set character class, although you have pre-generated archetypes you can start from. Cons: The story is somewhat linear, most of all in Dead Man’s Switch, where choice will change the dialog but not the outcome of the story. General graphics aren’t on par with the AAA industry, so anyone looking for graphical realism will be sorely disappointed. There is no voice acting, so get ready to read a lot if you want to have any hopes of feeling involved in the story. The two modules which happen at the same time, aren’t related to each other, so there is no progression from one to the other, and are both somewhat quick to play through.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youLet’s judge the game for what it is: a crowdfunded indie game (the success story that put Kickstarter on the map for many people) meant to be used as an engine for the modding community, community that has been very active at creating new stories, new equipment, new world object for other modders, and is using the engine in new and creative ways. As you play, you can feel the richness of the game’s tabletop RPG heritage, and you just wish you could learn more about that world. It is fun, it is well worth the money and time, and it’s definitively a game I recommend!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Oh. My. Goodness. What an amazing game that I've stashed for thus long. I were not a big fan of cyberpunk, but the atmosphere  of the game was well articulated, as I didn't feel uncomfortable. The story is immensive, well-written and intriguing. The combat (as well as navigation around the map) resembles highly XCOM, which is tactic-intensive. Some cons: it would be better if voice is added to the main campaign. The total silent during the conversations breaks immersion a lot. The skill tree looked very intimidating to me as a newcomer to the series. Finally instead of a ""comprehensive guide"", an integrated tutorial would be a huge help (albeit basic navigation/ combat was as simple as point and click, some profession-specific capabilities were not straightforward). Overall it is a great game, and I recommend it to anyone who like RPG with turn-based combat.			"

												Mediocrity is the word that best describes this game. Its art style is really charming, but only in screenshots.The combat is made of a fixed number of battles in the campaign, wich are not hard, not easy, but neither do they require strategic thinking. The tutorial is also really bad, only by the end of the game you'll get to understand what some type of characters do. The story is pretty simple, but the included campaign lasts more than it should. I often thought the game was gonna end after one battle, only to be surprised by villains who always run away and another few pointless quests.I should note that the game also lets you create your own campaigns, a feature I didn't use. It might be interest for someone.			"

												I got this free from a great friend!The original ShadowRun. I really enjoyed this remake of this game. Actually, to be technical this is a remake of a remake. The 1st game was on NES ..there was also a game on the Xbox, but it did not pan out and was not a rpg.Anyways, this is a great example of a rpg done correctly. If i can make a suggestion, this is not the remastered version and they are different...feel free to play this version before that one...but the remastered version might be better..i have yet to play it though.This game has a great storyline and has multiple paths to different endings. Any rpg that has multiple endings is great in my book.One other thing, probably one of the best uses of kickstarter was this game. They promised stuff and they pan it out.Anyways, recommended alot for great rpg mechanics and storyline.			"

												To write a review about this game (orginal dead man switch campaign) is really difficult for me. On the one hand the game is not bad and on the other hand I can't recommend it to someone who expects an RPG. Many aspects of this game are good and are a solid foundation for an RPG but the campaign is way to limited for an recommendation+ The Charactersystem: It allows lots of different builds. Unfortunately they are not balanced and some skills won't be needed too much. + The interface: It was created to also work on touchpads so it can feel a bit ""clunky"". However I did not have any problems navigating the menus.- The save system: The game only saves on the beginning of a map. This can be annoying but it is not the reason why I can't recommend the game to RPG gamers. - The story/campaign: This is the my main problem with the game. It is way too linear. Don't get me wrong the story is good in introducing the world too you but all the time when I played the game I thought: ""Surely after the next mission I will have more freedom to explore the world, have some more banter with companions or get better gear"" In my opinion the story ends to fast, dialogues with the few interesting NPCs is very limited, no decisions which could affect the story... well the important stuff besides a good character system.+ The graphics: I liked the graphics the only bad thing: The resolution-settings: define how far you can zoom into the game. Long story short: The base game itself is good but I can't recommend the game with the ""dead mans switch""-campaign. I hope I can recommend the game after the release of the next (dlc) campaign because as I said the game is not entirely bad it just needs a good official campaign.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a throwback to the days of old, which feels absolutely fresh in this modern era. This takes me back to the golden era of RPG's in the mid-to-late 1990's - which was back when RPG's were often isometric; turn-based; party-based; and used a mixture of both 2D + 3D environments + character models. If this sounds like something that would be up your alley - you likely have already have purchased SrR (Shadowrun Returns) or should buy this game ASAP. Shadowrun Returns is simply nothing short of fantastic.Shadowrun Returns (base-game) comes equipped with ""Dead Man's Switch"" for its base-game's single-player campaign. You play a runner (whose class, if you want to pick one; race, class, skills, etc can be determined by you) whose friend recently died. Actually, he was murdered. Your job is to find who is responsible, why, and decide what to do about the matter. It seems that our friend is linked to a bunch of strange murders that have being happening in this futuristic mix of both a cyberpunk setting (futuristic world where corporations, computers, hacking + whatnot are all par for the course) + fantasy elements (elves + dwarves are here; and magic can all take place in this game-world here). And that's just the start of things - so, that I don't spoil everything.One thing that absolutely sets SrR apart from many other modern-day games - there is just no voice-acting. It's not that this game needs voice-acting, either. This is one of the best written games I've seen in years, feeling like a throwback to the days of Planescape: Torment (late 90's). This game is not just a great game, but it also so happens to be a great book to read. You'll be doing plenty of reading here. The prose, dialogue & characters are absolutely excellent - littered with tons of description + is extremely verbose. If you've been missing games to be littered w/ tons of description when characters actually do things, since graphics do plenty of the talking these days - you're in for a treat here with SrR, since the writing here is excellent.While the graphical quality will certainly not top the technical aspect of the most recent hardware-pushing graphical show - the direction of the graphics are excellent. The artistic direction game is loaded with tons of style + substance - with its excellent 2D + 3D mixture of graphics. This feels like a modern-day revival of games from the Infinity Engine.Combat feels very similar to the classic Fallout 1 + 2. You have a limited number Action Points that you can use spend to do attacks or moves. The combat of this game is quite tactical + turn-based. It always feels great, sounds great, and is a lot of fun to take on. Some of the most interesting + fun battles take place when some of your party members are in the literal game-world, while other party members might be in the computer-world matrix - where you'll be balancing doing combat on two different fronts. Nothing short of awesome.Most of this game's campaign is a linear affair, where you also might have a few side-quests here and there on your way. This is not an open-world game, by any means. Not that it needs to be, either - as the game often stays very focused on its excellent story, game-world, settings, and characters. Here and there, you'll be given a few different ways to solve quests - which can be be done or result differently, all based on your stats, skills & whatnot.Shadowrun Returns is a fantastic throwback to the 1990's era of RPG's, if it was just made with modern graphics + high-resolution support. Gamers that have been wanting a high-quality turn-based RPG where you control an entire party entirely - look no further. If you've wanted superb prose, dialogue, and writing - look no further than SrR. If having this great ""Dead Man's Switch"" campaign (which took me around 16 hours or so to finish) wasn't enough - this game has the Editor come with it. SrR is on the Steam WorkShop and there are a good deal of mods + campaigns made by gamers out there. Being given such a great campaign + an editor here - is there more that old-school RPG gamers can really ask for here? Grade = A.			"

												Rating: 8.5/10What is it?Turn based RPG set in a cyberpunk setting. The Good+ Great story and dialogue options + Great character development, you can choose between a variety of different types to fit any playstyle. Brawler, weapon specialist, hacker, drone control, mage, shaman etc... Different stats determine how good you are in each ability.+ Fun combat. Its turn based so strategy is involved in how you develop your character but also your party members. Combat is also fast paced. + Lots of spells, weapons and armor to further customize your characters + Easy to learn game mechanics. At first I thought the game would be intimidating however a few minutes into the combat and I realized how simple it was+ Great graphics and art style. I really enjoy the cyberpunk setting mixed with all the crazy characters. + Character portraits look really nice+ Very slick UI and HUDThe Bad- Can be frustrating when you character misses on enemies even with a high hit percentage. - Even after you kill all enemies, rather than the game exiting battle mode you have to control each party member to the exit to progress- minor bugs.ConclusionIf you loved the original Fallout games or even Baldurs Gate, you need to play this game. I was surprised how good it was.  "

												I was pretty skeptical of this game, i watched a few videos about it and read a couple of articles about the game, the universe looked pretty interesting, but the gameplay didn't look appealing to me.However, since during the cristmas sale, the game got really cheap , i decided to give it a try, and oh boy. Though i still have mixed feelings about the gameplay, the writing in this game is amazing, i never thought i'd enjoy reading this much in a game before. There is a lot of text, which is actually a good thing. A lot of interesting characters and stories. Would i recommend the game? Sure, but be warned  there is a lot of text, that's pretty much most of the game, and if you don't enjoy reading you are not going to have a good time with this game, though the combat can be pretty fun and chalenging, the writing is pretty much what makes this game great.If I have one complain is how linear it is. Though the level design is pretty good, I'm somewhat disappointed by the lack of exploration. There is a little bit, but the levels are way too linear and it hurts the gameplay. But not by much, since again, the meat of the game is the writing. Also this game looks pretty good. I love the art style of the characters, especially the portraits for the different characters you'll meet, very creative and interesting looking people.			"

												Surprisingly great cyberpunk round-based RPG-ish tactic game:Pro:+ story+ atmoshere+ tactical gameplay, neat classes+ cool soundtrackContra:- no possibility to ""enter combat"" on your own resulting in enemies (almost) always start the encounter- only your own Hero is equipable with equipment (NPCs can only equip items such as grenades, medkits...)- (need to read much, not voiced)__________Playtime: ~20hrs for 1 playthrough			"

												I had some fun with this game but the number of bugs I've encountered spoiled all the fun. The game has a huge potential, but it seems it has been wasted.1) The engine looks nice but it's FLAT. I'm not asking for much, even ""Fallout 2"" nearly 15 years ago had stairs in it. Not to mention original X-Com/UFO series from mid 90's. Also there's absolutely no interaction with it accept for cover options and a few active objects.2) The autosave option is a pain... especially when you have to reload due to a bug.3) Numerous BUGS! ""escaping"" camera (occuring even in ""locked"" mode!), unselectable ""active objects"", weird interface lags.4) Original campaign storyline is linear. Don't expect many side quests or free content exploration becouse there is NO CONTENT, there's only a series of tactical missions.The only hope for this game is fanmade content, but I'm dropping it untill the engine gets fixed (that might be forever).

												Shadowrun returns is a turn-based RPG on which you focus on 1 character (your own). This is a bit disappointing since even though the games features a lot of flavors of combat with different branches:- Summoner- hacker- Guns (Pistol, SMG, Rifles)- melee (Throwing, Melee)- mage (Offensive, supportive). You can only pimp your own character. If you need to go in a mission, you can hire ""Runners"" to help you  do the mission. You can only fill them up with consumables and not be able to temporarily equip them.Despite all of that, Shadowrun returns is a solid game with it's gameplay and a decent 13 hour length game. Plus the fact that the modding tools of this game can allow you to make your own storyline, this is a great purchase overall. WAAAAAAYY better than Invisible Inc which has very short mission line, very weak modding tools (can't make your own story) in exchange of a almost perfect gameplay. "

												XCom meets Baldurs Gate squished into one.Lots of reading, but thats how these games are, but there is a lot of reading.About 1/2 way through I started to notice some of the text grammer and spelling started to show some foreign traits, but nothing that detracted from the game.The campaign was a touch short.  I'm a casual gamer and I finished my first run in about 18 hours, but I enjoyed it!  Yes I will probably be playing through again.  By the time I was getting to the end I was finially remembering how the talent points worked (yes I played the pen and paper ver some way back when), and what skills/abilities I wanted.All in all I would recomend the game.  Especially if you like XCOM or any of the D&D RPG style games.			"

												If you're a fan of the old Shadowrun games on Genesis or SNES, this might be for you. If you enjoyed the Shadowrun FPS/Counter-Strike clone from a few years back, you probably won't like this so much. I give this a mixed thumbs up- the combat and leveling system are fun, but the story/writing and conclusion are pretty balls.			"

												If you are looking for a classic CRPG experience in the style of Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale, you've come to the wrong place. This is one of the most linear Rpg's of it's kind i've ever played. Like exploring an open world, picking up side missions, and finding gear? Shadow run has none of this. Instead your stuck in an incredibly tiny hub area (usually just a bar, which you can't leave, though sometimes you have access to the city), which you use to hop from one mission to next, as mentioned before only a couple of these which deviate from the main storyline.  There is no loot really, the only item progression you get is buying the slightly better piece of armor/weapon/decker interface from the hub store. The story was holding it's own, and was a fairly interesting murder mystery untill about halfway through when ***SPOILERS*** you suddenly have to fight a bunch of astral bugs from another dimension and save the world... somehow? It gets completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, in other words. The combat is fairly good, but most of the time you're actually not even fighting anything so I can't reccomend the game based on the combat alone. This is not like an old school Black Isle/Bioware game like the trailers and screenshots make it look to be, so if that's what your looking for don't let this game sucker you into buying it like it did me. 4/10			"

Short Review: Keep in mind this relates to the Vanilla game as of Dec/6/2013The combat is great and fun,1 skill tree class is pointless,game is linear,not much consequence of choice quest endings are irrelevant.Character creation is limited,skill tree point allocation brutforces max stats based on race.Graphics and locations are varied and lovely to run through.Mods can be made for the game via the limited tools,but are restricted to custom campaigns.Levels have lack of map rotation which gets in the way very few times if at all.Save system is horrible you have to playthrough section by section in order for the game to save, no manual saving options.Audio effects are good. If you want to play a tactical rpg with a so-so story (seems akin to kings bounty) in terms of a passable but not memoriable story,and can deal with the items I mentioned I say get it when its on sale.If it was not for the apparent flaws in the game,short length,and bad save system, I'd say its worth full price but to me its only worth $10 at most.Either get on sale, or wait til all the dlc comes out and buy as a goty,gold,platinum,complete, w/e they will call it.Otherwise skip it. I give it a  3/5 I do not see myself playing through this game again other than once every few years or something,it just lacks replay value to me.Full Review:This game has probably one of the best tactical rpg A.I. in terms of difficulty I have seen in awhile.The combat system is pretty good and the % chance to hit works just fine. The locations you goto are very vibrant and colorful and fit the setting of the game quite well. The lack of the ability to rotate the map becomes a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥in a few instances but not anywhere near as much as one would think thanks to careful placement of obsticles. Skill tree wise, there are some aspects I do not like such as the fact a summon has to buy spirits to sommon.To aide with this though one can summon a spirit from a location on the map bt only some locations have them. I played my first playthrough on hard as a summoner with riffle skills and conjuring ability.The Decker class (a cyber hacker ) is completely pointless because most of the missions where it matters to have on you get one for free or get recommended one for cheap that is pretty strong.Its a waste of time to even bother with the decker skill tree and there not many places you can hack which takes away from having a multiple way of doing things.I find this a bad flaw since this game is linear and there is hardly a choice of consequence. All the other skill tree classes are useful. Overall though the skill tree point allocation system some have problems with,but it seems balanced for how the game is so I had no problem with it. Pistols,shotguns,rifles,drones,gernades,elemental spirit summons,med kits,cybernetic implants,etc are your purchase choices.Quests in the game seem mostly geared toward the main story,I found there to be hardly any side quests.There are more optional objectives that you can do while on a main quest than there are side quests. This a let down since the optional quests in the main quest seem like they are naturally apart of the main quest anyway.Character creation is standard though limited.What character you pick decides what your starting stats will be.Now here is where some people might not like.In the skill tree races have a max stat they can reach for skills.For example in many lure Elvan are largely focused toward magic,nature and spirits so they tend to have high max stat allocation ability in areas related to it than other people. This sort of system in my opinion takes away from being able to make your character your own,however seems to convey a standard lure for the different races.Human,Elvan,Dwarf,Troll are your races to choose from.The story for me was very passable.You will need to follow it because of having to pick different dialog tree's so you will need to know some of which was going on,but I found myself skimming through parts of the dialog exchange because it was not engaging enough to keep my interest. There are some interesting points to the main story but overall I feel the story hurts the game the most.I wont say its not an okay story, I just found it very uninteresting. Some of the ingame events that occurred were fun however short lived without much detail for some.Overall The game is playable because of various locations,graphics, and a good tactical  battle system.However being an rpg there character classes hardly have much difference to them and the skill system is lackluster.The lack of consequence of choice and branching story/quest elements touted to be in makes the game suffer for it.The combat system saves it making the game playable considerably but the story is forgettable and I found myself not being engrossed into it. Since steam lacks any other option other than a thumbs up or down I have to give it a down for its weak presentation of rpg gameplay and story.			"

												I heard a lot of mixed reviews for this game, and I have to say I was quite pleasantly surprised. It's not a perfect game, but it's a very enjoyable take on the genre, with enough innovation to feel fresh.PROS:- the biggest pro is the writing; the story is excellent noir-ish cyberpunk fare, and the dialogue is very well written- combat (especially late game combat) can be thrilling- the environments are attractive- there are some small and pleasing genre innovations (for example, hiring a party on a mission-to-mission basis, inventory/stash management is well done, the stat/levelling system is very versatile and effective)- the hacking system can lead to some really great combat encounters with fighting happening simultaneously in the real world and the matrix, and consequences of each fight has limited spillover on to the otherCONS:- the game is quite short with very little outside the main story path; I did every side mission and finished in under 9 hours- the combat music is repetitive- not enough weapons,  some balance issues,  some stats/classes basically worthless- the environments felt dead; few people in the environment, even fewer that will talk to you, and zero incentive to explore (not really any scavenging)- some of the lategame setpiece fights are too long and repetitive- the game was too easy overall (played on normal)anyway, I hear Dragonfall is better, so I'll be getting that too, but if this is on sale or something and Dragonfall isn't, it's still worth your money.

												I enjoyed this and its sequal dragon fall for several reasons.1. portrays shadowruns setting fairly well a dispotic apocalyptic wasteland with trolls and mugic and stuff.2. feels very close in character creation and growth like you are playing tabletop shadowrun !3. memorable characters and a cameo from the old nintendo shadowrun game ! nice.4. a pretty decent amount of options for strategies and you hire your own supporting runners.------------the few cons i found are as follows -------1. first one has kinda poor cyber parts until very late in game.2. healing from mage or shaman is kinda clunky and seriously gibbed by a lot of late game debuffs that give you damage at the start of your turn as healing only heals ""the last wound"" which is also kinda wierd in the players favor if you have 1 point in healing you can heal say a 24 damage crit in one shot if it doesnt have any lingering damage or anything.3.  Riggers seem OP once you get some money under your belt riggers can be up to 3 individual characters (combat) and circumvent things with drones (vents).4. Adept felt on the whole kinda meh. i beat the game and the sequal as an adept first and the second one helps but you still have to activate your abilities wasting 1/3 or 1/2 of your turn just to do the same damage as other people when in the scource game (tabletop) adepts can be passive wrecking machines just as dangerous as any cybersam.5. a few targeting glitches very rare but not being able to shoot at certain enemies at certain times ""just cause"" is a little annoying.6. i would have liked to see more control over your crews loadout and even maybe talent growth especially in the second one as the characters are more integrated into the story as opposed to just coyote in the first one.----------------------------in closing all in all the stories are good for both this and its sequal, the gameplay is solid enough especially for a small dev. They both allow a lot of character options, and advancement strategies. It feels kinda like shadowrun tabletop (a good thing)			"

												I finished the game.This game was developed for tablets and it hinders the game massively, many reviews seem to leave this part out.+ The story is great and very well fleshed out+ The NPCs you will interact with are interesting, unique and fun to read+ The graphical presentation suits the game's style very well, although key items and interactable objects blend in with static scenery+ The pacing is good+- The ending was satisfactory but nothing great- Short game, for an RPG, definitely not worth full price- A watered down XCOM combat system, boring, dull and clunky. Percentages seem to be broken, movement is annoying, cover is scarce and in illogical places. You can't peak around walls or anything like that.- The UI is barebones at best, you wont spend much time in menus, and as far as I could tell, there's no way to customise your character's gear and inventory unless you purchase something first.- There is little to no explanation of key features of the game, the UI, or the combat. I had to trial and error pretty much everything in the game.- No permanent party members, this means no customisation other than your character, no relationships to develop, no party member backstories to uncover. - The game locks you in combat between encounters, making exploration and navigating and absolute chore. Killing any semblence of enjoyment in exploring the detailed environments.  "

												So, really XCom is the leader in this sort of game, but Shadowrun compensates by adding some decent story and RPG elements. I had a good time with it, and apparently the sequel buffs out some of the quirks. There's a few oddities. The inventory management and party system is non-standard, but you're a grown person - you'll figure it out. The art is great, and you want a closer look at it. I only wish the game didn't keep trying to force you to zoom out. A few other weird issues manifest, especially in the early game when you and the game are still getting to know each other. I get the impression of a solid foundation having been laid but then parts of the structure being abruptly canceled and quickly made to achieve a base level of functionality. You can specialize in a weapon but then there's only 3 weapons of that class you can ever buy sort of stuff. Probably a result of the tabletop system being implemented literally without followthrough in the game properA few other areas assume a familiarity with the tabletop system and aren't explained especially well in the game, but they weren't gamebreakers for a 13-hour long RPG. You might make a bad decision and sort of de-optimize your build, but it's not a huge hassle. The game isn't very unforgiving. I played through on hard mode and only failed once in an early mission. For example, cybernetic upgrades aren't really explained very well in the game, and I purchased some cool robo-legs, and then later discovered that I was kind of stuck with them and there would never be any significant upgrades. I get the impression that the tabletop actually has lots more depth that they just sort of ran out of time to implement, and that these shortcomings (Just add more items to the shopping cart) could be easily addressed in fan made levels or whatnot.

												Shadowrun Returns is an top-down isometric RPG game, set in the universe of the Shadowrun pen & paper role-playing game.You take direct control of your central character, followed by the companions you choose or forced to by the game. Combat mode is activated when you encounter aggressive NPCs. Combat options include using cover, summoning creatures to fight for you, healing and boosting your team, spells, melee weapons and gun play. You have direct control of your own team. Interaction with the world and team is highly limited when out of combat unfortunately. When you start a game, you pick your character's gender, race (human, elf, ork, dwarf or troll) and either pick a pre-designed class or build your own. The character creation and progression system is highly flexible, you are given points which you allocate to certain abilities, enhancing them or giving you more options. You earn more of these by progressing through the plot or doing side quests in game. Throughout the game, you can also learn new spells, buy new weapons or invest in implants (at the expense of your ability to cast spells).The default campaign that comes with the game is short, linear, and filled with plenty of good and interesting characters that aren't fully fleshed out. Good plot, but missed opportunity. User generated campaigns are hit and miss, but some surpassing the default campaign.Graphics look beautiful, and really delivers the cyberpunk look and feel. Music and sound effects are good, but with only a limited selection, you end up hearing the same few tracks and sounds often. TL:DR: good for scratching that old-school isometric RPG itch, some good strategic choices to make in the game. The default campaign is fine, but limited, might want to check out the user made stuff, or DLC.			"

												I have a lot of respect to guys who worked on the cool artworks of the game. As a RPG fan, I really wanted to like Shadowrun Returns, but the game kept disappointing me on so many levels and I constantly failed to find RPG features that make me love RPG games.The story is very weak. Just compare the plot with Fallout series, the story of Chosen One, or Planescape Torment, the story of nameless one who wakes up in a mortuary one day and tries to find his forgotten past. Imagine Baldur's Gate's story, Candlekeep attack, Gorion's death, and the hunt for Saverok. Not to mention Kotor. This story doesn't give you any excitement or mystery in the storyline, and I constantly felt like the whole thing was written in a few days after the artwork was designed, although I am sure it is not true.There is no freedom of open world environment. The game dictates where we should go, what we should do to complete a quest. There are no random encounters, locations or rare items. The game doesn't reward you when you succesfully accomplish a mission besides karma points.There are certain areas where you can buy your supplies, have information on your investigations and you can't miss them. There is no puzzle that players can possibly struggle with.We are very limited with NPC options as well. Instead of choosing among several NPCs who have different POVs on matters, we have to choose no-name mercenaries for each battle. Think about Might and Magic series, Baldur's Gate, KOTOR, or Fallout and imagine how NPC choices were changing the gameplay, and how each character had different point of views on your actions. If Shadowrun Returns hadn't described itself as an RPG game, I wouldn't write any of this, but I think this game does not even  deserve to be in the same category with all of the other RPG games. I would even go further and say that even GTA IV, or Diablo is more RPG than Shadowrun Returns because of all the reasons explained above. I think the game tried to accomplish a lot and failed miserably because of this, and I hope they won't make the same mistakes in the future titles.			"

												Unfortunate Shadow run is really not that good of a game.I've sunk a considerable amount of time into the title and tried to like it because of the editor but in the end I cannot recommend it. The main problem is that the battle system is incredibly shallow, it is not balanced and to be honest it feels like there wasn't any attempt to create it like a system. It just seems like they added stuff because they thought ""well this is Shadowrun we need to have that"". Decking for example is largely useless unless you are playing a deck heavy UGC, other than that just bring along a decker on your mission and you're good to go. The guns don't feel much different from one another and spells that arnt bugged just seem bland, with again there appearing to be no thought put into the design and place of each mechanic. I think the main problem with the approach they took was that they were trying to develop it for tablet as well as PC and unfortunately it makes the PC version suffer through a general lack of options and customizability that you find in most PC titles.

												It plays a lot like the new X-Com on a more personal scale, and a lot more choice when it comes to combat. Since it includes a lot of RPG elements and the Shadowrun setting, you can create a character any way you like, from a run-and-gunner to a mage slinging fireballs, to a mage slinging buffs, to a mage with a pet, or something in-between. Some things seem unpolished or foolish, however, like running a melee combatant or a physad; The few times I tried to melee an opponent, even with a physad NPC, I got chopped into hamburger. I'm also unsure why you'd want to stick with pistols when rifles and shotguns are available, no matter how good pistols get later in the game. Maxing out pistol skills seems silly. Similarly, some of the etiquette skills are nearly useless, while some are indispensable. I suppose that's true in life as well, but it's easy to feel annoyed that you've wasted your skill points.But the setting is fantastic, and feels like it was written by people who know the game and want to make it as authentic and immersive as possible.

BITESIZE:SIMILAR GAMEPLAY TO: Jagged Alliance 2, Jagged Alliance: Flashback, Wasteland 2WHAT TO EXPECT: Basic kick-starter funded game. Short story.  Very limited RPG.  Cyberpunk themed.  Single-player. Virtually linear.  Great tactical combat.  Great graphics and art direction.  Superb writing.  ACHIEVEMENTS: NONE.STATUS: COMPLETE.WHEN TO BUY:  ASAP for fans.  Otherwise a good sale.More info below....THE LOWDOWN:Shadowrun Returns is a story-driven, party-oriented RPG with tactical combat.  The action takes place a in dysoptic cyberpunk version of Seattle around the year 2050 where trolls, elves and dwarves live alongside humanity.  The heavy use of stimulants and cybernetics pervade most aspects of life.  Magic exists.  Crime, and drug-taking are rife.  The internet has become an alternate reality where anything goes.  Rich and powerful corporations hold sway over everything and everyone, resulting in prevalence of industrial espionage carried out by Shadowrunners. These are mercenaries for hire who will perform any job if the price is right.  Players take on the role of a shadowrunner character and specialize in many abilities becoming a warrior, hacker, drone operator, magic user and unarmed combat specialist or a mix thereof.  The game world is shown in isometric form across a dozen or so fixed locations.  Play alternates between real-time exploration and investigation during the adventure phase and turn-based tactical combat.  Additional party members can be hired from an extensive roster of NPCs before going into battles, on a temporary basis.  The game begins with the player investigating who committed the murder and why, but this will ultimately lead to much greater quest with much direr consequences.  Are you up to the assignment?THE GOOD:+ A very good story with fantastic writing.  Even if some gamers may find it too much!+ Strong combat dynamic across a variety of categories: Magic, drones, ranged combat, melee and unarmed.+ Superb range of tactical combat options; from specialized firing modes, overwatch, to reloading without using an action.  Most become available by leveling certain stats.+ Amazing array of character selection and customization.+ Wonderfully created cyberspace levels reminiscent of System Shock, that plays like the tactical combat.+ A large array of equipment and items, with better items only becoming available as the story progresses.+ Very well balanced if a too easy for hardcore RPGers.+ Lots of well-made custom scenarios available in Steam Workshop.+ Ace production from its crisp, isometric graphics, well-drawn artwork and midi-based soundtrack (non-dlc), altogether produces a great ambience.+ Strong easy to use and understand interface.THE BAD:- Not open world.  Series of linked map areas.- Too short with very linear gameplay.- No voice-acting. Really could have done with it.- Only a very few optional quests.  Needed a few more at least.AND THE ORDINARY:* Needed more environment interaction with containers and searchable dead bodies to give the proper feel of an RPG.* A few more vendors would have been nice.  But theres just enough to sell old or buy new items.VERDICT:Shadowrun Returns is a really polished game.  For what it is, its a solid buy.  Built on a tight kickstarter budget it was designed to re-boot the franchise back to the video game format.  It has a very strong story with a neat twist.  Some great writing, complex RPG character building and  turn-based tactical combat with many possible choices.  One of the best features of the game is how it uses the isometric engine to make the sequences in cyberspace as relevant as the tactical combat.However the lack of an (even semi) open-world and voice-overs resulted in an incomplete experience for me personally.  Maybe I wanted too much from this first outting; more of an open-world where places could be visited, more NPCs to talk to in the background.  Just more padding, to add to the overall atmosphere.  Perhaps even more of a permanent party with more control over their stats.  But that doesnt take away from this first decent effort.Others have said that this feels more like you are taking part in an interactive video novel, a linear story where you are more of a passenger than the driver, like you should tend to feel when playing RPGs.  I agree with this but even for a casual Shadowrun fan like me, its enough to ensure that the franchise is back on PC.  For that I am thankful.All-in-all Shadowrun Returns feels like an entry level adventure.  Thats not a bad thing afterall because it is the first of the latest series, of modern adaptations to PC.  In this the developers have done a great job to make the game accessible, enjoyable, mostly accurate to the pen & paper RPG but most of all, to leave the player wanting more.  Shadowrun Returns sticks to the addage walk before you run and if this is built upon in the follow-on games (Dragonfall and Hongkong), then I wont complain.  As it is I would only recommend playing this if you are after an easy albeit interesting introduction to the world of Shadowrun or if you are a hardcore fan and want to play the current series from this developer, from the beginning.  I would suggest either way that you get this on sale or in a bundle as Ive read that the other titles are superior.  Cant wait to try those out!			"

												Shadowrun Returns is an old-school isometric cRPG in the vein of the classic Fallout games based on, as its title suggests, the Shadowrun franchise; one of the pioneers in the fictional literature best known for combining cyberpunk, magic, urban fantasy and crime elements into this unique lore. Initially started as a pen-and-paper boardgame, it was long “forgotten” by today’s generation or occasionally overshadowed by games such as the widely popular and highly-acclaimed Deus Ex – at least that is how I see it.The gameplay in Shadowrun Returns is similar to many classic cRPGs. You manage a team of up to four Shadowrunners where you can choose from the story’s main characters to use or hire random, more specialised, Shadowrunners which suit your mission’s requirements. Just like in any RPG, you can pick a race and class for your character at the start, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The combat mechanics are turn-based and generally well balanced, resembling the one used in the recently rebooted XCOM franchise by Firaxis Games, thus if you are familiar with it then that is good news because it is solid. In addition, by completing missions or triggering certain events in the story, karma points are earned to be further spent on enhancing your main character’s attributes which include the typical Strength, Intelligence and Charisma, to name a few, seen in most classic RPGs. For instance, investing lots of points into Intelligence allows your character to be highly competent with Decking or Drone Control specialities, or investing a lot into Charisma can unlock specific dialogue conversations to bypass certain key situations in the game (other attributes are used sometimes for exclusive dialogues too). In fact, the game does a good job in making sure the player cannot master all the available attributes, because as the game explains in its tips during loading screens: a jack of all trades is a master of none. As a whole, perhaps one of the key aspects of its gameplay aside from its good turn-based combat is how you can approach the narration by choosing your responses based on what personality you want your character to be like when talking to NPCs. While not all responses follow a choice-and-consequence pattern, some do actually have an impact on how things develope; and Shadowrun Returns provides a wide range of opportunities. Ultimately, this also increases the replayability of the game a great deal. One last addition is The Matrix which is like a cyberworld used by Deckers to hack into systems. It is an interesting concept but feels a bit underdeveloped as it can feel a bit of a chore most of times.The art direction in Shadowrun Returns is at the very least appealing. The backgrounds, which do vary, are nicely drawn and the colour pallets used fit with Shadowrun’s universe and its cyberpunk roots, making it easily one of the best looking traditional isometric games out there.  The neon light effects used are also something to praise it for since they bring the game’s world to life, despite the lack of NPCs roaming the streets. Unfortunately, the character models, including their animations, are about the only things which look visually mediocre in this rather attractive game, almost making it look like it was ported from a mobile game. Moreover, Shadowrun Returns also boasts a brilliant soundtrack with a couple of memorable tracks, such as the one from the main menu (“Return of the Sixth World”) and “Puppet Masters”, which fit with the cyberpunk vibes of the game. Sure, while this soundtrack does sound slightly different to the one from the original Shadowrun game on SNES, it still sounds cool.Without a shadow (no pun intended) of a doubt, Shadowrun Returns’ strongest aspect is its narration with its great character development. Whilst it takes a bit of time at the beginning to get to like (or despise) individuals you meet, eventually you will be surprised by how many who become your companions or allies will quickly turn out as memorable characters by the end with who you can at least sympathise. Starting off as a simple detective story in the style of Jack The Ripper which progressively deepens and deviates from just a simple detective case to solve later on, the “Dead Man’s Switch” story in Shadowrun Returns is mostly solid, even though it sorrowfully turns into a Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy) type of story in the last quarter of the journey. While it might not completely ruin the endgame experience, that latter part personally left me with a sour taste in my mouth. Despite featuring no voice acting, this does not ruin the experience either since it allows you to use your own imagination on how characters are supposed to sound like in the story. As a result, it might require a bit more effort and dedication to read some of its pompous written dialogues, and this will certainly not be everyone’s cup of tea.Shadowrun Returns has some glarying imperfections though. Being an extremely linear (pretty much most of it is on rails) and story-driven game, it lacks any sense of exploration due to its contained maps and minimal interactions with their environments. This is something which might frankly turn off quite a number of RPG fans, old-school or contemporary. Clicking on certain hotspots, found only intermittently around places, usually pop up a text-box describing what the character is observing, but these are indeed very few throughout the game’s journey. For a text-heavy game, this aspect of interaction seems like a lost opportunity for further enriching the experience. On top of that, once a mission is completed or the area is cleared, in most cases there is no way to revisit an area afterwards. For a completionist, it is crucial to check everything prior to proceeding to the next area. The lack of a deep character customisation is another aspect that will not please every RPG fan out there since it is very basic and only allows you to choose from premade character models. Additionally, there is also no inventory customisation/management for your companions either which can cause some annoyances when planning your tactics prior or during combat.  One further frustration with the game’s design is its tendency to occasionally lock the player into combat even when everyone in the area is eliminated. This results in wasted time trying to move your team to the next objective location on the map as it is agonisingly slow due to its turn-based mechanics. And lastly, as much as the writing is top-notch, the game can sometimes drown you with its longwinded expositions from time to time which can be underwhelming especially for those looking to jump into action more often.In conclusion, Shadowrun Returns is an adequate and faithful entry to the franchise, albeit a limited game, that should please any cRPG, cyberpunk/fantasy fans and even book readers out there to some degree. While it can honestly feel shallow in places, its stellar writing, good narration, memorable cast of characters, distinctive art direction and competent XCOM-like gameplay should keep most people invested in its relatively short 10+ hours campaign, even if its story loses some of its early charm near the end. This, however, remains a borderline recommendation as many things could have been done to further improve the game as a RPG since it can feel a bit basic. To get most out of it is to always remind yourself that it is a very story-driven experience foremost, so any notions of open-world or high-budget production values in the manner of The Elder Scrolls should be dismissed, otherwise you will be disappointed by your own misconceptions. The best way to describe Shadowrun Returns is like reading a long, but relatively good book (that will not really blow you away) accompanied by solid gameplay elements to justify it as a game -- because honestly, it is not too far from being no more than a visual novel.

												High fantasy, cuberpunk and a film noir style that makes this a great game.It is a turn based role-playing game from a popular tabletop game ""shadowrun"".The game come with one campaign ""Dead Man's Switch"" that got 10 to 12 hours gameplay.But when youre are done playing that one you simple can make or download a other story on the steamworkshop.The only problem i have seen there is that you need ""Shadowrun: Dragonfall"" for some of the downloaded story's.But thats a simple matter of looking for other story's.Combat is rough, sometimes a near dead experions.You need to find cover and try to use youre team togehter to kill the enemy.Sometimes you even need to plan your staps or use a decker ""hacker"" to kill the secerty or turrets.After a battle you feel like you have done someting but if combat ends youre life dont come back so you need to still watch out so you dont die.There is so mutch to tell about this game but all i have to said.Dont wait mutch longer and give it a try.I give this game 8/10 "

												I was a big fan of the genesis version of this game and old fallout series. This game seems to combine both, but it doesn't.The game is very linear, with no options to go back or visit previous places.. All the chat options are meaningless, leaving to the same course. Even the special ones, that you can acquire with 'etiquette' are useless most of the time, useful only a few times to get a bit more money as rewards. Besides, it seems all the etiquettes are used not more than once during the entire game.The gameplay is annoying, with a lot of delay to execute actions. They made a lot of options for classes but you end up not feeling like exploring it. It's like they made a cool framework for a game but forgot to invest in the game itself. Did I already said it's very linear?On the other side, the story is worth paying attention, it could lead to a great 90's investigation movie. I finished the game and don't feel to ever play it again. If you expect even a bit of what I thought it would be, don't buy this game. I'm sorry :(			"

												I was looking for something to tie me over until the release of a game I'm waiting for and so I decided to give Shadowrun a try.It is amazing! As I am someone who plays for story and characters, I was absolutely smitten by the writing. It's not so much the plot, but the little things that make this title superb. Dialogue, descriptions, and the mechanics of their delivery. Some people may not enjoy this much text, but I delight in it. At this point I am 8.5 hours into the game, and I cannot get enough. In addition to the writing, combat is also enjoyable. I'm not a power-player so my builds may not be efficient, but I appreciate the game allowing me to develop my character the way I see fit in terms of role-playing, and still have fun fighting. Once I am done with the campaign, I will be sure to check out the authoring tools. At this stage I might just be inspired to try creating a story of my own.			"

Shadowrun ReturnsExperienceWhen I was a little boy, I remember a tabletop roleplaying game my friend had. It had so interesting looking manual, I couldnt stop browsing it. It had pictures, formulas, almost nude cyborg chicks, mages, lot of guns and swords. It had orcs, elfs, humans, dwarfs, gnomes, giants and minotaurs. My little mind was blown away. I was so excited, I couldnt stop browsing. Time passed and memories faded. I was a teenager and girls were much more entertaining, than a tabletop roleplaying game. Roleplaying games were nerdy thing to do - girls were the cool thing, and you get to kiss them. You can kiss a rpg manual sure, it just taste like a paper.Not so long ago, I saw Shadowrun Returns in Steam Store. Something clicked. I had this indescribable feeling in my stomach. It felt so strange and familiar at the same time, I didnt know what to do actually. My mind went to some kind of automated state, and my mouse pointer hovered over the BUY - button. 30 minutes later, I was playing the game.UniverseShadowrun Returns is set in an alternate future in which magic returned to the world in 2012. Its cyberpunk themed. High fantasy meets science-fiction. Shadowrunners are the elite criminals for hire. They do your dirty work, for a wealthy payment, ofcourse. Cyberspace, omnipresent computer networks, genetic engineering and cyberware are reality.Gameplay Shadowrun Returns is using isometric view, and you get use cover like in XCOM. Gameplay is fluent and fun. You have many races to choose from, and lot of interesting classes. My first playthrough Im using a rigger. You are basicly an engineer with 2 droids to use and control. Im using shotguns and most of my points are in intelligence, drone control and drone combat. Partysize is four, and you have tons of choices. You hire your party members to every missions. Im usually using me ( as a rigger) , a mage, ranged specialist, and a shaman. Enemies vary alot, and story line is amazing. Its so fun, and entertaining. You can create your own campaigns and upload them to Steam. There are many good custom campaigns to download. This game is gonna entertain you a long time. Length of the original campaign is 15-20 hours, and gameplay is linear.I recommend Shadowrun Returns to all isometric rpg freaks.			"

TL;DR at BottomIf you enjoyed this review,consider giving it a thumbs up!8/10Recommended PurchaseBetween the CracksShadowrun Returns is a cRPG that was successfully kickstarted and has made its way to steam. The game is set in a cyberpunk world where risk takers, known as shadowrunners, undertake dangerous jobs for whoever pays the most. The game has no multiplayer but instead focuses on its strong singleplayer story and even has steam workshop support so that people can create their own stories and share them with others. Shadowrun Returns is a reboot of an old franchise on SNES going by the same name. This reboot truly sets a new standard for cRPG's with its phenomenal storytelling and graphics that really immerse you in the world of cyberpunk Seattle. The lesson is this - the game is rigged. The cards are stacked. The dice are loaded. It's the same as it always was.-HarlequinShadowruns combat is turn based and, as is usual in the genre, in order to perform any action you require AP. You start the game with 2 points of AP and about halfway through the main story you upgrade to 3 AP. The combat in Shadowrun is pretty usual and there really isn't much special about it. You play as one of 6 classes but really they only affect how you start off early on in the game. Something pretty cool about Shadowrun is that you can build your character however you want regardless of class and your build will still be viable. There are a handful of main skills you can upgrade, such as charisma and strength, and then under those you have at least four or five sub stats such as melee weapons or rifles. The problem here is, at least in the main story, that there are so many stats to upgrade that you can only get about halfway through the skill tree before the game is over. I did almost every side objective there was and I still only got about 3/4 of the way through some of the trees. The game is incredibly linear too so that there is very little you can do in the way of exploration or side objectives. Sometimes you can pass stat checks so that you can avoid combat or haggle price when selling an item but overall the stats really don't feel like they matter in most cases. In some cases, like upgrading rifles or submachine guns you can unlock new abilities to use in combat on those weapons but overall the upgrades from the skill trees are pretty boring. Some of the classes feel really unique and different but others are just typical RPG classes. The rigger, for example, is a class completely focused on controlling your own robots that can do things like sneak through ducts and ambush enemies. Other classes are just basic mages or soldiers and I feel that, while the unique classes are certainly cool, they're overshadowed by the more basic ones. The most interesting part of the game was when you get to hire mercenaries to go on runs with you. You put together a team of runners who come with you on missions and, for the most part you get to pick who you want to come with you, but in some cases you are forced to take main characters. Generally the gameplay is average for a game like this, but I feel they managed to pull it off in a way that, while getting stale after a while, still is respectable for the genre.""Allow me to share a truth with you, Shadowrunner. The truly powerful do nothing themselves unless they absolutely have to.""-Hans BrackhausNow lets talk story. Shadowrun is quite short for a game in the same genre as Fallout 2 and Wasteland but I feel the story is compelling enough to make up for the poor length. You play as one of the aforementioned shadowrunners and you're in your apartment when you get a recording from your friend, Sam Watts. He tells you that if you are hearing this then he's dead.However, he has set up 100,000 nuyen (The games currency) wired on a dead-mans switch to be transferred to you if you can find his killer. You accept the job, be it for loyalty, money, or a mixture of the two and set out to look for the man that murdered one of the few you called friend. You journey through this gorgeous cyberpunk Seattle and as you do the game starts pulling you in and immersing you into this dog-eat-dog world. The environments are so incredibly detailed that you can't help but to want to know more about them. The game, however, doesn't really give you much backstory on the world and tries to keep you focused on the main storyline. The first half of the story you're looking for the cyberpunk equivalent of Jack the Ripper and for the latter half you have to stop an invasion by a horde of monstrous spirit bugs that cannot die. Every character you meet will make you care about keeping them alive and doing right by them or, at the very least, get you to want to learn more about them. Even though it's incredibly linear the story itself is very unique and fits in perfectly with the settings and characters in Shadowrun.TL;DRShadowrun Returns shows that combat isn't everything and an intriguing story and artwork to match can be just as importantIf you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming "

												SR is a good way to kill about 10 hours or less; though I expected it to be longer.  Because of this, you might want to get it on sale.  The story-driven gameplay has a limited, if not non-existant, replay value... and you can't really stretch it out.  Well, you could make it longer by getting up from your keyboard between turns and spending that time with your family, but no one wants that.  Especially your family.The skill trees don't seem very important to success.  I put every karma point I ever got in dodge and/or shotgun... only.  And, still I blindly walked through the game without any actually difficult combat - which you'd find odd if you compared my random clicking to any real strategy.  I even destroyed the turrets that you're supposed to have to hack, because my dodge was too high for them to hit me (and then the game forces you to hack them to proceed anyway).  Most items are also pretty pointless... you can just buy one really good weapon, a couple of medkits (or just put a healer on your team), and forget the rest.The option of buying all that cyberware is confusing, because there doesn't seem to be a way to repeatedly take missions for money.  I can imagine some people making the game more difficult by blowing all their money on gear and then not being able to hire a proper team.  I only recall seeing one 'bonafide' side-mission, and the way I resolved it seemed to aggrevate the mission-giver at the Seamstress Union to the point where he quit talking to me - which I take it to mean that he wasn't intrinsic to the play mechanics and probably wouldn't have given me more missions even if he'd stayed.  It really seems like the player is stuck to the rails of the story and that there's no real economy in the game.Another thing about the gear:  Some items like the leg options only seemed to be slottable on one side of my body, though there was no apparent indicator that they were either an upgrade (I already hade a cyber leg on that side of the body) or are somehow restricted to one side.  I'm thinking this is a bug, but the game's not long enough, nor are the gear upgrades important enough, for it to matter.Other than not properly supporting my native 2560x1080 resolution (1920x1080 was the max, and that gets stretched when in fullscreen mode), the game works really well under Linux.

												The good: The setting is great, the story/characters are interesting, and there is a lot of flexibility in playstyle (being a mage feels different from being a decker, which feels different from just shooting up everything with an assault rifle). It's also a reasonably pretty game. The graphics are a little cartoony, but with enough detail to let you enjoy the dystopian cyberpunk future theme. The bad: It's extremely simple/easy, painfully linear, there's no voice acting, and while conversations give you the impression that your choices matter, the game appears largely devoid of meaningful consequences. I'd call it a ""video graphic novel,"" except the writing isn't even all that good, and (despite some more positive reviews) there's not even that much writing to begin with. It's also short. Really short.Bottom line: This is a simple game that would feel rewarding if it were a free mobile game instead of pretending to be a full-fledged PC RPG. If you can get it on sale for a couple of bucks, it might be worth it as a gateway to the superior Shadowrun games that follow, but as is, this is not a $15 game.The ""crime/detective"" themes try to make it feel like an old point and click adventure game, except your options are so limited that it feels like a ""mystery"" designed for a 5 year old to solve. Despite the emphasis on ""tactical combat,"" fights tend towards the easy. Resource management is a joke because you should always have plenty of money to buy equipment and a full high-level team, so there's no additional ""should I get better armor or a new gun"" type of trade-off. The result is boredom. The game spends too much time in the turn-based combat mode (even between discrete combat encounters), so simply walking from one fight to the next has to be done individual party member at a time.

												This game was a suprise for me. I did not now about Shadowrun universe before, and i was kind of dumbstruck about the setting. Think DnD with cyberpunk. This alone made me buy this game, and this beauty did not disappoint me. Combat is like the X-COM Enemy Within. Not detailed as much but still, enjoyable. The campaign is interesting (though not as much as dragonfall) and you can download more campaigns through steam workshop. There are many campaigns there and some of them are very, very good. Have I mentioned the setting is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome?This is an awesome game and it deserves it's pricetag.			"

												I really enjoyed the elements brought into the game from the RPG books.  They have done a great job merging the different types of combat, and interaction with the world even though the game sets you to run a specific story I found myself not minding the limited scope.  Normally I go for action-rpg combat, but this game manages to still have good flow with the turn based combat.  Overall I'd say it's a very well put together game especially for the price.			"

Posted: August 10, 2015
												So let's start this review by criticizing the story-module they offer with the game, since its the only story provided with the game and while yes you can acquire others from the Workshop, you'd expect something more solid, At this time I have about 10 hours I believe put into this game and with that I was able to start a first game, went maybe a quarter to a third of the way thru, than decide to restart with a different character and finish it... all in 10 hours, its very short overall, and the logevity of the game depended solely on the players themselves building new stories, which is not a good idea, since players didn't program the game or get paid for it, their work will most likely not be up to par... typically, but in this case, I am not really sure of the quality of the module provided with the game.Look at the Deadman's Switch story, effectively it has alot in common with Robert E. Charette Secrets of Power Shadowrun Novel series, you have a Sam Watts, instead of Sam Verner, heck you see one of Verner's buddies in there too, also with one of your runners named Coyote, somehow a connection to Sam Verner, however indirectly this time. Ultimately like that Novel series you are a man (or woman) on a hunt, in the Secrets of Power it was Sam Verner on the hunt for his sister, in here it was your Shadowrunner on the hunt for Sam Watts murderer, and in the end just like with the novel you end up dealing with some creepy spirits and it became the main issue to deal with at the end of the story. Frankly I am shocked nobody else saw how they merely copied various elements from the Secrets of Power novel series and recreated a cheaper story based on such elements but of far more mediocre result and with a far too cliché ending for the genre. So story wise the single module provided is a enormous let down.Now for the Gameplay, well its not too bad, but felt fairly limited, you have effectively a single Shadowrunner you can buid and equip, those you can hire are pre-made entirely and you can't even modify their gear, shouldn't you be able to buy weapons and stuff and loan it to them or something? It would make sense... rather you are stuck with whatever they want. Also they don't level up along with you, but as the game advance the entire list of potential runners is updated at a few spots in the storyline, also you only have two runners that have any connection to the storyline mostly, those two are involved in it and one of them is only available for a couple of missions, the other is only available after the first is not available anymore, which mean you never truly feel involved with your crew all too much and they are very much expandable assets. Also a problem is the bits of the story in the Matrix, unless you make your char a Decker, or at least update one to be a Decker on the side of anything else you want it, well you are going to have issues, the few spots where you have to deal with the Matrix would have to rely on pre-made chars that you don't have any choices over the build for, which can be a serious issue. They shouldn't have made the Matrix runs a necessity if you only have one custom char and that char might not be a Decker.Another issue is the game sometimes bugs and those bugs can be dire, at one point I wasn't able to do anything anymore during a fight, I couldn't attack or anything, so I had to close the game and load my auto-save, only happened once, yet its still annoying.

												A captivating turn based game, the like of which I've not played since Fallout 1 & 2. The story's amazing (heck, I just played through the game in one sitting, was worth it!), just wish there was voice acting for it as well. Little snag I had was that it sometimes would keep you in combat for too long, meaning it would be a hassle to move your troops from point A to point B once everything in the vicinity is killed off. Other than that, no complaints about the game. Time to play the other installations!			"

												I've heard ""this game is like XCOM."" Scratch that, because it's nothing like XCOM. Sure there are some minor similarities in battle mechanics but that's where the similarities end. This game is good in it's own right. You've got a pretty interesting plot about finding your old friend's killer to make a couple of bucks. From there the story goes down a rabbit hole to uncover the culprit and turns into quite the adventure. This game isn't necessarily about saving the world or some greater good. You're pretty low on cash and a lot of times I compromised my morals to make a couple bucks. Mercenaries don't come cheap in this run down futuristic, magic tech world and we've all gotta eat. That being said although this game is short, for an RPG you'll end up taking a lot of jobs and get to meet a few brothers in arms. There are many characters you'll encounter but aside from the handful you actually get to know a bit most are for fighting purposes.There are numerous skills to customize your character with. When you complete missions or do good deals it rewards you with karma points pretty frequently to upgrade whatever you like. I suggest finding a particular specialty and sticking with it. When I started my I decided I'd be a decker with focus on melee skills. Decker was a good choice as there are a couple of situations later in the game that require that particular skill set. But I soon found that most enemies carry guns and you know what they say about bringing a knife to a gun fight. Charisma was an important skill as you can get more money by charming the pants off of people using your words. This also had a couple of layers to it as you learn new etiquette surprisingly it's the choices I don't expect that pop up in dialogue. Like most strategy RPGs having a diverse range of companions helps in all missions but you'll end up hiring the same people who complement your style. Battles require a bit of strategy as AI isn't stupid. If you cluster all your forces in one spot an enemy will likely bomb your group. That being said you'll have more of the ""kill all foes"" variety of missions. How you do it is up to you. This game is good but I would have liked to see more locations or other town like places you could meet runners in between missions. There are conversations referencing other places in the Matrix but sadly you never get to experience them. There were also a couple of bugs that froze my game during missions. They were random and seemed to fix it self after a restart but saving often helps. Hopefully all these issues are resolved in the Dragonfall sequel but in itself it's an alright game and you should try it if you're into tactical, futuristic RPGs.			"

												Why does this keep happening to me? And by this I'm referring to the fact I can't seem to play a game where I can say, in clear-cut manner ""this is good or this is bad"", but always have to keep a balancing scale in my head and actively weighing positives and negatives against each other. Well, in one more attempt to remain consistent such is the case with Shadowrun Returns so let's get down to it, chummer.First thing first – it's GREAT to see Shadowrun make a proper return to the world of video games following its less than stellar last entry. That does come with a caveat or two because Returns was funded thanks to a Kickstarter project and this fact seeps through almost every aspect of the game, but we'll get around to that in due time. If there is one major Achilles heel worth noting it's the fact the entire game feels like a very light venture into the world of Shadowrun, but also one that makes only a token effort in explaining inner workings and setting itself to the uninitiated. If you don't know much about Shadowrun you'll get a brief 101; only for parts pertinent to what you're dealing with and delivered to you at a snail's pace primarily through loading screen text. This goes beyond matters of fluff and extends to systems themselves  - it's a borderline RPG-lite experience compared to what many have come to expect these days, eschewing things like looting fallen bodies and any great interaction with the world that surrounds you aside from few mechanics-related interactable points. This goes hand-in-hand with very light-weight tutorials which you'll have to actively seek instead of them being naturally introduced to ease you into the game. This may or may not be a relevant sticking point depending on your level of familiarity no only with Shadowrun but also with RPGs in general, though.To keep everything in perspective it is important to note this game was not made on a multi-million dollar budget and that should exempt it from some of the problems, even if things such as sometimes unresponsive functions and somewhat uninspired takes on certain elements like implementation of the Matrix remain annoying throughout the game. Speaking of which, as much as I love to see everything ranging from Adepts to Deckers presented not all Archetypes were created equal as far as unique selling points go and neither were Etiquettes aka your social ""specializations"" which unlock specific options in dialog. Game really could have used more of these options in general, but I guess it functions acceptably well with this overall linear structure of the game taking you from location to location as story demands and not letting you re-visit older ones, local quasi-hub notwithstanding.That was enough nagging about the game, where's the good stuff? Returns is not a bad game and you may have noticed I gave it a thumb up recommending it despite my incessant complaining in paragraphs above. Why? Because it's a still a competent RPG with great flavor and decent character building options. It smartly offsets the fact you only customize the main character by letting you choose who to take with you on missions from a roster of contracts, quality ranging depending on how deep your pockets are. Even though it kinda takes a while to kick in, game's story certainly delivers on everything from standard Shadowrunner fare to more... out there revelations and twists you will probably not see coming, but which still have absolute basis in existing lore.  Relatively short by RPG standards, but succinctly to the point and with no filler to waste your time. Characters? They definitely take a backseat to events unfolding although I have no doubt you'll find favorites among them.Last advice, chummer – never EVER cut a deal with a dragon if you value your sorry existence.

												Shadowrun Returns (SRR) is a story-driven linear RPG with turn-based tactical combat. You play a Shadowrunner (something like a private detective or a hired special agent) who's thrown into the investigation of an ex-colleague's murder only to find himself wrapped in a much greater plot...Review DetailsFor those not familiar: ""Shadowrun is a science fantasy theme set in a near-future fictional universe in which cybernetics,magic and fantasy creatures co-exist. It combines genres of cyberpunk, urban fantasy and crime, with occasional elements of conspiracy fiction, horror and detective fiction."" --Wikipedia. I would add the ""Noir"" keyword in that passage, as well.SRR is best played with a mouse and is entirely built into a third person isometric engine, just like the original Fallout games. The visuals (scenery, character portraits etc) are very well made and capture the atmosphere of the world, resonating in its depth and mystery. The music and SFX are just OK, and note that the game has no voice-over at all. The mechanics of the game are solid but they could use some more balancing and polishing. What annoyed me most is that the game tends to ""lock"" you in turn-based combat mode, even when all enemies are downed, until you reach a specific map location. Also, the stat-system (the so-called ""Karma"" points) is kinda inflated, not all skill-trees are well structured, and many of the items or skills you acquire become obsolete quite fast as you get better ones. The game is not very difficult: It took me 15 hours to complete on Normal difficulty and I only failed and had to reload a couple of times. You can quick-save/load anytime with F5/F9.The plot itself is interesting and keeps you motivated to see what's next. Each time you think you're close to the ending, something more pops up, throwing you into a bigger plot! Role-playing is quite varied and there's usually multiple ways to progress in the story which, however, is fully linear. However, I played the game only once, so I am not sure if the consequences are really that different if you pick other dialogue options... Most of the characters are memorable and well developed but I think that the lack of voice-over kinda limits their profoundness. Finally, I like how the game borrows elements from classic books/games, e.g. Gibson's Neuromancer or the Fallout universe, and how it renders stereotype characters, e.g. the ""corrupt cop"", the ""badass waitress"", the ""taciturn bouncer"" etc. Well written!VerdictIn overall, SRR is a decent game, mostly recommend if you're into that theme (cyberpunk) and/or that game genre (story-rich RPG with tactical combat). There's not something really special about it, but it was surely worth my time! If I were to rate it, I'd put it around 70-80%. They say that the second game, Dragonfall, is much better than SRR, so I got high hopes for that one!			"

												Shadowrun is the iconic cyberpunk RPG franchise from the 80's. RPG fans might also remember GURPS which had a cyberpunk module, and also the Neuromancer novel was a hit at that time. But it was Shadowrun that was succesfully converted into videogames, with two different games on the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo that a lot of RPG fans seem to remember. This game is a homage to these two games, rebooting the electronic franchise in a memorable way.This game style is pretty old school. You wander around places talking to people, searching for clues, learning information and finding items, just like an adventure game. Occasionally you will have to fight, tactical RPG style. You have action points to spend and got to position the characters wisely. Nothing new here, but it just works. All the reading provide immersion and the fights feel quick enough not to bore you.You have a single character, which actually helps role playing. The kind of character you build will influence how you will play the game. There are some decisions that depend on what class you are playing, so it feels great to make a difference when your skills are needed. You control other characters in fights too, you can recruit people and some people stick with you for a bit while the story is being told.This new franchise is compatible with GNU/Linux systems, and it plays very well on my Intel HD3000 onboard graphics. Graphics are simple, but well done. It feels like a classic game, but so much easier to get into in comparison with the older siblings.I recommend this to anyone who is interested in cyberpunk and enjoys some immersion and story telling. RPG fans are going to have fun building a character, the system is interesting and fresh. I recommend reading about character building before playing, unless you enjoy learning the hard way that going full hybrid won't work well.			"

												A terrific game. I was a huge fan of Shadowrun in my youth during the 80's and enjoyed playing it table top. As a video game it is a really good immersive feel. I am not a huge fan of so much reading usually and would have enjoyed more voice acting but this was a fun game non the less.			"

												Cyberpunk, Fantasy, Dystopia, Quality writing, and turn-based isometric gameplay. In other words... it's a cross between Deus Ex and the old Fallout games (1/2). Neat!I heard that this was a game series that existed many years ago, but I had never heard of it before playing this. No matter, since I didn't need any extra backstory to understand what was going on here. And what I saw was quite good. :DTook about 10-12 hours to beat the main storyline, but you can also create your own campaigns. Many have done so, and you can find them on the workshop to add a little more to this game. There's also a DLC that i've yet to play, and i'll put a review of that separately when I do. Anyway, I love Deus Ex and Fallout - two of my favorite franchises of all time. So naturally I have much to like about this game. Good storytelling, good gameplay, and a wide variety of choice and replayability options. Plus mods and more content on the way.Have fun! I did. :3Edit: Played Dragonfall. It's even better than the main game is. If you get Shadowrun Returns and like it, then get Dragonfall too. It is worth it. ^_^			"

												A cyberpunk-themed old-school turn-based RPG? Color me excited!Shadowrun has great graphical asthetics and feel, it plays well and the written dialogue and story is fantastic. The turn-based combat may be the weakest portion of the game, it's rather basic but it isn't bad and does what it needs to do.If you're into this sort of genre then you will be sucked into this world.*Update*The Dragonfall DLC Campaign is HIGHLY recommended! Far better than Dead Man's Switch in terms of story and (imo) characters. Be sure to pick up both!			"

												A fun short game (beat it in 10 hours) but an overall disappointment.  The level up/stats system is laughable -- I played a troll who has high maximum stats thinking I'd have the pleasure of making a strong brute of a hero.  Alas, the campaign is so short you only gain enough experience (or karma in this case) to get slightly passed halfway.  Huge letdown.Also, when hiring mercenaries, you'd think they would be able to hack computers/open locks for you -- they cannot.  It all relies on your character's skill set.Being able to hire said mercenaries also allows you to get a taste for the different classes/races/weapons/tools and removes any sort of replayability.  The storyline is very linear.The in/out of combat system is finicky as well, and I had to reload more than a few times to fix.Not worth $16.  Thank you Humble Bundle.			"

												That's the stuff, chummer.Game has its flaws, it's short, it's linear. Funny thing is, it's not even using the full potential of what content Devs created (for instance etiquettes).I think Harebrained Schemes (wtf name right?) were too much confident into their mod editor and community.Since then, 10s of mods have been released, I didn't play any so far, so cannot discuss quality. Fact is, you can appreciate quality of a mod by a simple glance when it comes to gameplay/system/ui/textures modifications, but it's very hard to tell when mods are oriented into story-telling with a simple synopsis.BUT, despite all its downfalls, let it be clear: writing is top notch!Harebrained Schemes also showed that they are a very capable studio with DragonFall Director's cut (imo best game of 2014) and that they deserve support.Soundratck is neat, and couple of tracks are full gems (Memory, Double Cross, That's the stuff, Dark Alley...)Oui, oui, mon ami!

												I bought some donuts for a sidequest I didn't even know existed until I went and talked to a cop who wanted some donuts... This game is too linear.This game bored me to death. Read other reviews because I don't even want to think about all the things I really dislike about this game. I was looking for something akin to ""Arcanum"" but got some empty world game with buggy controls and pointless quests. Hacking is pointless. Everything seems pointless in this game because of how incredibly linear it is. I'd try to do my own thing, but that's often how I'd end up with quest items (like donuts) before I even knew the quest existed.			"

Posted: November 15, 2014
												Man, I really REALLY wanted to like this game...A big part of that is because I think the world of Shadowrun is an awesome setting for a game, I mean I've never played the tabletop game but I've heard loads about it (primarily from watching Counter Monkey) and I think the idea of mixing a Gibson-esque Cyberpunk setting with elements of more traditional western fantasy (Orks, Elves, Dragons, what have you) is a really cool concept. I'm one of those people who could never really get into games/movies/books about western medievil fantasy settings, they just always seemed kinda boring by design, seen one seen 'em all y'know? Skyrim is one of the only games with that sort of Tolkien-esque world that was able to hold my attention, and that was only because the Nordic stuff was able to overshadow it and make for a more interesting world (Snowy peaks > green fields, just sayin'). But Cyberpunk? I ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE cyberpunk!I love the idea of speculating about  a darker future, how technology has changed us for better or for worse, the ethics and practicalities of cybernetics and artificial intelligence, it's just got so much more meat to it. And when you take all that AND THEN add magic and elves and♥♥♥♥♥♥ You've got the potential for some really interesting ideas and stories, and I'd absolutely love to see a game do this setting justice... but this is just not it.First, I'd like to disclaim this by clarifying that I am not entirely versed in the Shadowrun lore, I don't know how true to the books this game is, so I won't judge it one way or another in that respect. I will however say that had I not known anything at all about Shadowrun prior to playing this game I don't think I'd have gotten much from it. Things like the Sixth World and the Great Awakening are referenced but nobody ever explicitly explains what they are or how the dynamics of this world work. Why did magic come back? Where did it go? Where did all the elves, orks, and trolls come from? Who are S.T.A.R.S? What's a Doc-Wagon? None of these things are addressed, and while I understand that this is a game made for and by longtime Shadowrun fans, and as such there's going to be references that only long-time fans will necessarily understand, I get that, but It's not a good sign when I feel like I need to crack a players guide for the tabletop game just to understand what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, and that's how I felt while playing much of this game. Also, the writing in this game, or atleast the base campaign, is very... eh.I Mean it wasn't bad, it all makes sense, there were no glaring plot-holes or laughably bad exposition, but that's just the thing, it's very... okay. It's not what I'd call bad, but save a few stand out-moments it wasn't all that exceptional either. The idea of building a story around your dead friend hiring you to solve his murder from beyond the grave is an interesting idea but I've seen it done before, and far better. Also, while I definitely think that a noir-style crime drama would be the perfect framework to explore the world of Shadowrun, I just don't feel like the story presented lived up to the setting's potential. But again, this only refers to the Dead Man's Switch base campaign, I understand that many fan-made campaigns acted as a far better realizations of the Shadowrun setting, but I don't really think it's fair to include user-made content in a review like this.I think one of the major things that kills this game for me is the fact that it tries to be a throwback to old-school CRPGs, but it's completely linear, and doesn't give you the kind of freedom one would come to expect from a CRPG. There are very few optional missions or objectives to speak of, and while there are multiple ways to complete many of the objectives, much of the time it feels less like a choice, and more like a calculation (I recall one situation where a dialog choice asked me if I wanted to pay this guy 100 creds for what he knows or 50 creds. No speech check, no skills or disciplines involved, flat question of ""would you like to pay more money or less for the same information?""). The Dialogue trees in general just feel pretty cut and dry to me, very ""nice response/jerk response/witty response,"" much of the time, and it just comes off as boring to me. I do however think that going text only instead of recording some half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥voice acting was definitely the right thing to do, in my mind CRPGs have always been about replicating the experience of reading a good book in the context of an interactive environment, and when a game like this adds unnecessary voice acting it sometimes kills the experience, at least for me, and since quite a bit of the actual written dialogue is pretty damn good despite the plot in which it takes place, I am glad they went this route.The turn-based combat is actually one aspect of this game that I thought was pretty good, I mean it's pretty much XCOM light but that's okay, it functions very well and doesn't feel out of place in the setting or genera. I do feel like melee weapons were made somewhat under-powered, which is disappointing to me as I decided to play a Street Samurai specializing in melee and shotguns. Also, this game seems to have some kind of percentage skewing problem in which you seemed to miss ""70% chance"" shots 80% of the time, but that might have just been my rotten luck. Other then that the combat seems to work just fine for what it is.Another aspect of this game that I found a very mixed bag is the aesthetic, the backgrounds for one thing look fantastic, they're all hand-drawn in the classic CRPG style, and they do the seemingly impossible task of making the aesthetic of a grimy, neon soaked, cyberpunk world look beautiful (all-be-it with a little too much blue-saturation for my tastes). The in-game models on the other hand... not so much. I understand, this game was kick-started, they were on a budget, and as someone who doesn't have a very beefy PC I am rather grateful that they didn't emphasize graphical fidelity and turn the game into a performance hog, but that said, I do think they could have put a little more polish into making the in-game models match the backgrounds a little better, as it stands they just kinda clash and it creates a very odd contrast, it just doesn't look very good.I have other criticisms I'd like to level at this game, the character customization was a little lacking for my tastes (especially the outfit choices), some of the character portraits look better then others, and cyberware is drastically underplayed (which is one of my favorite aspects of the cyberpunk setting, so that's especially disappointing to me), but at this point I'm nearing the level of nit-picking so I think it's about time to wrap this up. I feel like a total jerk right now, because this is a kickstarted game I'm talking about here, it's a miracle this game was even made at all, and as a budding Shadowrun fan myself I am glad that it exists and is introducing the setting to other people. However at the end of the day the mark of a good game is whether or not I feel truly engaged in it, feel self-driven in playing and enjoying it, and look forward to playing it some more as soon as I power it down, and Shdaowrun Returns just didn't do it for me.I have been informed that Dragonfall fixed many of the problems I had with Returns however, so I do intend to give that a go when I can, and I really hope that turns out to be true because Shadowrun deserves a game to truly do it justice, and this just ain't it.

			Does this kickstarter funded revival of a classic 16-bit RPG franchise meet expectations? Reviewed by Trent Please like and subscribe for more reviews, gameplay, and discussions!		

 Kickstarter has proven itself to be an exciting tool for gamers disenchanted with the the games being pushed out be major publishers. Last year Kickstarter exploded with projects promising to revive classic gaming franchises and bring new releases that embrace classic gaming conventions. Shadowrun Returns is one of the first major kickstarter releases to come to market and it's success or failure to impress will inevitably shape gamers trust of the kickstarter. Based on a pen and paper RPG, two completely different Shadowrun titles were released for the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis. The shadowrun universe is a unique combination of high fantasy races like elves and dwarfs and a cyberpunk world. Shadowrun Returns offers an original campaign, turn based tactical combat and a robust editor that allows players to create their own campaign.Your created character has struggled after a shadowrun gone bad and is contacted by one of your old crew members from that run named Sam Watts. The catch is that Sam has been murdered and his message is pre recorded, in it, he offers you 100,00 nuyen if you are able to bring the person who killed him to justice. As it turns out, Sam has been slain by a notorious serial killer, the Emerald City Ripper. The quest to identify the ripper takes you through drug dens, shadowrunner bars, the National Transportation Safety Board, a mental hospital, a cult's worship center and into mega corp territory. The narrative is very noir inspired with its femme fatals, seedy locations and nihilistic denizens. The script is peppered with slang that is simultaneously ridiculous and enriching. This is especially important since Shadowrun Returns features no voice acting. The regulars of the Seamstress Union, your quest hub for much of the game, are usually up for a little chat and even the merchants are on the loquacious side, sharing their personal stories before hocking their wares. Oddly enough, most of the shadowrunners that accompany your character on missions are mute. There are a handful of optional tasks and even fewer optional missions to pad your coffers. It's ultimately a refreshing experience since your character and the supporting cast are fueled solely by their own personal gains and vendettas instead of high-minded, self aggrandizing world saving exploits.Tackling your missions involves navigating isometric maps, extracting information from the locals and of course engaging in turn based tactical combat. Exploring the sections of Seattle that host your missions isn't often rewarding. On occasion you will run across a grenade or a med kit for taking the trouble to look around before chatting with the next NPC that points your party in direction of the critical path. Fortunately, Shadowrun Returns often makes finding the way to your next objective engaging by asking you to so some puzzle solving, detective work and smooth talking. When the need to fight arises, combat starts immediately without any transition screens and props that litter the environment becomes all important cover. The turn based combat will have you analyzing the positioning of your units, managing action points and deciding which skills and spells to use. There are also elements in the environment to take advantage of, Riggers can send their drones through vents and Deckers can enter the Matrix to hack turrets, security cameras and swipe information to fence for funds. Turns in Shadowrun Returns are not governed by stats; there is simply a player phase and an enemy phase which makes streamlines planning. A large emphasis is on ranged combat since firearms are generally more powerful though melee attacks provide secondary effects like taking away a target's action points in addition to health. A wide range of buffs and debuffs can also swing the conditions on the battlefield in your favor.Where much of the difficulty in Shadowrun comes in is through the use of overwhelming numbers. Often enemy encounters are lopsided and several missions have you face down endless waves of enemies until a given task is complete. Careful planning and making use of the environment makes these missions more than manageable. In fact, on the whole, Shadowrun is a bit on the easy side if you build an offense based class. Instead of gaining levels, completing actions earns your character karma. Karma can be spent on stat increases that progressively become more expensive as they increase. In addition there are base stats that must be leveled to level a subset of stats that are associated with that particular stat. All of the other shadowrunners that your character hires are not customizable in any way. While this fits into the lore of Shadowrun, it can make the game more difficult if you choose to play as a specialized support character.The futuristic Seattle rendered in Shadowrun Returns is quintessential cyberpunk with hand painted interiors and cityscapes. The hand-painted aesthetic is very attractive and distinct and most of your surroundings are packed with details.  Most everything not associated with the Mega corporations are dingy and filthy and bathes in neon light. Unfortunately, some of the miliue can feel lifeless since there are few animated assets present. A few particle effects would have gone a long way toward making the streets of Seattle much less static. Characters are very minimalistic and their animations are modest. Detailed character portraits make up for this and do a commendable job communicating some personality. The music is handled by the composers of the original soundtracks for the Genesis and SNES games and as one would expect it has a large electronic influence. It's a catchy soundtrack that pays homage to it predecessor while properly aiding the tone of Returns.  Shadowrun Returns is one of several games that has to shoulder the heavy burden of gamers expectations from Kickstarter funded games and it has held up it's part of those expectations admirably. Harebrained Schemes has delivered several balancing patches and has offered excellent support for Shadowrun Returns and it's quality is quite exceptional. It's cyberpunk noir narrative is highly enjoyable with it's cast of characters motivated by very personal circumstances rather than the need for glory and heroism. Combat is simple but flexible, offering an appreciable degree of options for taking down foes. It's also a bit easy, linear and has a modest presentation but all of this is easily forgiven since it's price is a third of a tiple A game. Shadowrun Returns is an excellent example of what made classic RPGs special while reminding us how far the genre has come. Now, let's hope that Wasteland 2 and Broken Age also impress.			"

												Lacks any real depth or replay value like I was (realistically) hoping for. If you want a good Shadowrun game with replay value, play the Sega Genesis version, on an emulator of course. The game feels so ""look but don't touch"" with how linear it is and the lack of any real exploration that it should have been. Feels like a browser-based flash game and overall a REAL disappointment for people like myself that know how fascinating and fun the world of Shadowrun could and should be.			"

												A solid if streamlined RPG. THe biggest plus point for me was the story. It's well written and had enough depth to keep me keen to discover more.  Combat is straight forward enough and after a few fights you should have the basics mastered even if you have never used this type of turned based fighting before. You willl most often engage in combat as part of a group. Unlike tradidtionl RPG's where you meet characters and they tag along for as long as you need them Shadowrun returns takes a different approach. Most of the characters you encounter will not stick around for more than a quest ot two. They all have thier own agenda's and will not follow meekly in line behind you and your cause. To build up a ""party"" you hire companions from a list. This was a slight drawback for me, party characters did not feel like characters. They have zero dialouge and interaction with your character so feel more like pieces of gear rahter than actual people. All in all thou its a really enjoyable experience. a good 7/10 for my money.

												Fun but short. Fun but a little simplistic. Fun but a bit too limited. The key word here is ""fun"". There's a lot of criticisms you can hurl at this game, after all. 12 hours to complete the game from start to finish with quite a lot of reloading and a few pauzes included isn't all that much for an RPG. The world is location-based and the story is extremely linear with no choice of where to go. Interaction with the world is very low and even loot is unheard of. In short: people expecting a Baldur's Gate experience were extremely disapointed with this game and I can see why.BUT, despite all the short comings, the core gameplay is very solid. Combat feels right, the skill system feels almost perfect, the characters are fun, the story entertaining and the backdrops are beautifully drawn and crisp. What is in the game, is done really well - the game's main weakness is you constantly wishing it was more ... more interactive, more side quests, more freedom, etc.			"

												Took 17 hours to complete.I loved it!There is a LOT of reading. All dialogue, and this game has a lot of story content, is text based.Good for playing 5 min or 5 hours at a time.The combat is Xcom like, graphics and animations are less of a focus though.The world seems well developed, classes seem balanced enough. It's all turn based, which is great for me. There is nothing that happens that you need to respond to in any fixed amount of time. This means you can get up and get a drink in the middle of combat with no trouble, or during a dialogue sequence. You can save at almost any point as well. This helps when you don't know how long you are going to be able to play for.			"

												Even though I absolutely loved Shadowrun Returns, I can't just unconditionally recommend it. This is because you will only be able to properly enjoy this game if you like reading, since this game has a lot of text and no voice acting. But after a short period of getting used to it, it will feel like someone had combined a good book with a fun video game. However, just like a book, this game is very linear. Personally, I didn't really mind that, because I prefer a good, linear story over a crappy one with 30 different endings. It all comes down to personal preference, but if you're like me and don't need constant action to be entertained, this game might be a gem you have yet to discover.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a first installment of the Shadowrun Returns trilogy (followed by Dragonfall and concluded by Hong Kong). A kickstarter success, the project led by Jordan Weisman, the creator of the Shadowrun tabletop role-playing game met its funding goal of $400,000 within 28 hours. The game ultimately had gathered $1,895,772. The first installment in the series comes with one story campaign called “the dead man switch” - which takes about 12 hours to complete. The story itself consists of two distinctive parts: first 4 to 5 hours you're tracking down a serial killer, and the rest 7-8 hours you are fighting crazy doomsday cult. The story concludes with you stopping the invasion... of giant spiritual bugs representing ancient evil. Sigh.The combat is weak too- it is extremely slow, repetitive and plain stupid. The only saving grace is that no predetermined class approach guaranties a lot of freedom in character building (same goes for roleplaying as well). Honestly, the story and combat are pretty weak, but that's not the point. The point- SR R is a prologue, first act, exposition if you will, to one of the best game trilogies in recent years. It misses on story and combat, but it menages to create a feel, to add some context and to set a stage to the amazing second act (Dragonfall), and good third act (Hong Kong) So in conclusion- if you have some time to spare- start at the beginning, and play Shadowrun Returns first, before attempting Dragonfall or Hong Kong. If you don't- go for the Dragonfall and Hong Kong, you cant afford to miss them. They are THAT good. P. S. If you re playing Shadowrun Returns first, then lower your expectations and remember 2 simple things: firstly- its an introduction of the setting, and secondly- it gets better with second and third games in the series.P.P.S. While tracking down serial killer, you come across a suspicious and creepy man at the crime scene. He' s mumbling something about how he loves to strangle kittens and that his mother never loved him. ""Leave him"" says the game, we still have 10-12 hours to investigate these strange murders.10 out of 10, would investigate strange murders again.			"

												I reccommend this game, but only with one big asterisk next to it. This game is good... in potential.Dead Man's Switch is fun, but feels kinda short, and that's really all you get at the onset. The real good of this game is the fact that it's a way to both tell your own stories, run campaigns with numbers attached for others, or enjoy those campaigns that people toss up on the workshop or otherwise.The best part, to me, is the full ability customization. Rather than limiting you to the severity of most of the actual tabletops, this game does its own thing, more like the old console games back in the day, rather than duct taping itself to the tabletop rules like most tabletop video game adaptations. You wanna play an 'wared up ork street sammy and pick up a couple spells just for that special occasion? Go nuts. You wanna play a luddite mage and sneak in a few points to make yourself stupidly good with a sniper rifle? Have fun.Honestly, my only major complaint is that the availability of character customization options is incredibly limited. One face per race/gender combo, and your only real options are a selection of like 10 hairstyles and colors shared across all races, genders, and classes. And the troll looks like a spiky idiot at that. Top it off with the fact that armor only comes in one piece deals, and you're gonna be seeing a lot of a very blah character for a good long time.But if you can get around looking like the same jackass with a bad picture for the whole game, then you pick this♥♥♥♥♥♥up and play the hell out of it.(Note: I havent played Dragonfall yet, so this review doesnt include that. Maybe Dragonfall dispenses pure endorphins, idunno, it costs 15 bucks on its own on top of the game, it had better.)			"

												Ah Shadowrun.Being developed by some of the leading heads of the franchise you sure get that feeling when playing the game.Sure some things could have been better - the combat system/abilities/weapons could have been a bit more complex and imo far more of the stuff should have been taken over from the pen&paper system but graphics, sounds, dialogues and story all make up for that and just feel right when the playing the game - plus they provided a nice modding platform to statisfy different needs. :]The Dragonfall expansion is even better.(still yearning for a multiplayer mode here :p )			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a fun return to the venerable Shadowrun universe.  It has a healthy retro flair to it, both using a classic Shadowrun time period and an interface that would not be out of place in RPGs from the turn of the millenia.The included base campaign ""Dead Man’s Switch"" makes for a good entry point for those new to Shadowrun.  The treatment of the Shadowrun setting is excellent and is one of the high-points of the game.  Classic Shadowrun character archetypes are represented, a few familiar faces from previous Shadowrun stories make appearances, and the cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world is generally a joy to explore.  The writing is fittingly hardboiled, if sometimes a bit campy, for the neo-noir plot.  The soundtrack compliments the setting well and there are some very clever musical references to the classic Shadowrun game on the Super Nintendo.Regrettably, ""Dead Man’s Switch"" is a rather linear experience.  The writing style is engaging, yet the plot feels somewhat stock.  Most unfortunate, however, is the lack of balance for all character types; certain builds are less useful than others.  Hackers in particular seem to be short changed, as they rarely have opportunities to use their specialities.  Lastly, the game is a bit on the easier side, great for folks either new to the genre or people who are interested only in following the story, but it does include a scaleable difficulty for those who would rather their time in the shadows to be lived on a razor’s edge.Beyond the included campaign ""Dead Man’s Switch,"" Shadowrun Returns hosts a series of mod tools to allow for player created adventures and content.  As of this writing, there are already some very fun player created missions and campaigns available on the Steam Workshop.Overall, I really enjoyed Shadowrun Returns.  Though it has some shortcomings, I found them to be far outweighed by the games strengths.  It’s a game I can easily recommend, especially for fans of RPGs like Fallout, Neverwinter Nights, or the old Infinity Engine games.  And should you have an interest in discovering the world of Shadowrun this is a great place to start.			"

												I played Shadowrun in the early 90's.  I played the pen and paper RPG religously.  I read the books, and to this day, the 2XS/House of the Sun series by Nigel Findley are two of my all time favorite books, period.  The SNES game was intrepid, a game that I still go to every now and then because it was so much fun even when you could speedrun the thing in less than 20 minutes.So I'll base my review of this game on why I bought it:  I bought it because it is Shadowrun.  In my opinion Shadowrun has only successfully been represented once in a video game, and that is the SNES iteration.  Why?  Because it has everything a good table of friends had when they pried open their books and began tallying up the details of their runs.  Your character, a (basically) faceless dude who is slumming after a hard-knocks life of violence and heartbreak, suddenly becomes the target of a major corporate plan that by the grace of whatever god might exist, he lives when he isn't supposed to live.  The 16 bit game has everything you'd expect, barring the limitations of a directional-pad and 8 buttons:  A ""matrix"" to hack, complete with I.C.E. to fight, optional data logs, and upgrades to the way you interface with computers scattered throughout the world.  Magic to weild, nifty guns to play with, ""random"" enemy encounters and a handful of bosses.  Environments ranging from the urban sprawl to sewers to looming corporate towers.  The 16-bit SNES Shadowrun satiated the pen and paper fan's thirst for real world recognition of a game that too often was overlooked in the shadows of Cyberpunk and D&D.  As a kid, I didn't know anyone who played Shadowrun who ever dabbled in other dice rolling games.  That's what set it apart, at least for me and my friends.  We didn't have to squeeze into the typical stereotype of pen and paper gaming.  We could walk into the hobby shops and have virtually anything at our disposal, and nobody could ""talk shop"" with us because all the conventions considered ""normal"" in other games just didn't apply to Shadowrun.  Games could last for weeks, and to me, Shadowrun was Risk while D&D looked like Candyland.  There was no comparison.  The lore, the possibilities in character development, there is not one single thing I can look back without remembering fondly, except for the fact that FASA handled this gem so poorly that it eventually killed it.  I am going to give this game a 9.5 out of 10.  I have not enjoyed it.  None of the charm I associate with Shadowrun exists in this game.  I am rating it high simply because another Shadowrun product was created and released, keeping the brand alive and fresh.  I'm rating it high because it has done so well, assumingly amongst people who are used to playing games that follow the same vein.  I'm rating it high because I love Shadowrun, but no, I don't like this game.  I'm sorry.Maybe it isn't for me, but I hope that the critical acclaim it's recieved will lead to more Shadowrun products, and yes, I will buy them all, and hope that one of them suits my individual tastes.  I don't have time anymore, nor do I have the same friends who would dedicated 8 hours of their evenings to sitting around a table arguing about that homeless guy we didn't heal who turned out to be a decker that could have helped us stall a squad of drones while we got shot up trying to escape an Orc brothel.  This game here, will sit on my massive backlog and maybe at some point I'll give it a shot, if not only to see Jake's face one more time.  Buy this game, support the love and heart that went into making it.  If you aren't me, you'll probably love it enough to play more than a couple hours. "

												Shadowrun Returns is a decent game.  Even though there's a graphical interface and pretty pictures, it's an old-school, turn-based, text driven game.  There's a lot of reading to do, but that's not a negative.  Instead, the writing is very nicely done and your brain fills in the details we normally get with fancier graphics and super-duper cutscenes and voice acting.  It's really nice. There are several areas where the game falls down a bit:- Pacing:  about halfway through the story you start wondering if this is the last scene or not.  The story implies an ending, but doesn't get to it for a while.- Dialog choices:  adding more Charisma is supposed to open more dialog choices.  But, as far as I can see, there were only four or five places where those additional dialog choices existed.  Plus, I believe that there was only one type of extra dialog choice that was used more than once in the game.- Inability to progress:  because the story goes from one area to the next with no ability to go back or do other things, you can get to a point where you're stuck.  Maybe you need more money to hire a team or buy stuff.  If you don't have it, you're SOL -- there's no way to go off to earn it and come back.- Mission ambiguity:  when you're given a mission, you're told to buy a team to help you.  Yet, you don't know enough about the mission to know if it's purley physical or will involve decking.  So, you really don't know who to put on the team.  This is made a bit worse by the design choice of not assembling a permanent team that you develop and train.  With a permanant team, you could produce multi-talented people to cover all the gaps.- No sharing:  you can't move items from one character to another.  This is especially troublesome with things like med kits and resuscitation kits.  I ran into many cases where the character carrying those resuscitation  kits died and I could neither transfer one out to another character before-hand or walk over to the corpse and take one out of his pack afterwards.- Development tree:  some of the character developement tree doesn't seem to be of much use.  For instance, I played a Decker.  Theoretically, I should have focused on the Intelligence/Decking aspects of the tree.  Yet, Decking only happens in a few spots in the game.  Since the character you're playing is the single point of failure for the whole game (i.e., if he dies, the game is over -- whereas if a team mate dies, you can resuscitate him or carry on without), you're better off focusing on pure physicality and survivability and hiring the specialists as needed  (assuming you knew when they'd be needed).Of course, I've got to temper that by saying that all of that stuff is based on the sole developer-provided scenario.  There's another one in the Dragonfall DLC available here and there are oodles available for free in the Workshop.  So, with the proper writing, those issues could go away.  So, the game, especially considering it's a framework for other stories, is decent.			"

												I love tactical combat games, specially if they are turn-based, so this one (the first I played in the Shadowrun series _ I also got Dragonfall and Boston Lockdown on my library) seemed to be right up my alley. Unfortunately, it's subpar in terms of combat and graphics, and the lack of voice acting and controller support (this is always an unforgivable flaw) doesn't help either. So I was leaning on a non-recommendation for this one, but the character and party customization and, above all, the story redeem it. It's not very long (finished it in 21 hours), but this suits the story, which is not an epic, but more of a noir in a cyberpunk setting. Feels like an intro for a larger story, so I suggest buying it on sale. Hope the next installments are better (reviews for Dragonfall are largely favorable), because there's potential for great games, specially if the devs look up to the combat in the XCOM series, while keeping the focus on narrative instead of resource management.

												Well, I am not in the cyberpunk genre. But I thought, ""give it a try"". Wow, man was I in for a surprise. It is such a dense story, so many well written characters and so different ways of solving the story. I just had to play all races and earn all the achievements too. So I do highly recommend this.

												Shadowrun Returns is a decent game.  Even though there's a graphical interface and pretty pictures, it's an old-school, turn-based, text driven game.  There's a lot of reading to do, but that's not a negative.  Instead, the writing is very nicely done and your brain fills in the details we normally get with fancier graphics and super-duper cutscenes and voice acting.  It's really nice. There are several areas where the game falls down a bit:- Pacing:  about halfway through the story you start wondering if this is the last scene or not.  The story implies an ending, but doesn't get to it for a while.- Dialog choices:  adding more Charisma is supposed to open more dialog choices.  But, as far as I can see, there were only four or five places where those additional dialog choices existed.  Plus, I believe that there was only one type of extra dialog choice that was used more than once in the game.- Inability to progress:  because the story goes from one area to the next with no ability to go back or do other things, you can get to a point where you're stuck.  Maybe you need more money to hire a team or buy stuff.  If you don't have it, you're SOL -- there's no way to go off to earn it and come back.- Mission ambiguity:  when you're given a mission, you're told to buy a team to help you.  Yet, you don't know enough about the mission to know if it's purley physical or will involve decking.  So, you really don't know who to put on the team.  This is made a bit worse by the design choice of not assembling a permanent team that you develop and train.  With a permanant team, you could produce multi-talented people to cover all the gaps.- No sharing:  you can't move items from one character to another.  This is especially troublesome with things like med kits and resuscitation kits.  I ran into many cases where the character carrying those resuscitation  kits died and I could neither transfer one out to another character before-hand or walk over to the corpse and take one out of his pack afterwards.- Development tree:  some of the character developement tree doesn't seem to be of much use.  For instance, I played a Decker.  Theoretically, I should have focused on the Intelligence/Decking aspects of the tree.  Yet, Decking only happens in a few spots in the game.  Since the character you're playing is the single point of failure for the whole game (i.e., if he dies, the game is over -- whereas if a team mate dies, you can resuscitate him or carry on without), you're better off focusing on pure physicality and survivability and hiring the specialists as needed  (assuming you knew when they'd be needed).Of course, I've got to temper that by saying that all of that stuff is based on the sole developer-provided scenario.  There's another one in the Dragonfall DLC available here and there are oodles available for free in the Workshop.  So, with the proper writing, those issues could go away.  So, the game, especially considering it's a framework for other stories, is decent.			"

Shadowrun Returns: Dead Man's SwitchDrek or not?Shadowrun Returns has been out for awhile. I'm late to the party but figured I would leave a quick review for anyone that shows up after I did. In keeping with the spirit of today's digital world I will make this brief.GameplayShadowrun Returns is a top down, isometric view computer role playing game (CRPG). Story and dialogue are delivered through text (NFPWDLTR). Combat is tactical and turn based, incorporating gunplay, melee, and magic into a system that plays a bit like Xcom, or Wasteland 2. Combat is handled on a grid with an action point (AP) system. You move your character and any other runners (think mercenaries or other temporary party members) into and out of cover, shooting, swiping, using spells and or abilities to defeat your foes. There is more to it than this but for the sake of brevity I will leave the rest up to you to figure out. One key point to reiterate is that this is turn based. Each unit on the field, both friend and foe take a turn. They move/shoot/swing/cast/use an ability then on to the next unit. If you are going to enjoy this game you must be comfortable with this type of gameplay. This is NOT real time with pause (RTWP) like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale.  This is NOT real time top down like Diablo or Sacred. I like all three types of gameplay but your mileage may vary. If you do not like turn based combat then do not buy the game, you won't enjoy it. If you you aren't the biggest fan of turn based but really enjoy RPG's and are interested in the Shadowrun setting then put the game on the easiest difficulty setting, plow through the encounters, and have fun building your character and playing through the fun, albeit linear story. StoryThis is a short (for an RPG) game. The central storyline involves you, a runner, a dead buddy, a murder mystery intertwined with a larger murder mystery intertwined with a larger mystery mystery. That's about as spoilery as I am going to get. The story is passable but it won't knock your socks off or anything. Progression through the story is quite linear, this can be good or bad depending on your mood. If you just want to play a short and straightforward RPG adventure then you will have a good time. If you are looking for something with a branching storyline featuring heavy choice and consequence (C&C) this won't do it for you.Dialogue and story play in tandem with your choice of character quite well however and the game throws ample skill and stat checks at you in dialogue throughout the game. This will provide you with possibilities for higher paying rewards, avoidance of combat (in some situations), chances to receive additional intel, and alternative solutions to some quests.Character Building SystemThe best part of the game in my opinion. I am biased on this as I really enjoy the Shadowrun universe. The blend of high tech and fantasy with cybernetics, hacking the matrix, and wielding magic, all co-existing in the same world is a strong draw for me.The skill based character system is very well done and you can make some really unique builds if you so desire. Once you get a feel for how the stats and abilities work my number one suggestion is to create a fully custom character. The templates provided throw points into stats where you won't need them. Create an idea for your character and try and specialize in two key areas while maintaining a sense of durability that shares a direct relationship with the difficulty you choose you tackle. The only negative in this regard, and it is significant, is the way the hired Shadowrunners have been built. It's almost like the developers either don't understand their own mechanics (unlikely) or just wanted to build a bunch of gimps for you adventure with. If I were to alter this module in any way the first thing I would do is rebuild the stat and ability allocations for all the hired mercs. ConclusionNot drek ...Introductory I think is the best descriptor here. The Dead Man's Switch (the primary story module for Shadowrun Returns) serves as an introduction. An introduction to the gameplay systems, the dialogue system, the storytelling style, and the editor for the game. It feels like an introduction for both the players and the developers and while it leaves plenty of room for improvement I still had a great time.I played from start to finish over the course of one long weekend. Steam says I clocked 15.9 hours.  I played a Human Decker/SMG/Toughguy. My ending stats were something like: (Body -7-, Quickness -7-, Ranged -7-, SMG -3-, Dodge-6-, Intelligence -7-, Decking -7-, Charisma -2-) My main character was always the most deadly in a fight and I could hack the matrix like an awesome nerd. I can definitely see myself playing this again just to run through the story with another build. I already have several character ideas.Recommended for:CRPG enthusiasts that enjoy isometric games with turn based combat and can look past the linear story. Think of it as the introductory module for a larger role playing experience in the Shadowrun universe as imagined by Harebrained Schemes.Not recommended for:Gamers not interested in having all of the story and dialogue in a game deliverd via text. Gamers looking for heavy C&C in the storyline and or branching storylines based on player agency. Gamers who do not enjoy RPG's. Provisional mega bonuses:The game comes with an editor. Make your own Shadowruns!The game runs great on older machines. As of this review I don't even have a video card in my rig and the game ran fine using only my Intel integrated graphics chipset.			"

The level editor and the huge amount of UGC guarantees that you can't get tired of the game or if you ever do you can make your own story. It's a must have for everyone who is familiar with the Shadowrun universe and everyone who likes well thought, atmospheric turn-based RPGs.			"

For a text review, a modified script is provided below.Shadowrun Returns is a turn based isometric strategy game based in the cyberpunk world of Shadowrun. Accompanied by dialogue and progression mechanics similar to those found in RPGs, this indie title is a very unique start to a series that seems like it can only get better with more support.Shadowrun features a linear campaign with a highly engaging story that starts out simple and maybe just gets a little ridiculous by the end. But in a world of decking into the matrix, metahuman troll shamans summoning spirits made out of corpses, and drugs basically being entirely replaced by virtual experience chips that are eerily similar to video games? Maybe it's hard to judge when something actually becomes strange. There's plenty of dialogue to read, choices to make, and paths to explore that all come with rewards of additional money, karma, or maybe even just the opposite. The campaign lacks freedom of movement though due to its linear nature, but that's not really a con with this game. It works perfectly fine the way it is, it's just a shame the game is only about 10 hours long. Never fear if you want more content however, the game is fully equipped with modding support and plenty user-made missions and campaigns exist to lengthen your playtime. Some of them even allow you to import your character from the main campaign and continue to make him the epitome of badassedry.Shadowrun's gameplay is similar to other games such as Avernum and XCOM, but seems to borrow far more from XCOM in terms of the fact that you can still miss a lot with a 99% chance to hit your target. Honestly though, it's a lot of fun. The strategy elements will appeal to any fans of the turn based genre and the RPG elements of how the story progresses and how you equip and upgrade your character bring it an appeal to a whole 'nother market entirely. You see the game gives you Karma instead of levels or experience, and they are essentially skill points that you earn by completing objectives, and more of by sacrificing monetary rewards to do the 'right' thing. These skill points plus purchasing gear are entirely how you shape the efficiency of your character. My only complaint with how the gameplay actually works is  the movement. When you're out of turn based movement it is very obvious that the characters are still running around in turn mode since there is a constant pause like it's processing the start of a new turn every couple of seconds of running. And when you are moving, you are incapable of quick saving your game til at least one full second after you finish moving. This makes life for save-a-holics like myself a little inconvenient, but it makes it even more evident that they didn't bother making an actual real-time freeroam mode and just reskinned the turn-based movement. It's a shame, but it's no reason to be turned away from the game.A reason to to turned a way from Shadowrun would be that it suffers from a lot of bugs. In fact, if you have a bug and google it to get help, not only will you find plenty of persons with the same bug in the same place, but you'll find others who have a completely different bug in the same place as well! The steam version is notably the buggiest version of the game. It features extra bugs in any potential area and even features a game-breaking save-wiping bug that makes it so that if you want this game, I'd recommend NEVER buying it on steam. The GoG version being the least buggy that I've found and lacks any game-breaking bugs that I've found in 23 hours of playing it. If you're going to get this game, get it on GoG.The graphics of this game are understandably bad for today. The game was released almost four years ago and was a difficult project that even had to be kickstarted to get off the ground, and thankfully they put most of their effort into gameplay and story rather than making it a beauty to look at. The nitty gritty feeling of the graphics however really helps to immerse you into the scary world that is Shadowrun. So long as you can ignore occasional glitches such as shooting an SMG and seeing the bullets come from the opposite corner of the map and flying off to who knows where instead of coming out of the gun like they're supposed to, the graphics really shouldn't be a con.The soundtrack is something I'd like to describe as cyberpunk to the extreme. It definitely fits the setting and the sound effects are fine, but no standing ovation. The game however does lack any voice acting whatsoever which is good to note, because if you do not want to do a LOT of reading, then this game is not for you.Overall, Shadowrun Returns is a charming indie title so unique in every way I really don't think you should miss it. It gets an 8/10 from me. It was reaching for 9/10, but all the problems with bugs and certain flaws stomped it down a bit, making it just barely retain an 8/10. Is it worth the full price of $15? Only yes if you plan on downloading and playing a bunch of user-created storylines. The base game is too short to justify $15 however, being barely longer than the bare-bones campaigns findable in many AAA first person shooters these days. I definitely recommend buying this if you like strategy or experiencing new and unique settings, but buy it on sale unless you definitely plan on playing every single mod you can. Just do NOT buy it on steam unless you're ok with potentially dealing with having your save games wiped or a plethora of other steam-exclusive bugs that have been reported.			"

												After 11 hours I finished the game and it was a good ride. There are good things about the game and then there are things that could be (way) better. Let's start with the good things first:It certainly feels like a Shadowrun game. I've played the pen & paper RPG in the 90s and during the first minutes, the game gets the atmosphere right. It feels like the Seattle of 2050 that I had in my head (or at least very close to it). The artwork is well made and the soundtrack works nicely to support the setting.You can choose how to play your character. While the decking part is a bit underwhelming, the choice between weapons or magic is there and quite well balanced. There's a good amount of freedom how to build your character and while it doesn't have a big influence on the outcome of the game, it still gives the game some depth.Depth... that's the real problem with the game. The story is well written and while it does have a quite large number of twists, in the end it works well. The game is too linear though. There is exactly one optional 'Mr Johnson' run and that's simply not enough in a Shadowrun game. The game feels too much 'on rails' and while you can grab a few optional items for additional creds, there's almost no content you can miss out on. That in turn means there's almost no replay value except if you want to check out magic instead of weapons (or vice versa).I still recommend the game, because it does give you a good amount of content and especially if you like Cyberpunk. 15 € is too much for it though, so grab it in a sale (they are frequent enough). I'm looking forward to play Dragonfall and see if they added a bit more flesh ;)			"

												I really enjoyed playing the game, although it felt like there's a lot of systems that you can simply skip - for example, I found no use in putting points into Decking or getting most Cyberware, given the rare opportunities to actually use them, it's better to just use a hired gun. The complete lack of voice acting or animated cinematics even during critical portions of the story, such as, uh, the ending, lend to a bit of a low-budget feel. I also wish the game had gamepad support, or at least an option for larger text so I could have played it on my TV like the original back in the day; this is a complaint I could level at the majority of games on Steam, mind you. The game is really quite linear and though my time tracker shows over 25 hours played, much of that was spent on pause or idle, and the game feels kinda short overall. However, what's there is really good. I had lots of fun, and would recommend it to anyone who likes this sort of game, especially at a sale price. I'm looking forward to playing Dragonfall, as I've heard it's an improvement, though I don't expect voice acting there either.			"

												Please buy this game.Games like this are not released often enough, which is why I backed this on kickstarter a year ago.At the same time, it feels new-- glossier and more intuitive than I expected. Accessible, even.The writing is wry and pleasantly true-to-form for the canon/world of Shadowrun. NPCs are well-characterized without too much exposition, much like in a good tabletop game.Combat feels right, and very familiar to tabletop runners/fans of the SNES game. Multiple approaches to almost every situatoin, delightfully turn-based yet explosive/well-scripted enough to appeal to a newer set.Lastly, I want more games like this to come out. Need, even. Let's spend money on clever, exciting things(especially kickstarted things that were delivered on time and on budget). Vote with your dollars to tell indies and megapublishers both that this is the kind of game you'll buy.Please.			"

												Very nice game. I didn't expect it to be that good. Pluses:+ Visual style! + Interesting story. You investigate the murder of your friend. Of course, everything is not what it looks like.+ Character skills. There are lots of them. You have to be careful with what you choose as you can't revert it.+ Combat. I like turn-based combat system. Here it is a lot of fun. You have to think your strategy through very thoroughly.+ Great music!+ Memorable characters!There are a few minuses as well:- game is pretty linear which is bad for RPG. There are a few places where you can use your charisma skill and pass through without fighting, but that isn't enough. - No point in replaying the game.- It isn't really a minus for me, but the characters aren't voiced. So you have to read everything: dialogues, thoughts of your character. Some prefer to listen to all of that, so it is sort of a minus.All in all, I don't regret playing it. 8 out of 10!			"

												This game is good stuff. Why? Well, it isn't for everyone obviously, but the game is filled with enough variety and content (as well as has great people always making more stuff for it.) that it feels very very good. Also, depending on your class also means you get to choose how you want to approach things. Are you there to just kick down doors and give everyone a healthy bullet diet? You can! Want to have a lot of bots, enemy turrets, and other such things do that for you? You can!Also, delving deeper into things can lead you to decisions that you might have initially considered. Devil is in the details and all that. Overall, I would recommend this game, and its extra DLC stuff, cause it is done that well. Have fun, and happy running.			"

												I would recommend Shadowrun Returns to any RPG enthusiast.A Kickstarter success story, Shadowrun Returns is a classic cyberpunk RPG featuring elves, orks, and magic as well as cyberspace infiltrations.I spent over 25 hours unraveling SR's engaging, whodunit-style story, and was definitely hungry for more.Even though Harebrained Studios has since released Shadowrun: Dragonfall, Shadowrun Returns remains a solid RPG in its own right.Go buy Shadowrun Returns!

												In an Era where RPG's are filled with shallow mechanics, retardation in character urgency and plots that are as simple as offering  Oprah a piece of your sammich emerges Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall. For those who have been living under a rock I would like to ask 1)How much is the rent over there and 2)How have you not heard of shadowrun returns Dragonfall. Dragonfall is the expansion of the cyberpunk rpg that came out last year. I enjoyed the OC so much that it is probably my third favorite game of all time. The Dragonfall expansion has an ambition to expand on the wonderful world of shadowrun returns. I could write a long review but each time I look at vine videos I am reminded that society's current attention span is...hey a puppy. Basically I will write down some cliff notesWhat Does Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall Improve on?-Level Design-Choices and consenquences-Combat difficulty-Character Interaction-Character Development-Skillchecks-More Mage Class Urgency-More EquipmentWhat Does Harebrained schemes need to work on?-Response time of their game. My menu screen takes a while to respond to a click.-Adept class still needs improvement as it feels a bit lackluster.-Work on those Boss Fights.Final Verdict is Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall 9/10 would ban....sorry about that. 9/10 would play again which I will be doing today with a decker.

												""Shadowrun Returns"" does for the rich Shadowrun universe what ""Baldur's Gate"" did for the Forgotten Realms. Playing through this game was like playing through some of the classic SR adventures, with mysteries to solve, clues to follow, and all manner of unusual individuals to interact with. And firefights, of course. The noir atmosphere is great, and it's quite obvious from gameplay that the creators of the game were fans of the tabletop RPG: there are numerous references to characters and organizations from the gamebooks, some more relevant to the story than others. The music is great, the character creation was satisfyingly customizable: I was able to make a reasonable facsimile of my female Dwarf Decker from the tabletop game with the options present. And the fact that I've been able to play as a Decker and get through the first adventure on Normal difficulty is a testament to the fact that you can play any character type you like and do well. If you're a fan of the original tabletop RPG, I highly recommend ""Shadowrun Returns.""			"

												First off, I want to say that I'm glad someone is trying to revive Shadowrun and it's rich world setting. Unfrotunatly, this did not quite hit the mark.The game was too on the rails for me to enjoy. Shadowrun is an amazing world and you're not allowed to explore it. The stash system makes no sense and is a poor design choice. As far back as SNES, games have allowed you to automatically equip a new item you've purchased and sell your old one or keep it to be stored. Why do my new weapons go automatically to my stash? I purchased it because it was better than what I had currently. There's no excuse for this design to still exist in modern games.The only viable option for your character is Street Samurai as this game decided to keep the poor choices of old isometric games where the game is over if your character dies, even if there are ways to ressurect people. I chose Decker as my class and it was neutered from the awesome experience it should have been. I was squishy in combat and thus had to restart levels multiple times as the AI would target only me and end the fight quickly. I was not presented with an option to enter the matrix to hack things and it was relegated to an automatic dialogue option. I asked other and it doesn't get any better later in the game.I so badly wanted this game to be what Shadowrun deserves but I guess I have to keep waiting.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is some of the best isometric, turn-based combat I've seen in a while, and I love the genre.  I love cyberpunk in general, and Shadowrun in particular, so I'm admitting bias up front.  Still, the world and combat are a blast.  I really have to recommend it all over again due to the Dragonfall expansion, as that has some of the greatest in-game character development and plot that I've seen in the last decade.  Fascinating NPCs not only in your team, but in a neighborhood that you adopt.  Great options to solve problems regardless of whether you sling lead, summon spirits to do your bidding, or pilot a few remote-control death contraptions.  The team's interesting and useful, the cover system and environments make the combat fun, the plot keeps you progressing to see what's next, and your choices matter in ways that are really refreshing to see.  Two cybernetically-enhanced Orc thumbs up!			"

												As a point and click isometric / RPG tactics game veteran, I must say this game is fairly lame.TL;DR... It's Fallout / Fallout II light for the casuals... it's linear, it's mind numbingly boring and just not fun.For those of you that want a more in depth look as to why this is a polished turd, read on...It takes a whole lot of reading and engrossing yourself in this universe to really enjoy it. The entire game is played with a single button... yes, the left mouse button... so talk about a snooze fest. I found myself  controlling the camera movement with the W, A, S ,D, keys just to  break the monotony of only using the mouse to play.The game proceeds like this: You go through a metric♥♥♥♥♥♥tonne of dialog, learn some things, more plot holes are formed and you proceed clicking around walking (ever so slowly) around some linear rundown areas of a city. You talk to some more NPC's and choose some more inconsequential dialog options... Then you proceed to get in to a ""tactical"" fight... there's usually only one of these per chapter.I was interested in the game because it looked like a fun tactical RPG game and had stat / profession / skill selections like the original Fallout games but that's about where the similarities die... The dialog to combat ratio is just abysmal. Fallout found that perfect balance of never giving you too much unnecessary dialog / information... It was always just the right amount and then it was off to go shoot some people, even still, Fallout has much richer dialog, you almost crave more of it sometimes. Shadow Run is just the polar opposite... 90% of every chapter is all dialog with a single battle / boss encounter that lasts about 5 minutes, tops.The cyberpunk thing doesn't really do it for me either, a lot of the classes are rather convoluted and redundant... Highly unnecessary and only viable for small portions of the game to perhapes skip a few needless fights that end about as quickly as they start. The best all around class is the Street Samurai... so like you're a street thug with honor... kay... talk about a contradiction. :/I was never in to the Shadow Run lore so that might be why I'm not enjoying this as much, it all seems very familiar and boring. It's just another rip off of the Fantasy / Sci-Fi genre with a Cyberpunk coat of paint over the top... So you have your Trolls, Orcs, Humans, Dwarfs and Elves but they're all dressed in late 90's, pleather ridden esque garbs talking about jacking in to matrix's and carrying uzi's. *puke*If you find it on sale, go for it I guess... but be warned, it's incredibly drab over all... not very stimulating. As a word of advice, don't try to specalize in more than a couple traits because being a jack of all trades / well rounded toon is going to get you killed in the late game.			"

												Until recently, I was somewhat reluctant to recommend this game. I enjoyed Dead Man's Switch, but, like many people, found it to be more of an interactive novel (with tactical interludes) than a role playing game. Playing around with the editor has been a blast, but I know that this isn't for everyone, and neither is playing through User Generated Content (though there's some excellent stuff out there). After the launch of Dragonfall, however, I can post the positive review with confidence. Aside from implementing the much needed save-anywhere system, Dragonfall is a much more engaging campaign on so many levels. It's what Dead Man's Switch should have been, but wasn't. While the main hub is relatively small, you really do feel like the leader of a team of Shadowrunners, and are able to take on a variety of jobs, and complete them in the order that you wish. The jobs themselves, more importantly, feel a great deal more open, with tough choices and multiple objectives, including optional points of interest. The literally two side quests you got in DMS felt like afterthoughts (""oh crap, we forgot to put side quests in and the game launches in a week!""). Here, everything feels lovingly attended to. This is, perhaps, a major advantage of text based story telling. If you're inclined to pick up the relatively robust editor that comes along with the base game, you'll not that your storytelling capacity is only limited by your writing ability and your imagination (the scripting and map building aren't that hard to learn). If you've got the desire and the ability to write, you can craft beautiful and interesting adventures, whether side quest or main, to your heart's content. And that's what HBS has done this time around.In fact, the one thing that hasn't changed is the excellent writing. This isn't high end literature, but it's engaging and interesting all around. It draws you into the world and, in some cases, really captivates you. The charachters, especially your crew members, the fixer, and the occupants of your little slice of berlin, are memorable and interesting to a person. It's unfortunate that this had to be released as DLC. The base campaign had the writing down, but it didn't have the wow factor or the, well, interactivity. If only it had...The setting and the charachters of Dead Man's Switch could have really shone with a similar treatment.Still, better late than never.			"

												Shadowrun.A cyberpunk world heavily inspired by William Gibson's ""Nuromancer.""In fact, so heavily inspired much of the early lore and ""techno-speak"" with in the table-top RPG was taken straight from his 1984 novel and pasted.When I was 14 years old, I mingled with a small herd of nerds who held Shadowrun as some sort of Holy Grail amongst table-top games. I played it once, and hated all 30 minutes of it. Needless to say, my friendship with them didn't last much longer there after, but my interest was stoked a little.In my late teens and very early twenties, I read a trilogy of Shadowrun novels. My intrest went from mere intrest to a desire to gather more Shadowrun knowledge.I later acquired a battered and torn copy of 2nd edition.Again, my first game- this time Gm'd by me, did not bode well and was a complete failure, lasting just about as long.I have now however, acquired 4th edition- hopefully that will work better.But onto this game it's self.When my brother In-Law (soon to be) told me of a Shadowrun game on Steam, I was very excited and very jelous he had it too!Having been bought it by my wife during the summer sale, this has been one of the best buys I've gotten for any game.What has led to to write this though, isn't the core game it's self, but the ingenous user made content.The core game made, gives a good story an awesome over view of the Shadowrun world with a cool RPG element.The user content I has sampled thus far though, brings this game to a whole new kind of awesome.Users have spent their (probaly what little of it they have) spare free time to craft gems of gaming story with layers of Shadowrun lore, politics, intrigue and magic threaded within it. These aren't just ""I made this for a laugh (guff)!!!"" These are stories. Character driven and user defined.So why get this game?Get this game to find others who want to share a dark magical future with you.			"

												This reminds me of a time when good writing was still a priority in roleplaying games.  FASA's Shadowrun pen & paper games were among my all-time favourites back in the 1990s and this game captures the atmosphere and well-fleshed out characters of ""The Sixth World"" perfectly.The adventure is short but the toolset and mod community should provide more than enough justification for the asking price (especially during a Steam sale).If you're a fan of tactics-style RPGs or the cyber-punk genre, you really can't go wrong with this indie-gem.

												Shadowrun is a game that has long been waiting for an RPG like this.While you buy this as a whole game, you get so much more.You get the interesting campaign which is around 12 hours long and will keep you engaged. Beyond that, you get the tools to create your own campaign and play other people's. Many games have this, so why does this game having it warrant anything?Well, as with any RPG based on a pen-and-paper game, there's a plethora of campaigns just waiting to be inserted into this game and a lot are already there. Not only do you get an excellent game in and of itself, you get all of the currently-released and upcoming campaigns that will inevitably come.			"

												In 2005 an arena combat shadowrun game emerged, it was a tremendous mistake. It singlehandedly destroyed the beautiful and weird property that wizkids had cultivated for tabletop gaming, for an entire digital audience. I salvaged a disc from a bargain bin a few years after it's release, and died a bit inside realizing titles meant nothing. It'd be like going to your favorite restaurant on your birthday, and getting food poisoning.Flash forward to Harebrained's inspired idea to do this franchise right, and goodness did they.The controls are so streamlined you could replace candy crush/angry birds for your toilet gaming habits.The Lore is solid. This game was written by someone who not just played the tabletop, but obsessed over the subject matter so long, that they could re-create the vivid world of megacorporations and magic, and they expanded on it so well, that even their truly inspired players could use their tools to tell their own cyberpunk stories.This game is an accomplishment, not just a successful game- not just a beautiful deluge into the gritty future of fantasy, but the redemption of an entire franchise.

Nice twists.+ A variety of RPG classes,+ Turn-based squad combat+ linear (I like been told where to go next)Negative points:- Dialog and story is in text (no voice). I almost stopped playing after 20 minutes because of this. I was surprised that it bothered me so much because I usually turn on subtitles. - No  grinding, not many side quests, This sounds good on paper but I had a bad time with a summoner class; each summon cost money. I specialized in summoning and simply couldn't progress at some point. had to create a different character.- Short. Just when you are picking up speed, the game ends. "

												So after completing Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall, I can say with no small amount of enthusiasm that it was one of the best stories I've played through. Despite it's relatively short length (somewhere around 14-20 hours), the writing is superb and almost every character is fleshed out very well - even NPC's that aren't critical to the story. Coupled with the new save system, I can confidently say that it's a much better Shadowrun. The story may not be as deep, but the interactions with your team and neighborhood more than make up for it. Picked it up for $5 on the Steam Sale and it's easilly one of the best five dollars I've ever spent.			"

												""Shadowrun Returns"" tells a linear interesting story.You live in this world in the future, where orcs, trolls, magic or advanced tech are common.You are a shadow runner, a gun for hire.You have lots of possibilities what ""class"" your character is using.You may use guns, swords, magic or high tech or mix them all.How about conjuring demons and controlling flying combat drones?Or a mage with a sub machine gun who first makes enemies helpless before he attacks?What ever you chose, it is fun. Depending on your own class, you will have to chose your teammates so, that you can do you mission.The ""story"" levels are real time, you just move around and talk.When the fights start, it is turn based.""Turn based"" does not always go back to real time, when all enemies are dead.You can not exchange items between characters.There are bugs, some are gone after save/load. Some not. None are game breaking.For me, the game kept interesting and fun until the last level.That went on and on and on.It was just boring.Why not tell a story and let the story end.Why do all people think you either need an ""End Boss"" or something like that?You seldom get enough information about the missions.You can do every mission if you have a decker with you,but SOME information would have been nice.I did the last mission with 4 mages with healing, because I had no idea what I had to expect.I thought, would be a much better game with a open world. And generated quests.Then I found this in the workshop:

												A wonderful RPG, even if the campaign in the base game does it's best to try to convince you otherwise. While many of the major technical and design flaws have been excised, the base campaign is still plagued by level and story design that feels like it's just stringing you along from one too-long fight to the next. It doesn't help that your words, skills, and actions also have very little effect on either the conversation or the campaign level. It's not bad per-say, but I didn't feel terribly invested in the story or characters.The DLC expansion ""Dragonfall"" however is excellent and is everything that the base campaign should have been. It's significantly better designed, with far stronger writing, level design, and campaign structure. In the first hour, I had a far better sense of who my character was, where I was in the world, and was invested in narrative. The world feels much more vibrant and dynamic (even though there's quite a bit of illusion of false choice as is typical of the genre) than the base game. I very highly reccomend that you purchase dragonfall along with the base game. In my opinion, the $30 price of entry for both is a better value than $15 for just the base game. The difference in quality between the two campaigns is stark, and it's very likely you'll bore yourself about a third of the way through the base game and never think to pick up the DLC if you don't buy both and you'd miss out on a great RPG.It's also worth noting that the game has workshop support and is very friendly for creating user-made content including adventures and campaigns ala the original Neverwinter Nights. While I have not tried any of these yet, the content available looks quite promising.			"

												If you've heard rage about this game, don't worry; most of that is from people who severely underestimated the cost of video games development.  A $2 million Kickstarter campaign (which worked out to about $1.2 mil after Amazon and Kickstarter's cuts, which then also had to cover the physical rewards for the backers as well as the game) doesn't mean AAA quality - it means a shoestring budget.  Keep that in mind, and this is a fantastic game and a worthy addition to the Shadowrun universe.Set in the dystopian, cyberpunk future of 2050, in a world where magic and the races of fantasy have returned.  Unlike the last two good Shadowrun games (the FPS should only be considered a Shadowrun game in the context of how NOT to make a Shadowrun game) back on the SNES and Genesis, Returns hews more closely to the turn-based nature and feel of the original pen-and-paper game.  It doesn't exactly port over the ruleset - merely uses a whole new one inspired by the rulesets used by the PnP game's 2nd and 3rd editions.  It's a classless system, meaning you can spend your Karma (what the game calls XP) on whatever aspect of your character you want.  Think your AK-97-totting ork needs some skill with a blade for when the enemy gets up-close and personal?  No problem - just drop the Karma into the relevant stat when you have the chance.  What if you feel your chi-wielding Physical Adept needs a bit of extra ranged oomph but you don't want to spend the money on guns?  Sink some Karma into spellcasting and you can add some fireballs and lightning bolts to the mix.The game does provide a set of Archetypes to pick from during character creation, each one fitting one of six roles in the SR universe - the Street Samurai, who follows a code of honour but mostly focuses on combat and augmenting himself with a lot of cyberware; the Mage, who lashes out with powerful spells; the Decker, who uses his cyberdeck to hack into the Matrix (the internet's successor... no, no relation to the films; Shadowrun was using the term way back in the late '80s); the Shaman, who manipulates the energies of the natural world to aid his companions as well as calling up spirits to fight alongside them; the Rigger, who remote-controls a series of combat drones and the Physical Adept, who focuses his magic inward and make strikes with his fists or a blade more devastating.The Archetypes spend most of your starting Karma for you and (in the included campaign, Dead Man's Switch) set your starting gear.  If you want to spend all that starting Karma yourself, be prepared to start the game with a few guns (I think a pistol, an SMG and an assault rifle) and no spells/drones/cyberdeck/etc.  In addition to the archetypes, you also have five races, or metatypes as the game calls them, to choose from.  In the 2050s, humanity is now metahumanity and consists of humans, elves, dwarves, orks and trolls.Most of them are pretty much what you'd expect - elves are agile and smart, dwarves and tough and stubborn, orks can snap you in two like a dry twig, etc.  Trolls, though, can basically be seen as orks on steroids (an analogy that doesn't quite work as well when there could literally be orks taking steroids) - they're even bigger, even stronger and have bony growths on their skin that act like armour.  Each metatype's drawback is limits on how high certain stats can go - most can raise them to about 10 or 11, but trolls, for example, can't raise their Charisma above six.The combat has something of an XCOM feel to it, save that you can't rotate the camera.  HBS took some of the elements from XCOM Enemy Unknown that worked - the assumption that your team brought more than enough ammo for the job (infinite ammo, but needing to reload) and the high-low-cover system (though flanking doesn't give a bonus to critical hits, just makes them easier to hit).I'll get the negatives out of the way now - at the time I'm writing this, there is no manual save feature.  It only auto-saves on loading screens and there will be times when those are spaced far enough apart to be a pain.  Good news on this front - they're working on a manual save system that should be done at the same time as the first expansion, Dragonfall, but will be applied to the base game and campaign without you having to buy that.  That won't be til about January, though.  Secondly, the included campaign is rather short - tops out at about 12 hours or thereabouts and is rather linear.  Don't go into it expecting the freedom most other RPGs have; Dead Man's Switch is a very story-driven campaign and the events in it only cover a few days.  This next one I don't see as a problem, but there were a lot of people raging about it on the Steam forums after launch - the game has zero voice acting.  They couldn't afford it.  Yes, sadly; this means that you will have to read.  But for the added freedom this gave them in NPC dialogue, I have no problem with that.  There is also very little to actually interact with in the environments (or at least in Dead Man's Switch, this may not be the case in Dragonfall or some user-generated content) so they can feel rather empty at times.The graphics have an interesting, stylised look to them.  It was a big jarring for me at first (I'd binged a bit on the various 4th edition books during the Kickstarter campaign where most of the art's a bit more realistic) but eventually I came to enjoy it.  The character models aren't exactly high-grade, but the camera never really gets close enough for it to be annoying.  You'll be getting a better feel for a character's look from their portrait.  The overall character designs fit the SR universe, though; Detective McKluskly is a good example of this - they've taken an almost stereotypical design of a corrupt detective and turned him into an ork and it works.  Even with the lower-quality of the character models, they still found ways to add little details to them.  Jump over to Google and do a quick image search with ""Shadowrun Returns McKlusky"" and find an image of his character model.  You might notice a tattoo on one forearm.  It's never mentioned anywhere in the game, but that's a tattoo from the UCAS Marines - he's ex-military.This game does come with a full editor that is, relatively, user-friendly.  I say 'relatively' because any editor that involves more than placing terrain and hostile NPCs is going to be complex, no matter how you slice it.  But the coding side of this one is a lot simpler than any other I've seen - using If/Else statements and the like.  It takes some getting used to, but there are tutorials for it on the HBS youtube channel and there's bound to be plenty of fan-made tutorials out there by now.  Most of this game's life will come from the campaigns published on the Workshop, but like any game driven by fan-made content (ARMA, Elder Scrolls, even ol' Neverwinter Nights) it will be at least a year before that side of the game comes into its own.I'd say more about Dead Man's Switch itself, but most of the negatives I feel players could be warned about (or at least worth mentioning here) come with some serious spoilers.  These aren't massive ones, really just mention on why one NPC isn't as tough as the PnP game's books suggested.  What I will say is that it has some phenomenal writing that pulls you into the setting.  There are perhaps some things mentioned that may not mean anything to someone new to the setting, but HBS has a Shadowrun Primer on their website for free download that should help in that respect.  Regardless, they made great use of Shadowrun's iconic slang and the various setting elements (although that does mean anyone familiar with the setting may know what's coming once you start having to deal with the Universal Brotherhood).

												Shadowrun Returns is pretty sweet. A clear reintroduction to the Shadowrun universe with a world-significant and sufficiently grand story. A comfortable, enjoyable strategy turn-based.Dragonfall, however, is the true glorious return. Developed and empathetic characters, a rich and suitably gritty story, genuinely difficult choices. I can't extoll the virtues of this game highly enough.			"

												Nice throwback! 3/5I would like to first off say, I enjoyed this game a lot, but I did have some problems with it.  What happened to the rest of the world?  The original shadowrun games (I'm talking console not tabletop) had open worlds, free run of the cities, and clues you had to collect.  This is more of a Turn-based 3d scroller.  I felt led the entire time.  I want an open world to explore, shadowruns to do, cyberspace to hack, and random goons/lone star to take out for weapons armor and money.  The thing I loved most about shadowrun was the freedom to just turn it on and try to break into the nearest building and loot it, or mine some data in cyberspace for cash.  This point A to point B style was disappointing.  I don't want to be constantly following the storyline in order to do anything in the game.  I want the freedom to be a shadowrunner.  I'm just glad I still have my Sega and SNES if I want to play a real shadowrun game.			"

												This is good ol' classic Shadowrun, I have a bias, I love the Shadowrun backstory and myth. This game is primarily about two things: First you get a pretty decent campaign and the ability to create all the major Shadowrun character types, it's very story focused and is interlaced with combat sections. It's far more lightweight than most games. The other thing you get is a hell of a powerful editor and the strong likelyhood of an ever expanding pile of 'shadowruns' to go on as people make them. This isn't a game about extreme tactics and strategy, it's fairly deep but the combat isn't the main focus, it's all about the stories. If you liked the SNES version, this is very much like that, if you don't, you might stay away, at least see where folks take this game.			"

												In 2005 an arena combat shadowrun game emerged, it was a tremendous mistake. It singlehandedly destroyed the beautiful and weird property that wizkids had cultivated for tabletop gaming, for an entire digital audience. I salvaged a disc from a bargain bin a few years after it's release, and died a bit inside realizing titles meant nothing. It'd be like going to your favorite restaurant on your birthday, and getting food poisoning.Flash forward to Harebrained's inspired idea to do this franchise right, and goodness did they.The controls are so streamlined you could replace candy crush/angry birds for your toilet gaming habits.The Lore is solid. This game was written by someone who not just played the tabletop, but obsessed over the subject matter so long, that they could re-create the vivid world of megacorporations and magic, and they expanded on it so well, that even their truly inspired players could use their tools to tell their own cyberpunk stories.This game is an accomplishment, not just a successful game- not just a beautiful deluge into the gritty future of fantasy, but the redemption of an entire franchise.

												Shadowrun Returns is a modern take on an old genre we haven't seen much of recently. You might be familiar with the world of Shadowrun. I wasn't before playing this. It's one of the coolest and most well realised fictions I've seen in a while. The writing here is impeccable and will likely make you wish there were more games set in this universe. There's no voice acting, so get ready to read, but I found the world so engaging it wasn't an issue.The combat has taken some ideas from old-school games and some from modern ones like XCOM. It works very well and has deep character trees and customisation options. With the exception of a massive difficulty ramp on the last mission, the combat is quite intriguing.The real strength of this game will likely be in whatever the modding community decides to do with it. The whole thing is just a module launcher similar to Neverwinter Nights. You could tell endless stories within this frame.			"

Beyond that, you get the tools to create your own campaign and play other people's. Many games have this, so why does this game having it warrant anything?Well, as with any RPG based on a pen-and-paper game, there's a plethora of campaigns just waiting to be inserted into this game and a lot are already there. Not only do you get an excellent game in and of itself, you get all of the currently-released and upcoming campaigns that will inevitably come.			"

												If you are looking for a Cyberpunk RPG then this is the game for you, shadowrun returns is a good pickup worth playing. This review is based on core game [no modes] and two playthourghs. For a tl;dr go to the overall score for a summary.The gameplay is the normal turn based stargery with your charater and three others [Unless you want to go alone], choosing a class in the charater creation gives you a basic setup and you can stick to it or mix and match so you could get a mage who is good at punching or a shaman who can hack. There are also some puzzles that can be tackled depending on if you are a certain class, for example I was able to open a door as a shaman by summoning a spirt to spook a person out of the room. The game is not open world but linear which is perfectly ok as it suits the story and theme well. Storywise the games starts out well and is well written. Not to spoil it goes along like this, you are tracking down the killer of a friend who you find out was a serial killer, following a trail you find it who it was and why  but then the plot goes a little iffy for my taste  goes from street merc to Saver of the world.Replailty wise you can play different class or try different ways of sloving a puzzle but everythings the same all dialogue queal to the same thing, nothing changes and the final choice is pretty much the same but different wording.Overall rating I give it 6/10. The game is short as people do say and while everything is the same no matter what  it is worth a buy on sale. While I have not played any of the mods  they would add more to the game.  "

												""Shadowrun Returns"" tells a linear interesting story.You live in this world in the future, where orcs, trolls, magic or advanced tech are common.You are a shadow runner, a gun for hire.You have lots of possibilities what ""class"" your character is using.You may use guns, swords, magic or high tech or mix them all.How about conjuring demons and controlling flying combat drones?Or a mage with a sub machine gun who first makes enemies helpless before he attacks?What ever you chose, it is fun. Depending on your own class, you will have to chose your teammates so, that you can do you mission.The ""story"" levels are real time, you just move around and talk.When the fights start, it is turn based.""Turn based"" does not always go back to real time, when all enemies are dead.You can not exchange items between characters.There are bugs, some are gone after save/load. Some not. None are game breaking.For me, the game kept interesting and fun until the last level.That went on and on and on.It was just boring.Why not tell a story and let the story end.Why do all people think you either need an ""End Boss"" or something like that?You seldom get enough information about the missions.You can do every mission if you have a decker with you,but SOME information would have been nice.I did the last mission with 4 mages with healing, because I had no idea what I had to expect.I thought, would be a much better game with a open world. And generated quests.Then I found this in the workshop:

Nice twists.+ A variety of RPG classes,+ Turn-based squad combat+ linear (I like been told where to go next)Negative points:- Dialog and story is in text (no voice). I almost stopped playing after 20 minutes because of this. I was surprised that it bothered me so much because I usually turn on subtitles. - No  grinding, not many side quests, This sounds good on paper but I had a bad time with a summoner class; each summon cost money. I specialized in summoning and simply couldn't progress at some point. had to create a different character.- Short. Just when you are picking up speed, the game ends. "

												A wonderful RPG, even if the campaign in the base game does it's best to try to convince you otherwise. While many of the major technical and design flaws have been excised, the base campaign is still plagued by level and story design that feels like it's just stringing you along from one too-long fight to the next. It doesn't help that your words, skills, and actions also have very little effect on either the conversation or the campaign level. It's not bad per-say, but I didn't feel terribly invested in the story or characters.The DLC expansion ""Dragonfall"" however is excellent and is everything that the base campaign should have been. It's significantly better designed, with far stronger writing, level design, and campaign structure. In the first hour, I had a far better sense of who my character was, where I was in the world, and was invested in narrative. The world feels much more vibrant and dynamic (even though there's quite a bit of illusion of false choice as is typical of the genre) than the base game. I very highly reccomend that you purchase dragonfall along with the base game. In my opinion, the $30 price of entry for both is a better value than $15 for just the base game. The difference in quality between the two campaigns is stark, and it's very likely you'll bore yourself about a third of the way through the base game and never think to pick up the DLC if you don't buy both and you'd miss out on a great RPG.It's also worth noting that the game has workshop support and is very friendly for creating user-made content including adventures and campaigns ala the original Neverwinter Nights. While I have not tried any of these yet, the content available looks quite promising.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is pretty sweet. A clear reintroduction to the Shadowrun universe with a world-significant and sufficiently grand story. A comfortable, enjoyable strategy turn-based.Dragonfall, however, is the true glorious return. Developed and empathetic characters, a rich and suitably gritty story, genuinely difficult choices. I can't extoll the virtues of this game highly enough.			"

												I bought it yesterday and started playing it. I ended up spending 3 straight hours playing. It's really addictive! The only thing I have found really frustrating is the camera. There could have been better views, and having a fixed POV can make things really frustrating at times. Aside from that, this is an awesome game!			"

												So after completing Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall, I can say with no small amount of enthusiasm that it was one of the best stories I've played through. Despite it's relatively short length (somewhere around 14-20 hours), the writing is superb and almost every character is fleshed out very well - even NPC's that aren't critical to the story. Coupled with the new save system, I can confidently say that it's a much better Shadowrun. The story may not be as deep, but the interactions with your team and neighborhood more than make up for it. Picked it up for $5 on the Steam Sale and it's easilly one of the best five dollars I've ever spent.			"

												Based off the Pen and Paper RPG Shadowrun, this is without a doubt the closest to the pen and paper game you can get without getting papercuts, mountain dew and dice.On to the setting!the super short version: the Love child of Cyberpunk and High Fantasy.the short version: Magic returns after lying dormant for thousands of years turning people into the races from fantasy games/stories and reshaping the politcal and topographical map through war and disasters both natural and otherwise.Corporations are bigger and stronger (go figure) and they and anybody else with the scratch hire shadowrunners to cause and solve problems for them.Guessing you can figure out your role in the game.It's got a good campaign and once that's finished there are plenty more that other people have made and you can make your own.The Expansion's campaign is also very good.

												I played through the entire game in about a week, put about 20 hours into it. I've been playing games for quite a while and I have gotten to that point where few games make me want to came back again and again and be excited to come home from work so I can play it. While Shadowrun Returns didn't quite capture the feeling that I used to get it came pretty close and was a nice reminder of how gaming is supposed to feel. The main story was fun, I am looking forward to popping in a workshop campaign in a few weeks. Mechanics feel good, however with the single button comand style (only left clicks) I found that I made few miss clicks when I should not have but there is an option to change that. I look forward to playing an other class later on and with that in mind I would say that this game does have very good replay value. Take it from a biased gamer who you know nothing about, but for my two cents worth it was worth my 15 bucks.			"

												Great source material, execution has some flaws but overall a fun game.  A bit oversimplified IMO but that also makes it a friendly, unintimidating introduction to the genre.  The combat mechanics are a bit simplistic, especially for ranged weapons--I can't figure out why none of the newer squad based tactical RPGs like this have copied the excellent Jagged Alliance 2 'spend action points to improve aim' model, which is very flexible and intuitive.  If you haven't played that game, go buy it now, it's one of the all-time best in the genre and has aged extremely well.  The magic and drone aspects of Shadowrun combat are well implemented, so props to the developers for integrating everything so well.The story held my interest, though (spoilers)a deus ex machina sweeps in to help you with the final mission, which I found disruptive.  The writing itself is god-awful at times.  It could have used another couple proofreads (it's/its, comma usage) and stylistically it reads like decent internet fan fiction with some crap parts.  If you're going to do a text-heavy game like this, you'd better make damn sure you have the writing chops to do it.  Hire some damn writers, Bioware and Black Isle didn't seem to have this problem way back in the 1990s.Still, a fun ride overall, and the developers did a great job of capturing the universe.  I recommend playing it on 'Very Hard' which puts you on even footing with the enemy but plays more like you would expect 'Normal' or 'Hard' to.  Choose 'Hard' if you're new to this sort of game.			"

Posted: February 28, 2014
												I've loved Shadowrun for a long time. It was my first tabletop rpg, and it helped foster a love of the happy that is going strong today. For those who don't know, Shadowrun is a setting that takes place in a dystopian cyberpunk future. Corporations are more powerful than governments, and most people are either wretchedly poor or corperate wage slaves with no freedom. But there is a twist. As this dystopia began to develop, magic returned to the world, bringing with it Elves, Dwarves, Orks, Trolls... and Dragons. Think Bladerunner meets Dragon Age. You play as shadowrunners, mercenary criminals who live off the grid and do jobs that are too dirty or difficult for the corporations. You are a theif, assasin, or bodygraud on any given day, operating in the shadows and outside the law. I've always thought that this would make a great setting for a video game, but Shadowrun hasn't had too many adaptations: and the ones we did get weren't great. But Harebrained Schemes thought they could deliver, and took to Kickstarter. And deliver they did. I kickstarted Shadowrun Returns, and the end product was worth the investment. It was a good turn base strategy rpg, along the lines of, say, Fallout, though the setting conjures up comparasions to Arcanum: of steamworks and magick obscura (also recomended). The combat was fun, the graphics looked excellent, and importantly to someone like me, the developers clearly understood Shadowrun, a sense that could not be gained from the poorly received X-box shooter of some years ago. But it was good game, if there were several issues that kept it from being great. A save system that didn't work well, and a story that was a little too linear and static for Shadowrun's traditional style. These issues were tempered by a promise of mission packs and expansions, and a robust editor for the community to create missions of their own. Now they've released the first of those mission packs, Dragonfall, and playing it convinced me to write this reveiw. Because where the original game faltered, Dragonfall soars. A rational save system is finally in, and there is more variety to the weapons, cyberware, and other combat options to make things a little more interesting. And, most importantly, the new campaign is exactly what shadowun should be. It's got interesting characters to talk to, both in your team and in the hub where you go in between missions. It's supports player agency, from the runs you choose to go on to the way you solve those runs. Runs themselves are interesting and often dynamic. Each one has signifigant choices, and I had to think hard about seveal of them. While I could have seen more room to roleplay, for the most part I never felt that my character wasnt' represented in the dialouge choices. And while I like the story of the main game, the story in Dragonfall is much better. It made me care about the characters and the situation far more than the orignal. But most of all, it feels like Shadowun. The runs played exactly like runs I might have written myself for the tabletop game, far more so than the first game. And the balence between story based missions and those just for case works much better than the previous as well. All in all, playing Dragonfall felt just like playing a real Shadowrun game. That is what I wanted when I kickstarted, and I will buy whatever DLC they release as long as they maintain that feeling. So, I heartily recomend Shadowrun Returns, but strongly recomend you buy Dragonfall too- in fact, you should probably start with it over the original games campaign, espeically if you are familier with the setting, but thats a personal choice. But is it right for those who don't know Shadowrun? I still think so. The setting is interesting enough to draw people in, and no previous knoweldge is needed for the actual gameplay, which is entertaining even without feeding into that Shadowrun feedback loop I have. That said, the Berlin Free State setting of the game might be a little bit bewildering, as the game doesn't explain all that much (That said, most shadowrun players probably don't know much about Berlin either - Me included- but at least with the background its easier to get up to speed). For those who don't know anything about Shadowrun, and are willing to put up with the weaker (but still good) story, starting with the first game's story might still be better as it is probly friendler to those who are going in blind. tldr: Shadowrun Returns is a good game, but Dragonfall is even better, doubly so for anyone who knows the setting or has played the tabletop game. If you were on the fence before, Dragonfall makes it a good bet.			"

Posted: May 27, 2014
												--UPDATED REVIEW--No doubt about it, Shadowrun Returns is a Shadowrun roleplaying game engine (built on Unity), not a game. The first campaign released was Dead Man's Swtich. The second campaign is Dragonfall. They are fully standalone campaigns and are really where you find the game of Shadowrun Returns. Dragonfall is not ""DLC"". It is, in fact, a more robust, more ambitious and (at least as I played it) twice-as-long campaign compared to its predecessor.This is really important to recognize, especially if you haven't played through Dead Man's Switch, or maybe you didn't like it. It's like playing a roleplaying campaign under two different GMs with two different encounter design styles and stories to tell. You definitely don't have to play Dead Man's Switch at all to enjoy Dragonfall.Since I played Dead Man's Switch, many things have been improved / patched. For instance, scripting in the game's dialog has allowed you to often call on your teammates' skills to help interject in a hacking (decking!) or knowledge based problem. It's not perfect, but it's much, much better. The save system is also now fully featured, which was my biggest complaint about Shadowrun Returns (save when you want, OMG!).I don't really like how little influence you have over your party's inventory, but I kinda like the narrative implication that they are in charge of themselves, and you're fully in charge of what characters get to come with you on your runs.The art style, the characters, the rules, the format, etc. they're all the same as you'd remember from Dead Man's Switch. Where Dragonfall shines uniquely is in providing an environment that is far more free than the campaign of its predecessor. I believe most computer roleplaying game fans will greatly prefer Dragonfall. There is a town hub where you are free to shop and pick up side quests, unlike the compact hideout in Dead Man's Switch. Many combat situations have multiple approaches compared to what Dead Man's Switch offered. The characters are more interesting, have more personality, are more plentiful (and more useful), and are better written than those in the prior campaign (reminds me a lot of Mass Effect 2). The story also goes from the small criminal raids of a simple shadowrunning team to the gigantic world-changing epic story that RPGs are famous for.That said, Dead Man's Switch is still a friendlier, smaller, and more digestible introduction to the Shadowrun world, so I really do recommend playing that campaign first if you're just diving in for the first time.I'd also like to add that in Dead Man's Switch I played a shotgun-toting, robot-driving hacker, which is basically my ideal cyberpunk character idea. I had a great time! I was originally a little underwhelmed with Dragonfall when I started as a melee fighter because it lacked the gimmicks of my prior loadout (but I'll be darned if I only play one archetype in an RPG). In fact, the lackluster start is what kept me from really even playing the game for 4 months. But in the end, I was really impressed with my troll, and he was just as important to my party as my prior character.So yes! If you like RPGs and good writing, play Dragonfall. DO IT!--ORIGINAL REVIEW--This is only the second Kickstarter game I've played. I'm pretty impressed with it, and it really is the kind of game that most publishers would never fund, so I'm excited to have had the opportunity to play it.  I've so far only finished the Dead Man's Switch campaign, so the following points are regarding that campaign only.Here's some bullet points:* The visuals are adequate but not compelling. The high-res handpainted isometric art is impressive for the skill required to execute it. It's retro without being pixillated or limited in palette. VFX are adequate.* Really cool music, though not enough of it. Never became obnoxious but I was blown away in the first couple hours, but heard basically the same music for the rest of the game. Adequate sound, but no voice acting, which would've pushed the reception of the game's narrative over the edge!* The story was really cool with some great twists, though it is linear. It's a lot like a great pen-and-paper campaign. You normally wouldn't replay something like that, so a surface-level appearance of choice and nonlinearity is enough, and as a result I found myself happy with the game. However, if you're looking for the story to change dramatically as a result of your choices, you will be disappointed. There are a few dialog options that will change based on your choices, but they are for flavor only. That's OK with me.* The gameplay is fun. I love turn-based RPG tactics, I just do. I love the positioning and the AOE attacks and managing action points. I like buffs and line-of-sight and overwatch. The game is fully featured in terms of the amount of relevant (and effecitve) skills and choices you have available. You are not locked into a class. Where the gameplay falls short is the dice rolling (like most direct tabletop RPG-to-videogame translations). I hate it when I have an 83% chance to hit a guy and miss twice in a row. Further, I hate when an enemy has a 21% chance to hit me, and it lands. I want my performance to be more predictable and tactical and less dependent on luck. Usually things play out like you'd expect, and so it's okay, but every time the odds are in your favor and you fail, you feel cheated. I hate that.I would be very comfortable recommending Shadowrun Returns except one thing: The abysmal save system. This game will only autosave when you go from one area to another. There is no other way to save than autosaving. Further, as the story and quests are linear, you can't just abuse the auto-save system by going back and forth between locations. The result is that whenever the designer decides that you'll be in one area for a really long time, it means you can't save that whole time. This is remarkably, and frequently, inconvenient. That said, as the game is turn based, most of the time you take are decisions you mull over. Your progress is the result of choices, not usually execution. So losing progress isn't so bad when you die, as you'll quickly be able to repeat your choices that you've already thought through. Still though, in this day and age in gaming, it's a pretty egregious oversight.That said, I would still recommend Shadowrun Returns if only for the wonderful and rare cyberpunk videogame setting, choice driven character systems, and tactical RPG combat.

												*This is a review for Dragonfall, the DLC to Shadowrun and not the original campaign*An absoulute gripping look into the cyberpunk universe and one of the most mesmorizing narratives I've seen this year. Everything Shadowrun's original campaign does, Dragonfall does it three times better. This is a case where you should buy the game, just for the dlc. Your party members (which you don't have in the original shadowrun campaign, thanks) all have a plethora of fascinating backstories and dialogue choices. The game takes place in Berlin which uses a completely unique politcal structure for government combined with beautiful enviroments that just make the game feel real, even though it's such a stylized version of a mystical future. The decsions you make later in the game are excruciatingly hard. Dragonfall doesn't treat you like an omnipotent god that makes all the right choices. This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ world with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ choices to make and if you mess up too bad, everyone suffers for it. There was one choice in particular I had to stop playing for about 20 minutes to decide what I should even do. The gameplay is exactly the same as the original campaign or Xcom unknown so no real changes there. This is a game you need to play if your into old RPGs, well constructed plotlines and characters, and if your a fan of sci fi or cyberpunk, no exceptions if you meet any of these guide lines -Enjoy			"

												I am very happy with Shadowrun Returns. I think the game lives up to the hype. I am a passionate fan of the Super Nintendo Shadowrun game (which I've been playing for over twenty years!) and playing Shadowrun Returns feels like a homecoming. It is very reminiscent of the SNES game, but very contemporary and modern, of course.The combat and puzzles are of medium challenge (just right for me when I played on the game's easy level of difficulty) and the storytelling is good. The visual design and music are extremely well done. There is a well-balanced blend of exploring and fighting. I finished the game in about twenty-four hours of playing time, with only a couple of mission ""do overs."" A quicker and more skilled player might take about twenty hours to finish. I’d like the game to be longer, but that is hardly a legitimate complaint, merely a fond wish and a desire for more of a good thing. I noticed no flaws in the game other than a rash of minor typos about halfway through, mostly in dialogue windows. The only real problem I had was some serious lag in combat scenarios featuring about eight or more characters on screen, but my system, while of good quality, is not a gaming rig, and I'm running only the minimum 2GB of RAM the game recommends. The turn-based system employed in Shadowrun Returns made the lag easily tolerable.In my first play-through I found that playing my character with thoughtfulness and manners gained me lots of karma. The option to be a hardcore, coldblooded merc is always there, but I can't say how taking that tack affects the gameplay. My key to success in combat was always being smart with in-combat strategy. No matter what mistakes I made with equipping or tactics, or how my luck went when the fighting began, I was always able to overcome by making good strategic decisions.Thanks to everyone involved in making the game. Great job!			"

												The graphics are hipster retro, but the game world feels true to the cyberpunk genre - even with the addition of magic.  Once I got past the premise that allows magic, there is a lot to like from a story point of view. Thus, the edition of the game with the downloadable sound track and collection of background stories turns out to be a decent buy - but heed the warning . . . there be spoilers in the backstories.  The turn-based tactical combat portion of the game is a lot of fun, and is more varied than what is on offer from the XCOM revival game.  There are some negatives.  The check point based save games are pure suck, but not enough so to completely ruin the game. The leveling system may prove too limited to sustain really large community DLC projects, but that may be by design as the module that ships with the game is a little too short to justify the game's price on its own merits.  This is the most legitmate criticism of the game in my opinion.  There is just too little on offer for the price of the game.Put another way, the game design lends itself to modules that are more like short stories and less like full lengh novels.  Since the game only ships with one relatively short module, one does get the feeling that one has paid for full lengh novel and only received a short story in return.  This is also bad news if you would prefer to carry the same character through from module to module - this just doesn't seem possible as you would effectively need to start skill development over with each module. There are hacks around this limitation, but then play balance is shot to heck.Speaking of play balance, decking does not seem like a particularly viable solo class and the adept class is only marginally better.  If you want to play as a decker or an adept, try a multi-class design instead.  Longer modules might yield enough levels for the adpet class to be viable, but there is no such hope for the poor decker.  There were other balance issues that have been fixed in later patches. My impression is that the DLC community may not be large enough to produce enough quality DLC to even the ""value for dollar spent"" score.  However, I am not comfortable saying that community DLC won't get there . . . it just may take a very long time.  If you are a frugal gamer, check back in a year or so.			"

												I am a long standing fan of Shadowrun. I played it on Sega back in the day when it came out. Always loved the idea and the feel behind it. I've read the books, I've played the PnP game; heck, the first book I wrote was based in that universe. So it is no wonder I love this game. The freedom of choice and the nestalgic feel of what was once loved so dearly. Microcrap could have taken some inspiration from these guys. This is how Shadowrun is played. My only dream is to have a Co-Op Shadowrun game someday that is something like this, or maybe even FPS if that got it made.			"

												I played Shadowrun with a great group of friends back in the late eighties.  We were fortunate to have an awesome GM that could really develop a great and exciting story.  As I played through Shadowrun Returns and the DLC, Showdowrun: Dragonfall, I kept thinking back to the old days of paper, dice, beer and game sessions that would last well into the early morning hours.  Shadowrun Returns captures exactly what it was like in the old pen and paper days, minus the friends, unfortunately.  The world is rich and refreshingly different from other game settings.Combat can be exicting, but not very deep.  The are many character archetypes to play, but development of a character's skillset is sparse.  Those with little knowelege of the Shadowrun setting may also find themselves lost as to what is going on with the story.  The first adventure, The Dead Man's Switch, was a little slow for me to get into.  However, for those familar with the Seattle area will enjoy some of the local references and themes.  The second adventure, Dragonfall (a seperate DLC), was realy good and grabbed me right away.  It improved on many of the game mechanics, had more interesting characters, and had a more interesting story.Overall, the game was very good.  It isn't very expensive and provides many hours of play.  Shadowrun Returns has that old pen and paper feel to it, which I enjoy very much.  Give it a try, especially if it is on sale.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a light tactical RPG focusing on story and pretty graphics. The game is fairly short (~10h), but just the right length to not overstay its welcome.The gameplay elements are fairly simple as far as Tactical RPGs go, and those looking for challenging and meaningful systems should look elsewhere. It is still entertaining though, and perfect for those looking for a more casual experience.The real meat of the game is the story, the setup and the writing. The plot is of a noir detective style with conspirations and social commentaries mixed in, well written, served by beautifully hand painted 2D graphics.The only complaint would be that such an interesting universe: a blend between Blade Runner and D&D, deserved a more traditional, long lasting, content rich RPG. As it is the game is highly enjoyable as a little tread, but it's missing momentum, exploration and more involving combat. Well worth on a Steam sale though.			"

And it is a lineer one, but still there are enjoyable and strange characters. And the naration part of the story feels like you are playing a tabletop rpg.

												I bought this game having played Dragonfall (stand-alone) and was very disappointed. I expected going 'backward' from Dragonfall would miss out on some UI improvements and such but I was shocked at how short, basic and uninteresting Shadowrun Returns storyline was. The story was poor to say the least; I won't spoil it but I genuinely thought I was in the prologue or something until the 'final boss'... I completed this game in 11 hours, despite seeking all little side quests (it feels like there were none) and talking to everyone possible (much less than Dragonfall). I do not recommend buying this game today but STRONGLY recommend Shadowrun: Dragonfall, which despite being a ""small standalone story"" is infinitely better, more interesting and took me over twice as long to complete. At only £2.20 in a sale it's arguably alright but still, knowing what I do now I'd have skipped the game completely.			"

												Just to be clear, this is not the second coming of Baldur's Gate.  I'd love to go off on a rant regarding the relative merits of both games, but I suppose only that one fact needed to be addressed.  Avoiding spoilers, I can at least say that all missed opportunities in Shadowrun Returns made me better appreciate what the old classic of tabletop-to-computer gaming did right.With that said, I still recommend Shadowrun Returns as a well crafted experience as long as expectations are kept realistic. Made by a relatively small team with (relatively) limited resources, the potential that shines through this game makes me excited for upcoming projects, despite some sloppy execution and limited story.  The fact that they provided all the editor tools and the campaign level design files is also really neat, and there is a strong user community around custom content creation.			"

												In a sentence: a tactical noir murder mystery set in the Shadowrun universe. I loved playing the tabletop game in the 90s but it took me a long time to buy this since the last LAST Shadowrun game was so horrible (okay, it wasn't bad as FPS go but that completely defeated the purpose of setting it in the Shadowrun Universe). I'm not all the way finished with the main quest yet but have been immensely enjoying this game, both for the way the plot falls out (if a little predictably) and for the nostalgia of character building and the fun of the universe. I'm not really sold on the tactical combat -- it's never been my thing -- and even on easy mode I've had more than a few wipes. I also get a little frustrated when hiring runners because I'd like more control over the party and party skills (though it's possible that might come later? I hope?). Still, the game was definitely worth the money during the Steam sale and just the five hours I've played so far made me go ahead and buy the expansion too.			"

												This was the Shadowrun I wanted when I couldn't get *into* it back on the SNES. The story is deep but easy to get into, and while the engine feels sluggish, four hours in my first sitting is an excellent indicator of how engrossing this world is. I've heard it described as the 'weakest' of the rebooted series, but that is only a testament its success.What's fun:- Intelligent, thoughtful and entertaining writing- Fantastic character design and visual astectic- Thematic, moody music that is unintrusive- Dresden- Combat is fluid and engaging- Smooth difficulty curve with a storyline around which you are the focusWhat's not fun:- The interface is very bsaic; getting the job done and requiring more of a learning curve than the gameplay- Cover based combat is introduced without any guide- Shopping can be confusing as you can't see what's in your inventory at the same time (a feature in RPGs since the early 90s)The 'not fun' aspects are very minor quibbles as I easily found the patience to learn the system. It's nice to see a game that doesn't insult its playerbase, as games often do. Having to remember and/or double check your inventory before purchases is hardly a chore.Any fan of cyberpunk and fantasy needs to give this one a try, and it can be had quite affordably via various bundles online.What are you waiting for?

												I've just finished the second one of these game 'Dragonfall' and intend to start the third straight away later tonight! These games offer so much to the player who likes a 'story'. If your an impatient conversation/cutscene clicker then simply DONT buy these games, you will get so little from them! But if you like to get your teeth into a decent storyline, turn based combat and a polished product then these games may well serve you well. The Shadowrun universe is compelling and interesting. It's not your run of the mill fantasy/sci fi fair, it's rich deep and complex and the PDF that comes with this first game goes quite a way into giving you some of the details. Again this is for people who like to delve and read lore, those who care about backstories and where their characters will be adventuring. The graphic style of the game I think is perfect! The detailed world is welcoming, it draws you in and the art team have done so well in bringing the Shadowrun World to lfe. It's hand drawn feel adding to its charm. Character progression is good, although a little linear feeling, in that like most games nowadays you need to build your characters in certain ways to really get the most out of them. That said theres plenty of different ways to build your character and enouigh difference in the classes to keep you interested. I played the first game as a Decker and had plenty to do as I progressed through the game and I played the second as a Rigger and again found the gameplay excellent. The second game is better than the first and theres no requirement to play the first, they are standalone stories but if you were to skip this first game you would be skipping some of the best narrative there is out there today. Harebrained schemes obviously care about their writing because it's very profesional, head and shoulders above most similar games out there. The game isn't perfect. It's short (which can be forgiven as a first foray into a new universe - the second is MUCH longer and even better written, if thats poossible.) and it has anoying ommisions of functionality that we come to expect as game players.  You cant for example swap out inventory items between team mates, often leading to frustration because wanted items are passed to your 'stash' rather than simply handing them to another team member who has room for them! An odd choice of how to do things that sadly made it into the second game too!Aside from some other small niggles I find it hard to say bad things abaout this game, and its sequel Dragonfall because I had so much fun playing them.Do yourself a favour, buy them! TL:DR - This game is not for you.  "

												I just finished this game. Considering it was a kickstarter project for a game made in a old PnP setting that been pretty much dead as far as I know, they done a decent job. The setting itself is interesting. Steampunk with elves and trolls. The gameplay is turnbased and the perspective is isometric. What I think was the good parts is as said the setting, the world itself feels very interesting. Turn based and isometric is also a nice touch to see but more games been doing that of late. Someone changing it up from all the third person action oriented RPGs of late. The graphics are not top notch tripple A high budget but it got its own charm anyway. The bad sides to me is how short it is and the lack of exploration. The game is pretty linear. But from my understanding it is pretty much like the old Neverwinter Nights campaign, a tool to show what the toolset can do and what kind of things any player can create.If I would grade it I would give it somewhere between 6,5 to a 7 out of 10. Which is above average! With todays corrupt gaming journalism and inflated grade systems, this might look like a bad grade but it is really above average. Which is a good thing.			"

												This is a Cyberpunk style Turn-based RPG game as it is labeled, but beyond that, it is actually a 'detective' game with fantastic writing and in-depth futuristic settings.You follow the wish of your deceased buddy to investigate a simple murder but somehow stumble upon a tremendous conspiracy threatening all mankind behind this.The gameplay is basically linear, and often you won't find too many stuff to interact with, So I wouldn't recommend this game to Sandbox RPG lovers. But believe me, if you play this game, you would feel like you are actually reading an amazing novel with complicated plots and descriptive details.9/10 would name my Character after my daughter again.

												I do recommend this game. Warning though...This is an old school roleplaying game, set in a classic pen and paper RPG background, and it is focused on two features : nice writing/storytelling and nice turn by turn tactical combats. That's it.The two of them are great, especially the writing. You could say the art direction is somewhat strange but interesting, as every piece of level art is actually painted by hand. The mix of 2D and 3D works good enough.But good tactical combats, funny art and great writing doesn't exactly cut it. The hidden strengh of Shadowrun Returns lies in its Editor. The first campaign is actually a (very nice and long) showroom for the level editor. Very good content has already been made by the community and it is far from over. This is a cyberpunk-ish roleplaying game that keeps on giving.If you're not into User Generated Content and Steam workshop, you might want to wait until it gets cheaper. If you're into roleplaying games, if you know the shadowrun universe, or if you crave to create your own stories, just buy the damn game already!			"

												I just finished this game. Considering it was a kickstarter project for a game made in a old PnP setting that been pretty much dead as far as I know, they done a decent job. The setting itself is interesting. Steampunk with elves and trolls. The gameplay is turnbased and the perspective is isometric. What I think was the good parts is as said the setting, the world itself feels very interesting. Turn based and isometric is also a nice touch to see but more games been doing that of late. Someone changing it up from all the third person action oriented RPGs of late. The graphics are not top notch tripple A high budget but it got its own charm anyway. The bad sides to me is how short it is and the lack of exploration. The game is pretty linear. But from my understanding it is pretty much like the old Neverwinter Nights campaign, a tool to show what the toolset can do and what kind of things any player can create.If I would grade it I would give it somewhere between 6,5 to a 7 out of 10. Which is above average! With todays corrupt gaming journalism and inflated grade systems, this might look like a bad grade but it is really above average. Which is a good thing.			"

												I've just finished the second one of these game 'Dragonfall' and intend to start the third straight away later tonight! These games offer so much to the player who likes a 'story'. If your an impatient conversation/cutscene clicker then simply DONT buy these games, you will get so little from them! But if you like to get your teeth into a decent storyline, turn based combat and a polished product then these games may well serve you well. The Shadowrun universe is compelling and interesting. It's not your run of the mill fantasy/sci fi fair, it's rich deep and complex and the PDF that comes with this first game goes quite a way into giving you some of the details. Again this is for people who like to delve and read lore, those who care about backstories and where their characters will be adventuring. The graphic style of the game I think is perfect! The detailed world is welcoming, it draws you in and the art team have done so well in bringing the Shadowrun World to lfe. It's hand drawn feel adding to its charm. Character progression is good, although a little linear feeling, in that like most games nowadays you need to build your characters in certain ways to really get the most out of them. That said theres plenty of different ways to build your character and enouigh difference in the classes to keep you interested. I played the first game as a Decker and had plenty to do as I progressed through the game and I played the second as a Rigger and again found the gameplay excellent. The second game is better than the first and theres no requirement to play the first, they are standalone stories but if you were to skip this first game you would be skipping some of the best narrative there is out there today. Harebrained schemes obviously care about their writing because it's very profesional, head and shoulders above most similar games out there. The game isn't perfect. It's short (which can be forgiven as a first foray into a new universe - the second is MUCH longer and even better written, if thats poossible.) and it has anoying ommisions of functionality that we come to expect as game players.  You cant for example swap out inventory items between team mates, often leading to frustration because wanted items are passed to your 'stash' rather than simply handing them to another team member who has room for them! An odd choice of how to do things that sadly made it into the second game too!Aside from some other small niggles I find it hard to say bad things abaout this game, and its sequel Dragonfall because I had so much fun playing them.Do yourself a favour, buy them! TL:DR - This game is not for you.  "

												This was the Shadowrun I wanted when I couldn't get *into* it back on the SNES. The story is deep but easy to get into, and while the engine feels sluggish, four hours in my first sitting is an excellent indicator of how engrossing this world is. I've heard it described as the 'weakest' of the rebooted series, but that is only a testament its success.What's fun:- Intelligent, thoughtful and entertaining writing- Fantastic character design and visual astectic- Thematic, moody music that is unintrusive- Dresden- Combat is fluid and engaging- Smooth difficulty curve with a storyline around which you are the focusWhat's not fun:- The interface is very bsaic; getting the job done and requiring more of a learning curve than the gameplay- Cover based combat is introduced without any guide- Shopping can be confusing as you can't see what's in your inventory at the same time (a feature in RPGs since the early 90s)The 'not fun' aspects are very minor quibbles as I easily found the patience to learn the system. It's nice to see a game that doesn't insult its playerbase, as games often do. Having to remember and/or double check your inventory before purchases is hardly a chore.Any fan of cyberpunk and fantasy needs to give this one a try, and it can be had quite affordably via various bundles online.What are you waiting for?

												In a sentence: a tactical noir murder mystery set in the Shadowrun universe. I loved playing the tabletop game in the 90s but it took me a long time to buy this since the last LAST Shadowrun game was so horrible (okay, it wasn't bad as FPS go but that completely defeated the purpose of setting it in the Shadowrun Universe). I'm not all the way finished with the main quest yet but have been immensely enjoying this game, both for the way the plot falls out (if a little predictably) and for the nostalgia of character building and the fun of the universe. I'm not really sold on the tactical combat -- it's never been my thing -- and even on easy mode I've had more than a few wipes. I also get a little frustrated when hiring runners because I'd like more control over the party and party skills (though it's possible that might come later? I hope?). Still, the game was definitely worth the money during the Steam sale and just the five hours I've played so far made me go ahead and buy the expansion too.			"

												So, after many breaks, I finally finished this game.I suppose up front I should say I don't have nearly enough time for games as I used to.  So being able to actually finish an RPG in around 10 hours was a very enjoyable experience.  Not every RPG needs to be epic, you know?  I don't remember what I paid for this, I think I got it in a Humble Bundle, but $15 seems about right for this.Now I'm not familiar with Shadowrun at all.  But this game did a good job of easing me in.  The world building was relatively minimal, and didn't hold things up too horribly.  In fact, I think the world building was appropriately spread out and well integrated into the game.  No audio logs you listen to while doing other things in this game.  Or worse, audio logs you listen to unable to do anything else.  I'm looking at you Mass Effect.I perhaps could have used a bit more of a combat tutorial.  I didn't realize until halfway through the game that I could overwatch, or that I could command my guys in any order I wanted.  But perhaps I should have Read The ♥♥♥♥ing Manual instead.  On second glance, there doesn't appear to BE a manual...Combat did start to get a bit repetitive towards the end.  Equipment wasn't too glamorous either.  But I think my biggest complaint is that I never got attached to any of the hirelings you can get.  Well, except for Coyote.  But for the most part, your team will just consist of a rotating cast of randos, with maybe a story required NPC.  It really hurt my engagement in the somewhat stale combat.  I had my guy, who I cared about, and then 3 bags of meat.That being said, at the end of the day I really enjoyed this game.  It took me a few months to stop being distracted by other games and actually finish this one.  The reptitive combat may have contributed to that.  But the story was interesting enough to keep me coming back.  And the story really does wind and twist through some interesting nooks and crannies.  Probably the strongest aspect of this game, aside from the generally creative setting.Probably not the strongest recommendation, but it's still a recommendation all the same.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a wonderful nostalgia trip that feels like a loveletter to every fan of the old SNES Shadowrun game. The graphics are smooth and fresh, the various gameplay systems are streamlined without being dumbed down, and the writing is amazing, full of wit and subtle touches that tell more about the world than endless exposition would. The only real complaint I have about the game is that the music gets *incredibly* repetative. I haven't yet played Dragonfall, so this might just be a flaw in the Dead Man's Switch module.			"

												So, the Shadowrun world is entirely new to me.  I never played the SNES Shadowrun game, and I definitely didn't know until recently that Shadowrun started out as a Dungeon and Dragons style table top game in the late 80's/early 90's.  Only a few minutes into the game, I could tell that this is a well developed universe, one that could be better appreciated by those who have been involved in the Shadowrun lore for years.  Not to say I'm not impressed.  Like I said, I'm completely new to this world.  But that's what makes this game immediately addicting.  It has it's own world and immediately pulls you right into it.  Yes, you can feel like a foreigner at first, but not for long.  The game starts when you receive a message from an old friend, Sam Watts, who pre-informs you of his death through a video message which is sent to you upon his death.  Your mission is to investigate who killed him and find out who this ""Ripper"" character is.  As you investigate Sam Watts murder, you get pulled more and more into the underground world of Shadowrun, discovering more of the secrets of Sam Watts, as well as the other characters you meet.For me, I enjoy a good RPG.  Typically, I have trouble getting into turn based RPGs anymore.  Despite that this game is turn based, there is a strategy element that gives it more depth.  You're not just attacking, healing, and casting magic.  You have to anticipate the movements of your enemies and use your surroundings to your advantage.  There is also a bit of a puzzle element, too, as you must search your surroundings and use items to get past certain areas.Shadowrun is a nice blend of fantasy with cyberpunk.  I wish I could have emersed myself in this universe before, but I feel fortunate that I can experience it for the first time.  So even if you are not already familiar with Shadowrun, I suggest downloading this game.  It will definitely keep you hooked for hours.			"

												It is hard to rate this game as a whole.  On one hand, I found the writing to be excellent.  Several twists, it kept me interested.  All the dialog choices are mostly just cosmetic though.  There is no real reactivity or plot branches based on your responses.  The combat is the weak point in my opinion.  It isn't very challenging and seems to get a bit repetitive.  Overall, I really did enjoy the game and it is well worth the money.  I bought the expansion as well.  It is better.  It has better writing and many quests have morally ambiguous choices to make at the end.  The combat is still weak, but enjoyable.  I recommend it.  It is well worth the asking price, even if not on sale.  Support the indies.  8/10			"

												I'm impressed with Shadowrun Returns. While the core adventure may seem brief to some (roughly 12 hours of continuous play), the ambience is reminiscent of the old pen-and-paper Shadowrun I played so long ago and adored. Furthemore, there seems to be a respectable, growing listing of user-built content and adventures, free to download here under Steam Workshop.  Most surprising to me is that SR runs smoothly at 1366x768 resolution on my old 2009 Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop running Ubuntu 12.04, with only a mere integrated Intel GMA 4500MHD; Intel Core 2 Duo (2.0 GHz x 2), 2 Gb RAM DDR2 800Mhz.

												A decent singleplayer RPG set in the Shadowrun universe. Do not expect the Genesis Shadowrun. This game is very linear and does not allow any real form of exploration or deviation from the story task at hand. Combat is FFT-esque and pretty fun. The campaign is designed to take a character from nothing to maxed out over a rather short period of time, so don't expect to build up your character over multiple user-made campaigns or anything like that. Worth $5 if it's on sale and you like Shadowrun.			"

												Shadowrun returns is a fairly good game but I might be biased as a fan of the franchise so to speak. There are many familiar things in this game for those who have played the pen and paper rpg.The game is fairly short in itself, but community created content can bring more bang for your buck so no worries. The dead man's switch is a pretty short and limited storyline, but I thought it had pretty good replayability value. The graphics and music are decent enough and the game worked pretty well for me. I had some minor problems with the attack animation of my main character being delayed in one place and it appears I'm not the only one. So some glitches still remain. Hopefully future patches will fix these.The setting is nice and the storytelling is pretty good. Overall I really enjoyed Shadowrun returns. I think this game deserves some serious thought for people who know the setting already but it might night be such a good purchase for others.			"

												So I've had a few people ask me what I think of the game so I thought I would right a review. I have not finished the game at the time of writing this. So far I am enjoying it. While I know about the Shadowrun franshise others my not. This game plays alot like X-com but with a Deux Ex feel to the world.  It is a Cyberpunk D&D setting. Graphics are good, I haven't had any problems with bugs, the story so far is good. I haven't figured it out yet but I am starting to put things together. Replayablity should be good with having 5-6 class's and races to pick from. At the $5-$7.50 range Its worth picking up if your working with a small bugdet.UPDATEI finnished the story took 24 hours, I play slow I would say its about 8-12 hours for normal speed. Overall It was worth the $5 though the real Gem has turned out to be the DLC, the story and world is alot more fleshed out, new EQ more side quests I would say pick it (the DLC) when its in the $7.50-$10 range.

Walking around can be a bit tedious, and the healing especially is obnoxious, which can lead to a bit of frustration.

												If you're a fan of the tabletop you should find at least a bit of pleasure out of this, if in nothing but the character creation. The included scenario is fun, but doesn't demand much replay, and while there is plenty of player generated content the basic premise can get old pretty fast. (Visit fixer, get qeust, kill baddies, return to fixer, repeat) Combined with the pretty hefty load times when going from zone to zone it can make the game drag.

												Shadowrun returns is a fairly good game but I might be biased as a fan of the franchise so to speak. There are many familiar things in this game for those who have played the pen and paper rpg.The game is fairly short in itself, but community created content can bring more bang for your buck so no worries. The dead man's switch is a pretty short and limited storyline, but I thought it had pretty good replayability value. The graphics and music are decent enough and the game worked pretty well for me. I had some minor problems with the attack animation of my main character being delayed in one place and it appears I'm not the only one. So some glitches still remain. Hopefully future patches will fix these.The setting is nice and the storytelling is pretty good. Overall I really enjoyed Shadowrun returns. I think this game deserves some serious thought for people who know the setting already but it might night be such a good purchase for others.			"

												This is a game where I wish there was a third option between ""recommend"" and ""not recommend"". But I guess I am engaged with the game enough to keep playing it, so I am going the ""recommend"" route.To begin with, this game is my introduction to the Shadowrun IP. I never played the tabletop RPG, nor any of the other related video games. And really, this particular blend of genres doesn't really do it for me. If you don't know, in the world of Shadowrun, magic and fantasy-type races typical in most fantasy (orcs, trolls, elves, dwarves) genres have ""re-awakened"" in a futuristic, cyberpunk setting. So basically, you've got elves casting spells alongside cyborgs hacking their way through cyberspace. For me, this is just a mashup that I don't find that intriguing, though I can see how some might think it's really cool. So then, what pulled me in to trying out this RPG with turn-based combat? I guess it was the beautiful visuals of the isometric maps. The game world is very pleasingly portrayed in great detail.Unfortunately, you can't interact with much in the game world except for certain areas (hotspots denoted by various icons) where you need to search for plot-specific items that you need to advance the story, or when you need to talk to someone, or open a door. And here I'll point out one of the minor technical gripes I have with this game. Sometimes when I try to click on one of these interaction icons (to open a door, for example) the game doesn't respond to the click. It seems like it happens when my character is moving from one point to another. If my character is in motion, then clicking on a ""open door icon"" isn't going to work most of the time until the character stops moving. Minor nuisance, I guess.The other thing I don't like about the game is the inventory system, which I find confusing.There is only so much stuff that you can carry and so you have a stash for anything you don't currently have equipped. However, when going on a mission, you usually have one or more other characters going with you and they each have their own inventories. However, sometimes in the game, it seems like these other characters have their own stashes, but it's not clear to me how to access their stashes. Furthermore, when you go to hire these other characters in your party, you have to commit to the team you've just hired and then embark on the mission. You can't hire your team and then go buy equipment for them. You have to by all the weapons, health packs, spells, fetishes, etc. BEFORE you hire your team but then, how are you going to know which gun, for example, will be most effective with which team member when you haven't hired your team yet to look at their stats. Even when I have tried to buy ahead of time for team roles I am going to hire, when I get to the ""loadout"" screen before embarking on a mission, I try to equip these things on various characters, and then either don't show up (presumably because the character isn't skilled enough to use the item) or they are incompatible with some other item that the character already has. But there is not enough information provided to the player to know what spells, items, etc are or are not compatible with which characters.Here's an example, I bought some grenades and when I tried to equip them on my shaman, I got this message that said that the item I was trying to quip was not compatible with the level 5 summon elemental spell the shaman already had equipped? Uh, why exactly? I have no idea.Not to harp on the inventory problem too much, but here is another example. My character is a decker (a hacker class) and I have leveled up to where I can use better decks(like a portable hacking keyboard or laptop) that hold more ESPs (Expert Systems Programs) and other programs to help me hack in cyberspace. But I have never been able to figure out how to get those programs that I buy from my stash INTO my deck. So I usually end up hacking in cyberspace without any of these useful aids.So other than the beautiful graphics, I have to say that the writing is pretty good in this game. The character dialog makes the characters have their own personalities, and their motivations are usually clear. The load times between ""areas"" of the game can feel long at times, but there is usually some good flavor text that gives you some setting and atmosphere for the area you are entering. The story is pretty engaging and starts out as a story about bringing your friend's murderer to justice, but through some twists and turns ends up in the familiar, ""save-the-world-from-some-evil-from-beyond"" territory.The turn-based combat is also pretty good and implements a cover system. You have plenty of options when it comes to fighting: melee (fists, bats, swords), ranged (pistols, machine guns, grenades), AoE attacks (some spells and grenades), and buffs and debuffs (in the form of spells or various drug-like substances). Shamans can summon elementals to fight for them, but at a risk. These summoned pets might decide to rebel against their masters and then you have one more enemy on the map to fight.So even though I have some gripes about this game, I guess overall I would recommend it for those who like isometric RPGs with turn-based combat. I am not sure if fans of Shadowrun will think this game does the IP justice or not, but to me it seems like they would like this game.UPDATED: So here's my final word after finishing ""Dead Man's Switch"". I bought the game for 5 bucks and it gave me 18 hours of basically good gameplay and a good story. But I have no desire to play it again which is a shame because usually with a good RPG, like Skyrim for example, I would want to play it through again trying out a different character which would allow me to experience the story again with a different play style. Also, I have no desire to try out the Dragonfall DLC nor any other player made content that is out there. I guess the game world didn't captivate me enough to make me want to live out other stories within it.			"

												Shadowrun Returns brings the Sixth World triumphantly back to the video game medium. While the setting has always enjoyed a cultish, global fanbase, this game offers strangers to it a chance not only to get a solid feel for its essence, but also to enjoy an all-around good game. The fruits of the Shadowrun Returns kickstarter have been sweet indeed, and new updates keep making them even sweeter. From veteran runners of the pen & paper or console shadows, to anyone looking to enjoy a nice indie game brought into being by the hopes, donations, and hard work of many -- I highly recommend this fun and celebrated game.

												Turn based tactical rpg by a somewhat inexperienced studio, i still enjoyed this one. Closest thing to  Shadowrun pen and paper so far with room to grow. Regarding the initial campaign many people consider it a mixed bag. Story was mostly well done, tone of the setting was excellent, character developement was good, though some skills such as decking not utilized to their full potential in this initial campaign. A bit short. Overall i enjoyed it for what it is. A decent first effort at bringing back e shadowrun rpg. An editor is included and community content is available at varying stages of finish. An expansion is on the near horizon that fixes the save system( from current checkpoint system to new anywhere save)  and ought to expand the gameplay and campaign linearity. Curious to see what gets built on this foundation.edit 6/16/14;  having played through the dragonfall expansion i felt the need to add that it is an improvement over the base game in most every way. such as party members able to use their own skills to make skill checks now, and improved cohesive story, and somewhat more open campaign. i highly recommend  checking out dragonfall as well, or at least the reviews of it. something to consider when purchasing this.

												An amazing throwback to the days of Jagged Alliance and Fallout 1&2. Top down isometric view, turn based combat, extremely well written dialogue choices and a great set of skills to customise. The main storyline is around 10 to 12 hours depending on your reading speed and difficulty. Some of the best writing I've seen in an RPG, with a built in editor with plenty of community created content to make almost unlimited play time. Very highly recommended, especially when you consider this isn't a £35 release. I'd still be extremely happy if this was a full price production.			"

												I have heard of Shadowrun, and I have played the roleplay game only a couple of times. My friends prefer Vampire or DnD. I played the game with no expectations other than it looked pretty, and I got it on sale. The game had very pretty backgrounds, but the sory was very linear. There were hardly any side missions, and you had to do them as soon as you got them. There was no exploring of the world, which would have been nice. I would have liked to get to know some of the people who were in my party besides Coyote.I liked the character customization part. The fighting style was tactics, which I usually do not like, but Shadowrun Returns did it well. Overall the game was fun, and Dragonfall is supposed to be much better, or at least that is what i have heard. "

												I loved the original game on Sega many years ago. So i was thrilled to try this new game. It has some flaws, as it is short and very linear, no voice acting, checkpoints system. Also the matrix/decking mode is just the same turn-based combat with a different skin. Would love to see the original matrix combat. But it is still a little gem with interesting story, characters, nice combat system and visuals. And i've heard the Dragonfall DLC is even better and more refined (with more side quests and choices).UPDATE: Dragonfall DLC is just amazing. So much better plot and twists. A lot of hard choises to be made, better selection of side quests, a whole town region to live in, lots of interesting characters. And you can now save the game whenever you want :)			"

Dead Man's Switch was the first campaign and has mucho retro nostalgia to it, Dragonfall is a more polished and classical weaving Shadowrun campaign. Both are well written. You get to make a shadowrunner of custom class/race/appearance and level them up in a slimmed-down version of the tabletop's character development rules.

I bought it because I used to play the pen and paper rpg version of Shadowrun a long, long time ago (2nd edition, if that means anything to you), and got curious about Returns. It _is_ old school indeed, and it _is_ clumsy a bit here and there (though the patches have improved a great many things), but it definitely _is_ Shadowrun. So much so that playing this game made me want to play the pnp version as well again. I'm definitely looking forward to playing the second installment, Dragonfall, in the near future.

												The first section of this review is regarding the Dragonfall DLC campaign, as of originally writing this review, I had not touched the original Dead Man's Swtich campaign, so keep that in mind when reading. Theres a second section that covers Dead Man's Switch.DragonfallTo start, it's a good game. A really good one. It feels like a CRPG from over a decade ago, and I say that in the best way possible. It honestly feels like it could have been made by Troika, and I say that in both a good and bad way.What do I mean by ""both a good an a bad way""? Well, the game has some good writing, genuinely interesting characters, and a sold cobat system. The game is also buggy, but not so much that it's game breaking.When speaking of a the combat system, we're looking at a very XCOM esque sort of feel complete with grid-based movement and overwatch for helping to keep areas locked down. You'll likely often find yourself moving your characters from cover to cover while pushing forward and taking down enemies. The combat system works on a cooldown system for abilities, in which once an ability is used, it cannot be reused for X number of turns. All in all, the game actually offers satisfying tactical RPG experience complete with guns, magic, and swords. In terms of the bugs well, here's a few examples. At one point in the game I had a set of side objecties. Those objectives disappeared from my mission log, which from my expericne, shouldn't happen, but fortunately that did not prevent me from completing those side objectives and getting the payout from them. At another point in the game, a character I was talking to repeated dialogue from earlier on in the game when I spoke to her. It seemed clear that that piece of dialogue should not have been spoken, as it completely went against the more recent gdialogue I had just had with her (as in, literally seconds before). Also, not really a bug, but movement can be finickey if you want to move a charater to a tile behind another character, since the game will generally select the other character rather than move the one you wanted to move.Writing is... pretty subjective obviously, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I really liked all of the characters, I found converstations interesting, I liked learning about the past of my companions, and I liked watching them grow as I continued to run with them. The chararacter aren't exactly super dynamic, as there'll never be huge changes  in their personality, but still, as you converse with them, you can tell they're growing, which is actually more than I can say for quite a few other titles in the genre. The game also offers a number of superficial choices, in that you can't actually alter the course of the story, but it will still give you feedback about the effects of your decisions in terms of the world around you, so while it doesn't change the storyline, it still feels like it has an impact. Aside from that, doing things one way over another may provide more karma (experience) or money.In any case, I bought the game on sale, so betwen the original title plus the Dragonfall DLC, I ended up spending around 15 USD, and it was most certainly worth that and more. That said, $30 might be a little steep if you're only interested in Dragonfall, as it's not actually all that long (longer than the original campaign from what I'm told, and just better all around), but then again, it might not be, because it really is good. I'll add to this review after running Dead Man's Switch I suppose, but bottom line is: Dragonfall is a fantastic campaign that's well worth paying for and playing.Dead Man's SwitchI might as well start by saying that yeah, it's pretty much worse than Dragonfall in every way possible, but still decent. The writing is Dead Man's Switch is far less compelling to be frank. The characters aren't as interesting, they never really appear to gorw, and you don't really interact with them, or even the world very much. It's a very much guided experience that sort of just shuffles you from level to level as the story unfolds. I feel that my most major problem with the storyline is that I find it pretty much impossible to make a connection to any of the characters since you don't really get to interact with them much. Honestly, I'd say that if you're going to get Shadowrun Returns, get it for Dragonfall and think of Dead Man's Switch as an extra campaign despite the fact that Dragonfall is DLC which you'll have to pay for. Dead Man's Switch is nothing to really write home about, so if you get the game, you should really get the DLC. If you're more interested in the user-generated content or the combat system, the base game still has that going for it of course.			"

												Real cool game that catches the spirit of the genesis version. People (goons) will ♥♥♥♥♥ about the save system, but it's actually pretty good. It keeps multiple saves at different decision points and on entering different areas; I was able to cycle all the way to the beginning of the game.This game features a cool immensly interesting setting, cool powers, XCOM:EU style cover mechanics and overwatch controls and fun combat. If you're at all interested in cRPGs, cyberpunk or tabletop RPGs then slot your cred-stick and frag off, chummer.			"

												Excellent game. Top of the notch turn-based combat, and depth of roleplaying goes well beyond normal big rpg titles. It does have issues with confusing line-of-sight and other minor grievances, but I found this actually less buggy than most games I play.The first campaign, Dead-man's Switch, is very, very good. The Dragonfall add-on seems to be one of the best rpg-stories I've even played in videogames, but I've yet to complete it.Highly recommended for RGP and turn-based fans.			"

												Take an old-school, well written, high fantasy, tactical turn-based RPG such as the Black Isle games, completely flip the ""high fantasy"" part on its head and replace with a Cyber-Punk theme that breathes a well-needed blast of fresh air into the genre and you get Shadowrun Returns. The base game and the game mechanics are well realised and will provide many hours of engrossing fun. But the Dragonfall ""dlc"" is nothing short of a masterpiece of story based gaming. 89% for the base game. 97% for Dragonfall. Throw in the fact that the community are getting behind it with some decent free mods and this game becomes an ESSENTIAL purchase for any self-respecting RPG fan.			"

												Quick review for Dead Man's Switch+ Deep writing with lots of humor+ Fun combat mechanics+ Nice soundtrack- LinearThe game is a light action-RPG, with combat style similar to Fallout. RPG elements are there to provide some depth, but I found the focus of the game to be more in telling the story. The story is told mainly in text, which I personally liked as it gives room for imagination. The game is linear but as the story is really gripping that did not bother me. Took me about 12h to finish, which was enough to tell the story and not drag for too long artificially.Really enjoyed it! "

												A light strategy action rpg that doesn't hit as hard as it can. It combines fantasy magic, trolls, with technology, guns, hacking, for a cool atmosphere you wish you could spend more time in. The combat is good, uses a cover system and plenty of weapons to attack with from a nice choice of classes to master with a few perks to each.Your character build affects how you can approach situations depending on your strength, decking, and mostly charisma. Choice is limited, though.The story keeps it going but isn't as fantastical as you think it could be. You also don't get all the explainations you want. All the characters are very good for their short cameos in game.Overall, the pieces for something really big are here, it just doesn't flex all it's muscles. Most importantly, I had fun. I was underwhelmed because of my expectations for story but nothing that made me enjoy the game any less. Characters were cool, combat kept me going, choices lead me to being nice to some, a rare puzzle element suprised me, and it's worth the not-as-short-as-most-people-who-complain-about-length you put into it.

												This game brings me back to when I played Shadowrun, The Card Game. A fun, interactive game, my friends and I always desired more in the plot/story line. I even went so far as to create a MUD with my friends (Showing my age there...), based on the Shadowrun Universe.Harebrained Schemes had a home run on this title. The storyline and gameplay are wonderful, coupled with 'retro' graphics, seems like they can do no wrong!.... Except have a soul. I bought this game on iOS first. Seemed perfect for my iPad (didn't see why I needed to waste low-end graphics on my computer). Oh how I look back and see how innocent I was. Paid the 8.99 for the game 3 months after it came out and a few updates ironed out a lot of the bugs. Seems like the smart way to go. Oh.. oh how innocent! Game crashes every 4-10 mins. Eventually, after grinding my way into the game (later to find out it was only about 25 mins of normal gameplay) I come to a single action that crashes the game everytime. I write into Harebrained Support and ask for a refund, due to inability to play the game. They tell me they cannot, but try Apple Support, they might be able to do something for me.So... you want me to jump to hoops with Apple, because your game, that states 'Made for iPad'..... doesn't work on my iPad?Long story short, thumbs up on the game, big middle finger to Harebrained Schemes. Worst company in the world, when it comes to customer relations.			"

												An excellent old-school RPG.  If Fallout had an adventure in a world formed by a collision of Deus Ex and Baldur's Gate, this would be the result.  The base campaign has some flaws, but the Dragonfall expansion is excellent.  You spend as much time talking as you do in combat, so it's a good job the writing is among the best to be found in the genre.			"

												I was a huge fan of Shadowrun for the Sega Genesis, and when I saw this go up on Kickstarter, I was quick to drop money on something I'd always wanted to see more of, and I wasn't disappointed.It's not the kind of game with high action gameplay, but the story runs deep, the threads and arcs are nicely woven, and it's everything I expect from a great game based in the Shadowrun Universe.Remember, watch your back, shoot straight, conserve ammo, and never, ever, cut a deal with a dragon.

												SRR is trying to be very close to Pen & Paper feeling. And so in my opinion that's why it's the best Shadowrun Videogame until now. Main story of SRR(Deadman's switch) is well written also there is already an offical DLC for another story(Dragonfall).But the real highlight here in my eyes is the Editor/Steamworkshop. With it you are able to create, and also play many other stories, where some support to import your favorite character but sometimes needed to create a new one.So you always have interesting and new runs, just like P&P.Sure, there are some bugs here and there, also the UI could be better at some points, but those will hopefully get fixed after time. But until now, i hadn't experienced any bugs which made the game unable to play. So it's fine.All in one(For me):Way better than expected!Especially when you can't find any P&P groups or wait for one, but really need to visit the sixth world again, SRR is the solution for this problem.

												I loved the original game on Sega many years ago. So i was thrilled to try this new game. It has some flaws, as it is short and very linear, no voice acting, checkpoints system. Also the matrix/decking mode is just the same turn-based combat with a different skin. Would love to see the original matrix combat. But it is still a little gem with interesting story, characters, nice combat system and visuals. And i've heard the Dragonfall DLC is even better and more refined (with more side quests and choices).UPDATE: Dragonfall DLC is just amazing. So much better plot and twists. A lot of hard choises to be made, better selection of side quests, a whole town region to live in, lots of interesting characters. And you can now save the game whenever you want :)			"

There are many classic pen and paper missions converted over and a massive amount of content in general. MUST OWN for Shadowrun fans.I would highly recommend buying the Dragonfall ""DLC"" and playing it first. Dead Man's Switch is good (even better now that save anywhere was added), but Dragonfall really captures that classic CRPG vibe with a great story and variety in playing methods and choices. As it stands right now, Dragonfall is the best game I've played this year. The characters will make a William Gibson fan weep with joy. Berlin and the politics and npc's that inhabit it make for a far more compelling locale than Seattle. BUY.			"

I did enjoy the art, character development, and variety in combat, but really wished to just explore the world and complete missions not related to the general story. That being said, Shadowrun has a lot of untapped potential for the modding community wishing to polish this stone a bit more.  Definitely worth the price if you want a change of pace.			"

												DRAGONFALL analysis:Pros:- Great story- Immersive setting- Interesting characters- Nice, strategic, turn-based combatCons:- The game does not explain anything to you. For example, there are these ley lines things on the ground, that somehow improve magical abilities. However, the game does not explain this to you, and nor does it say HOW your magic is improved. This is just an example, because you have to pretty much figure everything out by yourself here.- The NPCs don't cover every role/class possible (like in games such as Dragon Age). This is actually not a big deal, but I started the game as a Shaman (summoner/support mage), only to find that the game already provides you with one, but not with a damage-oriented mage. You can hire some mercenaries to fill those roles by paying cash, but I don't think this solves the problem.- The items/spells systems are not clear and have some pretty big flaws, and as I stated before, nothing is explained to you.Two examples: 1) You can by spells/armor for yourself, but not for your companions, but no one tells you that. At the same time, you can buy consumables for them. 2) If you equip an ally with a consumable before a mission, the item will be lost after the quest, even if you didn't used it.Even if its flaws, I must reccommend this game for anyone who's fond of turn-based strategy games (it plays a bit similar to XCOM) or who likes a game with great story. Just be sure to read a guide or something before playing.			"

												If you're a fan of the tabletop you should find at least a bit of pleasure out of this, if in nothing but the character creation. The included scenario is fun, but doesn't demand much replay, and while there is plenty of player generated content the basic premise can get old pretty fast. (Visit fixer, get qeust, kill baddies, return to fixer, repeat) Combined with the pretty hefty load times when going from zone to zone it can make the game drag. I'm still a fan of the franchise though, so fanboy as I am I'd still reccomend it.			"

The original campaign is ok, but it's not stellar, i felt it needed improvements on a lot of areas (from level design to gameplay). The dragonfall expansion improved a lot of stuff, the characters are more interesting, and also the Berlin is really cool. This is for fans of mature rpgs with lots of choices (most of them aren't that easy), really cool lore and story and engaging gameplay. You can choose the race you want, the features you want, and build the character you like the most. You are given a lot of freedom.The workshop adds a lot to this game, you can find dozens of interesting campaigns, that will keep you hooked for many hours. "

Shadowrun Returns DMS and Dragonfall both made a great impression on me. I cared about the characters and what happened to them! But most of all, I must say the Karma system and the different skill paths make this game awesome. Sci-fi meets Fantasy is done right by harebrained schemes! I urge you to buy this game and experience it for yourself. Personally, I find the Decker class is my favorite, but do whatever you want (I'm thinking of trying out a mage or street samurai).

												I waited on the berlin expansion to review this game, and I definitely recommend it now.The original campaign, Dead Man's Switch, had a handful of problems at launch that had kept people from being as upbeat about it as they could, but many of those have also been fixed as of the expansion (Weapon balance, save system, bugs). Dead man's switch is a pretty cool campaign, and has a lot of nostalgic throwbacks to the SNES game. It's very Shadowrun Seattle (Megacorps, historic figures, gang control), and a bit short and linear, but still cool. I would give it a 8/10 or so.The Berlin expansion is the most hooked I've been by an RPG in a really long time. The writing is fantastic, the characters are cool, and the world is really fun. The combat isn't quite as polished as say, XCOM, but it's passable and doesn't detract in any way. The flux state (prior to the invasion and second Berlin wall going up) is well depicted, and you become very invested in the stories of everyone living in your block of the anarchists haven.There's much more freedom to approach things differently in the Berlin expansion, and you can take on side missions from the Berlin hub in the order you want, or even skip one or two if you want. It's also a bit longer than Dead man's switch, and features some new weapons. I would give Dragonfall a 9/10, easily.			"

												I bought this game pretty much on a hunch, a hunch that it would be something I would enjoy immensely, and I was right. As soon as I step into the Main Menu I came across a great tune which got me into the right mood. The character creation is overall pretty good in my honest opinion, having a set of difference races, classes and ettiquets to choose from and then the usual skill ""tree"". If you enjoy turn based combat games I'm positive that you'll enjoy this one, as soon as I got my first encounter it reminded me of the XCOM: EU and Omerta, mainly due to the cover system and because I've played those too fairly recently. The combat ranges from a variety of standard guns, hand to hand combat and spells to the deploying drones and summoning spirits to fight by your side, it also uses the standard chance to hit per attack with a somewhat medium variety of skills and abilities to use. The world is really well put together and the writing does a tremendous great job of putting you inside the game world where magic meets cutting edge tech and when the Earth is a total mess. As I said the writing is pretty good, atleast I thought so, and that made me enjoy this game much more than I was expecting to. I'm looking foward to the user created content and the upcoming DLC and I HIGHLY recommend this to any fan of classic party RPGs or turn based combat.			"

												Do you like Xcom? Do you like Baldurs Gate? Do you like epic Cyberpunk worlds? This game manages to seamlessly combine the combat, the story and the gritty world that is Shadowrun.  The game includes one campaign, but with Steamworks, there are hundreds of campaigns and worlds built by the community to explore.  I haven't tried the user made stories yet, but if they are anything even close to the main campaign, they should be excellent.  This game has it all, fun, strategy and replay value.  Buy it if you like to read a cool story and strategize through a challenging storyline.  Be ready to don your detective fedora too.			"

												Seriously, if you like cyberpunk themed videogames (or cyperpunk in general), this one is for you. The original campaign is ok, but it's not stellar, i felt it needed improvements on a lot of areas (from level design to gameplay). The dragonfall expansion improved a lot of stuff, the characters are more interesting, and also the Berlin is really cool. This is for fans of mature rpgs with lots of choices (most of them aren't that easy), really cool lore and story and engaging gameplay. You can choose the race you want, the features you want, and build the character you like the most. You are given a lot of freedom.The workshop adds a lot to this game, you can find dozens of interesting campaigns, that will keep you hooked for many hours. "

												It's a breath of fresh air to see a serious RPG with real-life problems, even though the world has changed, there's no difference in how people act, and the way this is portrayed is absolutely amazing. Shadowrun Returns DMS and Dragonfall both made a great impression on me. I cared about the characters and what happened to them! But most of all, I must say the Karma system and the different skill paths make this game awesome. Sci-fi meets Fantasy is done right by harebrained schemes! I urge you to buy this game and experience it for yourself. Personally, I find the Decker class is my favorite, but do whatever you want (I'm thinking of trying out a mage or street samurai).

												Okay, so I understand this game is based on a tabletop roleplaying module, which I think is critical to understanding what it is and isn't. The biggest successes of this game are when it adheres to those origins and carries them into the video game world, whereas its biggest failures are in the different limitations of those two things.The best thing about this game, by far, is the world/setting. It's unique, interesting, and just damn cool. For this reason, the game sort of gradually improves as you play through it and get to see more and more of the Powers That Be within the gameworld. If you find yourself an hour in and interested but not completely hooked, keep going. The ending is pretty cool because it raises so many other questions and hints at grander goings-on behind the curtain of the one story you're shown. I think more than anything this game was never intended as a standalone thing but rather as a platform for the creation of more campaigns, a digital version of the tabletop format. It works pretty well in that respect. I especially loved how the class system played into and reinforced the character of the setting. This may be the only Steam game I've played where I think I will definitely go try out some player-created content, as well.Some practical aspects of the game mechanics definitely need work, though. As a first time player, I rolled a Decker character, and this turned out to be a terrible mistake. There is absolutely no benefit to being a Decker: you only get to use your special abilities at all from halfway through the campaign, and even then there's always another Decker given to you whether you want/need them or not whenever you would have any opportunity to use that class's skills. Choosing which dialect your character is versed in also has minimal benefit unless you happen to choose the one that gives you more money.By far the biggest downfall of this game was its crippling linearity and limited choice. You cannot affect the story in any meaningful way or even dramatically change the way individual characters treat you. This would not be half as noticeable a flaw if the game wasn't rooted in the tabletop style, as I said before. Tabletop RPGs are entirely based on letting you do whatever you want and just collaboratively creating the story as you go along. A system in which a static, linear story is told with only minor superficial player choices is a really questionable design decision in that context.So, is the game worth it? I would definitely say yes. I liked it more the more I played it, and the end of each act kept expanding the scope of the conflict in a satisfying way. I thought the story was pretty good and served to highlight the setting in the right ways. I will probably play the sequel/expansion/DLC/whatever once I have nonzero moneydollars. You should just know what you're in for, I think.			"

												I had no preexisting investment in the Shadowrun universe before playing this game. It would be fair to call this an RPG-lite with a pretty compelling setting. Fans of the original Fallout games will find the AP-based combat system familiar and enjoyable, but the level of freedom (both in terms of direction of the plot, as well as freedom within an area) is not what you get from those games.For a budget priced game, though, it holds up. The game is better realized in the standalone Dragonfall expansion, though.			"

												If you're a fan of RPGs, Cyberpunk & Noir mixed together with some XCOM: Enemy Unknown tactical combat, then you can pretty much get it all in one package by buying this game. I've personally never played the first Shadowrun, but Returns has me intrigued with its awesome soundtrack of synth-electronic tunes and a few interesting characters. Like in true old-school fashion there's no voice acting, which when it comes down to it, is an afterthought anyway. Good voice acting & Bad voice acting can certainly affect the playability of the story, but If voice acting is a most then you'll find none of it here. This is a game for peeps who are looking for an old-fashioned RPG and I'd say it succeeds at that. Despite its flaws, such as the absence of a save feature in exchange for an auto-save function and rather short length; It's damn good!			"

												The world of Shadowrun Returns is based on the tabletop RPG Shadowrun. As such, the lore is well established and will certainly please many cyberpunk fans. When you purchase Shadowrun Returns, don't expect to be satisfied with ""Dead Man's Switch"", the campaign that comes pre-installed with it. No, you are buying this game in order to run user generated campaigns set in the world of Shadowrun. In my opinion, ""Dead Man's Switch"" is merely a way for the developers to show the capabilities of the game engine and how much you can do with the campaign editor. With that said, ""Dead Man's Switch"" is around 6 hours long and features a rather linear but interesting story. In this campaign, a fellow shadowrunner that you knew hires you to avenge him for a hundred thousand nuyen, through the use of a dead man's switch. You travel to Seattle in order to find the killer and get paid, but as luck would have it, it involves plenty of jumping through hoops. Once you complete the campaign, you'll find yourself wanting more and that can be easily solved through a quick browse in the Steam workshop.			"

												Edit: Updated for the newest patch.Shadowrun returns tries *really hard* to be a great game. It's got a great history in tabletop roleplay, and the super nintendo shadowrun might be the most overlooked RPG of all time. The framework is definitely laid to make this one of the best retro gaming experiences of the last few years. Sadly, a lack of attention to detail often holds it back. Simple things, like healing kits in the store before the last fight, have been flat out overlooked or left out. It may be intentional, however there are enough times that it happens that it really feels like the game was slightly rushed. Another great example of this is the decking system. Decking itself is fun, if a bit tedious at times. However, there are 3 missions in the entire game that actually allow you to deck. And the times there are decking quests? One requires you to take an npc along as a sidekick (not bad, all things considered). The next decking mission? The npc *has to* do it, you don't even help. I realize there may be plot reasons, but where it ends up is that there's an entire skill tree that they literally only let you use twice. My first run was a decker, and I got through 3/4ths of the game before I got to actually use the skills I built for. Frustrating doesn't describe it. Another issue is how healing magic only heals the last attack to hit you. Mobs love throwing a big hit, then pinging you for 1 damage. This wouldn't even be an issue, except for the fact that you have limited medkits, and can't force your helpers to pick em up on the fly. Either you get them, or they go to your stash. This isn't an issue in combat mode, but you can't toggle combat mode manually, so if you're out of a fight? Hope you're the medic, because you're the one getting the health packs. Movement can be equally tricky, especially when it starts getting crowded. Misclicks, clicks in wrong places, moving instead of attacking (the worst of the bunch, as it's pretty easy to die if you're not behind cover) are commonplace if you're not careful. Add the ability to manually enter combat mode at any time (so npcs can pick stuff up), or inventory management on the fly, mixed with a bit of an easier way to move to a specific location in a crowd? A lot of my problems would immediately go away.Shadowrun combat is fun and engaging. There's a deep variety of skills and abilities that all influence the battle field in different ways. Mage-based spellcasting feels powerful, especially if you beef yourself up to be able to take a hit (you'll have to) and stand on a ley line. Rigging is a *blast*, if a bit frustrating as they only allow one of each drone type per tier. This means, if you want 2 attack drones? One's gonna suck a bit. Summoning, similarly, is a ton of fun and feels really powerful. They put quite a few free summoning points in the game, it's one of the few ways you can use the environment against your enemy. As for Adepts? They are a bit under-utilized, IMO. Right now they're heavily melee focused, and take a lot of finesse to get full use out of, because you're so skill-thin. Body for HP, Quickness because Dodge, Strength for melee attacks and the attack focus skill, Will for Chi Casting. Late bloomer doesn't describe them, even the supposedly super-awesome npc you pick up near the end isn't all that impressive. And, without spoilers, he's one of the strongest characters in the entire Shadowrun canon.The campaign's difficulty is incredibly well balanced. I was thrilled when even my biggest indestructible troll still had to take cover from time to time, because becoming fully immortal is impossible when your enemies have fully automatic machine guns. Some of the UGC (actually, most of it I've played to this point) doesn't have the same light touch, though, making swapping from the official campaign a pretty steep learning curve. The only real issue with the main campaign is length. It's incredibly short, especially for this style of game. Lots of people lament the fact that it's a fairly linear experience, but I personally enjoyed that. Not every game needs to be a sandbox, and Shadowrun Returns has a very distinct story to tell. Some may feel shoehorned, but I just enjoyed going along for the ride. The writing in the main campaign is *fantastic* and easily the strongest thing about it. They paid a lot of attention to detail, and really worked a lot of the flavor of the shadowrun world into their story. I *love* the big bad, as well. They definitely swung for the fences with the nemesis in dead man's switch. This is a great touch, since I know a lot of us pnp shadowrun players have fond memories of them. As well, major and well known players in the shadowrun universe make cameos, and some may even join your team. There's a great early nod to the snes shadowrun game that really set a great tone. This game pays obvious respect to what came before it. The fact that Jordan Weisman was responsible for this is very apparent in the plot and tone. Also, for those wanting a sandbox style adventure? Dragonfall is very much along those lines.The graphics, as well, are spot on. The game feels fun, and cartoony, and really captures the essence of the shadowrun universe. Hyperkinetic neon and chrome, with a touch of Tolkien fantasy, blend together oddly well. None of it feels out of place. My only qualms about the background art boil down to there not being enough of them, which becomes a problem with UGC as it all starts to look exactly the same. The sprites are also well designed, if a bit generic at times (I'm looking at you, every troll in the game), and the game wouldn't hurt for the option of using different faces/body types. The sound? Meh. The soundtrack is fun at first, but quickly gets repetitive. I tend to turn off the music and put on some industrial while I play, or other music suitable for shadowrun. After the first playthrough, or even the first few hours? You probably will too. UGC... It's the elephant in the room. UGC is a great idea in theory, and supposedly a high selling point for the game. The ability to create your own worlds, and play the worlds other people create, is *fantastic* on paper. And sometimes, it even works in execution. This is seeming to be the exception to the rule. UGC suffers from the same thing it does in most other games that feature it. It's uneven, balance is often lacking, the plots are frequently very weak, and... Well... It was made by the community, with all of the lack of polish that entails. There are a few *strong* exceptions to this rule, but it seems overall like the ones with the great plot lack any semblance of combat balance. As well, and as mentioned, the art assets get rather repetitive. A lot of the UGC just looks cut-and-paste, which is probably because they are. On the upside, sourcebooks from the original pen and paper game being fully converted into the game, and heavily fine tuned. Some of the creators have done a lot of work adding even more customization options, which is *amazing*. The major downfall to UGC is already becoming apparent post-Dragonfall, however. A few of the people responsible for large conversion kits or well known adventures have walked away, because the expansion completely broke their work. It's the same problem the UGC community of the first Neverwinter Nights faced, with every new expansion comes 10-20 hours of work to put your mods back together again.Overall, this game is fantastic. It's got some quirks, but Dragonfall cleaned up a lot of bugs or issues that were once holding it back. This is solid retro gaming. 8/10			"

												I'll get straight to the point:The Good: It's official campaign Dead Man's Switch is pretty good so to speak. The story it has justifies the linearity of the game's design as it's pretty much like reading an interactive book (like some of the older RPGs of the 90s). The game is practically friendly to almost any PC considering that it relies on the cyberpunk aesthetics to make the game look pretty. In terms of combat, it's basically a simplified version of Xcom: Enemy Unknown and if you like that game, you are going to be fairly familiar with how the game works. And even if you are done with the main campaign, there's still more to offer from the community itself through UGCs which can be downloaded through Steam directly or through the Shadowrun Nexus (especially if you own the DRM-free version on GOG) And by the time of this review (which is the same time as when the DLC Dragonfall first came out) you can actually save without relying on the autosave feature. The Bad: Due to the fact that the replayability of this game past Dead Man's Switch (and Dragonfall) is dependent on the UGC of the community, you will probably have to take your time to look for custom campaigns that are actually complete, let alone any good. Most of the complete ones are usually the shortest or the simplest of campaigns. In addition, the Dead Man's Switch campaign doesn't seem to give much options to have a players who want to play a Face or a Decker as they are either very few instances to begin with or doesn't truly payoff. I don't like the fact that I have to actually rely on hiring more runners for a particular mission and they feel restrictive in which you cannot give them suitable gear or even have them hold on to an medkit if your inventory is full. Also, there are certain dialog choices that are greyed out if you don't meet the required stats to qualify. I'd rather have them hidden to keep me surprised. On top of that, I know that the idea behind this game is to make the player the main protagonist, but the problem with that is that this is Shadowrun, and the reason you have a variety of runner archetypes in a team is because you can take advantage of what they are capable of inside and outside of combat. Instead, that variety is only restricted to combat and combat alone save of you being able to appoint a hired/companion decker to hack into the Matrix for you in case you are incapable of such a task.Overall: Shadowrun Returns has it's flaws but I like what Harebrained as treated it so far. It's not an amazing game and it's hardly going to be the ""best RPG EVAR!!!11!"" but if you appreciate a good cyberpunk story with a touch of magic with a potential for more to come whether by the devs themselves through DLC or by the Shadowrun community, then I'd say this is a very safe purchase.

												At first, i was thrilled to have this game as a gift from a friend on my birthday. I graciously accept and installed.I assumes its going to be fun. I assumed right. It was a good game with good story, detailed-graphic-on-screen and awesome gameplay. Took me 15 hours to finish Dead Man's Switch campaign. Never felt happier to get this.Thanks Bud!!			"

												As a gamer constantly looking for as immersive as possible and varying different experiences, it felt as if I found a gold mine just for myself after 1 hour within Shadowrun Returns. The game runs as half tactic combat, half story. Both are very well made and entertaining, but where the game truly excells is the story. At first I was put off by the lack of voice in the game. Why are the pretty and detailed avatars with excessive and rich language representing the dialogue, entirely silent? I dig around options looking for volume slider, but there was none. Some minutes of gaming later I realized the person who wrote the story, descriptions, and dialogue lines is a pure genious. Reading your way into the world of Shadowrun is like reading a truly well written novel. I really really hope the person behind these texts continues the work in the next Shadowrun game. Thus, the game world is immersive, colourful, rich. There is zero point in spoiling the story, but it should suffice to say that it is very good and that♥♥♥♥♥♥goes down in unexpected extremely well written ways. The world of the game is not so big, but the way it is presented and through the richness of details you get a sense that it is huge, living, and real, and that there are so many more interesting ""♥♥♥♥♥♥going down"" kind of things going on besides your own story. Sahdowrun's RPG elements are not very deep but fun and engaging enough to encourage even several playthroughs. I would suggest Shadowrun Returns to anyone interested in a truly good story or immersive world, or those who like tactical combat. The game is truly bad♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I managed to pick this up on a steam sale a while back. My friend suggested I just pirate it because the game wouldn't be worth 15 euro. How wrong he was! I've just come off finishing this entire game in one sitting, and the reason for that is because the game is that good.The game comes with one campaign which is called 'dead man's switch'. This is the campaign the developpers made and is a very good showcase of what you can do in Shadowrun returns. The story sucks you in and the entire realistic atmosphere gives off a gritty blade runner feeling. You actually feel the grime that exists in the world and the parallels to our world are scarily frequent.The gameplay itself is a blast, you play the game using a self constructed avatar which you assign a 'class'. Which can be broken down into a fighter, monk, mage, summoner, hacker and trapper. The game then divides the points into the needed categories and from there you are free to specialise your character how you see fit. This gives you an insane amount of customisation as far as your character is concerned. Besides yourself you can hire help to go along on the runs (missions), you can preview their stats and items before picking them and during the mission you are free to control them as you see fit.The game also contains a lot of dialogue which helps to flesh out the living and breathing world. You sometimes get choices which you feel will have some impact later on along the line, sadly you generally don't see any effect from your choices besides alternate ways of attack something or something being worth more or being more expensive.I suggest anyone to atleast give shadowrun a try, the game is really fun, able to pull you into it's world and the challenge it provides is just right in my opinion. Despite in the last mission the two 'superior' characters being weaker then my own dwarf. ""Reality can be found in the shadows""			"

												You don't see these kind of games that often now a days. The old school classic feel you get with the isometric tactical RPG's from back in the days. Shadowrun Returns brings this back in full force. Great looking artistic graphics, very well written story and game play that is enjoyable. For me this is one of the best games i played all year. And if your new to the Shadowrun series(like me) then this is a good way to start, as each character has a rich story and you get to know pretty much everything about the world in the first hour or so. I can highly recommend you this title if you have the slightest interest in this genre.			"

												Some folks have noted that the core module ""Dead Man's Switch"" is short and the gameplay is limited. Those are both fair points, but when thought of as a weekend romp through a cyberpunk landscape, Shadowrun Returns is perfect. You're not bogged down learning in-depth combat systems or slogging through tutorials. The game gets off to a snappy start and doesn't stop. The writing is easily the best part in setting the tone even if the graphics won't blow you away. I wouldn't say the story is short so much as not cluttered with filler. Every step is meaningful and that's downright refreshing in an RPG nowdays despite shaving hours off of the game.			"

												I was proud to back this game on Kickstarter, and the final result is no disappointment. The tactical combat is very satisfying, and the writing and atmosphere are great. The end of the main story is just where the experience begins, though, because the community has already started creating some incredible content. This is to Shadowrun what Neverwinter Nights was to D&D, with new community modules cropping up everywhere to make the game much bigger than any single company could make. It'll just keep getting better as time goes on.This is a worthy Shadowrun game, recommended for everyone who loves party-based RPGs with turn-based tactical combat.			"

												This game is AMAZING! When I saw it, I saw it as another game like the classic Fallout 1 and 2, and yes I know this is a rebirth of the classic Shadowrun rpg series which was amazing! But this game brings it back in HD and visual graphics of our time and it is just fun. Fun is how I can describe this, it brings rpgs back, with indepth skill trees, where you cant unlock everything, so you have to choose what you need. No levels, as you get karma points to unlock your skill and stats, Its just lots of fun. The visuals are definately amazing and the whole steampunk motif is just amazing! Why arent there more games set in an ORIGINAL steampunk universe, that isnt a final fantasy game. If you guys want a Xmas present for yourself, get yourself Shadowrun Returns, it is just worth it. :) 5/5P.S. Did I also mention that all the fan made created content is free so as long as people are making their own stories set in the Shadowrun universe, we keep getting stories to play. :D			"

												Let me start out by saying that this is the first Shadowrun game that I have ever actually played. Yes I have tried the 1993 Shadowrun for the Super Nintendo but I could never get into it due to it's... Interesting controls (read point and click with a controller). But the game concept and the universe intrigued me, Over the years I forgot the name of it several times but would bring it up every few years and try to find the name of it and feel that they should remake it for the pc where it ultimately belonged. Well a few months ago was one such time that It popped into my head, I did a quick search for it and what did I find but a new Shadowrun being made for its proper platform (psst its the PC). I instantly fell in love with the style and everything I say was just the best thing I have ever seen.Flash forward to now where I have been given the ability to write this review and I am just stoked to be able to finally play a Shadowrun game without being hindered by a D-pad. Well I wasn't home when I got the Beta code but I had a 2 hour drive till I got home and then I had to download it and set it up. This just ate at me up inside but I managed to do it and when I first started it up I felt a chill as the dark and music (composed by Marshall Parker and Sam Powell from the 1993 SNES Shadowrun) started to play and the menu appeared.When you start a new game your greeted with a fairly standard character creation menu. You can select your gender, race and choose between several preconfigured or a custom skill sets for your character as well as select from one of several portraits and player models. The models look nice but are lacking the level of detail that you see with other games though this low detail level just feels right in the world, fitting in with the 2D environments. Each race has specific traits that are more prominent then others, these usually have higher starting values and higher max values. After choosing a character model and skill set you get to pick traits and spend your skill points on your starting stats. As soon as you are done creating your character you start in a modest apartment. After looking around the apartment for a while you get a call from an old friend and are sent into a flashback where you learn more about yourself and your friend but more importantly you get to experience the combat system for the first time.Shadowrun Returns is broken up into missions and uses an auto save feature that saves at the beginning of a mission. It uses a tactical combat system where you have your squad and each member has action points. Each action your characters take use action points and once they're gone then that character can't do anything till the next turn.This is customary for tactical games like this and even new people to this style of play should get used to it rather quickly. The combat system uses cover and line of site as a tactic and shows you how good the cover is and to what side you have cover on. This system isn't perfect as it doesn't always show that you're in cover and at times it's hard to tell if your line of site is broken simply due to the layout of the room and the camera angle.Shadowrun Returns comes with a full scenario editor that allows users to create whole new missions and stories and share them with the community. The editor has been out for many of the kickstarter backers for a while now so there is going to be plenty of user made content available. Someone is currently working on recreating the old SNES Shadowrun into Shadowrun Returns using the editor available here http://www.obsidianportal.com/campaigns/snes-shadowrun/mapsOverall I feel that the 2D backgrounds and the 3D character models mesh very well together and unlike in some games they feel right together. The story is excellent and you don't feel like it's being force fed down your gullet so you can play the game for the story or the game play or both. The main story is quite linier and it tends to feel like there's some handholding going on but you can choose to help someone or leave them to their own devices and save your own skin. I am not a master of table top RPG's but this feels like how I would imagine a table top RPG should be on a PC.Check out my video review on YouTube @

												While I like this game a lot, others may not, depending on what they're expecting.If you are expecting any edition of the tabletop role-playing game, or the Genesis or SNES console games, you will be disappointed.  Shadowrun: Returns plays something like a simplified version of tabletop rules that never actually existed.I liked the plot, combat, and music.Opinions on the plot vary widely.  If you have an aversion to reading, this game is not for you.  Almost all of the plot is delivered via screens of text upon entering an area, or text dialogs.  There is no voiceover.  Some people complain of purple prose, or that it seems to have been written by someone that is immature, but the writing is superior to that in most video games, including most other RPGs.  I personally do not perceive any of these problems, and have never seen examples cited.Screenshots do not do the combat system justice.  Some of the interface is only displayed when it is relevant.  For example, the action point cost of movement, and the effectiveness of cover, only appear when you prepare to move, and when cover exists in the area you mouseover.  The combat system is relatively simple (which is reflected in the user interface), but like Chess, can be quite difficult.  The difficulty is selectable at character creation, so if you find the game too easy or hard you can adjust it.  Since almost all RPGs are combat-heavy, it's important that it not be mindless and repetitive.The music is hard to describe.  It is not ambient.  You will notice it.  I especially like the theme on the title screen.I didn't like some things about Shadowrun: Returns.It is very linear, and most decisions will not affect the ending.The gameplay in the matrix is very similar to meatspace.  It's not so much that the gameplay in the matrix is bad as it doesn't feel different enough.The game only saves on area transition.  If you have to stop playing, or die, unexpectedly, you can lose quite a bit of progress.			"

I defnitely enjoyed this great, albeit short,  game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys turn-based rpgs, x-com enemy unknown/within, urban-science-fantasy settings and fantasy races. A surprisingly good mixture of sci-fi stuff with near-like contemporary settings filled with elves, orcs, trolls and dwarves. "

												Excellent! Loved it!There is no free roaming - this game is on rails.  It's more like an interactive William Gibson novel than Fallout Tactics.But it's the writing that really stands out,  that and the the RPG setting.  After playing this, I think if i ever did pen and paper again I'd like to try Shadowrun.  It reminds me a lot of Traveller (all-time favorite pen and paper RPG) in some respects.The music is good and fits the game well.The art is unique - be sure to zoom in occasionally to check out the details.In some of the levels, you will have a character jacked into the matrix and running alone,  while the rest of the team defends the access point (and the helpless cybernaut).  The game does a good job of creating a genuine feeling of urgency in these situations.Save points:  the game saves for you.  if you screw up a level you have to play it over again.  Did not care for this.I did not find it possible while on a mission to drop out of combat (when no enemies were visible) to move easier -  either i just never figured out how,  or it's not possible.  It should be automatic.  Did not care for this.I found the early game fights weak & easy.  Later scenarios were more difficult.Many reviews I have read lamented that the game is too short.  If you were expecting an open world roamer,  it is -  but if you are expecting a good novel,  it's not.   And ultimately, i think that's what this game is - a good novel.Speaking of good novel,  i found after playing  - being curious about some of the characters -  that i had met a very famous (in the milleu) dragon,  and an immortal - both subtly and (believe it or not) *realistically* portrayed.  another example of good writing.More side quests and missions would have been nice -  but it would have detracted from coherence.If you like cyberpunk novels, or gritty film noir,    you'll probably like this game.   I picked it up on sale for ~7.00$  and it's Definitely worth that.			"

												For a  turn based, and thus slow paced, game this is a pretty solid buy (especially on sale). The original mission is kind of short but the Dragonfall DLC is longer and more enjoyable. Also, the DLCs which I am just starting to get into are prety solid. I'm a big fan of ond SNES style RPGs which is why I wanted to try this game, and I wasn't dissapointed.ONLY COMPLAINTThere isn't a lot of replay value in the main mission, and there are not a lot of weapons/spells/equipment choices to keep you coming back and trying new thins with the same character class. Once you've played through with a class, it kind of loses its novelty.			"

												What a lot of fun.I generally dislike games with a huge amount of dialogue delivered via text & cutscenes.However this game has drawn me in...completely.There is a plot and it drives the game forward at a nice pace.The artwork is perfect for an atmosphereic adventure.My introduction to Shadowrun was the FASA Windows Live version (still play it), so my history with the game is somewhat skewed. It was a strange 1st person shooter, not a tabletop RPG.Dislikes?Have found one, yet.			"

												This game is very hard to quantify.Many have pointed out the original campaign for this game is straightforward, very linear, and doesn't have much flexibility in it.They are all correct. And I don't think it matters at all. The game is fun, interesting, and beautiful. Buy the game, but get ready to fall in love and to be eager to buy expansions, add ons, and anything else offered so that you can keep playing more and more.			"

												Shadowrun is easily the best story-driven tactical turn-based adventure-combat game I've played since Fallout 2. The original campaign (Dead Man's Switch) is great, the second (Dragonfall) is fantastic, and the tons and tons of UGC campaigns available are full of gems that easily rival the official publications. I suggest trying out Nightmare Harvest for a great & funny story, and Shadowrun Ultimate for a semi-MMO player-driven ""work-your-way-up"" open world experience.			"

												Lives up to the classic I played years ago. Not as improved as it could be, very dated if your comparing it to open world and procedurally generated. Even look back to Diablo or fallout tatics it is still a bit clunky. I am really hoping for a building assault, muti floor action. Where one of my runners gets knocked out a window but grapples his way back in maybe a floor or two lower. Did you guys play some new XCOM recently? can you imagine a decker across the street in another bulding maybe with a sniper and a squad fighting their way up to be in a cross fire another runner team on another mission. will it be enemy of my enemy or just another target.

												Definitely nostalgic of the original Shadowrun on SNES.  An epic 'SQUEE' could probably be heard down the block when Jake Armitage crawled off of the slab in his cameo.  In any case, the turn based combat leaves a little bit to be desired from the original but all in all is actually fairly well thought out.  Positioning for cover, positioning behind enemies gives a melee boost, shotgun spread, etc.I've always been a HUGE fan of cyberpunk games that follow the whole, 'end of days' type feel.  World populated by multimillion dollar corporations that make the decisions now, street gangs that control most of the slums, implanted datajacks to interface with computers.

												Shadowrun Returns is a fun and relatively simple cyberpunk rpg. The underlying systems have some weaknesses and punish character builds that don't specialize. However, the sense of adventure is great throughout and the game is the perfect length so as to not allow the combat mechanics to overstay their welcome. The editor is too complex for myself and possibly most people who were expecting something on the level of the original Neverwinter Nights, and this means that there won't be many well-made user generated campaigns which is a shame. The Dragonfall DLC campaign is even better than the base game.			"

												Shadowrun Returs is a good game, and the GNU/Linux port is nicely done. If you like the Shadowrun world stuff perhaps you'll find it a bit limited, but in my opinion it's quite accurate. The included editor makes a lot of new homemade material avaliable out there. And, of course, the Dragonfall mission is even better.All perfect for Shadowrun stuff fans and casual gamers, but perhaps not a big deal for hardcore gamers. I must say, I loved it at first sight!

												Overview:Pros:-	2D environments and portraits-	Interesting characters-	great writing-	refreshing setting-	diverse skill systemCons:-	3D effects-	linear story-	story goes a little off the rail in the final act-	endgame fights (enemies appear out of nowhere, required party members)RPGs are my favorite genre. Nevertheless I didn’t enjoy recent RPGs like I used to. Yes, they might have great graphics, good gameplay mechanics or a well-crafted skill system, but the one aspect I find them lacking is the storytelling. Shadowrun Returns is an exception.Before I start getting into the details, I have to say I watched several gameplay and review videos before I picked it up. To be honest – I wasn’t impressed. Even though the hand-crafted 2D environments are gorgeous and vivid, the character models as well as the visual effects are far from impressive. Nevertheless, I gave it a shot and I wasn’t disappointed.The Shadowrun universe combines Cyberpunk aspects with the return of magic and metahumans in a futuristic world. The player slips into the role of a shadowrunner, an operative who will steal, infiltrate, hack and kidnap for the right price. The protagonist has to deal with powerful corporations, corruption, mythical creatures and fellow shadowrunners to survive.When it comes to creating a character that is your own, Shadowrun excels. You can choose between five races you might find in a fantasy RPG (human, elf, dwarf, ork, troll), which feel quite fresh in this unfamiliar setting. Your character can choose from six pre-made classes:-	Street Samurai: become a gun-wielding or close-range killing machine-	Mage: Fireballs, buffs and Debuffs. The familiar choice.-	Decker: jack into the Matrix to fight security systems with your programs-	Rigger: use small drones to support your team or deal damage-	Shaman: use totems or summon spirits to defeat your enemies-	Adept: use magic to enhance your own abilities, making yourself a weaponFurthermore you can also start from scratch and spend Karma points and create your own experience. Technoshaman? Combat Decker? Everything is possible, as long as you don’t spread the Karma points too thin. Skill checks are quite common in dialogue options and spending some points in Charisma or Intelligence can be worthwhile.The inventory system is quite rudimentary. Characters wear an outfit and can carry up to three weapons. Everyone can carry up to six consumables and Magic users as well as Deckers have a spellbook with up to six slots. To further improve skills or stats, cyberware can be implanted. However this results in increased cooldowns for spells.The gameplay revolves around a team of up to 4 shadowrunners. During the majority of the game you can hire a team and choose them depending on your group dynamics. Or your cash on hand, since shadowrunners don’t work for free. The combat system is round-based and reminds of Fallout 1 & 2. Action points have to be spend wisely to move, attack or use consumables like medkits and grenades.You have to read! Where many games try to tell their stories with cutscenes and voice acting, Shadowrun Returns presents the story with superb writing. Whenever you travel to a new location or meet a character the situation is beautifully described before you have to worry about combat or dialogue choices. Combined with vibrant character portraits, the characters you encounter feel alive.The different races and classes offer replayability. My first playthrough (normal, Human Decker) took 9+ hours. Due to the familiarity with enemy placement and linear storyline, my second run (very hard, Dwarf Mage) took a little over five hours. I can see myself coming back to try out different classes, however for now I’m enjoying the Dragonfall DLC (very hard, Troll Adept).I would highly recommend this game to players who enjoy round-based RPGs, which concentrate on storytelling.

												I can now give this game a thumbs up with the Dragonfall content. This is what the game should have been from the outset and it's a major all around improvement. Make no mistake, this is still CRPG-lite, but for price it's worthwhile. I can only hope Harebrained keeps pumping out DLC of this caliber - and continues to improve the game - as well as assets to give the game longevity from the community making mods out there.  "

												A quick note - I've only played Dragonfall, and have not yet touched the original campaign.This was a really well-done narrative game, with a surprisingly fun tactical component, reminiscent of x-com (and the upcoming Wasteland 2).  While linear, the game did a stellar job of making it not feel linear.  The narrative was rather strong, and kept me interested the entirety of the way through.  The author's of the game clearly knew the setting well (as one would hope with the creator of the setting being on the team), and knew what elements worked well and wouldn't work well in the world.There are some caveots: there were some bugs which cropped up periodically, that if I hadn't been regularly saving would have forced me to restart the mission.  (On the other hand, at least this game would let you restart the mission without too much fuss).  There were some instances of some items dissapearing permanently if I didn't pick them up.  Another big issue is the lack of ability to change my party member's gear, or to even control them outside of combat.Overall, this is one of the strongest narrative games I have played in a long while.  Even some annoyances (and the inability to give weapons I find to party members is a big one for me) were unable to dissuade me from finishing the game.  I can't stop talking about this game to my friends, and perhaps you won't be able to either.			"

												With 54 hours of me playing the Core story, expansion pack, and community created content at time of writing, this defintiely deserves a recommendation from me. This is shadowrun. There's not really another good way to put it. Between the fun tactical gameplay, classless character creation, and honestly pretty good graphics, it's a fun and solid game in it's own right, but the community created content is the icing on the cake. The initial campaign sells the game slightly short, in my opinion. It's fun, but it goes a little out of it's way to be a showcase of all the different options available to characters and content creators. If you get the game, and like the mechanics, buy dragonfall. I've sunk over 12 hours into this expansion, and it's a wonderful, character driven journey in a living, responsive environment full of intertesting people. And I'm still a couple of missions from the end. Don't worry too much about the deluxe edition of the standard game, but the core game and Dragonfall are worth every penny.			"

												Okay. Have you played Shadowrun the tabletop RPG? Me neither. The closest i've ever gotten to playing Shadowrun before this game was the counterstrike ripoff on the Xbox 360 (not that it was bad or anything. They just went a very ""safe"" route with it).I had no idea what the setting was. What everything was called. Why in a cyberpunk futuristik setting where would be elves, Dwarfs and trolls. Did i learn anything about that in game? Nope! I did however find it online and i did get a bit intrested in the setting.""So we get that you like the setting of the game. Is it any good? Is it worth my 14 bucks? (Or something like that.))"" Yes, Absolutly. The game is pretty cheap and it has workshop support AKA you'll be old before you run out of content. The community makes content for this all the time and if you would so choose you could make your own pretty easily. They give you all the tools.The main story that comes with the game is a nice touch and it's a pretty decent story too! It's not bad at all but it isnt great. It's good not great. Just a bit of a fair warning on that front.The only thing i wish was in there was some sort of multiplayer. But that would be long and frikking annoying with all the slow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s going ""HMMMMMMM, i wonder if i should heal that guy over there that just took a katana to the face or if i should throw a ineffectual ball of magic at the baddie that use said katana. Let me think about if for 10 min. Calculating every possibility for every move i make for the next what should be 2 hours made 12 thanks to me!""But it doesnt have multiplayer anyway so no real rush. Besides the elitist ♥♥♥♥ers in the world would probably make the game unplayable anyway.SO is the game good? YES. Should you buy it? YUP! Will i go to make a snack after this? probably!			"

You have NPC's that are more fleshed out as well as more options of how you want to play your character (good, evil, selfish, or a little of all of it).  I recommend the game. I'm sure we'll be seeing some really good community made campaigns as well.  This game will have a lot of replay value.  Pick it up!			"

Also whats nice is a lot of the storys can be completed in a weekend, (or a night of hardcore gaming).

												At the time of this writing, Hairbrained Studios have only released ""Dead Man's Switch"" and ""Dragonfall"", with the latter a significantly stronger module than the former. Both are heavily combat-based, and while careful positioning and action choices can tilt battles in your favor, the RNG can make sure that even if you do everything right, your team can still be wiped in a couple rounds due to keyboard-smashing bad luck (in this respect, the combat is very similar to X-COM: Enemy Unknown). But if you're getting an RPG like this, you're hopefully getting it knowing that luck is part of the game.It's all very good fun, particularly on harder difficulties. Agonizing over how to build your character, whom to take on a mission, and how to position them each round should please old-school turn-based RPG purists. The story arcs and character depth are not really fantastic, but the game is built on going out and completing runs (usually by shooting/stabbing/blowing things up, with only occassional decking responsibilities).Definite recommend, particularly if you've played the pencil-and-paper version.

												Shadowrun: Returns and its Expansion/DLC Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a turn-based tactical RPG game created by a studio called Harebrained Schemes out of Seattle, WA. The base game Shadowrun: Returns was released on Steam on July 25th, 2013, and the DLC Shadowrun: Dragonfall was released on February 27th, 2014.For those not familiar with the Shadowrun universe, it is based on a cyber-punk futuristic planet Earth. It is the 2050’s. The world is run by enormous, greedy corporations who will stop at nothing to acquire power. The twist is that a few decades earlier (around our current modern-day) magic returned to our world. With it came elves, dwarves, trolls, ogres, and other magical creatures.Shadowrunners are for-hire mercenaries who will do just about any job as long as there is money to be made. Whether it is stealing secrets from a corporate rival, working as security to protect those secrets, or taking out individuals that stand in their way of power, they are hired by big corporations to do their “dirty work”. They work in the seedy underbelly of this corporate society and live and survive in the shadows.I discovered Shadowrun when I was browsing around Steam looking for something new to play. Dragonfall was pretty highly recommended, and after reading up a bit on it I thought it sounded like something I would enjoy. I started it up and decided to start from the beginning and play through the original campaign. I was immediately sucked in to the story. I just had to keep playing, if for no reason other than to find out how the story turned out!The story for each of the campaigns is probably the best feature of the game. I don’t think I’ve been this captivated by a video game’s story since Final Fantasy VII! Even though there are no video cut scenes and no voice overs, the story is told VERY well.The story is progressed by speaking with various NPCs in the game world. When you speak to them you are given a number of choices as to how you want to respond in the conversation. There are a few places in the game where the dialogue options you choose will change the sequence of events to complete the mission. There isn’t a LOT of these places, but they are there. Also some dialogue options may not be available to you because of certain conditions. For example, if your Strength stat is high you may be able to bully that gang leader into giving you the key you need to progress. But, if you lack strength and are more intelligent, you may have to use brains over brawn to get what you need. There is also a feature called “Etiquette”. The game describes etiquette as “knowing how to behave in various social situations”. In-game this means you will get certain dialogue options based on what etiquette you choose when you create your character. In the example above, if my character has the “Gang” etiquette I may have a dialogue option when talking to the gang leader that will open up different options for completing the mission.Character progression is pretty straight-forward. When you create your character there are a few class archetypes that you can choose from. This gives you a basic set of skills to start from. As you progress you will acquire more skill points that you can spend on any skill you want. If you want to spend your skill points to be a shotgun-wielding mage you can, or if you want to specialize in being an uber “Decker” (Shadowrun’s version of a computer hacker) you can do that too. While skill points come pretty easy, it’s still a good idea to specialize in one or two areas. The campaign isn’t long enough for you to get enough skill points to max out everything.The skills were all pretty well explained right in game. All of your teammates and other Shadowrunners that you can hire all have their own set of skills and abilities. So if you are a shotgun-wielding mage you can hire a teammate that has the hacking skills you need for a mission. I kind of like this system. It lets you build your character however you like and then you can complement your skills with those of the shadowrunners you run with.From the very beginning I felt like the game environment and the atmosphere were very well done. I felt like I was running around in the movie Blade Runner! Everything was futuristic, yet familiar. The characters I interacted with and their portraits definitely captured the cyberpunk feel. Each character you encounter has their own personality and they are very unique. I thought the music was great too, even if there wasn’t a lot of variety. I thought it fit well with the theme of the game.The tactical combat style is what attracted me to the game in the first place. I found the combat to be a lot of fun, and in some places it was VERY challenging. For most missions you have your player character and three other Shadowrunners to make up your team.When you are walking around the map everything is in real time. But, as soon as combat starts, it switches to turn-based tactical mode. Every member of your team has a set number of “Action Points” (AP) that you can spend each turn. Firing your weapon or using a special ability may cost an AP point. Moving to a different location with better cover may cost another. Casting that healing spell or reloading your rifle will cost another. This is where the tactical part comes in. You have to decide what you want each member of your team to do each round. Do you want to focus fire and finish off one enemy at a time, or do you spread out and burn them all down at once? You also have to be careful that you don’t leave yourself pinned down somewhere without enough AP to use that medkit to keep you alive in the fight. Once you spend all your AP for that turn, the computer will play the turn of your enemies. Once they are done it is your turn to spend your AP again. Add in that each weapon type has a different range and friendly-fire can be hazardous to your teammates, it makes combat VERY interesting.The Good, The Bad, and the UglyAs a whole I very much enjoyed Shadworun: Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall. The story lines for BOTH campaigns are among the best I’ve ever seen in a video game. The first campaign is a BIT slow to start but it’s only so at the beginning. Combat is a lot of fun and can be pretty challenging at times. There were a few missions I had to play through a couple of different times with different strategies before I was victorious.I really enjoyed the skill system as well. It was easy to understand and easy to use. I didn’t feel like I needed to go online and read hundreds of forum posts to learn what the best build for my character would be. I could just pick a couple of skills I wanted to learn that were fun for me and go with it and be successful.The only bad worth mentioning is the length of the campaigns. My total play time on Steam is 48 hours, and that was running all the way through both campaigns. I’m sure I’m a lot slower that a lot of other people. However, considering the inexpensive price of the game and the fact that there is a lot of player generated content on the Steam Workshop, there is a lot of replayability here. Hopefully they will also be releasing more DLC in the future.About the only “ugly” I can say about the game is a couple of buggy missions I encountered. In one mission there was an event that didn’t trigger properly and I was unable to continue because a door would not unlock. I had to replay that mission one or two times before it finally triggered properly and I could advance.Also, some earlier reviews criticized Shadowrun: Returns’ save system. At release you could only save at certain checkpoints. This is no longer the case. I’m not sure if it was with the release of Dragonfall or if it was before that, but they changed the game so you can now save anywhere.See my original review at http://www.mistervertigo.net "

												Simply a-freaking-mazing.Shadowrun Returns is my first venture into this universe, and after a ten hour campaign, I'm completely obsessed. If you are also new, but a little wary about dropping the money for this title, allow me to explain a little about the game...SR is an isometric-style Rpg, set in a future-fantasy universe, where elves and dwarves wield shotguns and cast spells. Starting up the default campaign, Dead Man Switch, you create a character. Race, class and appearance are all up to you. Then, the developer, Harebrained Schemes drops you into a well-written and thoughtfully crafted story, presented in a text-based format - no voice acting here, and I think it's better for it, but that's personal preference. Dialog options are different depending on how you build your character and elicit different responses from NPCs, with charisma allowing you to sweet-talk, and etiquettes let you rub elbows with the many groups that populate Seattle.You play a Shadowrunner, a type of mercenary, doing the dirty-work of multi-billion dollar corporations and aristocrats for cash. Gameplay is very reminiscent of the recent Xcom: Enemy Unknown. If you didn't like that, chances are you won't like this. Every turn, each combatant is given a certain number of moves, from moving to shooting and using items. It's very tactical and you could wind up dead if you don't think before you click. Several jobs you undertake have you bringing other Runners on to watch your back and take a cut of the pay, so you're almost never alone.I found no hick-ups in the gameplay during my play-through. The specials and items are balanced well, meaning death is often the fault of the player's ill preparation. The game is fair, which is about all a gamer could ask for. Also available are game editors, allowing anyone to write their own stories and scenarios for others to enjoy. I haven't been able to try any out because there currently seems to be a bug that causes the ugc to be downloaded to the wrong files, making them difficult to locate.Shadowrun Returns is a gem that I'm glad was funded. It's not for everyone, but if it sounds like it's up your alley, I urge you to pick it up. "

												Shadowrun Returns is a game for those who enjoy old-school RPG's. Dragonfall DLC is a must have.The games strengths are in good writing, rich world history and all in all beautiful artwork.The world is beautifully detailed whether you're in the streets of Redmond Barrens, a luxurious corporate headquarter or busy market hub in Germany. I might not be the biggest fan of the ""cartoony"" style the designers went ahead with but all in all it works. The portrait artwork is also beautifully done.Dialogue and text is descriptive and good all through the games, lack of voice is the proper way to do an rpg when you have good writers.While there are many things in the game that could have been done better, far better even, I cannot think of any major  flaws or issues in design. Base game delivers an okay story and gameplay although it's lacking in many ways I still managed to get some 12 hours of gameplay from it and did not feel bad about getting the game but I did feel like it could have been done better and certainly it could have been bigger.Dragonfall DLC is a whole different story however. In fact, I would say that Dragonfall is -the- reason to buy Shadowrun Returns. Dragonfall provides you with a more classic Shadowrun feel, the storyline is excellent, the permanent companions have personalities and plenty of dialogue in and out of missions and even the local npc's are always worth talking to. Dragonfall features more of the actual Shadowrun gigs, the game is full of choices to make, plot twists to uncover and provides far richer experience for all types of characters as all types of skills have more uses.The Dragonfall DLC provided me with additional 18-20 hours of gameplay, far more than the base game does.Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall dlc's only major problem is that it leaves me wanting for more. So much more.. I want a bigger game with more content!Harebrained Schemes has a great basis set up, hopefully they will continue in the path of Dragonfall as it is obviously doing so many things right.			"

												I never played Shadowrun when it was on the NES or whatever else it was on. I joined the world with Shadowrun Returns and I have to say its a good place to start. It opens up a lot of doors, and even some windows, to a whole new world of science and magic. The controls feel clunky sometimes, but its by no means game breaking. Its turn table based combat, good guys go first more often then not, and then the bad guys. You get to make your own character from various races and classes. You don't have to stick to class you pick at creation though. You can be a mage with some intense decking skills, or a rigger who knows some summoning. They don't force you to stick to a class. Just be careful, as the game often hints 'A Jack of all trades is a master of none.'You play as a Shadowrunner, a gun for hire in the streets. You've fallen on some hard times and seem to be thinking more about your future then your past, till you get a call from a old contact. A guy you used to run with, Sam. He's been killed recently and set up a 'dead mans switch' in his brain to send you a message when he finally kicks the bucket. Well, someone kicked his bucket for him and you need to travel to Seattle and find out who did it. There are some serious twists and turns as you dig deeper into this world, trying to uncover who did it.Dragonfall is leap and bounds ahead of Dead mans Switch. The graphics feel tighter, but there is no real change. Some of the sounds and combat has been tweaked a bit and the save anywhere anytime button is a lifesaver. The supporting characters feel a lot more real, and can be interacted with anytime. They have backgrounds and lives, and aren't afarid to give you a piece of their minds if they think your doing something wrong.In the newest 'dlc' you get a whole new campgain, set up for a new character but thanks to some dedicated players you can import your character over to this save file to run the DLC. Your out on a run with long time friend Monica and her crew in Berlin. Its a simple job, a smash and grab type. However things aren't always as they seem... Monica ends up dead and you and the crew end up fleeing for your lives. With Monica dead there is a seat to be filled in the community where she lived, and her crew wants revenge. Will you be the vengeful angel and the savior all in one package?			"

												Shadow Run Returns is an isometric tactical turn based rpg. While the story that comes with the game is quite short the developers of this game have developed a very in depth editor which allows the community to expand on content much like the old Never Winter Nights games.The combat is an enjoyable experience and the artwork and assests are amazing. The game contains no voice acting but I believe titles like this benefit from the lack of audio dialogue as these games are quite text heavy and a lot would be lost if it had to be minimised for audio's sake.If you enjoy isometric turn based rpg's then this is a must buy and definitely visit the Steam Workshop once you complete the main game and if you have any talent at designing games then you will thoroughly enjoy the provided editor.

												My only prior experience with Shadowrun has been playing it on the Sega Genesis. It was one of favorite games back then. This one is really good, but it didn't blow my mind like the Genesis version did. It felt very similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown but not as polished. Originally you couldn't save your game until you finished a scene, which could take a hour or so, but now you can save anytime. There's still some annoying elements like not being able to trade items with your crew during a run.Overall I think this game has a lot going for it. The story ""The Deadman's Switch"" and the game play was entertaining. The workshop content is also a great way to extend your playing time with your character. I'm happy I played through it and looking forward to playing the next installment Shadowrun: Dragonfall. "

Gameplay is slow and reminiscent of early final fantasy although the enemies don't bounce when they attack but the story line is interesting, the graphics are very nice and it is an excellent break from FPS games where hair trigger is just a bit too slow.

												Overview:Pros:-	2D environments and portraits-	Interesting characters-	great writing-	refreshing setting-	diverse skill systemCons:-	3D effects-	linear story-	story goes a little off the rail in the final act-	endgame fights (enemies appear out of nowhere, required party members)RPGs are my favorite genre. Nevertheless I didn’t enjoy recent RPGs like I used to. Yes, they might have great graphics, good gameplay mechanics or a well-crafted skill system, but the one aspect I find them lacking is the storytelling. Shadowrun Returns is an exception.Before I start getting into the details, I have to say I watched several gameplay and review videos before I picked it up. To be honest – I wasn’t impressed. Even though the hand-crafted 2D environments are gorgeous and vivid, the character models as well as the visual effects are far from impressive. Nevertheless, I gave it a shot and I wasn’t disappointed.The Shadowrun universe combines Cyberpunk aspects with the return of magic and metahumans in a futuristic world. The player slips into the role of a shadowrunner, an operative who will steal, infiltrate, hack and kidnap for the right price. The protagonist has to deal with powerful corporations, corruption, mythical creatures and fellow shadowrunners to survive.When it comes to creating a character that is your own, Shadowrun excels. You can choose between five races you might find in a fantasy RPG (human, elf, dwarf, ork, troll), which feel quite fresh in this unfamiliar setting. Your character can choose from six pre-made classes:-	Street Samurai: become a gun-wielding or close-range killing machine-	Mage: Fireballs, buffs and Debuffs. The familiar choice.-	Decker: jack into the Matrix to fight security systems with your programs-	Rigger: use small drones to support your team or deal damage-	Shaman: use totems or summon spirits to defeat your enemies-	Adept: use magic to enhance your own abilities, making yourself a weaponFurthermore you can also start from scratch and spend Karma points and create your own experience. Technoshaman? Combat Decker? Everything is possible, as long as you don’t spread the Karma points too thin. Skill checks are quite common in dialogue options and spending some points in Charisma or Intelligence can be worthwhile.The inventory system is quite rudimentary. Characters wear an outfit and can carry up to three weapons. Everyone can carry up to six consumables and Magic users as well as Deckers have a spellbook with up to six slots. To further improve skills or stats, cyberware can be implanted. However this results in increased cooldowns for spells.The gameplay revolves around a team of up to 4 shadowrunners. During the majority of the game you can hire a team and choose them depending on your group dynamics. Or your cash on hand, since shadowrunners don’t work for free. The combat system is round-based and reminds of Fallout 1 & 2. Action points have to be spend wisely to move, attack or use consumables like medkits and grenades.You have to read! Where many games try to tell their stories with cutscenes and voice acting, Shadowrun Returns presents the story with superb writing. Whenever you travel to a new location or meet a character the situation is beautifully described before you have to worry about combat or dialogue choices. Combined with vibrant character portraits, the characters you encounter feel alive.The different races and classes offer replayability. My first playthrough (normal, Human Decker) took 9+ hours. Due to the familiarity with enemy placement and linear storyline, my second run (very hard, Dwarf Mage) took a little over five hours. I can see myself coming back to try out different classes, however for now I’m enjoying the Dragonfall DLC (very hard, Troll Adept).I would highly recommend this game to players who enjoy round-based RPGs, which concentrate on storytelling.

												A tale of two halves.The first half is a basic-yet-intriguing cyberpunk XCOM-lite game. The second is a tedious, monotonous, dragged-out affair that completely spoils everything and made me very glad it was only $2.50 when I picked it up.PROS-Crisp art style that lends itself fairly well to the setting-Some interesting characters (kind of)-The music is decent the first time around-Neat outfits-It's less than ten hours....CONS-Environments/levels are 99% static and lifeless-The dialogue/script is wildly inconsistent in terms of style, going from grandiose to vernacular at will. It's like two or three different guys were writing without consulting the design document. Then at the end they were just like ""♥♥♥♥ it, too hard to redo all this work""-After a couple hours, the music grates-Combat is far too simple to be enjoyable for long-Lack of cool loot/drops-Exceedingly linear-Most characters are neat at first but then it becomes obvious there's no depth-The narrative takes a wild shift in the second half, and it's not for the betterment of the game-The second half is only more difficult because gobs of enemies are thrown at you, rather than anything clever or original-Puzzles can all be solved by holding down Alt to see what few things are interactive-Terrible ending that made me uninstall immediately after closing the game-Along with the tonal shifts, most of the scant humor isn't funny, and the cyberpunk/Shadowrun terms were used in a tryharding manner rather than making sense or adding atmosphere-Lots of typos and generally-lazy writing-Decking is uselessly dullOverall it's a game that starts out strong and finishes way after boredom sets in. The combat is stale with little-to-no tactical depth, and level design is so narrow-sighted and basic that I can't help but think these guys are out of their league. And this is from someone who views cyberpunk as the best genre in all of media.			"

												I cannot put into words how much I love this game. There really are not enough good RPGs out there nowadays, this is an example, something to measure any RPGs by. Shadowrun is unique in many ways, most good. But before I start my big parade on how amazing this game is, let's look at the negatives. There is no adjustable difficulty setting, which I think is a plus but most look at as a bad. It can be repetitive, and sometimes a little bit clunky and unresponsive, but this factors don't occur often, I mean it is and RPG so you will be doing somethings more than you'd like to. And now the positives, there's a lot. This game is old school, in difficulty, its isometric layout and dialogue etc. The game has no speaking, so there is a bit of reading. Characters are memorable, and the fight system is superb. Choosing your crew is essential to living long enough to get paid, and you really feel like the little things you do actually will matter at some later point, and they mostly do. I love it so much, and I think it has set a new standard for its genre.			"

												While the first campaign, ""the death mans switch"" has great storytelling, it is appearent that it´s just the first baby steps that the company took for shadowrun returns. that becomes specially clear, when you play the DLC, Dragonfall... it is a HUGE improvement on so many levels, that i can´t point them all out here... Great storytelling is the special strenghth of SR:R, and with many sideplots, active decisions that matter, a more polished world that immediately drives you into the Shadowrun universe, lot´s of additional weapons, cyberwear and other stuff, Dragonfall makes huge steps into the right direction. HBS (the developer) activelly listened (and still does) to their players. bringing lot´s of the improvements that the community asked for. So: if you are an oldschool RPG fan, or just someone who likes to read great stories, you aren´t grafx-b***ing and can appreciate low-budget-huge-dedication,  plus you want to support one of the few small developers who really put all their heart into their game and interacts with their community then i can only recommend you buy both SR:Returns + Dragonfall... for that price you get several hours of great entertainment in a Cyberpunk/Fantasy crossover setting.SR:R is what it is... Shadowrun at it´s ultimate core			"

												I had never played the SNES version of this game.  But I was absolutley hooked on the Sega Genesis version.  This new rendition of a classic is, to say the least, Fraggin' awesome!!  The good people at Harebrained Schemes really deliver a terrific balance of new technique and classicly proven rpg elements.  Whether your here for some good old fashioned turned based RPG combat, or to lose yourself in a great story I'd recommend this game.Game-play, controls, mechanics all come pretty standard with this game.  Its a ""tutorial-while-you-play"" learning curve.  The dev's manage to balance it decently.  If youre new to RPG's, and turn-based combat, you might have a slight up hill battle learning the in's and out's of the game.  But if your a fly by fan, or hardcore RPG junkie, you'll find it easy and intuitive. Again, I highly recommend it! "

												ahhhhhh, sitting back with a glass of 15 year glenlivet and a pipe in your man chair. It's hard to find a more refreshing and manlier past time....oh wait, what is this? Cyberpunk infused with a refreshing take on fantasy? In an Isometric rpg using hand crafted maps with a unique art style? I have a game to play, enough of this manly lounging about!tl;dr;  Overall 7/10. Worth the cash if your gaming plate is empty and, you want a fun rpg with decent story telling and stunning, unique, art direction and  visuals to sit back and relax with.-hardcore rpgs fans will find the Dev's campaigns lacking rpg-ness in areas-those who want the best parts of the campign will have to pay $30 for the toolset and dragonfall -it missed its calling -> it needs networking/co-op support so it can be used as a pnp campaign tool for shadowrunners. In my opinion, with these expansions added on this tool would be hands down the best way to run a pnp shadowrun campaign with friends.Shadowrun plays as a mix between old school isometric rpgs such as baldurs gate and uses a combat system similar to the new Xcom by Firaxis. Unfortunatey though the first campagin is...lacking. While a fun play through and introduction to the universe, it is necessary to buy the dragonfall campaign to truly see what this framework is capable of. However, hardcore Isometric rpg fans will find this game lacking. Side quests are few and far between, you have no control over how your npc companions (depending upon the campaign by harebrained) level up, and a general lack of freedom in what should be a more open world experience. However, the game is primarily designed for being a tool that players use to build their own campaigns. Sadly though, this shouldn't have to be a substitute for harebrain's lack of campaign building talent. The game also needs co-op, just hear me out. This is turn based game, based upon a pen a paper rpg, with focus on building a single character for a player with full stats/""classes"", with tools to build your own campaigns and maps. While entertaining to experience in single player, and as cool as the build your own rpg framework is, it missed its calling. This is a tool that could be expanded to actually run a pen and paper campaigns! There are things like roll20.net but lets be honest, the visual tools and dice support are lacking for odd ball rpgs like Shadowrun (huge lack of cyberpunk visuals like tiles/characters/creatures and a lot of custom equation building required to get it running properly). Adding networking/co-op would allow a savvy dm to build their own maps/campaigns and run a pnp rpg with visual support and a set rule framework for combat! (seriously, the art direction is gorgeous and no need to worry about that ""one player"" cheating their stats or rule loop holes).Overall, for the price ($30 if you buy all the dev built campaigns) it's worth the money. The 2 campaign  stories are fun, the lenghts of the stories are good, the changes in Dragonfall are proof that harebrained is listening to the community to improve upon their stories, tool upgrades, and improving rpg elements in their own work. There are a few bugs/optimizations that need to be sorted out but, I also need to upgrade my pc (really badly) so I'd like to hear how those with beefier rigs hold up. (I'm pretty sure the issues I ran into were due to the HD graphics straining my rig at high resolutions).			"

												This game, this game is one of the few titles I can name that truly inspires my mind to delve depths unimaginable the setting is superb, the lore rich and thick and let's not forget the beautiful controls and gameplay all in all I would say this title is one of my absolute favorites, but let's talk about why.First off the setting is one of the, if not the most beautifully crafted settings to grace the games industry the world feels alive and full of character and emotion as though it is dripping pure atmosphere and spawning true intrigue this is because it is built off of an amazing title already being part of the deep and wonderful world of Shadowrun making it one of the best modern iterations of a classic game series I have ever had the pleasure to step into.Now let's saunter on over to the lore of the game, which is built upon the original Pen and Paper title and the superb yet confusing NES and Genesis title, not to spoil anything too major but the entire world has been changed massively by an event called the awakening and yea, you know what just go read up on everything else.The gameplay is another area I want to cover as the game plays like an Turn Based Roleplaying Game, now the game comes with one preinstalled mission which is actually quite huge but there are a lot of player made missions on sites like NexusMods and even on the workshop itself add on the beautiful levelling system which stops you becoming extremely over powered early and you have fantastic gameplay.But I don't think the game is one hundred percent perfect, the preinstalled story called Dead Mans Switch, unfortunately feels undercooked and doesn't pull off the gritty superb story I expected in short your friend is killed and he hires you post death to find and kill the drek that killed him, I'm not gonna spoil anything but I thought the end villain was weak and uninteresting when they could've done something great with an established character from the beginning.I also shouldn't forget the DLC Dragonfall which in and of itself adds much more to the world and is it's own excellent piece of content adding new characters and more awesome story development.to test my new scoring system I give this 4 stars or a That's Grand LadLook forward to more reviews that hopefully don't sound too pretentious or crap "

												I've always found the Shadowrun setting to be interesting - way back in College, I got to play the pen-n-paper game with some friends a few times. It's nice to have a chance to play a game in that world again, and the quality of the art in this game captures the setting quite nicely!			"

												I am enjoying this game very much. It has a great story, and well crafted mechanics.  More than anything it feels like a series of old-school rpg sessions with minitures. My one comment is that it is at heart (IMHO) a tablet game. I am constantly aware of how much more I want the game to do and be.  That doesn't detract from what it is.   And it gives me high hopes for what the company is working on now.  If you like the genre and want to play an rpg on a tablet, it is a great game!  Otherwise, quirky fun and a good diversion for several hours.			"

												Almost a perfect title.First off, the focus on the editor and the ""module"" approach to the campaign made me think of neverwinter nights (the first one). The fact that the game focused on being highly expandable and customizable made me more forgiving of the campaign's shortcomings.That being said, the game's pretty good, but still lacking. Some of it in terms of interface, some in terms of design (gameplay). Please note, I played on normal difficulty. The storyline is quaint, the visuals are detailed, and flow overall is smooth and enjoyable.1) With all the awesome artwork, the protagonist visuals were extremely boring, whatever look I had in mind for my hero was nowhere to be found in the portrait collection. I just gave up in the end and went with a whatever-approach.2) The chapter oriented campaign moves the story along nicely, but the linearity(sp?) of the game was disappointing, if you didn't manage your resources well, it's gone. This includes karma (xp).3) Moving around when there's no (immediate) combat in combat mode is a chore.4) Too many illusionary dialogue choices. Great, but acknowledging it was also an acknowledgement of it's extremely linear gameplay design (like combat, progression, resource allocation and game balance).Ultimately, I think if they fixed a few things, this title would have a been a true A+, and fans would be clamoring for a sequel like crazy. Unfortunately, in it's current state, it's a great experiment to the throwback that is the shadowrun RPG, but that's all.Maybe some mods would've helped, but the online presence for the game wasn't really there like other games neither. Hopefully they'll come out with some improvements in due time, if not a sequel.			"

Everything I was ambivalent about with DMS was rectified and improved.If you were on the fence after playing DMS then rest assured, Dragonfall is awesome and blows DMS out of the water. This is more than just game mechanics and tweaks. The story telling is better, conversation options are vastly improved, missions are more varied, NPCs are more than just mission givers and your squad mates have personality and history to uncover as you get closer to them.In short I love this game and can't wait for future releases.

												I absolutely love this game. Although it lacks in the free roaming aspect that many RPG’s do well in the story is extremely immersive and the characters are interesting and at times frustrating. The old-school isometric view lends itself well to Shadowrun and the lighting when in urban areas sets a great tone for the dark cyber punk world the game is set in.  The character creation isn’t quite deep enough in regards to ascetics but more than makes up for this in the skill tree and I found myself fiddling with the skills for ages whilst envisioning what kind of cyber punk badass I was going to be. The combat is turn based which I found very refreshing, as I am a massive fan of turn based strategy games, and I found the whole process of finding cover and blasting the enemy very entertaining. To sum up if you’re not a fan of deep story driven games with lots of text and long spells between the action then this game isn’t for you, although I would recommend anyone to embark on this story……you won’t be sorry.

												A great game, lovingly recreated to resemble the old super nintendo game I used to love.  The turn based gameplay works really well and the karma system for levelling up gives limited scope so decisions must be made carefully, rather than having a fully levelled up character before too long.  Dead Mans Switch felt linear and the responses felt as though they didn't really change the game outcome much, however the expansion, Dragonfall, addresses many issues including the ability to save anywhere.  Dragonfall is a much more honed Shadowrun campaign in my opinion and deserves an applause for the production team who clearly thought hard about the game story and characters.  A triumph.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a tactical strategy rpg which functions similar to the X-Com or UFO series games, set in the Shadowrun universe. Pros: *Nice Artstyle*Simple yet effective combat and skill system, allows you to more or less build your ""class"" by picking which stats and skills you want to learn.*Lands the Shadowrun Universe pretty wellCons:*Very short playthrough (core game, not the Shadowrun: Dragonfall expansion)*This game is very easy on ""normal"". I recommend to anyone that has played the genre before to play on the hardest difficulties.*Could use more weapons/armor/configuration. I kept feeling like there should be another drop or weapon coming soon... and it never does.Overall: 7/10Fun game, looks nice, but it's very short and could use more content and story. I am about 5-6 hours in (2 did not get recorded by Steam), and I would say according to the chapter list on most websites I'm about 75% through the game. I am looking forward to trying the expansion however, and I will update my review when I get the chance. Many reviews for the expansion title seem to point out that it's a bit more complete and a touch longer than the core campaign.I would purchase this game again, since I bought it on sale... but I don't think I would pay full price for it. This is a good pickup if you catch it on sale, and if so I would grab the expansion to go with it, otherwise the game may feel a bit incomplete.			"

												Stephenson meets Tolkien in the world of Shadowrun, and it works surprisingly well. I wasn't massively familiar with the PnP RPG roots of Shadowrun before I bought the game, but having completed the Dead Man's Switch campaign, I'd definitely like to know a lot more about it. Cyberpunk dwarves and elves might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you can buy into the principle, there's a lot of depth to be found in the game lore and the mechanics of the game. The character classes are distinct enough to make the game replayable (though making sure you have three levels put into Rifle is pretty much compulsory if you want to get the best out of the combat) and the setting is well realised and nicely polished. One thing it's not is a cyberpunk Baldur's Gate, as the story does run on rails (and is easily dispensed with in around 10-12 hours), so there's no sense that you can just make your way in the world on your own and just discover what there is out there, but that said, the characters are nicely written (I especially like Coyote, Cherry Bomb, Harlequin and Dresden) and easy to invest emotionally in. Definitely worth picking up if you fancy a little old school isometric RPG action, and the mod scene should keep the game fresh for a long time to come.			"

												Shadowrun Returns (7/10)Just played through the main campaign (Dead man's Switch). Never got into the whole P&P shadowrun thing before, but snapped this and the DLC up during the Steam summer sale, and have to say overall I'm rather impressed, albeit I wasn't expecting much. Although it heavily treads the usual Cyberpunk tropes, the mix of races adds something to matters and although I generally relied on hacking and hardware to push through the storyline the magical aspects enhanced the experience to some degree. Play wise it's not long. I took a fancy to playing it yesterday early afternoon and wrapped it up earlier this morning, with a good nights sleep in between (10 hours tops by my reckoning). My main criticism of the principal campaign would really be the near linearity of it. You're basically pushed from pillar to post with very little in the way of deviation or side quests and that pacing felt off given in large part that the beginning of the campaign is an investigation. I wanted to be able to explore Seattle, but the opportunity never really arises versus being pulled by the main narrative.The game also suffers a bit when it comes to equipment. The upgrade path essentially consists of buying a better X versus any degree of customization and although there are various chem tonics you can take to temporarily boost a characters abilities I never felt the need to sacrifice an equipment slot for one, versus using it to carry a med pack instead. The combat is very much in the mould of X-Com, but for reasons unexplained even when all the enemies in a level have been defeated you're often seemingly forced to continue to use the point system to get around, which can get rather tedious at times, though thankfully the levels aren't generally too sprawling. In large part I didn't find the combat too troubling on normal, though towards the end the enemy difficulty does ramp up (a resultant of the narrative) and a bit more thought is required in order to effectively combat some of the threats. Where the game shines most is in the writing, which manages to give you some flexibility in terms of how you 'play' your character tonally. Although I suspect your choices likely don't have any impact in terms of options, it's nice to have that flexibility.			"

												Great game for fans of old school RPG at a great price. If you've read Neuromancer; and loved it, if you've spent countless hours playing Baldur's Gate or older Fallout titles; and couldn't tear yourself away from them, this is a game for you.And once you're done with original campaign, quality user generated content awaits you on Steam Workshop and 3rd party sites like Shadowrun Nexus. Modders are so ambitious that they are recreating whole Shadowrun sourcebooks. So, come on, join us in the shadows, chummer.Shadowrun Dragonfall: I know they are marketing this as merely DLC, but DLC this is not. It is a full blown, old fashioned expansion pack. Dragonfall packs a bigger campaign, set in the anarchy ridden Berlin of 2054, otherwise known as the Flux State.HBS has listened to fans and addressed all the major issues from the original game. Saving your game anywhere? Check! More interesting companions with actual personalities and backstory? Yes, sir! Side missions? Of course! This time around you are not led by the hand. You get a hub, certain Berlin neighborhood, where you can choose your missions, even reject them if Mr. Johnson offering it isn't on the level. You can chat with the (meta)humans living there. Solve their problems. Learn of their past, and they all have some very shady skeletons in the closet. Let's face it, only people running from something come to the F-State...and corporations. But the latter are a different story altogether. Runs themselves have been improved considerably. There are multiple solutions to every problem and some tough choices to be made in practically every one. Enemy encounters have been improved. Combat is more enjoyable, overall. Non-combat skills feature more prominently. Skills and etiquette checks are very frequent. You can go in guns, fists, blades and magic blazing. But you can also do things covertly. It's all up to you.Writing in this game is great. Story takes hold of you, is full of twist and turns, and won't let you go 'till the end. By that time, you'll crave more. Speaking of length, you'll get at least twenty hours out of the game. Even more, if you play on harder difficulties, want to speak to everyone and see everything.Dragonfall is the definitive reason to pick up the original game. If you're into old school RPGs, cyberpunk, and value a good story, you won't be disappointed with this game.			"

												I started playing in order to check out the game.  The first think I noticed was that without going into the settings, movement of my mouse from the game to my desktop was seamless.  As I went on, I noticed other little things that I normally needed to tweak, I didn't.  They just worked.  But more importantly, as I went on, I was transported to a time many years ago in the story, in the environment, in the game play.  If you loved Shadowrun on the SNES, you'll love this.  And if you didn't know about it, you'll find a new love.  The best Kickstarter I've backed, and one of the best games that I've played.  Definitely Recommended.			"

The campaign that ships with the game is very good in its own right: it has an interesting story and dialog, believable and memorable characters, and a great balance between combat, conversation, and puzzle segments.The main campaign ran me about 15 hours, and that alone made the purchase worthwhile.  There's some level of replayability, trying different races/classes/builds, but the main draw will be what the community produces in time.			"

												Great RPG.  The default campaign is well-written and keeps the spirit of the setting well.  Full character customization including magic, adept, decking, rigging, etc.  The campaign editor interfaces with the Steam Workshop, making it easy to find reviews on custom-created campaigns.The system itself is inspired by the Shadowrun rules; spend karma to increase attributes, linked skills, and subskills.  It even gives bonuses for the chosen etiquette.  The skills themselves are similar to Shadowrun skills, but there are certainly differences; in particular, the lack of stealth or perception.Despite any shortcomings, it's a fun game with an immersive atmosphere.  Expect about 25 hours of original gameplay in the default campaign, more with custom campaigns and replayability. "

												The story is quite linear (something they want to change in the Berlin campaign), but I really enjoyed completing it once and I am now in my second playthrough (now with the DRM-free version on Linux) with a different character and while it is still the same story, it feels different, because they provide different ways to solve situations, e.g. sending a drone through a small hole to open the door from the inside instead of finding a key.This is the game I hoped for when I backed it on KickStarter, I really recommend it!

Dead Man's SwitchShadowrun Returns. Indeed it has... this intriguing isometric RPG is a great combat system wrapped in a rollicking mystery that although has a few stumbling points, it is very much worth your time. Returns comes with a built-in campaign that will last you 10-12 hours if you take your time, and with plenty of mods in the community to keep it fresh. GameplayShadowrun Returns has a basic isometric movement system, just click where you want to go/interact with. It's when you get into the easy-to-learn combat system that the game really opens up. You can create your Runner to be a Sorcerer, a Drone-using mastermind, or just a guy with a shotgun that shoots people in the face. The RPG system is good, not overly complicated, and has good conversation trees that can be affected with different levels of Charisma. You can even role-play what type of things your character is knowledgable in. Overall, the gameplay of Shadowrun Returns is slick and stellar. StoryShadowrun Returns has a story that doesn't quite work on the empathy stakes... there's no reason really to care for any of the characters you meet, and some of the Runners you can hire are simply generic. If they die, it's just a *shrug* and leave them behind. However, the actual mystery behind the game and what's going on I found to be motivating enough... although it starts off slow, you want to meet the 'Ripper' until you actually stop playing the game- though after you've met him, things really start to get interesting... Graphics, Atmosphere, and SoundThe graphics of Shadowrun are servicable; sure, they won't dazzle you, but they aren't bad either. It has a nice art-style to make the world come to life, and the character portraits help give you first impressions of the characters, as well as the information that comes through text-wise.The atmosphere is great, with dank hotels and rain-drenched streets beckoning your Runner on. The characters are as fleshed out as you can get in a 'short' campaign as the Dead Man's Switch, but personally, I won't miss any of them. The music quality in this game is impeccable. If you are a fan of electronic music, you won't regret listening to the tracks that are on offer here. 'Double Cross' is my personal favorite track. The additional sounds of guns and sorcery that permeate the air whilst fighting adds to the atmosphere. ConclusionShadowrun Returns, A Dead Man's Switch, is a joy to play, and although the story has a few hiccups and the companion system leaves a lot to be desired, the game is overall a solid reccomendation. Worth your time indeed. Ready to deck into the system?			"

												Undoubtedly beautiful, quite immersive and relatively nonlinear. The greatest drawback of this game is the p&p RPG system it's built upon. I personally find it to be one of the least attractive p&p concepts, doubly so because it invades one of my favourite genres; cyberpunk. Personal buttrage aside, it is a smooth and decently long RPG with a good albeit uninteresting combat system. Play it for a laid-back adventure with a Dreamworks aroma, best enjoyed inside a duvet with plnety of bulk confectionary. [7/10] (personal bias) [8/10] (buttrage aside).			"

												I really enjoyed the game. Shadowrun has a very interesting world and good dialog. The combat system is okay, fairly standard for a turn based tactical game. Downsides were few: selecting things in combat can be clunky, leading to mis-clicks and an inability to move some characters where you want them: the game overall was quite easy as well. I didn't have a single character die, or even get close to death in the campaign and I don't think this is because I played particularly well. Money was very readily available, to the point where I could buy anything I wanted. Overall a good game, mainly for the story, novel setting and dialog.			"

												Less than I hoped for.Shadowrun feels half-baked in a couple of ways:1) The writing was made with care, but there are far too many allussions and jargon phrases that are used without explanation. It feels like jumping into a conversation after its started2) The games menus and iventory don't seem to be finished or have all the detail other games might.3) The game is short. Like really really short. For an RPG, that's usually dissapointing.4) There's all kinds of class/skill options, but there usefulness seems questionable.But there's a silver lining!Combat system has potential, there could be great mods.Puzzles were clever and challenging.The universe is fascinating.Art style is beautiful.

												This game is absolutely great from top to bottom. The main game is a well written and well paced piece of murder mystery cyberpunk action, made with great writing and interesting characters. The writing is so good, in fact, that even characters that show up just once or twice feel really memorable. The graphic style and musical design are top notch and really help make the experience into a cohesive whole. The gameplay is a solid tactical RPG experience that's fun to play, if a bit on the easy side more often than not. The few downsides to the game start with the lack of manual saving. The game automatically saves at checkpoints (probably to prevent save scumming like some other tactical games) which can sometimes be frustrating. The locked angle camera usually is okay, but there are times where it's a problem. Some people will call a 12 hour, very linear main campaign a problem too, but I personally think that it's better to have 12 high-quality hours than 20-25 with lots of filler. So it's not perfect, but it's damned well done. And the inclusion of an editor means that in the end we'll hopefully see a lot more great content from the community.			"

												Not only am I happy with the mechanics of the game, the ease of movement, targeting choices, how skill points and systems make sensible differences, I'm most happy with how it feels.  This is a really satisfying outlet from my days of playing on a tabletop and gives a good sense of cyberpunk.  The writers have done a good job creating a story that draws you in and makes you want to see what all the options were.  I still don't have completions for 'Returns' or 'Director's Cut', but I aim to get there, eventually.Icing on the cake is how active the community is with the add-ons, additional stories, art sets, and general enthusiasm.  Of the various games I've played in Steam, I have liked this community the most.  Try it for yourself.  I think you'll find it was a good choice.			"

												While I like this game a lot, others may not, depending on what they're expecting.If you are expecting any edition of the tabletop role-playing game, or the Genesis or SNES console games, you will be disappointed.  Shadowrun: Returns plays something like a simplified version of tabletop rules that never actually existed.I liked the plot, combat, and music.Opinions on the plot vary widely.  If you have an aversion to reading, this game is not for you.  Almost all of the plot is delivered via screens of text upon entering an area, or text dialogs.  There is no voiceover.  Some people complain of purple prose, or that it seems to have been written by someone that is immature, but the writing is superior to that in most video games, including most other RPGs.  I personally do not perceive any of these problems, and have never seen examples cited.Screenshots do not do the combat system justice.  Some of the interface is only displayed when it is relevant.  For example, the action point cost of movement, and the effectiveness of cover, only appear when you prepare to move, and when cover exists in the area you mouseover.  The combat system is relatively simple (which is reflected in the user interface), but like Chess, can be quite difficult.  The difficulty is selectable at character creation, so if you find the game too easy or hard you can adjust it.  Since almost all RPGs are combat-heavy, it's important that it not be mindless and repetitive.The music is hard to describe.  It is not ambient.  You will notice it.  I especially like the theme on the title screen.I didn't like some things about Shadowrun: Returns.It is very linear, and most decisions will not affect the ending.The gameplay in the matrix is very similar to meatspace.  It's not so much that the gameplay in the matrix is bad as it doesn't feel different enough.The game only saves on area transition.  If you have to stop playing, or die, unexpectedly, you can lose quite a bit of progress.			"

												As someone who's never played Shadowrun previously, I'm pretty happy with the system mechanics and how the story folds out. I played it on Very Hard difficulty, which didn't actually seem all too difficult (if anything, I felt like my team missed their attacks more often than they should have). This is also based on the Dead Man's Switch campaign, which comes with the game.I customized my character originally as a Rigger, focusing on Drone Control, with a few levels in Pistols. I later added Decking to my skills, keeping its levels even with my Drones, and it seemed to work out very successfully, in that I never felt that my character was over-reliant on my companions other than for additional damage output.The game does have a couple of bugs in some places: the first major one I noticed was when I bought level 2 Decker abilities, where they did not show up in my inventory/stash at all after I bought them. I had to trust the game actually did register that I possessed them, as they were also absent from the store (which is normal if you already had it), and later on in the game, when level 3 Decker abilities were made available, the behavior seemed to correct itself.The other major bug I found was in the room for the final battle (I'll try not to be spoilery). There are pieces in the room which are either active or inactive, and to keep the battle more manageable, you want to keep all of them inactive as much as possible. However, there were a few instances where I couldn't actually target an active piece (quicksave/loading fixed this), and a few times where a piece appeared inactive, but I knew based on enemy behavior in the battle that it was actually active.

												Shadowrun. I picked up the Pen and Paper RPG when I was younger. Sadly it took years before finding a group to play it. Luckly around my University years I found a decent group of people and we are gaming since than. I am an hardcore fan so probably my Review could be a bit biased. Frist of all I strongly suggest to read a bit before gaming. Just the ""Primer"" which is a small guide\introduction to the World of Shadowrun available from the site Shadowrun Universe (official site for all things related to Shadowrun). Once you have the Primer you can have a good idea of what to expect from the Setting. I know that at a frist glance it looks strange maybe even too much but trust me it is awesome. The more you will dig the better it will get, specially if you start to read the various RPG manuals and novels. If you liked the setting buy this game. The basic Campaign included in Shadowrun Returns is a classic. If you never rped or played Shadowrun (I am mostly referring to SNES and GENESIS Games) this is a wonderfull start. The narration is set in 2050s which is a very cool period for Shadowrun (keep in mind that in the current RP Setting the time is around 2075) and it is based on some of the hottest plots of that period. The game is a basic Turn Based Combat with RP elements in the form of dialogues where the various options depends on which skill you have. Back when it was just published the Game lacked few things like save anywhere option. Luckly this was fixed up in the 1st DLC Dragonfall. Dragonfall is even better than the basic game. The Devs listened to us Players and fixed few things and I dare to say even took inspiration from some of UGC - User generated Content (More of this later). Dragonfall can look a bit boring at the start with the logic of ""Do a Run, get back and run again"" (Run is a work, a mission in Shadowrun) but the Narration, the Plot goes always up till its end. In Dragonfall I was not impressed by the first Runs but nearby the end I could not stop to see how this Story was going to end. The only negative side of both Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall is that you can not manage your NPCs. You can select who can help you in a Run but you do not have any kind of control on their Skills and how they improve. Probably this will be fixed in future DLCs. If the basic game and the DLC are not enough there are UGCs. Shadowrun Community is very active and Devs select from time to time some UCG to play just to show up how much it is good. There are a lot of good Artist out there who are working on big UCG like remakes of SNES and Genesis Shadowrun Games. I strongly suggest to take a loot at ""Shadowrun Unlimited"". I hope all of this makes sense. In any case, if you start to play and dig into the Shadows of Shadowrun remember: ""Shoot straight, conserve your ammo and never make a deal with a Dragon"".			"

												Ive been fan of the Shadowrun ever since i first played on the Genesis and Snes and was glad to see a new iteration of it come out. The game still follows all of it rules and has a great look and story that fits the Shadowrun world great.While I still do recommend the game to fans of the Shadowrun world, it does have some really bad bugs / glitches still and wouldnt recommend it unless you love the shadowrun series.Fans of the first two fallout games might find some interest in this title as well since the combat sytem is set up very similar,although a  buggy (almost feels incomplete) version of it.Just an example of a few combat bugs to give people an idea of what thier getting into.A bug for shamans where when you summon a spirit which will cause the combat system to break and not be able to use or select any of characters during youre turn and basicly forcing you to forfeit the rest of your turn which will most likely cause a death of one of your runners.Another bug is where and enemy attacking you will shoot you through walls while you not only cannot shoot because of line sight issue and wont be able to even see the enemy untill you run around the wall.A bug where when you try to heal your drone out of combat it will say immune not heal your drone and use a repair kit.So I would say a good game for the price if your a fan of the series but if not I would probaly skip over this one.

												Really a big fan of turn-based RPGs since Fallout and Fallout 2 as well as a fan of the pencil and paper, table-top RPG game. The description and reviews are fairly accurate. The thing that really hooked me was when the game was approaching a foreseeable ending and then took a left turn at Crazy Street. Totally surprised me in a good way and extended the gameplay by a couple of hours. Looking forward to replaying as a different spec character to see if there are any other twists that I missed. After that, it's some serious contemplation on whether to buy the DLC or venture off into the user created material that seems to be free of charge. All in all, a fun, solid game with unexplored aspects awaiting.			"

												Shadowrun Returns by itself is an excellent RPG game that blends the science fiction dystopia of William Gibson's cyberpunk genre and a fantasy world that deliciously warps the traditional roles. I never liked elves, but give one a data-jack smart link shotgun and some chrome wolverine claws and suddenly I think they're worth talking about.As someone who never played Shadowrun tabletop or even really had an idea of what it was, this game has launched me into an entire new realm of games. After finishing the first campaign I immediately went and bought a copy of the Shadowrun 5th edition sourcebook.The first DLC; Dragonfall, is even better than the original campaign both as a new story and a starting point for new players. The writers have only gotten better and they really immerse you in the details of an anarchist Berlin, plagued by crime and the ever present corporate political encroachment. Definitely recommend this game whole heartedly to both Shadowrun veterans and new players alike. Play. This. Game.			"

												Is it an RPG? In the sense that you have items, experience points, and character classes. But ultimately, this is just a really fun cyberpunk adventure game. It tells a cool story, and its well developed. If you like a good cyberpunk game, this is required.			"

												This was one of those games that was incredibly fun to play and it was worth every penny, but you also saw how much more there could be simply due to how well everything else worked. Simply more of exactly what you saw to allow deeper progressions, more missions, more.... You saw incredible buildings that were never used, etc... I highly recommend the game, certainly. Buy it. I just like it enough, and the pieces all seem to be there, to know that time may have prevented this from being completely fleshed out. I await more!!!			"

												Bloody awesome RPG and a bloody awesome RPG. I don't regret spending a single cent on it. Basically it's a bit like a cross between Blade Runner and Lord of the Rings. You play a Shadowrunner, a bounty hunter who does difficult and risky jobs in a near-future world where magic has returned to the Earth, cyber-augmentation is very real, and meta-humans like elves and orks walk among us. Truly cool in every aspect, no?			"

												Funded this game back when the kickstarter campaign was around. Spent $10, and would gladly spend $20+ on it. Granted, I am a long-time shadowrun fan, but it's a great game for rpg fans.While the graphics may not be the greatest, and the original story was pretty good at best (the Dragonfall DLC definitely makes up for it, it's another game in itself), what really makes up for it is all the user generated content that is coming out. A reboot of the snes title was the first project I saw pop up, and have been following since.Shadowrun Unlimited, is more of a non-linear style of game. I'm only a couple of hours into it, but there is so much more to it than the original game (more cyberware, more programs to be used in cyberspace, etc.), and it has much more replayability (random missions) than the original game.That's just a couple of mods that I've been keeping an eye on, and there's plenty more where those came from.If you like turn-based strategy, with both mystical (magic, dwarves, elves, etc.) and futuristic elements, it's most definitely worth picking up.

												Ok so i had never heard of shadowrun, not the Table game, books or the Vid-games, but got intrested when i saw the game show up on the store slider page and reading the description about the sci fi, cyberpunk, fantasy mix and seeing i had the funds sitting in the wallet thought i might aswell give it a go. I loved the setting & story the diffrent ways you can play depending on the characters and abilitys you choose to specilise with to get through the game, the first story 'deadman's swtich' was enjoyable but on replay i did notice what other people mentioned how there wasent much exploreing or side quests branching from the main plot as it throws you down the main story but all the same was enjoyable. the second story thats out however was a massive imrpovement 'Dragonfall' you're responcible for a whole area of people each character has their individual storys, there's many sidequests that branch off the main plot, and the choices you make can effect various details through the later game.In short i thought this game was great! and has replay value though mainly with the 'dragonfall' campaign, the graphics aint the most amazeing thing but i couldent care less!, i preffer games that are enjoyable, have good story & content. I strongly recomend this game to any rpg fans & anyone who enjoys good storylines in sci fi settings. :)			"

												Shadowrun Returns is an adaptation of the classic cyberpunk tabletop pen and paper RPG. Set in an alternative history future where magic has returned to the world, elves, dwarves, trolls, and orks live side by side with humans in dense urban cities, and corporations are a law unto themselves; the game centers around the segment of humanity who makes their living in the shadows, the runners. Hacker, mercenary, detective, sorcerer, where there is a job that needs doing, there will be someone willing to get paid to do it.The game itself is a single player, turn-based strategy RPG, utilizing 3/4 isometric perspective with 3D character models set against sprite based backgrounds. The sprite backgrounds are static and well done, while the character designs are somewhat poorly textured with resolution below that which the majority of modern systems could easily handle; belying the limited budget the company had to work with. Gameplay takes the form of point and click interaction with the world map and carries over directly into combat, utilizing the same environments. Combat is somewhat klunky, as there are problems with the interaction of the courser and corners of the movement field.The game itself is, however, merely a platform. It is in reality intended for players to build and share their own Shadowrun campaigns, and the full game editor comes included with the base game as well as a professionally developed campaign. Thanks to Steam Works, player campaigns are free, though professionally developed campaigns will be sold as DLC as they become available. Sadly there is no multiplayer option what-so-ever, crippling one of the intregral elements of the pen-and-paper game.Overall, the game's campaign will run you around 12 hours, and is a good buy if you can get it on sale, for any enthusiast of turn-based strategy RPGs.

												I absolutely love this game. Although it lacks in the free roaming aspect that many RPG’s do well in the story is extremely immersive and the characters are interesting and at times frustrating. The old-school isometric view lends itself well to Shadowrun and the lighting when in urban areas sets a great tone for the dark cyber punk world the game is set in.  The character creation isn’t quite deep enough in regards to ascetics but more than makes up for this in the skill tree and I found myself fiddling with the skills for ages whilst envisioning what kind of cyber punk badass I was going to be. The combat is turn based which I found very refreshing, as I am a massive fan of turn based strategy games, and I found the whole process of finding cover and blasting the enemy very entertaining. To sum up if you’re not a fan of deep story driven games with lots of text and long spells between the action then this game isn’t for you, although I would recommend anyone to embark on this story……you won’t be sorry.

												A great game, lovingly recreated to resemble the old super nintendo game I used to love.  The turn based gameplay works really well and the karma system for levelling up gives limited scope so decisions must be made carefully, rather than having a fully levelled up character before too long.  Dead Mans Switch felt linear and the responses felt as though they didn't really change the game outcome much, however the expansion, Dragonfall, addresses many issues including the ability to save anywhere.  Dragonfall is a much more honed Shadowrun campaign in my opinion and deserves an applause for the production team who clearly thought hard about the game story and characters.  A triumph.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a tactical strategy rpg which functions similar to the X-Com or UFO series games, set in the Shadowrun universe. Pros: *Nice Artstyle*Simple yet effective combat and skill system, allows you to more or less build your ""class"" by picking which stats and skills you want to learn.*Lands the Shadowrun Universe pretty wellCons:*Very short playthrough (core game, not the Shadowrun: Dragonfall expansion)*This game is very easy on ""normal"". I recommend to anyone that has played the genre before to play on the hardest difficulties.*Could use more weapons/armor/configuration. I kept feeling like there should be another drop or weapon coming soon... and it never does.Overall: 7/10Fun game, looks nice, but it's very short and could use more content and story. I am about 5-6 hours in (2 did not get recorded by Steam), and I would say according to the chapter list on most websites I'm about 75% through the game. I am looking forward to trying the expansion however, and I will update my review when I get the chance. Many reviews for the expansion title seem to point out that it's a bit more complete and a touch longer than the core campaign.I would purchase this game again, since I bought it on sale... but I don't think I would pay full price for it. This is a good pickup if you catch it on sale, and if so I would grab the expansion to go with it, otherwise the game may feel a bit incomplete.			"

												The Dragonfall expansion single-handedly did justice to Shadowrun Returns. The Dragonfall campaign build brings a much more involving and intricate storyline, choices, side-missions and memorable NPC companions, resulting in longer gameplay and satisfaction compared to the 12-hour long original. There were certain tweaks to the mechanics of the core game, it seems. For example, there will no longer be extra action points garnered from cybernetics, but this is compensated for via game balancing. There are new portraits to choose from (though still quite limited visual customization) but no changes to the skill trees. Games can be saved at almost every point of the game now, not just at savepoints, so that's another step forward. There are new music scores with this campaign, and they all set the mood satisfactorily for the throughout the gameplay. I still find the beats from the original campaign more to my liking, but that's personal opinion. Some issues inherent in the original was still present in this one. Missing sprites, limitations to allocating picked-up items to teammates outside of combat and the occassional AP bug can still be encountered. However, I would not personally hold this against the expansion as this one is does seem like the developer's turn of churning out an AAA campaign using the same builder tools made available to the community. I grew up playing and loving role-playing games that were akin to reading sci-fi fantasy book sets. After Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Arcanum and Neverwinter Nights, I am relieved to be able to add Shadowrun Returns into my collection of RPG games worth the ages. To enjoy this one, you'll have to read, children, and dig into your storeroom for that old thing called an 'active imagination'. If Shadowrun Returns left you feeling wanting, then Dragonfall will bring you past dessert.			"

												Excellent! Loved it!There is no free roaming - this game is on rails.  It's more like an interactive William Gibson novel than Fallout Tactics.But it's the writing that really stands out,  that and the the RPG setting.  After playing this, I think if i ever did pen and paper again I'd like to try Shadowrun.  It reminds me a lot of Traveller (all-time favorite pen and paper RPG) in some respects.The music is good and fits the game well.The art is unique - be sure to zoom in occasionally to check out the details.In some of the levels, you will have a character jacked into the matrix and running alone,  while the rest of the team defends the access point (and the helpless cybernaut).  The game does a good job of creating a genuine feeling of urgency in these situations.Save points:  the game saves for you.  if you screw up a level you have to play it over again.  Did not care for this.I did not find it possible while on a mission to drop out of combat (when no enemies were visible) to move easier -  either i just never figured out how,  or it's not possible.  It should be automatic.  Did not care for this.I found the early game fights weak & easy.  Later scenarios were more difficult.Many reviews I have read lamented that the game is too short.  If you were expecting an open world roamer,  it is -  but if you are expecting a good novel,  it's not.   And ultimately, i think that's what this game is - a good novel.Speaking of good novel,  i found after playing  - being curious about some of the characters -  that i had met a very famous (in the milleu) dragon,  and an immortal - both subtly and (believe it or not) *realistically* portrayed.  another example of good writing.More side quests and missions would have been nice -  but it would have detracted from coherence.If you like cyberpunk novels, or gritty film noir,    you'll probably like this game.   I picked it up on sale for ~7.00$  and it's Definitely worth that.			"

												A pretty good game and a blast from the past in terms of style. Its got an interesting world and characters. The main campaign feels very much like the one from Neverwinter Nights - a holdover until the community builds content via the editor. The AI is a little weak; the game relies on overwhelming you with bad guys which is a bit annoying but overall combat is really interesting. It's sort of a cross between Advance Wars on the Gameboy and the freeware game Battle of Wesnoth. Improvements for the future could be a party system that allows you to customise a team of 4. That would be a great addition.			"

												For years now I've considered old-school isometric genres to be 'my' genre. That is to say, the one that strictly caters to my sensibilities as a player. I discovered them well after their golden age, and since this wave of kickstarted CRPGs began I've been eagerly awaiting their results.As the first one out of the gate from this batch, Shadowrun Returns does not disappoint. If you're like me and you've been aching for a deep and immersive roleplaying experience and actual agency when it comes to solving problems, this game is a steal at $20. Excellent writing, beautiful environments, and a fantastic soundtrack all tied together with engaging combat and character progression.The campaign will take you about 15 hours to run through, and there's sadly little in the way of extended diversions, and the game is rather linear in how it progresses. There's not much of a sense of an 'open world' that one would expect from this genre, but even still the world itself is one of the most well-realized and vibrant ones I've seen in a long time.They've got another campaign on the way, and you're going to see plenty of gameplay content coming out of the steam workshop, so I can guarantee you'll have your money's worth in actual meaty game.If you like RPGs at all you owe it to yourself to grab this game and play through it. You'll be really glad you did.			"

												I was a backer for this game on Kickstarter and it has not dissapointed!  The game is fantastic!  Honestly I can't believe how polished it is with the small budget they had to work with.  With a built-in editor and Steam Workshop support I can't wait to start playing all the community content.For an old school RPG fan, for a Shadowrun fan, for a turn based combat fan, for a fan of excellent and entertaining writing and incredible setting, this game is for you!Update November 2016:Over three years later and Harebrained have released two much better Shadowrun games.  I am nominating Shadowrun Returns for the write-in vote on the Steam Awards because it was such a great comeback for a classic rpg setting.  Still a good game in its own right and absolutely worth a playthrough.			"

Highly recommended, though it seems like Dragonfall is the smarter buy.			"

												*i've only beaten Dead Man's Switch and my short rant will only conver it*My first impression of this game was really great and i was really impressed by the story wirting , art direction and character building but as i progressed through the game its flaws have became more apparent .Story wirting is good through out the whole game and the writer/s seems like a knowledgeable person but i was really surprised when i noticed spelling and grammer mistakes! For me it wasn't a big problem since English is not my native language but i think many native-English gamers will find it annoying .The gameplay machanics are good but have small problems that can be annoying at times .Some of them are technical (like when you set the character to overwatch a certain enemy/area and then it goes out of the previously set range and waste a bullet and an AP point) and some of them are design flaws (like being forced to traverse a whole floor in battle mode even if there is no enemy left) .For the game design in general i really wished that the developers have reused the previously visted locations for side-missions to increase the game time and value because in the end this is an RPG game and not COD .This game have its flaws but i was able to look past them and enjoy it .That's why i'm recommending it .

												Shadowrun Returns is a decent CRPG that has definite bona fides back to the isometric giants of ages past.  The content is well written and fits the universe it's set in.  The combat is fun, if a bit less than challenging and less common then you'd hope.The game does feel a bit ""on rails"", however, especially when compared to the games it harkens back to.  This isn't the utter gigantism of something like Baldur's Gate.  The game is pretty small, the party options are limited (you only get to allocate stats and alter the inventory of the main character, for example).  I bought SRR during the steam summer sale.  It was worth the $3.50, easily.  I'm hoping to discover a lot of additional content in the workshop.			"

Not a lot here for Deckers and Mages. That being said...Dragonfall absolutely makes up for this, with many mission possibilities limited to only Deckers, Riggers and Mages.

Also there is lot of stuffs you can buy, and stats to level in. Frequent changes of your companions help keep fights variability on decent level.

												OK, I've been playing for a couple hours, and I was hesitant to buy this game because of the reviews. But I like Shadowrun lore and ambiance, so I gave it a shot. I played Shadowrun when it came out for SNES.Now: I would cathegorize this game as an ""interaction novel"". Most of the players wanted a sandbox or at least some freedom, but this is no game for that. This game tells a story where you are involved in. There are some RPG aspects like leveling and building your character, but that is not the core of the game (I think).If you are looking for a short sci-fi story you can play, then go ahead, I recommend this game. If you are a Shadowrun stories fan, then you should give it a try too. If you are looking for an action game, a sandbox or a game where you can choose where to go, then this is not a game for you. It has click adventure parts, it has tactical turn-based parts, but the core is the story. Some player have said the story is sh$%#"". For me it is working, so far.CheersEdit: If you are looking for turn based strategy game or you are not into Shadowrun lore, go for XCOM: enemy unknown and within			"

Emerse yourself in the dystopia world of megacorps and shadowrunners.  Forget about Starbucks.  Put on your Doc Martins, flannel shirt and the dusty old Pearl Jam CD.

												Worth buying for the writing alone. Its dialogue and prose are clean and razor sharp, like something from a William Gibson novel.It does have its shortcomings:- The combat can be repetitve. It doesn't feel like they got the most out of the engine. - The player character models are due for a revamp. Compared to Glory in Dragonfall, the standard characters look a bit awkward.- It's hard to know which class to play. I've found myself starting over sevral times because I didn't like my character choice.If you can look past these flaws, Shadowrun Returns will reward you with a solid story, interesting characters and spotless branching dialogue. Not since the golden age of CRPGs has a game felt so much like a great piece of literature. GET IT.			"

												This game is quite the nostalgia trip. They really nailed the look and feel of gritty ol' Seattle of 2054, and the music is just stellar. It's an old view of the future, played in the old ways of RPGs. That means lots of turn-based combat and lots of reading. LOTS of reading. The story is nothing stellar -- what Shadowrun fiction ever is -- but it's a fun return to familiar territory. I haven't dug into the user-generated stuff, but the main campaign is easily worth the asking price if you have any love of cyberpunk.That said, if you buy this, then I highly recommend picking up the Dragonfall expansion as well.

												Gameplay is topnotch Tactical RPG stuff. Its fun to make your character however you'd like them, and the skills are laid out in a straightforward way. Spell variety leaves a little bit left to be desired, and I personally wouldve liked greater variety for implants, but is all in all very solid. Storyline for the default game, called ""The Deadman's Switch"" is boring and linear, and you dont spend a long enough amount of downtime to talk to and connect with your party members. Also playing a decker is a waste of time as theres very few times you actually get to enter the Matrix. Hold your hand too much and feels shallow because of itThe DLC, Dragonfall, fixes the above problems. It starts a bit linear just like before, but theres multiple ways to clear any area, as well as plenty of time between missions to talk with your fellow Shadowrunners. The plot is much more interesting and there are more ways to use your character's skills, both in the field, and in dialogue choices. The game opens up and you get to start taking missions of your own accord, with each having a small storyline within its own mission.Theres also a metric crapton of great workshop content out for the game, which I think will add tremendously to the games longevity.Bottomline, buy this game, and buy it with the DLC.

I heartily recommend Dragonfall to any RPG enthusiast and especially to anyone who has ever been curious to explore the Shadowrun setting.			"

												I didn't play the original Shadowrun back in the early nineties, so the game gets no retro love in this review. Shadowrun returns is a average cyberpunk and magic theme RPG. The main defect in the game is the vacuity of the gameworld comprised of the different interconnected areas. The game basically gives you only plot items to interact and the city locations are small. True to the ""pocket world"" RPG approach the plot is your average RPG pipeline stuff. Shadowrun Returns also lacks the intricate background stories for NPCs that most RPGs have, but this aspect of team interaction is added in the Dragonfall DLC. Dragonfall also does everything a little bit better, passing of as a relatively good RPG. It takes maybe 15-18 hours to complete Dragonfall if you're a completionist and about 20h for the main game. Since there's lots of combat, which is not that great, the game in my opinion is somwhat lacking in replay value. Though the end game of Dragonfall does play differently depending on few key choices, you're not inclined to mow through the same combat laden missions again.			"

												Graphics - 4/5A fantastic pre-rendered world that looks fantastic almost everywhere. There are some flickering issues in some areas and some of the larger creatures aren't high resolution friendly.Sound - 3/5Nothing incredibly memorable, BUT, it is absolutely perfect for the setting and really sets the mood of this bleak futuristic world.Gameplay - 5/5Best tactical RPG I've ever played. You can make whatever kind of character you want. My character used nothing but his fists and knuckle weapons and he ended up being a badass knocking security bots out with a single punch. The combat itself is awesome, fast paced and controls really well. One thing that I noticed though was I feel like the percentages are a little off for the accuracy ratings, I feel like I've rarely hit anything lower than 60 percent.Story - 4.5/5This is a review of the Dragonfall story. You follow a group of shadowrunners led by your character, and the game really makes you familiar with everyone. All species of sentient beings have their own ways of speaking and there are very little stereotypical characters. Strong female leads, strong male leads, and all around strong side characters. Dead Man's Switch overplayed the in world slang a little bit too much, but Dragonfall made it very easy to get what certain words mean.Overall: 4/5			"

												Incredible Game, Reminds me of a mix between dragon age, and XCOM enemy Unknown. It comes with a great story, right of a shadowrun module, and the game stays very true to the books. My only complaint was the luck system, seemed toward the end of the game, all my shots pretty much missed. even when I had a 97% chance to hit, maybe it was just my luck, but it was very annoying. But other than that, The game was overall very fun and compelling, and what it lacks in customization and level-shadow pop ins, It makes up for in beautiful living environments, and an incredibly intricate story. I beat the game the day after I got it, and bought the Dragonfall the next day, amazing game. 8/10 brb buying cyber gear and an ak47 and shadowrunning my nearest comcast for free internethave fun out there runners!(ps: F*** those Green Ghost Bug Things) Cheers			"

												The game is ok but is simple, short and linear.There are almost no secondary quests, there is not a loot system since only few items are lootable.The skill tree is simple , weapons and armors are limited.The story is simple and the choices you do don't change the reactions and replies(apart few cases) of the npcs.The melee system feels bugged (i missed a LOT of hits that where 99%) and underpowered if compared to the ranged one.The main story is 9 hours long (reading everything and exploring every places).Maybe the workshop will make the difference but the core of the game is poor.I reccomend it but read more about it before buying it since it is not for everyone.

												Shadowrun Returns is a game I find hard to give excessive praise, but it's a game that I also find hard to dislike. When it comes down to it, it's a completely solid game, even if it's shallow. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and feel fully satisfied with the experience, and I didn't have any trouble playing all the way through. There are certainly some notable flaws, however.Let's start with the story, since this game relies heavily on it's writing to motivate the player. The writing and characterization is good, I felt very absorbed in the universe, but the story itself is fairly lacking. It's a shame as well, it starts out great. You got a murder mystery with a lot of interesting faces dying to be talked to, with a few twists and turns here and there. The problem is that it just doesn't developed. It feels extremely rushed. The characters are lovable and relatable to the very end, but I started skipping through dialogue that dealt with the actual plot about 2/3rds through the game. It escalates in a comical direction, with an extremely weak and one-dimensional villian. It's extremely predictable, and just plain boring. The last stretch is so typical and lackluster that I had little to no investment in the actual plight, I just wanted to see if the characters would drop some more interesting backstory about themselves. It gave me closure, but it's not memorable at all. It's just too bad, the beginning was really good, but the plot started going so fast in such a linear direction that it forgot to flesh itself out, leaving some questions unanswered and plot points underdeveloped. It got the job done, but I was hoping for more.Where the game really shines are the characters and their own personal issues. Almost all the staple characters have their own personal motives and vendettas, and I was interested in all their stories. I enjoyed going back to base and talking to every single one of them that were willing to open their mouths. The game does a fantastic job of setting up this belonging feeling, that you're part of this organization of runners. Although, as I stated before, as the game escalates it leaves behind this deep characterization in order to fawn over its own hilariously absurd and out-of-place world-threatening dilemma.The combat is serviceable. It's ultimately shallow and linear, there isn't a lot of variation or depth, and there are some balance issues. But it's still fun, you get to characterize some characters simply by their fighting styles. It's too easy as well, but not game-ruiningly so. It's fun, if you really like X-COM-like turn based combat, you'll probably enjoy it if you can stand it being a tad shallow.The game is overall fun, I would recommend it. It doesn't really have any offending flaws, it just doesn't quite reach the large potential it could've. It's not particularly memorable, but it's enjoyable. I would wait for a sale, but when the price is suitable to you, I'd say to go for it just to get immersed in the world.			"

												A good old school RPG with tactical battle. True (as much as it can) to the univers of Shadowrun (cyperpunk). Sadly the game is very short - which mean not a lot of different skills & weapons, and it don't take full oportunity of the wonder that is the matrix.To really enjoy the game, you're going to have to use the mods and campaigns created by other players - or create them yourself !In short : good game, worth it's price (especially if you play mods), but the main campaign fail to use the game mechanisms to its fullest.

												The game story and mechanics seems rushed however, the graphics were quite nice and a little too ""fluffy"" for this style of game.  The music, not a fan, it still lingers in my head after the game crashes or I die and have to go back to that base to redo many lost hours of gameplay.  I HATE HAVING TO DO THINGS TWICE BECASE OF CHEAP DEATHS!  Cheap deaths are understandable as they make you re-strategize...but it wouldn't of been so bad EXCEPT not being able to save whenever you want was very annyoing.  The game did have tense moments mostly because I was afraid to die because I didn't to have to replay the entire mission.  The game seemed to have a tutorial guided aspect...go here and click this.One thing I did like, irrigardless what I stated above, was the story.  I found it interesting and kept playing to see what was going to come next.  The added dark humor was relavent to its style and I enjoyed it.			"

												The Dragonfall expansion single-handedly did justice to Shadowrun Returns. The Dragonfall campaign build brings a much more involving and intricate storyline, choices, side-missions and memorable NPC companions, resulting in longer gameplay and satisfaction compared to the 12-hour long original. There were certain tweaks to the mechanics of the core game, it seems. For example, there will no longer be extra action points garnered from cybernetics, but this is compensated for via game balancing. There are new portraits to choose from (though still quite limited visual customization) but no changes to the skill trees. Games can be saved at almost every point of the game now, not just at savepoints, so that's another step forward. There are new music scores with this campaign, and they all set the mood satisfactorily for the throughout the gameplay. I still find the beats from the original campaign more to my liking, but that's personal opinion. Some issues inherent in the original was still present in this one. Missing sprites, limitations to allocating picked-up items to teammates outside of combat and the occassional AP bug can still be encountered. However, I would not personally hold this against the expansion as this one is does seem like the developer's turn of churning out an AAA campaign using the same builder tools made available to the community. I grew up playing and loving role-playing games that were akin to reading sci-fi fantasy book sets. After Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Arcanum and Neverwinter Nights, I am relieved to be able to add Shadowrun Returns into my collection of RPG games worth the ages. To enjoy this one, you'll have to read, children, and dig into your storeroom for that old thing called an 'active imagination'. If Shadowrun Returns left you feeling wanting, then Dragonfall will bring you past dessert.			"

												Shadowrun. I picked up the Pen and Paper RPG when I was younger. Sadly it took years before finding a group to play it. Luckly around my University years I found a decent group of people and we are gaming since than. I am an hardcore fan so probably my Review could be a bit biased. Frist of all I strongly suggest to read a bit before gaming. Just the ""Primer"" which is a small guide\introduction to the World of Shadowrun available from the site Shadowrun Universe (official site for all things related to Shadowrun). Once you have the Primer you can have a good idea of what to expect from the Setting. I know that at a frist glance it looks strange maybe even too much but trust me it is awesome. The more you will dig the better it will get, specially if you start to read the various RPG manuals and novels. If you liked the setting buy this game. The basic Campaign included in Shadowrun Returns is a classic. If you never rped or played Shadowrun (I am mostly referring to SNES and GENESIS Games) this is a wonderfull start. The narration is set in 2050s which is a very cool period for Shadowrun (keep in mind that in the current RP Setting the time is around 2075) and it is based on some of the hottest plots of that period. The game is a basic Turn Based Combat with RP elements in the form of dialogues where the various options depends on which skill you have. Back when it was just published the Game lacked few things like save anywhere option. Luckly this was fixed up in the 1st DLC Dragonfall. Dragonfall is even better than the basic game. The Devs listened to us Players and fixed few things and I dare to say even took inspiration from some of UGC - User generated Content (More of this later). Dragonfall can look a bit boring at the start with the logic of ""Do a Run, get back and run again"" (Run is a work, a mission in Shadowrun) but the Narration, the Plot goes always up till its end. In Dragonfall I was not impressed by the first Runs but nearby the end I could not stop to see how this Story was going to end. The only negative side of both Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall is that you can not manage your NPCs. You can select who can help you in a Run but you do not have any kind of control on their Skills and how they improve. Probably this will be fixed in future DLCs. If the basic game and the DLC are not enough there are UGCs. Shadowrun Community is very active and Devs select from time to time some UCG to play just to show up how much it is good. There are a lot of good Artist out there who are working on big UCG like remakes of SNES and Genesis Shadowrun Games. I strongly suggest to take a loot at ""Shadowrun Unlimited"". I hope all of this makes sense. In any case, if you start to play and dig into the Shadows of Shadowrun remember: ""Shoot straight, conserve your ammo and never make a deal with a Dragon"".			"

												Ive been fan of the Shadowrun ever since i first played on the Genesis and Snes and was glad to see a new iteration of it come out. The game still follows all of it rules and has a great look and story that fits the Shadowrun world great.While I still do recommend the game to fans of the Shadowrun world, it does have some really bad bugs / glitches still and wouldnt recommend it unless you love the shadowrun series.Fans of the first two fallout games might find some interest in this title as well since the combat sytem is set up very similar,although a  buggy (almost feels incomplete) version of it.Just an example of a few combat bugs to give people an idea of what thier getting into.A bug for shamans where when you summon a spirit which will cause the combat system to break and not be able to use or select any of characters during youre turn and basicly forcing you to forfeit the rest of your turn which will most likely cause a death of one of your runners.Another bug is where and enemy attacking you will shoot you through walls while you not only cannot shoot because of line sight issue and wont be able to even see the enemy untill you run around the wall.A bug where when you try to heal your drone out of combat it will say immune not heal your drone and use a repair kit.So I would say a good game for the price if your a fan of the series but if not I would probaly skip over this one.

Fans of the game the PnP game will enjoy the encounters of classics characters from the adventures and Shadowland BBS.Even the most recent DLC Dragonfall has some amazing events from the Shadowrun history.  So if you enjoy cyberpunk, fantasy and a well developed world to play around, cast spells and blow people away with shotguns, then this is the game for you.			"

												Shadowrun Returns by itself is an excellent RPG game that blends the science fiction dystopia of William Gibson's cyberpunk genre and a fantasy world that deliciously warps the traditional roles. I never liked elves, but give one a data-jack smart link shotgun and some chrome wolverine claws and suddenly I think they're worth talking about.As someone who never played Shadowrun tabletop or even really had an idea of what it was, this game has launched me into an entire new realm of games. After finishing the first campaign I immediately went and bought a copy of the Shadowrun 5th edition sourcebook.The first DLC; Dragonfall, is even better than the original campaign both as a new story and a starting point for new players. The writers have only gotten better and they really immerse you in the details of an anarchist Berlin, plagued by crime and the ever present corporate political encroachment. Definitely recommend this game whole heartedly to both Shadowrun veterans and new players alike. Play. This. Game.			"

												This game is quite the nostalgia trip. They really nailed the look and feel of gritty ol' Seattle of 2054, and the music is just stellar. It's an old view of the future, played in the old ways of RPGs. That means lots of turn-based combat and lots of reading. LOTS of reading. The story is nothing stellar -- what Shadowrun fiction ever is -- but it's a fun return to familiar territory. I haven't dug into the user-generated stuff, but the main campaign is easily worth the asking price if you have any love of cyberpunk.That said, if you buy this, then I highly recommend picking up the Dragonfall expansion as well. It's storyline is much, much better.			"

												Gameplay is topnotch Tactical RPG stuff. Its fun to make your character however you'd like them, and the skills are laid out in a straightforward way. Spell variety leaves a little bit left to be desired, and I personally wouldve liked greater variety for implants, but is all in all very solid. Storyline for the default game, called ""The Deadman's Switch"" is boring and linear, and you dont spend a long enough amount of downtime to talk to and connect with your party members. Also playing a decker is a waste of time as theres very few times you actually get to enter the Matrix. Hold your hand too much and feels shallow because of itThe DLC, Dragonfall, fixes the above problems. It starts a bit linear just like before, but theres multiple ways to clear any area, as well as plenty of time between missions to talk with your fellow Shadowrunners. The plot is much more interesting and there are more ways to use your character's skills, both in the field, and in dialogue choices. The game opens up and you get to start taking missions of your own accord, with each having a small storyline within its own mission.Theres also a metric crapton of great workshop content out for the game, which I think will add tremendously to the games longevity.Bottomline, buy this game, and buy it with the DLC.

												The core campaign here, Dead Man's Switch, is awful.  It serves as an introduction to the mechanics and, to a much lesser extent, the setting of Shadowrun.  The DLC/expansion Dragonfall, however, is absolutely fantastic, and is completely unrelated to the core campaign.  It's one of the better written RPGs I've ever played.  The characters are great, the story is interesting, the decisions are difficult, and although the ""epilogue"" is a little weak, the overall ending was solid.  I heartily recommend Dragonfall to any RPG enthusiast and especially to anyone who has ever been curious to explore the Shadowrun setting.			"

												Funded this game back when the kickstarter campaign was around. Spent $10, and would gladly spend $20+ on it. Granted, I am a long-time shadowrun fan, but it's a great game for rpg fans.While the graphics may not be the greatest, and the original story was pretty good at best (the Dragonfall DLC definitely makes up for it, it's another game in itself), what really makes up for it is all the user generated content that is coming out. A reboot of the snes title was the first project I saw pop up, and have been following since.Shadowrun Unlimited, is more of a non-linear style of game. I'm only a couple of hours into it, but there is so much more to it than the original game (more cyberware, more programs to be used in cyberspace, etc.), and it has much more replayability (random missions) than the original game.That's just a couple of mods that I've been keeping an eye on, and there's plenty more where those came from.If you like turn-based strategy, with both mystical (magic, dwarves, elves, etc.) and futuristic elements, it's most definitely worth picking up.

												Ok so i had never heard of shadowrun, not the Table game, books or the Vid-games, but got intrested when i saw the game show up on the store slider page and reading the description about the sci fi, cyberpunk, fantasy mix and seeing i had the funds sitting in the wallet thought i might aswell give it a go. I loved the setting & story the diffrent ways you can play depending on the characters and abilitys you choose to specilise with to get through the game, the first story 'deadman's swtich' was enjoyable but on replay i did notice what other people mentioned how there wasent much exploreing or side quests branching from the main plot as it throws you down the main story but all the same was enjoyable. the second story thats out however was a massive imrpovement 'Dragonfall' you're responcible for a whole area of people each character has their individual storys, there's many sidequests that branch off the main plot, and the choices you make can effect various details through the later game.In short i thought this game was great! and has replay value though mainly with the 'dragonfall' campaign, the graphics aint the most amazeing thing but i couldent care less!, i preffer games that are enjoyable, have good story & content. I strongly recomend this game to any rpg fans & anyone who enjoys good storylines in sci fi settings. :)			"

												I have enjoyed the Shadowrun universe for a couple decades and feel this really hits the mark for creating that world.While I completely enjoyed Dead Man Switch playing Dragonfall only highlighted the flaws I saw in DMS. Everything I was ambivalent about with DMS was rectified and improved.If you were on the fence after playing DMS then rest assured, Dragonfall is awesome and blows DMS out of the water. This is more than just game mechanics and tweaks. The story telling is better, conversation options are vastly improved, missions are more varied, NPCs are more than just mission givers and your squad mates have personality and history to uncover as you get closer to them.In short I love this game and can't wait for future releases.

												First, an explaination: When you buy SHADOWRUN RETURNS, you get one campaign - ""Deadman's Trigger."" It's a solid introduction to the gameplay and story world. There's one additional campaign for sale from the studio - ""Dragonfall,"" which also adds some new items and gameplay functionality. Additionally, the game comes with a campaign editor, allowing you to create your own or download campaigns from others on Steam Workshop.In terms of gameplay, SR is basically a glorified point-and-click adventure, with XCOM-style turn-based combat added in. The combat is just solid enough to feel worthwhile, but otherwise this is the kind of game that lives or dies on the quality of the writing. Thankfully, both campaigns present some of the best character development and story writing I've seen in a videogame. Is it high-literature? No, but it's incredibly solid pulp-fiction and well worth the price of admission.			"

												This game is absolutely awesome. It takes the rpg elements of the original Fallout 1 and 2 and mixes it with some of the combat mechanics of XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within. The characters and world are wonderful, giving you that silver lining to a dystopian society. I picked this game up and logged 5 hours nonstop after starting.If you like story driven RPGs or turn-based tactics games, get this game.Edit: I don't mean to sound like I'm advertising it, this mod completes the game. Subscribe to the Shadowrun Unlimited mod in the Steam Workshop for an open world, borderline endless (so far as I can tell) adventure. You pick the contracts, explore an open city as you please, and work your way up the chain (unlock higher tier missions = more money = better apartment & equipment vendors). With this mod, I may never stop playing this game.			"

												People who can't read shouldn't play this game.But then you wouldn't be able to read this review...So go for it!Seriously though, in other reviews you may read that the few negatives of this game are that it's very linear and that there are only checkpoint saves.Yes, it is very linear, but if you enjoy a good story you should definitely play it. And the reviews talking about the bad saves aren't very up to date. You can now save manually wherever you are within a mission, quit and return to it later.So unless you're very petty and need some life changing decisions to make a game playable there is no reason you shouldn't play this game. Unless you're poor and can't afford it... That's a fairly good reason...			"

												SRR is one of the best RPGs of the generation; between this and the upcoming Wasteland 2, I'm overjoyed to see a resurgence in isometric, turn based RPGS. Everything Harebrained Schemes writes for this game is fantastic. Despite the frustrating brevity of Dead Man's Switch, the writing for it is exceptional. That said, you'll not be getting the real SRR experience unless you buy Dragonfall, which is head and shoulders above the game's first campaign. Lengthy, well written, and challenging, Dragonfall is every bit the excellent RPG adventure I've been missing since the days of Fallout and Fallout 2. If you like old school, you'll love this game. Additionally, SRR has the hands down best lore I've ever seen in a videogame--much, much more so than anything Bioware has released. A low pricetag and a robust User Generated Content scene make Shadowrun Returns the sort of purchase that should be made without any reservations. Just make sure you like reading!			"

												I didn't play the original Shadowrun back in the early nineties, so the game gets no retro love in this review. Shadowrun returns is a average cyberpunk and magic theme RPG. The main defect in the game is the vacuity of the gameworld comprised of the different interconnected areas. The game basically gives you only plot items to interact and the city locations are small. True to the ""pocket world"" RPG approach the plot is your average RPG pipeline stuff. Shadowrun Returns also lacks the intricate background stories for NPCs that most RPGs have, but this aspect of team interaction is added in the Dragonfall DLC. Dragonfall also does everything a little bit better, passing of as a relatively good RPG. It takes maybe 15-18 hours to complete Dragonfall if you're a completionist and about 20h for the main game. Since there's lots of combat, which is not that great, the game in my opinion is somwhat lacking in replay value. Though the end game of Dragonfall does play differently depending on few key choices, you're not inclined to mow through the same combat laden missions again.			"

Posted: March 7, 2014
												Way back in 1989, FASA Corporation, publisher of role-playing games, wargames and board games, released the first version of Shadowrun[en.wikipedia.org], a science fantasy tabletop role-playing game. It was cross-genre, taking elements from both cyberpunk and urban fantasy and putting the player in a world where humans co-exist with elves, dwarfs, trolls and other exotic races, where magic and cyberware are common and the Matrix is accessed by deckers, jacking into the network with cyberdecks connected directly to their brains.I was introduced to Shadowrun while attending middle school by some older friends of mine with long hair and/or glasses who were heavily into tabletop role-playing games. Over the years we tried many different games, like Vampire The Masquerade[en.wikipedia.org] and the GURPS[en.wikipedia.org] system, but Shadowrun was always the one we returned to and the game that gathered most players. Shadowrun has continued to thrive since its release as one of the most popular tabletop role-playing games and in July 2013, Shadowrun Fifth Edition was released.The Shadowrun universe has spawned a massive amount of properties, including action figure games, two magazines, over 50 novels and four more or less successful video games. The latest video game installment, Kickstarter-backed Shadowrun Returns[harebrained-schemes.com], was just recently released and this is my quick and dirty review.I have to admit that I don't remember all the details of the Shadowrun rules, it's been over 15 years since I last sat down to play, but from what I can tell, Shadowrun Returns is true to the core rulebook. The game takes its rules from the second and third edition of the rulebook and everything from character creation to the available items feel familiar. All races and classes, from Street Samurai to Shaman are there, all the different types of magic are available, deckers can enter the Matrix, and riggers can control drones. The only thing I haven't seen is the astral space, so I'm not sure if it's in the game, but players familiar with the Shadowrun universe will immediately feel at home nonetheless.Shadowrun Returns features isometric graphics, and you move your character around and interact with people and objects in real time. But as soon as the drek hits the fan and the weapons come out, the game switches to a turn-based model. Your team can consist of up to four characters, including yourself, and they all have a number of move points determined by each character's attributes. The combat, both in the real world and in the Matrix, is fairly simple, but in my opinion just as complex as it needs to be.The game comes bundled with one campaign set in Seattle, and a single campaign might not seem like much, but it will keep you entertained for 8 to 10 hours. There's also a Berlin campaign in development by the gamer's creators, Harebrained Schemes, but it's not scheduled for release until October. The campaign will be free for Kickstarter backers, but the rest of us have to get it as a paid DLC. That said, Shadowrun Returns comes with a level editor with virtually endless potential. And the game editor is the real strength of Shadowrun Returns: It's a framework that enables game masters to create their own campaigns and share them with the community.One of the great things about the tabletop version of Shadowrun was that it was very social, but if you were hoping for the same experience with Shadowrun Returns you will be disappointed. The game only supports singleplayer at the moment, but multiplayer might be implemented in the future. Multiplayer would be a sweet treat, but I'm not sure how it would be solved in practice. Who is the main character on a multiplayer run? Who will control the NPC team members? Thankfully, I'm not a game designer, so I'll leave these challenges for Harebrained Schemes to solve themselves.Since the game is just released, there are a few bugs here and there, but nothing major. Harebrained Schemes is also working closely with the players to find and remove bugs from the game and very recently released the first game patch. It contains both balancing changes and bug fixes the game needed. If there's one major issue I'd like to point out, it's the design decision to only save the game when the player moves from one area to another as opposed to letting the players save when real life needs their attention. It can be pretty damn tedious to replay parts of the game because you had to abort a run.Despite these few shortcomings Shadowrun Returns is a great game. If you ever played the tabletop version and enjoyed it, you owe it to yourself to buy and play Shadowrun Returns. The base campaign that comes bundled with the game is perhaps a bit linear, but complex and intriguing enough to keep you entertained from start to end. There is also massive potential in the game editor. I'm very excited to see what kind of campaigns the community will create and share.Maybe even my old game master will sit down and re-create his epic campaign from back in the days? That would be downright wiz.This review is also available on https://www.vegard.net/ "

												A fine game, however...There are many differences between a video game RPG and a tabletop RPG run by a GM. A video game RPG we expect certain conventions: random battles to raise XP, walking around a fixed location until we're ready to proceed with the story, and freedom to explore the entire world to a certain point.In a tabletop RPG, it's almost the opposite: random battles are tedious and most battles are relevant to the plot in some way, you're expected to keep to a timetable to follow the plot, and you probably won't revisit areas you've already visited except for a 'safe house' or two.What we have here is a video game RPG that acts like, plays like, and runs like a tabletop RPG! There are no random battles, and world exploration is very limited. Side quests are (generally) done immediately when you get them or not at all. There are no obvious good/bad dialogue choices that alter an unseen scale that judges your 'morality'. What we instead have is a very intriguing, atmosphere-driven game with a tightly-focused plot and tactical combat which feels very tabletop-ish.I enjoy Shadowrun, but I've also played the tabletop RPG and enjoy the setting. A person who buys this expecting something like a Bioware rpg or Skyrim is going to be very disappointed. But if you're willing to give it a chance, the atmosphere and writing will immerse you easily.And there's a game editor. So you can probably make your own game, if you think you could do better.			"

												Ah Shadowrun, I'll start off by saying this: If you're into the Shadowrun universe and games like UFO: XCOM, then chances are that you'll really like Shadowrun returns.That said, I do have some issues with the game. First and foremost, the music gets grading and tiresome fast. I've played the game for 9 hours and I had to turn the music off, they were clearly aiming for a dark electronic ambience and they do achieve it, but there are simply not enough tunes and a few of them simply sound too much alike.A second point that I feel must be made, is the fact that the game has cut a lot of corners when making the jump from pen & paper to video game. Shadowrun has always aimed for high realism, but this requires a lot of rules and a lot of depth. I understand that they had to cut a lot of these rules because otherwise nobody would've been able to play the game without 2 hours of tutorial, if not more.Third point, there are some issues when trying to select certain points to move to in the grid, so I suggest activating the double-click feature, which ends the miss clicks.Fourth point, the save system blows balls. The game will auto-save whenever you enter a new scene, but you are unable to manually save, this means that if you fail, you have to start all over from the very beginning of the scene, this can be especially tiresome if the encounter is 30 minutes long or you just leveled up before you died.Fifth point is mostly mechanical, but I still feel  it should be mentioned. There's an issue with scripted events that can ♥♥♥♥ you over; I'll try to explain it: When you move a character through a door and towards cover, the character will stop because and a little dialogue will play. Afterwards your character will be stuck where the dialogue started and if you're out of actions for said character, this can lead to them recieving a lead sandwich. Couple this with the fact that you're unnable to resurrect your main character if his HP hits zero and you can get rather frustrated. This wouldn't be half bad, but when you can resurrect side characters after they hit zero HP it just seems rather silly.And finally always remember:Watch your back. Shoot straight. Conserve ammo. And never, ever, cut a deal with a dragon.			"

Also with the user generated content from Backers of the Kickstater it has lots of replayability and hopefully more things will be added in the future.			"

												After much debate, well, not really, but I did wait a decent amount of time to play this title:  Shadow Run – Returns (http://store.steampowered.com/app/234650/), I gave it shot.  It’s about 15 hours’ worth of content and there doesn’t appear to be much in the way of quality DLC atm.   From a cost perspective, a dollar per hour of game play with a great story is money well spent.  It has a Fall Out 1 feel as it is turn-based, there are walls of text to read, and you can be a troll hacker that is more charismatic than an ancient vampire, with a data jack in his head.  In short, if you want a game that doesn’t demand too much of your PC or your time, and gives you a decent story to fall in love with, this game is for you.			"

												People who can't read shouldn't play this game.But then you wouldn't be able to read this review...So go for it!Seriously though, in other reviews you may read that the few negatives of this game are that it's very linear and that there are only checkpoint saves.Yes, it is very linear, but if you enjoy a good story you should definitely play it. And the reviews talking about the bad saves aren't very up to date. You can now save manually wherever you are within a mission, quit and return to it later.So unless you're very petty and need some life changing decisions to make a game playable there is no reason you shouldn't play this game. Unless you're poor and can't afford it... That's a fairly good reason...			"

												SRR is one of the best RPGs of the generation; between this and the upcoming Wasteland 2, I'm overjoyed to see a resurgence in isometric, turn based RPGS. Everything Harebrained Schemes writes for this game is fantastic. Despite the frustrating brevity of Dead Man's Switch, the writing for it is exceptional. That said, you'll not be getting the real SRR experience unless you buy Dragonfall, which is head and shoulders above the game's first campaign. Lengthy, well written, and challenging, Dragonfall is every bit the excellent RPG adventure I've been missing since the days of Fallout and Fallout 2. If you like old school, you'll love this game. Additionally, SRR has the hands down best lore I've ever seen in a videogame--much, much more so than anything Bioware has released. A low pricetag and a robust User Generated Content scene make Shadowrun Returns the sort of purchase that should be made without any reservations. Just make sure you like reading!			"

												Way back in 1989, FASA Corporation, publisher of role-playing games, wargames and board games, released the first version of Shadowrun[en.wikipedia.org], a science fantasy tabletop role-playing game. It was cross-genre, taking elements from both cyberpunk and urban fantasy and putting the player in a world where humans co-exist with elves, dwarfs, trolls and other exotic races, where magic and cyberware are common and the Matrix is accessed by deckers, jacking into the network with cyberdecks connected directly to their brains.I was introduced to Shadowrun while attending middle school by some older friends of mine with long hair and/or glasses who were heavily into tabletop role-playing games. Over the years we tried many different games, like Vampire The Masquerade[en.wikipedia.org] and the GURPS[en.wikipedia.org] system, but Shadowrun was always the one we returned to and the game that gathered most players. Shadowrun has continued to thrive since its release as one of the most popular tabletop role-playing games and in July 2013, Shadowrun Fifth Edition was released.The Shadowrun universe has spawned a massive amount of properties, including action figure games, two magazines, over 50 novels and four more or less successful video games. The latest video game installment, Kickstarter-backed Shadowrun Returns[harebrained-schemes.com], was just recently released and this is my quick and dirty review.I have to admit that I don't remember all the details of the Shadowrun rules, it's been over 15 years since I last sat down to play, but from what I can tell, Shadowrun Returns is true to the core rulebook. The game takes its rules from the second and third edition of the rulebook and everything from character creation to the available items feel familiar. All races and classes, from Street Samurai to Shaman are there, all the different types of magic are available, deckers can enter the Matrix, and riggers can control drones. The only thing I haven't seen is the astral space, so I'm not sure if it's in the game, but players familiar with the Shadowrun universe will immediately feel at home nonetheless.Shadowrun Returns features isometric graphics, and you move your character around and interact with people and objects in real time. But as soon as the drek hits the fan and the weapons come out, the game switches to a turn-based model. Your team can consist of up to four characters, including yourself, and they all have a number of move points determined by each character's attributes. The combat, both in the real world and in the Matrix, is fairly simple, but in my opinion just as complex as it needs to be.The game comes bundled with one campaign set in Seattle, and a single campaign might not seem like much, but it will keep you entertained for 8 to 10 hours. There's also a Berlin campaign in development by the gamer's creators, Harebrained Schemes, but it's not scheduled for release until October. The campaign will be free for Kickstarter backers, but the rest of us have to get it as a paid DLC. That said, Shadowrun Returns comes with a level editor with virtually endless potential. And the game editor is the real strength of Shadowrun Returns: It's a framework that enables game masters to create their own campaigns and share them with the community.One of the great things about the tabletop version of Shadowrun was that it was very social, but if you were hoping for the same experience with Shadowrun Returns you will be disappointed. The game only supports singleplayer at the moment, but multiplayer might be implemented in the future. Multiplayer would be a sweet treat, but I'm not sure how it would be solved in practice. Who is the main character on a multiplayer run? Who will control the NPC team members? Thankfully, I'm not a game designer, so I'll leave these challenges for Harebrained Schemes to solve themselves.Since the game is just released, there are a few bugs here and there, but nothing major. Harebrained Schemes is also working closely with the players to find and remove bugs from the game and very recently released the first game patch. It contains both balancing changes and bug fixes the game needed. If there's one major issue I'd like to point out, it's the design decision to only save the game when the player moves from one area to another as opposed to letting the players save when real life needs their attention. It can be pretty damn tedious to replay parts of the game because you had to abort a run.Despite these few shortcomings Shadowrun Returns is a great game. If you ever played the tabletop version and enjoyed it, you owe it to yourself to buy and play Shadowrun Returns. The base campaign that comes bundled with the game is perhaps a bit linear, but complex and intriguing enough to keep you entertained from start to end. There is also massive potential in the game editor. I'm very excited to see what kind of campaigns the community will create and share.Maybe even my old game master will sit down and re-create his epic campaign from back in the days? That would be downright wiz.This review is also available on https://www.vegard.net/ "

												I didn't play the original Shadowrun back in the early nineties, so the game gets no retro love in this review. Shadowrun returns is a average cyberpunk and magic theme RPG. The main defect in the game is the vacuity of the gameworld comprised of the different interconnected areas. The game basically gives you only plot items to interact and the city locations are small. True to the ""pocket world"" RPG approach the plot is your average RPG pipeline stuff. Shadowrun Returns also lacks the intricate background stories for NPCs that most RPGs have, but this aspect of team interaction is added in the Dragonfall DLC. Dragonfall also does everything a little bit better, passing of as a relatively good RPG. It takes maybe 15-18 hours to complete Dragonfall if you're a completionist and about 20h for the main game. Since there's lots of combat, which is not that great, the game in my opinion is somwhat lacking in replay value. Though the end game of Dragonfall does play differently depending on few key choices, you're not inclined to mow through the same combat laden missions again.			"

												Once I sorted out the crashing issues, (Thanks to this website http://shadowrun-returns.wikispaces.com/Troubleshooting+FAQ, I did the ""Audio Problems"" fix, and run the game in 1024x768) the game works fine. I will admit I never played any of the older versions, but Shadowrun Online has been on my wish list for a while and when I seen Shadowrun Returns for under $5 (I love you Steam Summer Sale), I snapped it up quick. After playing for only 15 mins, I was sad I never played the older versions, and I was doubly sad I never even heard about the Shadowrun series until this year.As for this iteration of the Shadowrun series, I was blown away, when one of the NPC's feels an urgency to get a mission done, that sense of urgency if felt by the player too. I'm looking your way Paco.The sound effects are really well put together, there is something satisfying about beaning a thug over the head with a baseball bat and that bone on wood sound chimes in......... (Makes note to get more baseball bats in game.)The dreary, miserable, wet, outside world is not only a joy (in the sense it feels real) to walk around in, it is also a joy to explore and talk to the locals and see how downtrodden they are as well.The loading screen DM style scene setting briefs even make the game feel like you could almost be playing the tabletop version with a friend over the weekend.Game play 10/10Graphics 10/10Music 10/10SFX 10/10Atmosphere 15/10All in All 10/10 will spend WAY to many hours playing.

												The base game is decent; the DLC is very good. Base game introduces you to all the game mechanics and is a good if not particularly deep game. The DLC on the other hand has a great plot that lends credibilty to the various runs your crew goes on, some great twists and turns, er, and also has some battles that are (potentially) cruelly unfair, awful, and frustrating.I just had trouble with the one battle, but I read that others had trouble with one or two others. I expect that it depends on play style and the party you bring. The battles often have some sort of interesting twist or surprise that makes them really interesting, but depending on your party and playstyle the same twist can make it very frustrating instead. Maybe the occasional rage quit is the price you pay for the cool surprises. :)In summary:  a) strongly recommended, worth buying just to play the DLC, and b) AUGH. AUGH AUGH AUGH. AUGH MMMWAAAH! AUGH! DIE! DIE! DIE! KILL! WHY AM I DOING THIS TO MYSELF? ISN'T THIS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN??? OK calm down, let's try it again.Four stars. A generally great game and totally worth your money. Expect 1 (and possibly 2  or 3 depending on what party you bring) really unfair battles in the DLC. :)  No, really, it's a little frustrating, but you care because it's good. Just buy it.			"

Of course your actions don't really change the storyline, but I allway liked interactive books, and thats it.The whole game is a little bit of anachronistic I think, but it does not loose by that. In my humble opinion this is even better, because this way they told two beautiful stories and created a game that does give Shadowrun the tactical feeling I allways felt wenn playing on the table.So I hope there will be som AI-fixes for the higher difficulties.

												The Dragonfall expansion single-handedly did justice to Shadowrun Returns. The Dragonfall campaign build brings a much more involving and intricate storyline, choices, side-missions and memorable NPC companions, resulting in longer gameplay and satisfaction compared to the 12-hour long original. There were certain tweaks to the mechanics of the core game, it seems. For example, there will no longer be extra action points garnered from cybernetics, but this is compensated for via game balancing. There are new portraits to choose from (though still quite limited visual customization) but no changes to the skill trees. Games can be saved at almost every point of the game now, not just at savepoints, so that's another step forward. There are new music scores with this campaign, and they all set the mood satisfactorily for the throughout the gameplay. I still find the beats from the original campaign more to my liking, but that's personal opinion. Some issues inherent in the original was still present in this one. Missing sprites, limitations to allocating picked-up items to teammates outside of combat and the occassional AP bug can still be encountered. However, I would not personally hold this against the expansion as this one is does seem like the developer's turn of churning out an AAA campaign using the same builder tools made available to the community. I grew up playing and loving role-playing games that were akin to reading sci-fi fantasy book sets. After Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Arcanum and Neverwinter Nights, I am relieved to be able to add Shadowrun Returns into my collection of RPG games worth the ages. To enjoy this one, you'll have to read, children, and dig into your storeroom for that old thing called an 'active imagination'. If Shadowrun Returns left you feeling wanting, then Dragonfall will bring you past dessert.			"

The campaign will take a few days to beat if you read everything the way i did, also if thats not enough people are always making their own campaigns if your still itching for more they just released a 12+ hour campaign in a whole new city. If you love turn based strategy rpgs for 15$ you really should give this a buy. Dragonfall it's expansion/sequel is a whole new campaign for the same price.			"

												I am a huge rpg-geek, and for me story and the connection to ones character is one of the most important keys to a good game. I usually also is a so called graphic ♥♥♥♥♥, I have issues playing games if the graphics don't blow me away. This made me hesitant to buy Shadowrun Retuns, since I've had issues playing the early FallOut games (and they are great in all other aspects I love in a game). But I gave Shadowrun Returns a chance, and boy am I glad I did! It is a great old rpg with amazing atmosphere and the right amount of twist, reveals and epic to pull the player in. The graphics didn't bother me at all, the combat isn't to annyoing nor taking away from the story and it runs smooth. I reccomend it it to anybody wanting to play a nice cyberpunk rpg!			"

												If you're a fan of noir-style stories with twists and turns, tactical turn-based combat, or a fan of the Shadowrun tabletop RPG, this is probably a solid game for you. Played through ""Dead Man's Switch"" in about 10 hours. Good balance of exploration, dialogue, and combat. There were some things missing, though; the act of hiring teammates was cool, but you never interacted with them, which kind of sucked (some parts in the game led me to believe that it was originally there, but was cut). I also felt like my dialogue choices meant nothing to the outcome of the game, which pretty much goes against how tabletop RPGs work. Also, I think the Dragonfall DLC should be free, but I suppose I'm against paid DLC in general. Should you pay full price for this game? Yeah, I guess so. I'd give it a solid 8/10.			"

												Shadowrun for me is filled with fond memories of tabletop gaming, and lazy weekends with people too clever by half for their own good. Thankfullly, that core is there, and the story they bundle with it is solid. The problem however, lies with the overall brevity of the content given. There are remarkable storytellers out there who have written, and continue to write stories in the setting, [Do browse the UGC for the game!] but the package as a whole for the average gamer may be a little underwhelming. Mechanically, the pieces are functional, and the experience in terms of actual gameplay is solid enough, but the pace of action and the lack of diversity in its approach may not seem the divine ambrosia to all. X-Com would be a fair parallel to make for the way the gameplay unfolds in action sequences. Character development allows for specilization, and divesification both, but can feel stiflingly slow compared to the glut of typical loot-and-shoot games. For players who like the idea of being able to poke a few buttons thoughtlessly, toss another point into ""strength"" and move on to the next fight, the system may prove unsatisfying. For players who constantly look at old saves and think ""What if I tried it with _____ build?"" the depth of variety allowed is a welcome change of pace.Graphically, there is a sense of ""days gone by"", I personally found myself filled with nostalgia for the classics. The atmosphere is there, in all its dirty, decayed charm, and the experience as a whole is such that no single part of the presentation is a jarring disconnect from the rest. At its core, it holds true to the experiences I remember as a tabletop gamer. I enjoyed and continue to enjoy it and do not regret the purchase.			"

												The first campaign, Dead Man's Switch, is pretty linear and predictable, but it serves as a basic introduction to the Shadowrun universe, with a lot of famous characters and locations.Dragonfall is a much, much better campaign, with a little bit of non-linearity and choices of outcomes.It's a very fun tactical turn based shooter, with a pretty reasonable point-based character generation system.The only downside is that matrix combat is boring and repetitive, and takes up a huge chunk of a lot of runs.

												A fine game, however...There are many differences between a video game RPG and a tabletop RPG run by a GM. A video game RPG we expect certain conventions: random battles to raise XP, walking around a fixed location until we're ready to proceed with the story, and freedom to explore the entire world to a certain point.In a tabletop RPG, it's almost the opposite: random battles are tedious and most battles are relevant to the plot in some way, you're expected to keep to a timetable to follow the plot, and you probably won't revisit areas you've already visited except for a 'safe house' or two.What we have here is a video game RPG that acts like, plays like, and runs like a tabletop RPG! There are no random battles, and world exploration is very limited. Side quests are (generally) done immediately when you get them or not at all. There are no obvious good/bad dialogue choices that alter an unseen scale that judges your 'morality'. What we instead have is a very intriguing, atmosphere-driven game with a tightly-focused plot and tactical combat which feels very tabletop-ish.I enjoy Shadowrun, but I've also played the tabletop RPG and enjoy the setting. A person who buys this expecting something like a Bioware rpg or Skyrim is going to be very disappointed. But if you're willing to give it a chance, the atmosphere and writing will immerse you easily.And there's a game editor. So you can probably make your own game, if you think you could do better.			"

												Ah Shadowrun, I'll start off by saying this: If you're into the Shadowrun universe and games like UFO: XCOM, then chances are that you'll really like Shadowrun returns.That said, I do have some issues with the game. First and foremost, the music gets grading and tiresome fast. I've played the game for 9 hours and I had to turn the music off, they were clearly aiming for a dark electronic ambience and they do achieve it, but there are simply not enough tunes and a few of them simply sound too much alike.A second point that I feel must be made, is the fact that the game has cut a lot of corners when making the jump from pen & paper to video game. Shadowrun has always aimed for high realism, but this requires a lot of rules and a lot of depth. I understand that they had to cut a lot of these rules because otherwise nobody would've been able to play the game without 2 hours of tutorial, if not more.Third point, there are some issues when trying to select certain points to move to in the grid, so I suggest activating the double-click feature, which ends the miss clicks.Fourth point, the save system blows balls. The game will auto-save whenever you enter a new scene, but you are unable to manually save, this means that if you fail, you have to start all over from the very beginning of the scene, this can be especially tiresome if the encounter is 30 minutes long or you just leveled up before you died.Fifth point is mostly mechanical, but I still feel  it should be mentioned. There's an issue with scripted events that can ♥♥♥♥ you over; I'll try to explain it: When you move a character through a door and towards cover, the character will stop because and a little dialogue will play. Afterwards your character will be stuck where the dialogue started and if you're out of actions for said character, this can lead to them recieving a lead sandwich. Couple this with the fact that you're unnable to resurrect your main character if his HP hits zero and you can get rather frustrated. This wouldn't be half bad, but when you can resurrect side characters after they hit zero HP it just seems rather silly.And finally always remember:Watch your back. Shoot straight. Conserve ammo. And never, ever, cut a deal with a dragon.			"

The guns for this turn based rpg do so make a satisfying boom, at least for me. I was also really pleased that I could customize my character the way I wanted.

												First, an explaination: When you buy SHADOWRUN RETURNS, you get one campaign - ""Deadman's Trigger."" It's a solid introduction to the gameplay and story world. There's one additional campaign for sale from the studio - ""Dragonfall,"" which also adds some new items and gameplay functionality. Additionally, the game comes with a campaign editor, allowing you to create your own or download campaigns from others on Steam Workshop.In terms of gameplay, SR is basically a glorified point-and-click adventure, with XCOM-style turn-based combat added in. The combat is just solid enough to feel worthwhile, but otherwise this is the kind of game that lives or dies on the quality of the writing. Thankfully, both campaigns present some of the best character development and story writing I've seen in a videogame. Is it high-literature? No, but it's incredibly solid pulp-fiction and well worth the price of admission.			"

												Cyberpunk is a genre as much built on the atmosphere as it is on the technology. Everyone has that formative memory of the giant advertisements and smog-belching smokestacks in Blade Runner, Some games make the mistake of keeping the slums out of the cyberpunk, but Shadowrun Returns has the formula down just right: ""high tech, low life."" The game is a fun return to an earlier era for me, given my experience with the tabletop game - but the experience is fluid and accurate, reminding me of so many times spent around a table being suspicious about your Fixer or the latest contact you made.The gameplay can be somewhat halting and awkward at times - a concession to make in order to accommodate the system itself, of course - but it doesn't diminish the enjoyment of this authentic cyberpunk game. Combat is strategic, if somewhat sparse on detail, and emphasises the differences in roles within the party itself. The decking is sadly quite anaemic compared to the tabletop world, a blue-gridlines re-creation of the combat systems, with Agents standing in for Spirits, and spells replaced with Decker attacks. Nonetheless, it rounds out the flavour of the game well.If you're looking for an engaging Cyberpunk story, with a dash of magic and plenty of political intrigue and conspiracy, I highly recommend Shadowrun Returns.

Even with 6 character archetypes to choose from, there is still an immense amount of customization that allows you to find your own playstyle.

												The classic 80s-90s vision of the cyberpunk future of the Shadowrun world is done serious justice by this game.  The art style and game mechanics and story all do a great job of pulling you into it even though there is no voice acting (prepare for a lot of reading).The turn based combat is slow paced but satisfying.  The character skill and equipment system is pretty robust.  So, there's definately room for replay variety but it would probably be boring to play through more than a couple times.  If you're a veteran of turn based combat games, I would suggest playing on a high difficulty.  I played the default normal setting and for the most part, combat was way too easy.All in all a pretty lesurely game and a bit nostalgic.  Keeping in mind how SR is setup more as a gaming platfom with systems in place for users to create their own stories and content, the lack of niceties like voice acting, variety of music and so on is forgivable.  This was definately worth the $4.99 I paid for it on Steam sale.			"

												The core campaign here, Dead Man's Switch, is awful.  It serves as an introduction to the mechanics and, to a much lesser extent, the setting of Shadowrun.  The DLC/expansion Dragonfall, however, is absolutely fantastic, and is completely unrelated to the core campaign.  It's one of the better written RPGs I've ever played.  The characters are great, the story is interesting, the decisions are difficult, and although the ""epilogue"" is a little weak, the overall ending was solid.  I heartily recommend Dragonfall to any RPG enthusiast and especially to anyone who has ever been curious to explore the Shadowrun setting.			"

												Overall great game! The fighting style is pretty close to that of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, which is a win. The game requires a lot of reading to really get through the story and the decisions you make don't really seem to affect the outcomes any, which leads to a bit of a linear game. It is a great story and fun combat all around.			"

												I like the fact that this is very old school type of game play feel and stays inline with the way shadowrun is meant to be played. very cool game and well done. just wish you could search areas more and it was a little more open world kinda. instead of feeling like you have to follow set paths.  still very fun to play.

												Best way to describe it would be a mix between a traditional fallout game, and a Dungeons and Dragons title. It's a party based strategy game set in a cyperpunk future where magic has been introduced to the world. The original campaign is well enough, however Dragonfall (DLC) is where the game really shines.			"

												The Dead Man's Switch(DMS) campaign is forgettable and is only notable for having an annoying enemy that can only be killed with a cumbersome mechanic. There are a handful of interesting interactions during DMS but overall its honestly not worth playing through and can be easily skipped.Dragonfall(DF), on the other hand, is awesome and is filled with characters and scenarios that are as imaginative, well written,  and worth exploring as some of the best RPGs that I have ever played. DF additionally contains a much better structure than DMS, by that I mean rather than having a linear quest with hardly any side branches that you undertake with some flavorless NPCs, DF tasks you with a central goal and allows you to lead a team of fairly unique characters along a questline that has scores of opportunity to explore more of the world of Shadowrun. I enjoyed the vast majority of my time with DF, save for the hacking bits (called decking in this universe), and some later game fights with some annoyingly powerful enemies. Altough, I wholeheartedly recommend DF, Its a shame that you have to buy both to play DF but since thats the case I would advise that you buy the campaigns at a reduced cost and skip DMS.			"

												A fine game, however...There are many differences between a video game RPG and a tabletop RPG run by a GM. A video game RPG we expect certain conventions: random battles to raise XP, walking around a fixed location until we're ready to proceed with the story, and freedom to explore the entire world to a certain point.In a tabletop RPG, it's almost the opposite: random battles are tedious and most battles are relevant to the plot in some way, you're expected to keep to a timetable to follow the plot, and you probably won't revisit areas you've already visited except for a 'safe house' or two.What we have here is a video game RPG that acts like, plays like, and runs like a tabletop RPG! There are no random battles, and world exploration is very limited. Side quests are (generally) done immediately when you get them or not at all. There are no obvious good/bad dialogue choices that alter an unseen scale that judges your 'morality'. What we instead have is a very intriguing, atmosphere-driven game with a tightly-focused plot and tactical combat which feels very tabletop-ish.I enjoy Shadowrun, but I've also played the tabletop RPG and enjoy the setting. A person who buys this expecting something like a Bioware rpg or Skyrim is going to be very disappointed. But if you're willing to give it a chance, the atmosphere and writing will immerse you easily.And there's a game editor. So you can probably make your own game, if you think you could do better.			"

												Ah Shadowrun, I'll start off by saying this: If you're into the Shadowrun universe and games like UFO: XCOM, then chances are that you'll really like Shadowrun returns.That said, I do have some issues with the game. First and foremost, the music gets grading and tiresome fast. I've played the game for 9 hours and I had to turn the music off, they were clearly aiming for a dark electronic ambience and they do achieve it, but there are simply not enough tunes and a few of them simply sound too much alike.A second point that I feel must be made, is the fact that the game has cut a lot of corners when making the jump from pen & paper to video game. Shadowrun has always aimed for high realism, but this requires a lot of rules and a lot of depth. I understand that they had to cut a lot of these rules because otherwise nobody would've been able to play the game without 2 hours of tutorial, if not more.Third point, there are some issues when trying to select certain points to move to in the grid, so I suggest activating the double-click feature, which ends the miss clicks.Fourth point, the save system blows balls. The game will auto-save whenever you enter a new scene, but you are unable to manually save, this means that if you fail, you have to start all over from the very beginning of the scene, this can be especially tiresome if the encounter is 30 minutes long or you just leveled up before you died.Fifth point is mostly mechanical, but I still feel  it should be mentioned. There's an issue with scripted events that can ♥♥♥♥ you over; I'll try to explain it: When you move a character through a door and towards cover, the character will stop because and a little dialogue will play. Afterwards your character will be stuck where the dialogue started and if you're out of actions for said character, this can lead to them recieving a lead sandwich. Couple this with the fact that you're unnable to resurrect your main character if his HP hits zero and you can get rather frustrated. This wouldn't be half bad, but when you can resurrect side characters after they hit zero HP it just seems rather silly.And finally always remember:Watch your back. Shoot straight. Conserve ammo. And never, ever, cut a deal with a dragon.			"

Possibly higher. I had a deliberately less than optimal build for RP reasons (I wanted to max out Charisma) and didn't find the game too tough.			"

I was a bit disapointed at first, but with this 'expansion' I am totally happy with my choice! I really recommande it, it give alots of inspiration for real Shadowrun Tabletop time.

So what do you  get in the game? Character building, Many choices that don't impact the story but the gameplay, silent charcters (To roleplay better?), A catchy background music and lore that don't make sense if you are not well wersed. (Tho they are as a sidenote in the game and not relevent for the game itself) This is a kickstarted game based on nostalgia and i (Who did not kickstared it and havent even heard of shadowrun before) got hooked.

Fascinating world, interesting characters, tactical enough combat, intriguing story. Would buy again.Edit after 12 hours into it: still loving it. It's a linear story, but there's enough illusion of choice that it doesn't feel linear. Protips:1. Do not give your hired shadowrunners anything cool because they keep it after the mission is over! 2. Don't bother with hiring a dedicated decker. The story so far has dropped a free pro-decker in my lap each time I've really needed one.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is so damn likable that it's easy to overlook how mediocre it can be. The user interface is cumbersome and frequently doesn't let you do what you'd expect it would. It's janky in the way that you remember crusty old PC games used to be, except it's not charming by today's standards. The default campaign: Dead Man's Switch is unflinchingly linear and the game has some odd hitching issues. But it's ****ing cyberpunk! Despite the fact that the story goes off the rails in a rather magnificent way, Shadowrun Returns stays true to the Gibson-esque tone that you want from a cyberpunk RPG and more to the point, a sequel to the original Shadowrun. The writing is what you want from a Shadowrun game. The combat is ersatz-XCOM Enemy Unknown. I'd have a hard time calling Shadowrun Returns great, but if you're as starved as I am for its specific brand of dystopia, it's a decent fix.			"

												I'm done with ""Dead Man's Switch"" and a few missions into ""Dragonfall.""tl,dr: Don't buy the game unless you buy Dragonfall with it.The combat is a bit simple, though turning up the difficulty helps immensely to provide a more engaging, complicated experience. It certainly doesn't feel like the fluidity one finds in a real tabletop game session, but then, to expect that from a computer game is usually folly.The heart, and meat, of the game is, rather, in its dialogue and world. For clarity, don't expect voice acting and animated cutscenes. It's more in the mein of the aging RPGs like Baldur's Gate, but even less frilly. Characters are rendered convincingly, and with their own authorial voices. The writing never worse than ""pretty good.""But where Dead Man's Switch (the base campaign) never gets far above pretty good, and maintains a dreary linearity at all times, Dragonfall excels. Dragonfall's characters and story are much more believably written, the world more flavorful, and the story less full of deus ex machina windfalls.Where Dead Man's Switch feels like a saturday morning cartoon, Dragonfall is more like a well-written, high-budget film. I might watch both, but you can be sure I'd much rather watch the latter.			"

												Hoy Chummers.Shadowrun Returns takes you through a solid introduction to the cyberpunk world of shadowrun where classic fantasy, (sword and sorcery) meets cyber enhanced super soldiers.  When I first saw that this game was going to be done I was afraid another company was going to screw it up the way Microsoft did when they failed making another game trying to use the Shadowrun name.    Thankfully this is not the case.  The first story deadman switch is a good solid introduction to the world of being a gun for hire.  While the story is largly liniar the additional content added by players adds vast replayability to the original quest and provides a huge amount of additional content. Dragonfall adds several more hours and more options for play as well.  Another thing that has been nice is that many of the bugs that are/were in this have been fixed.  So many products are released to die where this game has been continually updated to ensure problems when found are solved.  For RPG fans or those who remember playing one of the many table top cyberpunk games,  this is a great game worth every penny.			"

I paid nearly full price for the game and the Dragonfall expansion and regret nothing!			"

The pros far outweigh the cons. Any TBS fan is sure to enjoy this title. Well worth the reasonable price tag.			"

												Another recommendation for Dragonfall. The second campaign is placed in the flux state berlin. The setting in the ADL is way better for ""world shattering"" Campaign than Seattle and unleashes a great storyarc with countless additional information about the world of shadowrun. A great problem of shadowrun (pen and paper) is the world, which is always feeling the same way, even with all the options it has to offer. Berlin (ingame) is compensating this a bit but not much. It looks interesting and is more open than seattle. Still, it's far way from a open world. Harebrained Schemes your storytelling is already great and enough over the top, I would love if you start bringig more features to your game. More settings, more skills, more options. So please start hiring more programmers and more artist to create a deeper ruleset and more gameworld.At least, this is a recommendation! Go buy it, if you like cyberpunk, Shadowrun or a good written story. If you are not close with reading books or text in general, buy it for a good cause and just don't play it, there is no voice acting in this game for a reason!			"

Great characters, extremely gripping story, and there will be plenty of downright agonizing dilemmas for you to solve.Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall - THIS is the true Shadowrun experience and you owe it to yourself to get it.Oh the game have mods, so ya thats a plus too.

												Shadowrun returns is a much-anticipated return to from for the often-maligned Shadowrun videogame series.  After the absurdly bad adaption as a first-person shooter under Microsoft's ageis, this game returns to the series' roots as a delightfully atmospheric adventure game.  Tactical turn-based squad combat is blended deliciously with punchy storytelling in the vibrant if dark and gritty 6th World.Really, I can't recommend this game any more highly.  Everything from the music, to the art, to the writing was nigh perfect.  As someone with over two decades of experience with the setting, getting to see stories well told in it was heartening, especially when familiar characters get to cameo.A solid purchase, with no regrets.

												The flavor in this game nails the essence of Shadowrun right on the head.  I enjoyed my first playthrough of both the main campaign and the expansion a lot.The endless customization that the pen and paper game has is not present sadly, and this hurts replayability.  Dragonfall added side missions which was nice, but not enough of them.  It would be nice if player made side missions could be loaded into the main campaign/expansion.All in all, a fun experience, I would probably buy more DLC if they offered it.			"

												For some, Shadowrun: Returns was a disappointment; a Kickstarter investment that didn't quite live up to their expectations. To others, it was good enough. For some, like me, the game was a very happy surprise that engaged them more than they had ever expected.Shadowrun: Returns is, as one might gather, a return to the Shadowrun universe, based on the Pen & Paper role-playing game and the previous NES RPG tied in with it. Following its roots, it is of course a role-playing game, played from an isometric perspective not unlike the older Fallout titles. When seeing this perspective, you'll probably note how absolutely striking it is: The first thing that struck me about this game is how absolutely beautiful it is. The artwork is wonderfully designed and it carries a dark, gritty cyberpunk tone that will bring you back to stories such as Neurmancer and Blade Runner.The centerpiece with many worlds is, of course, the story, and again, this is an area where Shadowrun: Returns truly shines. Although the story itself might not be the strongest out there, the overall writing makes up for it: The character and story are written with a high quality, and this breathes life into the story, making it engaging, making you curious as to what might happen next.  The written dialogues contain plenty of wit and intrigue with interesting conversation options, very much making up for the fact that there is no voice-acting present in the game.So, if the story is wonderful and the world equally so, you might begin to see where the detracting factors come in that made this game disappointing for some: The gameplay is where Shadowrun: Returns is lacking. Unlike its late 90's - early 2000's peers Fallout and the Infinity Engine games, Shadowrun isn't very open-ended. It's a linear story that you follow. Sure, there are a few optional sidequests, you can talk to people and you have plenty of freedom when it comes to building your character, there isn't too much free-roaming through the game's world. The world is wonderful, yes, but it could have been utilized way better if there was more freedom.The combat falls a bit short along with it. It's tense enough, and there is a little strategy involved, but very weak animation and sound design deliver a very hard blow to a system that would otherwise be pretty solid; It feels weak and unsatisfying, despite being quite exciting in some of the harder spots of the game.Finally, the RPG mechanics are lacklustre when compared to other titles. Although the progression tree does its job pretty well, there is no proper way to equip yourself during missions, no true 'inventory' besides utility and weapon slots and generally it feels as if there are just a few features missing in this department that would have truly helped the game become better.So, what do we end up with? A very story-oriented game with a wonderful world to play in. The gameplay might not deliver all the time, but it's just strong enough to hold together the rest, and if the combat doesn't provide enough motivation to keep playing, the writing most probably will. If a darker, cyberpunk world to play around in for a bit appeals to you, Shadowrun: Returns is most definitely worth playing.As a final note, it must be said that the game is packed with a reasonably strong modding tool and Steam Workshop compatibility, so when you're done playing you can play user-created content or have a go at making some yourself!

Only thing is you are in charge of only one character and hire others to fill out your squad, which is okay but sometimes I wished I was able to assign stats to the characters on my team.  I did not encounter any bugs.  If it was a book it would be one of those ""I could not put it down"" type books			"

												I'm new to the franchise but I love anything with a TTRPG feel. I haven't finished the game yet. It's hard not to compare this to Fallout 2. I think if you enjoyed that game you'll like this.Pros:+great writing, a joy to read+satisfying gun sounds imho+great art/character designs, armor not so much+allows class mixing based on skills+every class has something useful. it's worth it putting something into magic just to have access to the basic healing spell or charisma to avoid conflict+Good soundtrack that can get stuck in your headMeh:*kind of have to look up a lot of stuff *I play fairly frugally but still struggle with money. I probably hire too many mercenaries though but I have very little money for consumables after upgrading weapons and armor.*scalable difficulty in options menu*no voice acting*from a lore perspective, they really crammed as many tropey things [things overused in fiction] in as possible (hacking/cyberpunk, spirits, zombies, high fantasy races, magic, ninjas, etc.). It doesn't take anything away from the experience though. I'm nitpicking.Cons:-decking/matrix stuff doesn't show up until half-way through; essentially making a class fairly useless until then (and where I am currently, since). I recommend mixing it with another class. EDIT: I've since beat the game. Roughly 3/4 through, Decking becomes very useful in taking over turrets. Basically every class has the option of adding a key tactical option a some point in the campaign.-not much lore available in-game-VERY linear for an RPG but has a good amount of length for the $4 I spent on it.-some character(s) forced on you for missions aren't nearly as good as hired mercenaries. *cough* Coyote *cought* How can you miss that many time in a row at point blank with a fragging shotgun?!.... *cough* excuse me...

												An old classic is rebooted with the fluid and tactical combat of Xcom mated with a mysterious Cyberpunk/Fantasy theme. The RPG dialouge is top notch and the characters are very fleshed out. Each character is unique independent of their race unlike most other RPGs.If you were ever a fan of Fallout, Baldur's Gate, Torment, or other infinity engine classics, highly recommend this and keeping an eye out for the Torment and Wasteland kickstarters. This is the first of many beautiufl reboots to come (although from what I hear this doesn't live faithfully up to the originals which I unfortunately never played having never owned the consoles needed).I would like to add the current campaign is moderate in length being shorter than most old and new RPGs. The main appeal is the mod kit which will allow for many, many campiagns and such. Also the dialouge while great does NOT affect the world greatly and is more for flavour than anything.Lastly I recommend not playing a Street Samurai. They are in bad need of balancing and it makes the game a cake walk once you unlock the ability to 'one-action kill' most enemies in the game.			"

												Solid Turned-Based RPG.I found the overall game to be solid.  Well written, enjoyable storyline wrapped with some great mechanics.  Complaints about a very linear campaign are accurate.  However, considering the price and solid execution, I feel that is more than forgiveable.  This isn't an RPG with lots of side content or derivative bits to distract you from the main story.  As mentioned, at $15 or even $20, I think that the offering is more than fair.  My only complaints are that while polished, the story and gameplay are forgettable.  The game is entertaining enough to pull you through the campaign but not memorable enough to bring you back for nostalgic purposes.  On the contrary, it will probably give you a craving for some older classics such as Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment or Fallout.			"

												This expansion for Shadowrun Returns (by Hare-Brained Schemes) evokes the old-school grand scope of classic Bioware RPGs.  More than just an expansion campaign, Dragonfall improves on the original engine in many ways, and responds directly to many complaints about the original.  Even better, it translates those improvements (like a new save system) to the original campaign as well, so folks new to the series entirely can enjoy the improved engine from the start.  The result is an improved product all around, and a memorable and enjoyable RPG set in one of the most fun alternate universes ever created.  An excellent set of custom creation tools add to the potential life of the game, as the mod community may well produce some masterpieces of their own, down the line.			"

												I never played the original Shadowrun (SNES and Sega Genesis, apparently), but after playing Shadowrun Returns, I'm going to find it.Shadowrun Returns is one of the few games in the ""RPG"" category that is, in fact, a Role-Playing Game. Unlike Dungeon Siege, Diablo, BioWare Game or Final Fantasy, Shadowrun actually requires you to interact with NPCs and the manner of those interactions actually impacts the game. Imagine that. So many games claim that NPC interactions affect outcomes, but this is the first game I've played in a while (not including the Elder Scrolls/Fallout 3 sub-genre) in which that's actually true.Dead Man's Switch (the original campaign) has a little bit of important dialogue, but Dragonfall (the first DLC campaign) is LOADED with character development and NPCs that actually behave differently depending on how you treat them.But the beauty of Shadowrun Returns isn't the official campaigns. It's the editor, and the integration with Steam Workshop. I've not actually used the editor yet, but judging from the vast range of quality in the user-created content, it must be pretty easy to use. On the one hand, that means a LOT of just pure garbage content. On the other hand, it means that learning how to use the editor isn't a stumbling block for somebody who's got a great story to tell.So while the original campaign is really quite good (I mean really, really good. It's one of the few campaigns of any game that I'm perfectly happy replaying several times in a row), Dragonfall really showcases what the game's engine is capable of.If you've ever played the old Fallout games (Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics), this is a lot like those. If you haven't played those, think of it as turn-based, squad-based Diablo, with almost no emphasis on gear. There is an equipment treadmill, but it's not very involved. More along the lines of Mass Effect 2.There are three or four pistols (for example), and you buy the most expensive one you can afford. So while there IS a reason to make more money and get the better stuff, it's not the need that it is in other games (Diablo, for example). Sorry to keep making the comparison to Diablo, but that's the other game I've been playing most recently.Shadowrun Returns is also one of the few games I've played that knows how to use a touchscreen. Most games work ""well enough,"" but SR has a touchscreen mode that makes it function beautifully. And by ""beautifully,"" I mean that the PC version plays just as well on my Dell touchscreen as the Android version plays on my Samsung Note 2.I don't know if anyone but me cares about that, but with the increasing prevalence of Windows 8, I figure it's worth mentioning.I know I'm making a big deal about Dragonfall, and I mean to. It's an excellent campaign, and is actually (in my opinion) worth the price of a full expansion pack, as opposed to the increasingly-common 2-dollar DLC. But I suppose I should really talk more about Dead Man's Switch. It's an engaging mystery with great characters. It doesn't have the meaningful dialogues and character developmnet of Dragonfall, but I was immediately taken with both Dresden and Kluwe. They're not ""important"" characters, but the fact that placeholder roles are filled with well-fleshed and well-written characters is just indicative of the attention to detail paid by the devs. It's a well-polished introduction to the world of Shadowrun.

												Okay, I finally have to write a little something after playing the Dragonfall DLC.First off, to quickly go over Shadowrun Returns:  Let me preface this by saying I am a kickstarter backer.  Back when SRR popped up on Kickstarter, I immediately jumped on board.  I'd been craving the old-school SR like the ones on Genesis and SNES which I played when I was hardly into my teens, and everything in the KS pitch sold me that this would bring it back to those days.  When SRR finally released and I played through it, I came out satisfied.  It has a solid and deep story, good combat (which has since been balanced and improved), fairly simple puzzles, and yes..it had some flaws like no manual saves (again, resolved since then), but it didn't really bug me that much.  Most of all, they made choice matter.And then along comes Shadowrun: Dragonfall.   Dragonfall absolutely oozes greatness.  There's insane depth of characters and the world, down to the smallest details, even in conversations with side characters like Simmy Kim and reading the Shadowland BBS.  It's a very rare thing where a game captures me so well that I sit and read every single piece of text I come across (and there's so much to read in this series).  I especially appreciated the design in this DLC of having the quest hub, but more importantly, there were so many more rich side quests throughout the campaign than in the base game.  They also upped the design on the puzzle elements a bit which I appreciated (the original campaign's were generally way too straightforward).  But enough of a wall of text, let's break things down:Story: Phenomenal.  Aside from the depth of lore in this world, the story of this campaign alone was so great.  Just when you     think you've got things figured out, something throws you for a loop.  You face lots of decisions that test your morals, many of which mostly seem to test just how close to ""the line"" you're willing to step, or if it's even a question for you.Characters: Great.  This time around, you've got a dedicated crew.  Sure, you could hire runners to go along with you, but the crew is where it's at.  They've got deep stories and I loved every bit of exploring them.  The SRR Dead Man Switch campaign had people occasionally joining you, like Coyote, but those companions pale in comparison to the attention given to the crew of Dragonfall.  I cared about my crew.  Hell, I felt bad that I always had to leave one member behind on my runs having only room for a team of 4.  I felt like I was neglecting them most of the game and that they were going to confront me about it at some point.Combat: Solid.  I played on hard difficulty, and essentially did the same rifle-focused street samurai build I did in SRR.  I found it much more balanced, and there were several missions with some real tension as the fights raged on.  The Matrix served a good purpose as well; it felt much more key to this campaign than the first.Graphics: Beautiful.  They already established this with SRR, they just painted a whole new world for Dragonfall's Berlin setting, and it's gorgeous.So that's it in a nutshell.Final verdict: Worth buying?  Abso-freakin-lutely.  This is an rpg not to be missed. "

												Good News:This game stays extremely close to the feel of the core game of Shadowrun, so much so it feels like it's been released by FASA during the 90's in tone and theme,  It also tries very hard to give you customization of the shadowrunner classes or lets you make your own main character to get through the plot the way you want to.  The story is engaging and the characters are deep.Bad News: The core mechanic of combat feels simple.  It uses a turn based, seek cover mechanic which feels a bit like a slower version of Dawn of War II.  Combat starts abruptly and you can be left in the lurch.  There's also no way to end combat which makes some parts just a little bit of a slog once you kill all of your enemies and have to traverse the map taking turns.   I played a mage and feel like I got a little shafted because you don't get to play in the Matrix unless you want to split your skills, you can't assense, go astral, or summon elementals.  You're just a better, more versatible combat monster.However:The Good outweighs the bad.  If you were a fan of the tabletop RPG or like the theme of technology mixed with magic, it's definitely worth a playthrough.  If you don't like story or you expect more tactics in your combat, skip it.			"

												A short review right now - still playing the game.I am relatively new to playing many of the classic games of the 90s. I didn't even know Shadowrun Returns existed until I came across it on a steam sale, but the high community rating piqued my interest, along with the steampunk art style and setting. I've only done a little D&D in my life (getting into that more, actually, now that I'm an adult) but I love how SR carries through the feel of D&D combat without bogging you down in details. It's easy to learn but requires tactical thinking.The story has been more engrossing than I expected. For a game without voice acting, I'm drawn in by the story of a friend's murder and the quest to know.If you like the dungeon genre but want some sci-fi in your life, pick up this gem and give it a try.

												Having never played a Shadowrun game, I was surpised to discover a good casual game with nice soundtracks. I only encountered one glitch where the game hung, near then end, when you discover the real reason for the killings and who was responsible. Simply restarting the level from the last save and choosing a different character response was all that was needed. I was doubtful about replay value but seeing that the game includes Steam Workshop, there are plenty of user generated content available to play. Also, if you're creative and have the time then you can use the game editor to create and share your own story. After a quick search, you'll find plenty of tutorial videos for using the game editor. I've yet to try the DLC but Shadowrun Returns is easily an 8/10 game.			"

												Shadowrun Returns (Dead Man's Switch) has some of the best writing of any game I've played this year, but the early going can be somewhat frustrating as SR unfortunately plays its cards close to its chest before opening up the world. After an extended prologue, though, the game blossoms into a story that pulls from classic noir fiction like Raymond Chandler's Marlowe stories and Polanski's Chinatown coupled with the richly detailed background fiction of the Shadowrun universe. ""Cyberpunk and magic"" is a concept that should, by all accounts, collapse into utter silliness, but somehow SR manages to keep finding interesting (and sometimes amusing) twists on both of these themes.While the art style is clean and the interface generally functional (inventory management is a sore spot), be aware that this is a game that really only gives as much as you're willing to bring to it -- there are no 3D environments, voiced dialog, or cut scenes, but the game manages to be immersive in the same way that dreamily browsing through a gamebook and conjuring adventures can be. Some reviews have faulted the plot for being overly linear, and while I always appreciate more player agency, it really wasn't an issue for me here.My main complaint is the way the game paces itself in doling out the fun skills and cool toys. Early on it's hard to understand why I'd want to invest in particular skill sets when there's little explanation of how they function or game scenarios that take advantage of them. It's not until the midpoint of the game that distinctive SR features like rigs, decks, and chroming really even come into play which makes it frustrating to define your character without knowing what kind of build you're even shooting for. While I have no problem holding back some surprises, I would have rather seen the advanced stuff up on the shelf early on so I had a better idea of what I could aspire to be. In the worst case, you can never go wrong with shooting something with a gun or throwing a fireball at it, though a lot of the fun in SR comes from mixing and matching all the different combinations available.But the story and characters are well drawn, the dialog full of personality, and once events pick up steam I felt compelled to chase down the conclusion. By the end I'd developed a lot of affection for both my character and the friends she'd made along the way; I was sorry to see them go (and that there are currently no plans to continue their story) but based on the strength of this initial foray I'll definitely be checking out the sequel, Dragonfall. Definitely recommended.			"

												I don't know if I'm playing this game correctly.  I REALLY WANT to like this game.  I've only played the story that comes with the game originally and as far as i can tell, there's no way to level your character before key fights.  It's very linear, and almost seams more like a vivid book than an actual game.  In the original Shadowrun, I would do tons of missions to get paid and level my items, then progress the story.  This version seems to lack the freedom that the original boasted.  Although I didn't have the fun that I wanted to, it is an extremely beautiful game.  It holds very true to the original lingo and settings as well.  There is a TON of user created content for this game, so I'm still going to give it a thumbs up.  Good luck, chummer!			"

												I have been forced to rewrite my review because Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall is DLC thus can not be reviewed independently.Basically, I did not recommend Shadowrun Returns on its own. It is too short, too easy, too linear, and the combat mechanics aren't particularly interesting.Dragonfall is longer, harder, and less linear, albeit suffers from the same flaw of conversation choices appearing to be irrelevant and merely affecting the current conversation and little else. However SR:Dragonfall is a good enough game to recommend even if the combat still is a little on the shakey side.Both SR and SR:Dragonfall suffer from dumb AI, so don't expect it to tactically challenge you other than some enemies being far more dangerous than others, but the good writing and significant content of Dragonfall make it more than good enough to recommend. I would not recommend getting SR without Dragonfall though.			"

												It's a very fun game but I had no clue it was so story driven. For every 5 minutes of combat you have to read through 20 minutes of dialogue. This made the main story go by rather slowely for me but don't let that deter you because in the workshop you can find custom stories that have a much heavier focus on combat. Regardless it is still a great game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes turn based strategy games or anyone who likes to fully indulge themselves in a great story.			"

												Not a very complicated game.  While many other games have exciting engines and flashy graphics, this game harkens back to the '90s style of turn based action.  The interface is basic and easy to use.  There are plenty of Workshop quests to go on if you complete the main story line and want to keep playing.  Try your hand at GMing and craft a plotline for your fellow shadowrunners.  This reimagining does the tabletop RPG justice.			"

												Personally I think the Sega Genesis game tops all of the rest of the shadowrun installments...I didn't play the fps for the pc that was released a few years ago but i heard that was garbage so.... Genesis still wins out, but this version is very close to the Snes version just prettier and better sound. the game revolves around clicking to talk to people, clicking to shoot them, clicking to use inventory and or special moves/spells.sometimes you do this in the matrix (not much different from the ingame rl combat.)you have to do alot of stuff to progress from one area to the next and it can feel clunky, and slow, and if you aren't a SR fan the game then Shadowlingo can be convoluted and seem ...very stuck in what the 80's thought theyd be saying in the future.    So for nostalgia's sake I like this game, the story is ok, Chery still pops into my dreams wearing that ripped shirt , familiar characters from the first game, very true to SR story line, tons of workshop content and the abillity to create your own story (true to the pen and paper SR). And you can use your initial character in a lot of the user generated content items,deck and all.So people looking for a casual rpg with a merc-noir story and lots of add ons this game is for you.Fans of the snes and sega versions will like this.none of the above? you got 30/70 chance of liking it.I give it a solid 70 out of 100. it would have scored higher with more playable options and a revamped combat system but i think we may see that with future content from the workshop.

I don't think i'll be playing this game anymore as it takes too long to load each individual screen while waiting for the interface to catch up and hoping i stumble upon the correct path.  ain't nobody got time for that.  the basic gameplay is entertaining, but the load times remind me of what it was like to play an original playstation game.

They did such great work if actually making your teammates and even the NPC's themselves feel alive. They all have their own personality, their own demons, their own wants and wishes. Really grade A writing on their part. I have not felt such a strong connection to characters in a video since Final Fantasy 7. I am really conservative when it comes to giving out ratings, but seriously...10/10. Combat is great, character development is great, dialog, sound, plot...just everything about this game is near perfection.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is set in a fantastic, cyberpunk, distopian earth, where mega-coorporations are running the show, drug dealers roam the streets, and mercenary adventurers, called ""shadowrunners"" take on dangerous work for the highest bidder. On top of everything else, magic has returned to the world, which puts a novel spin on the whole cyberpunk setup.This game has a brilliant atmosphere, captivating from the start, pulling you into the dirty streets of a blade-runner-ish seattle, and putting you into the skin of a shadow runner. Shadowrun returns features a great story, with lots of twists and reminds me of the Torment due to its emphasis on dialogue, rather than battles. On the downside it's very linear, with only a couple of occasional options for side-quests. But this is not necessarily that bad, because it focuses on the plot and tells the story without infinite distractions and pointless errants.Highly recomended for RPG fans who are not aversed to exploring a futuristic, cyberpunk world, very similar to the worlds of Gibson's ""the neuromancer"", or Stephenson's ""snowcrash"" but still very unique in its own right.

												This is a game that could have been so much more. I love the setting and I think that for the most part they did a great job creating the world. However while it looks great it often feels like a set rather than a living city. Every place you go plays out more or less the same. Click the 2 or 3 people with talk symbols over their head, look for the 1 or 2 items that you can click on the map somewhere, fight a few guys, leave area. I like the world, I want to be able to go around and explore it and have a reason to do so. Even if it is just flavor text like ""You see a grimy computer terminal, you can tell it has been well used"" for example. I want to be able to go around and look at everything and just explore. The world graphics are great for the most part. There are a few things that really take me out of it like the quick loop of papers blowing in the wind over and over. The birds that fly off when you walk by are great though. My biggest gripe with the graphics is that the characters rarely look anything like their super awesome avatar pictures. I see a big orc character and when I walk up to him his avatar picture is of a skinny orc. The avatar picture I made for my guy is very thin but his character model is chunky with a way different head. Just pulls me out of the story. I like the story and I like the characters. It was well written and kept me interested. Even the loading screen text telling me about the place I was heading was great. I do wish that there was less travel here travel there though. I just get interested in an area and nope off to the next place. Maybe if rather than quick traveling everywhere there were inbetween areas with optional side stuff to do then all the traveling around would feel more cohesive. I have not played the official DLC mission yet so maybe they fixed some of my problems with it. Despite the problems, I do recommend the game if for nothing else other than the story and great setting. I really hope we get something more expansive in this universe someday though.  "

												Right... So where do I begin... The game left me with quite a mixture of feelings...Let's clear the negative bits first. The game is more linear than most linear FPS's this days (and the RPG being more linear than most FPS's says a lot). There is almost no chance to explore or approach the mission in any variety of ways. The game practically forces you from point A to point B in a most direct and unforgiving way. There is simply nothing to do in between of those points. No exploration, no looting, no chatting with random NPC - nothing.Another major let down of this game are dialogs. While generaly well written, multiple choice answers make no sense. As no matter what you reply will be, the conversations take the same course. You can flatter other NPC to high sky or you can tell them to kiss your *** - makes no difference whatsoever in majority of cases. So to cut the long story short - the game is hugely let down by its linearity. Its ultimately linear in every imaginable way - from converasations to how the missions go.But let's ""knock it off with those negative waves"" and be positive for a bit. First and foremost the game's atmosphere is absolutely marvellous. Considering the simplicity of graphics, sound and setting the game does absolutely fantastic job in recreating a world that, despite its linearity, is still interesting to be in. Many games, while being much more graphically advanced and running on much higher budget have tried and failed to deliver the same.The atmosphere somewhat reminds me of the first Deus Ex, only with magic, elves and orks thrown in. Same dark, run-down, but strangely attractive urban-setting of the near future. You really feel comfy, entering the pub after roaming the slums, you really want to ask bartender for a pint (shame that game won't let you) and chat with the bouncer, while you at it.The plot is fairly strong. Somewhat predictable, but still has a few unexpected twists and provides a good story. Other than that - game has a lot of potential to expand on what it has already achieved, to fix its downfalls and to become a classic in its own right. Developers have already done the most important thing - creating an interesting and immersive world. Now its only a question of expanding on dialogues, exploration, more side quests and making the game-world bigger and more detailed.So I would still recommend this game and ""Dragonfall"" is already on my wishlist (although not at the top). If you aren't fully convinced - just wait for big sale and buy it then. It probably wouldnt be ultimate purchase of the year, but still - few coins well spent :)			"

												Quite alright, especially with Dragonfall. The base game is a bit lackluster though, if you're not into cyberpunk then the looks, music and overall atmosphere will not carry you through it. The expansion helps a lot to overcome that and turns it into a fine game for anybody curious about a new turn based rpg. Also check out Extra Credit's youtube episode ""games you might not have tried: cyberpunk"".			"

												An essential game for all fans of cyberpunk, sci-fi and fantasy, cRPGs or PnP, and turn-based gaming.  Shadowrun Returns: Dead Man's Switch is the first turn-based game I've played in what must be a decade and I'm thoroughly enjoying every moment of it, and I hear the Dragonfall campaign is even better and apparently much longer. The DMS campaign's story is tight, although linear, but the beautiful and lush art combines with the rich fictional world of the Shadowrun universe to make the world come alive, and serves as an excellent introduction into the world of cyberpunk. The editor ensures a steady stream of excellent player-made campaigns too, so if you have any inclination to try this game out you very likely won't regret it and will feel stupid for not trying it out sooner, if you're anything like me.

												I have mixed feelings about this game. Obviously Shadowrun is an awesome universe and this game gives you a great taste of it. However, I found the combat kind of lifeless and repetitive. The writing in the default campaign is a bit uninspiring as well. I do hear great things about the add-on campaigns and the new DLC though, so overall I would say it's worth checking out.			"

												Shadowrun is a long running series, starting in 1993 as a Nintendo action adventure game, it literally blew minds with its diverse story telling. It had everything; connecting your brain to the internet, street mages, mafia trolls, crazy ex-girlfriends. the game was later adapted into a paperback rpg that has had a relatively strong run. ( its in its 5th edition.)Shadowrun Returns; Deadmans switch and its superior, Dragonfall, takes place in 2070, about 10- 20 years after the events of original. Deadmens switch is an adventure through the city of Seattle, fighting through deadly cultist plots and drek crazy doctors you manage to avenge your old partner’s death. While dragonfall is and intricate story about investigating a mysterious force in berlin while your attempt to battle forces that would appose the flux state. I belive the game play is quite sharp for a turn based game, delivering multple layers of complexty with its various custom class archtypes (rigger, adept, shaman, samurai, mage, decker, ect) you can play a muscle mage, or a shooty hacker, or any combination there of. next there's the multiple layers of customization, from bio mods to specll selection you have a large library to chose from. I've thoroughly enojoyed my adventures in the dark, an impatienly await the coming additions.			"

												I was introduced to Shadowrun back in the early 90's with the SNES classic.  I fell in love with the setting almost instantly; sci-fi with magic?  It was my dream game.  I then became more enamoured with the Sega Genesis version once I discovered it, since it allowed for even more freedom, and a glimpse into the true mechanics of the game.  In Junior High I was introduced to the actual tabletop RPG, and it sparked my love of that hobby.  All that aside, Shadowrun is very important and dear to me, will always hold a special place in my heart, and will forever be held at the highest standard for me.This game does not dissappoint.  At all.  It is amazing.  The setting harkens back to an earlier time of the Shadowrun universe, when Deckers HAD to go with the group, because wireless connectivity, that wasn't even a thing.Dunkelzahn hadn't become the first Dagon-American President of the UCAS.The Arcology was still a shining beacon of how the future will be.The world is perfect.  It shows how and why people live in the shadows, and doesn't leave anything to mystery as to why the world is in the over all crummy condition it's in.  The gameplay, while not the Shadowrun I know and love, still feels amazing.  Spellcasters are appropriately powerful, while not being the rediculous level of game breaking they can be in the tabeltop (lacking Astral Projection and long-term spirit aid.)  Martial-oriented characters are sufficiently amazing (street samurais and adepts both shine,) and whether you're melee, gun happy, or mixed, you have a lot of cool options.  Where the mechanics really shine?  The Matrix play.  It feels very appropriate for what it's supposed to be.  A little world where you wander around and blast programs.  Where the game lacks over all?  While highly customizable, it still feels as though you are cornered into one or to directions.  Healing is challenging, which isn't bad, just something you aren't really made aware of early on.  It also feels that there's a sharp increase to difficulty if you aren't playing a face (social oreinted) character.  All in all, an amazing game, love it, and suggest it to everyone!			"

												*i've only beaten Dead Man's Switch and my short rant will only conver it*My first impression of this game was really great and i was really impressed by the story wirting , art direction and character building but as i progressed through the game its flaws have became more apparent .Story wirting is good through out the whole game and the writer/s seems like a knowledgeable person but i was really surprised when i noticed spelling and grammer mistakes! For me it wasn't a big problem since English is not my native language but i think many native-English gamers will find it annoying .The gameplay machanics are good but have small problems that can be annoying at times .Some of them are technical (like when you set the character to overwatch a certain enemy/area and then it goes out of the previously set range and waste a bullet and an AP point) and some of them are design flaws (like being forced to traverse a whole floor in battle mode even if there is no enemy left) .For the game design in general i really wished that the developers have reused the previously visted locations for side-missions to increase the game time and value because in the end this is an RPG game and not COD .This game have its flaws but i was able to look past them and enjoy it .That's why i'm recommending it .

												Shadowrun Returns is a decent CRPG that has definite bona fides back to the isometric giants of ages past.  The content is well written and fits the universe it's set in.  The combat is fun, if a bit less than challenging and less common then you'd hope.The game does feel a bit ""on rails"", however, especially when compared to the games it harkens back to.  This isn't the utter gigantism of something like Baldur's Gate.  The game is pretty small, the party options are limited (you only get to allocate stats and alter the inventory of the main character, for example).  I bought SRR during the steam summer sale.  It was worth the $3.50, easily.  I'm hoping to discover a lot of additional content in the workshop.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a surprisingly addictive isometric cyberpunk RPG. The combat has enough tactical depth to keep you on your toes, but the real strength to this game is the story. The dialogue between characters is both interesting and meaningful, often making use of slang specific to the Shadowrun universe which aids immersion. The game does feel quite linear at times and conversational options are often inconsequential, but it doesn't detract from the experience thanks to engaging storyline. I'm genuinely surprised at the quality of the game, especially when consideration is given to the asking price. I think anyone looking for a modern take on old-school RPG'ing would be wise to try Shadowrun.Note: ignore the playtime, my shadowrunning was done offline.			"

												I've never played the Shadowrun tabletop RPG, those aren't my bag. I did love the Shadowrun game on SNES that I played as a kid. This game brings a good blend of nostaglia for that previous title in a similar, but updated look, but it definitely also takes advantage of lessons learned in gaming in the intervening years. Combat in both the real world and while dekking is intuitive and easy to grasp. There are a number of skill tree options to monkey with, but not so many as to require a spreadsheet. Overall I found the game to be a satisfying experience, not terribly difficult, but that's not what I was looking for here anyway. Good times, definitely worth picking up if you enjoyed the old SNES game or the trailer to this one appeals to you.			"

												The Dead Man's Switch(DMS) campaign is forgettable and is only notable for having an annoying enemy that can only be killed with a cumbersome mechanic. There are a handful of interesting interactions during DMS but overall its honestly not worth playing through and can be easily skipped.Dragonfall(DF), on the other hand, is awesome and is filled with characters and scenarios that are as imaginative, well written,  and worth exploring as some of the best RPGs that I have ever played. DF additionally contains a much better structure than DMS, by that I mean rather than having a linear quest with hardly any side branches that you undertake with some flavorless NPCs, DF tasks you with a central goal and allows you to lead a team of fairly unique characters along a questline that has scores of opportunity to explore more of the world of Shadowrun. I enjoyed the vast majority of my time with DF, save for the hacking bits (called decking in this universe), and some later game fights with some annoyingly powerful enemies. Altough, I wholeheartedly recommend DF, Its a shame that you have to buy both to play DF but since thats the case I would advise that you buy the campaigns at a reduced cost and skip DMS.			"

												An old classic is rebooted with the fluid and tactical combat of Xcom mated with a mysterious Cyberpunk/Fantasy theme. The RPG dialouge is top notch and the characters are very fleshed out. Each character is unique independent of their race unlike most other RPGs.If you were ever a fan of Fallout, Baldur's Gate, Torment, or other infinity engine classics, highly recommend this and keeping an eye out for the Torment and Wasteland kickstarters. This is the first of many beautiufl reboots to come (although from what I hear this doesn't live faithfully up to the originals which I unfortunately never played having never owned the consoles needed).I would like to add the current campaign is moderate in length being shorter than most old and new RPGs. The main appeal is the mod kit which will allow for many, many campiagns and such. Also the dialouge while great does NOT affect the world greatly and is more for flavour than anything.Lastly I recommend not playing a Street Samurai. They are in bad need of balancing and it makes the game a cake walk once you unlock the ability to 'one-action kill' most enemies in the game.			"

The combat is an interesting puzzle, but, as befits a shadowrunner, avoiding combat, or searching through the environment can be yet more engaging.  It already has a few excellent user-generated shadowruns (though, like anything that allows fan creation, there's drek out there as well), and the editor should allow for yet more in the future.  Strongly recommend.			"

												If you don't expect too much, it's actually quite a bit of fun, or at least it was for this old Shadowrun tragic. I miss the tabletop RPG tremendously, but just don't have the time for actual real world RPG sessions anymore, so this is a nice little alternative. It seems there are many other adventures out there to try as well, though I think they are made by the community, so who knows if any are good. No multiplayer function, which is a pity. It might have been fun to design dungeons for the old group to explore. Ah well. A fun game anyway. :)			"

												Highly reccomended, especially if you remember the paper n' pencil, SNES or Genesis games.  Turn based combat, but the use of cover makes for good strategy.  AI tends to target the player, and it's one of those 'if the player goes down you lose, regardless if someone could save said player' which is a stupid bit of design that's been accepted as industry standard.WARNING:  This is NOT a hand-holder, you CAN screw your build, and grinding is NOT an option.  Cash is scarce.  You must build practically, specializing in three areas:  Offence, primary role (this may be the same thing) and Survivability.  Think Fallout 1 & 2:  You can't do everything.  Thankfully, most of the time you can hire the help to do it for you.There's a few bugs here and there, and the system could use a bit of polish.  Firearms specialists feel a bit overpowered compared to mages, but make no mistake:  magic is invaluable and you'll always want at least one magic user of some sort.  Hires in Dead Man's Switch seem to have been built before the system was tested.Note that you won't likely to be able to recreate any characters from the paper and pencil game; the system just isn't the same.  Street Sam's can't have Wired Reflexes AND Dermal Plating for example, and the Wired Reflexes don't give extra AP passively like they did in previous editions.  Drain is replaced with cooldown (although casting from hitpoints remains an option).Once you get the hang of the system however, it's well worth it.  Strong builds are rewarding, and certain builds allow soloing runs on Normal, but you'll never get so powerful you can afford to get cocky.Fans of the console adaptions will be pleased, as there's plenty of shout-outs.  Highly replayable as well, due to the number of ways to solve situations depending on your build.ADDITIONAL EDIT:  I cannot recommend the Dragonfall DLC highly enough!  It includes several improvments in game design and having experience from the first game shows.  While Dead Man's Switch is definitely a love letter to the SNES/Genesis games, Dragonfall adds more depth to the characters and feels more like a true RPG with the ability to talk to a regular set of runners inbetween runs.  It is also a vastly more satisfying experience and well worth its price because it's basically a separate game entirely.			"

												Right... So where do I begin... The game left me with quite a mixture of feelings...Let's clear the negative bits first. The game is more linear than most linear FPS's this days (and the RPG being more linear than most FPS's says a lot). There is almost no chance to explore or approach the mission in any variety of ways. The game practically forces you from point A to point B in a most direct and unforgiving way. There is simply nothing to do in between of those points. No exploration, no looting, no chatting with random NPC - nothing.Another major let down of this game are dialogs. While generaly well written, multiple choice answers make no sense. As no matter what you reply will be, the conversations take the same course. You can flatter other NPC to high sky or you can tell them to kiss your *** - makes no difference whatsoever in majority of cases. So to cut the long story short - the game is hugely let down by its linearity. Its ultimately linear in every imaginable way - from converasations to how the missions go.But let's ""knock it off with those negative waves"" and be positive for a bit. First and foremost the game's atmosphere is absolutely marvellous. Considering the simplicity of graphics, sound and setting the game does absolutely fantastic job in recreating a world that, despite its linearity, is still interesting to be in. Many games, while being much more graphically advanced and running on much higher budget have tried and failed to deliver the same.The atmosphere somewhat reminds me of the first Deus Ex, only with magic, elves and orks thrown in. Same dark, run-down, but strangely attractive urban-setting of the near future. You really feel comfy, entering the pub after roaming the slums, you really want to ask bartender for a pint (shame that game won't let you) and chat with the bouncer, while you at it.The plot is fairly strong. Somewhat predictable, but still has a few unexpected twists and provides a good story. Other than that - game has a lot of potential to expand on what it has already achieved, to fix its downfalls and to become a classic in its own right. Developers have already done the most important thing - creating an interesting and immersive world. Now its only a question of expanding on dialogues, exploration, more side quests and making the game-world bigger and more detailed.So I would still recommend this game and ""Dragonfall"" is already on my wishlist (although not at the top). If you aren't fully convinced - just wait for big sale and buy it then. It probably wouldnt be ultimate purchase of the year, but still - few coins well spent :)			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a great game.Think Lord of the Rings meets the Matrix for the setting : orks, elves, trolls, dwarves and regular humans dwell in the shadow of mega-corps, facing the many perils of a cyber-punk low-life. They fight, charm or oustsmart their way around the many dangers of this world with guns, cybertech and magic. The general setting is vibrant and offers a great potential for many stories.The official first campaign is good, but the excellency comes from the User Generated Contents, some of which are better than the original game. Shadowrun's online community offers a lot of different storylines that make this game virtually immortal : play as an elf shaman, a troll bruiser, a dwarven mage, an ork street samurai or a human cyber pirate (or any combination of them, or a character of your own design), assemble your team of runners and advance through the myriad of high-quality mods. Each character has its advantages and drawbacks, so a balanced team is often the best option, though sometimes brute force, magic or technological capacity can make the difference.On the gameplay, it is rather intuitive : 50% RPG, 50% turn-by-turn tactical fighting (à la X-Com) with varyinng proportions depending on the mod.Some ""classes"" are better suited to some roles than others but the progression system allows you to create your own build : do you want your shaman to have proficiency in firearms ?  Do you prefer him to be a pure spellcaster and go mage/shaman ? Do you want him to be extra-tough ? Do prefer to concentrate on invocations and shamanic support spells ? Do you want to sacrifice some of your spellcasting capabilities in favour of cyberware ? All builds are possible and all of them work, with various advantages and drawbacks !The different races help for the feel of the game but have ultimately little impact gameplay-wise apart at the very begining or at the very end of a campaign. Choosing to be a tough troll or a gracefull elf will give you some minor changes in starting stats and a different ultimate potential, but for most of the game the different races don't really matter.Overall, this great game is made awesome thanks to the online community (most of which is here on Steam).

												I started playing the game with zero expectations and no prior knowledge about the series, and came out pleasantly surprised. Shadowrun Returns' story is rich and well-written; The fusion of fantasy race archetypes and the cyberpunk backdrop is perfectly done. The story never gets dull, and the writing does an excellent job of linking together the events to form a smooth and cohesive experience.My only gripe with the game is the somewhat unpolished cursor targetting system. There were instances where I couldn't place my character on a specific spot because an enemy sprite is blocking the spot. There was one game breaking bug where an elevator icon would go dark after moving your characters to the next area, save for one. Aside from these, the game is incredibly fun to play, and comes highly recommended.			"

												Like every game, this isn't for everyone. The default campaign is short (took me slightly north of 10 hours without skipping sidequests), it has a check point system instead of save anywhere (getting changed in Berlin DLC, unsure if being ptached in to cover default game too), lack of lootable corpses, and no voice acting. If none of that bothers you, it's worth a look. The story isn't bad, and there's a lot of dialog.My main complaints are as an RPG, it's kind of lacking content. The campaign is very linear, not a lot of tactical depth to combat, no ability to customize anything except a handful of consumables on party members, nearly all hired runners lack any personality, and reactivity is pretty sparse (i.e. special dialog for race/gender is rare). However, where this game will really shine is future content. It shipped with an ugly but powerful editor that allows modders to fix certain things (more open world questing and lootable bodies for starters). The Berlin DLC is also planned to be more open ended.Overall, a shallow but solid default campaign. The best of this game will come to the surface in the coming months.			"

												This is one of those games I went ""must have it!"" over and then, for some reason, it took me a while before I actually tried it (typical me). So now that I have I'm really happy I did!The atmosphere in the game is really something extra and I'm surprised there aren't more of this type of games instead of all those fantasy inspired ones who are basically flooding the market. Blending cybertech with magic and then puting it in a dark, corporate run society where bribes, conspiracies and espionage is a way of life really speaks to me.So, what will you get then? You'll get a linear game where you get to create your own character and specialize it the way you want it while compensating your weaknesses by hiring mercs whom you'll fight turn-based tactical battles with while following an intriguing storyline that kept me hooked from start to finish (alright, I slept in between, once!). Well constructed dialogues with lots of options that feel real and adds a lot to the feeling of the game. I  liked the music quite a bit and for those of you who also liked the first game won't go wrong with this one ;)Ohhhh! The game has a few difficulties as well to choose from, ranging from ""I just want to know the story"" to ""I love to see my character dying"".I love playing for achievements and usually don't buy games who lack them but this is one of those rare titles I make an exception for and so I give it a 4!Cons: 1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game but not my taste4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played			"

												The game was really good. I like how the story escalated from a simple investigation to taking down a whole cult organization by the end. You can tell that the story, chracters, and the whole lore have been thought through. Gameplay was fun. It's a tactical, grid-based, turn-by-turn actions. You can customize your gear and skills. And even your team. The game doesn't really hold your hand when it comes to exploring features, so take time in digging info about everything like what different skills and items can do. ""I didn't know I can do that!"" I said this so many times. By the time I started getting to know what everything does, the game was almost over. There is one thing that really irked me about this game: my shots just kept missing! The probability says 85%, and yet all my shots missed, like all the time! This happened so many time that I felt like that probability the game is showing is the probability of you missing. Overall, the game was great and I'm looking forward to more titles!			"

												Having just finished the Shadowrun: Dragonfall DLC, I would say it is a better game than the original overall, but I enjoyed both stories very much. The inclusion of the 'save anywhere' system was a great addition. It means the designers are able to make larger maps and encourage exploration. I found Dragonfall's maps were more interesting to roam around. The story is less linear which is fantastic.Choice and dialogue feel a bit better in the DLC as there are some large fights you can avoid completely if you have high charisma or the appropriate character background. I played a rifle-toting character, which just like the previous game, feels rather overpowered on normal mode. Starting ranged weapons skills at 4-5 and increasing this steadily throughout the campaign will get you through many battles faster and quicker on normal mode.  "

												I never played the table top or the MMO shooter no one else seems to have played either, but Shadowrun Returns hits all the important bits for a western RPG: flexible charecter progression, a plot that raises the stakes as you progress, comrades of drinking age, and a fun enviroment that doesn't need hundreds of codex entries to explain what the hell all is going on. Its good tactical fun for a reasonable price: beating the game won't make you sad to leave the charecters, but it will feel like you came from somewhere and did something. If that's not you cup of tea, go find a game where the protagonist has three love intrests he doesn't even notice in between beating up spiders and panther bear robots in his quest to slay god. I'm sure that is much better time spent...			"

												Personally I think the Sega Genesis game tops all of the rest of the shadowrun installments...I didn't play the fps for the pc that was released a few years ago but i heard that was garbage so.... Genesis still wins out, but this version is very close to the Snes version just prettier and better sound. the game revolves around clicking to talk to people, clicking to shoot them, clicking to use inventory and or special moves/spells.sometimes you do this in the matrix (not much different from the ingame rl combat.)you have to do alot of stuff to progress from one area to the next and it can feel clunky, and slow, and if you aren't a SR fan the game then Shadowlingo can be convoluted and seem ...very stuck in what the 80's thought theyd be saying in the future.    So for nostalgia's sake I like this game, the story is ok, Chery still pops into my dreams wearing that ripped shirt , familiar characters from the first game, very true to SR story line, tons of workshop content and the abillity to create your own story (true to the pen and paper SR). And you can use your initial character in a lot of the user generated content items,deck and all.So people looking for a casual rpg with a merc-noir story and lots of add ons this game is for you.Fans of the snes and sega versions will like this.none of the above? you got 30/70 chance of liking it.I give it a solid 70 out of 100. it would have scored higher with more playable options and a revamped combat system but i think we may see that with future content from the workshop.

												Well this is my first review ever so bare with me, the game is good  you need to use your  imagination more than other games which I dont have a problem with and the writing for the game is great there is no voice acting but it did not bother me my only complaint would be dont buy this game for $15 wait till it goes on sale for like $5 in my opinion its not a $15 game, Shadowrun is a pretty damn simple game so just resist the urge to buy it for full price.

												Get this game if you want to practice your campaign making, whether for video games or DnD-like sessions. I got through both the Core Campaign(Dead Man's Switch) and the Dragonfall campaign, plus a few highly recommended fan-made campaigns, so I could get a feel of what I could do with the Editor. Dragonfall Campaign is REALLY good by the by. This editor is just maddening with the amount of stuff you can put into it. Completely free to write whatever, answers the players can choose from, map, tile, and prop placement. You can get damn creative with it. Whether you want to just run campaigns(Which you can get from Nexusmods or Steam Workshop easily enough), or create them, this Hobbit recommends this game.			"

												Shadowrun Returns original campaign:This is a very nice Shadowrun based game, with a good story and gameplay. However, it is a short game and as soon as you learn how to optimize the character skills (and the enemies AI failures...) it is an easy game, even in the very hard mode. Also, it is an extremely linear game, not giving you any options besides the main track of the story. Still, it is a great game and I strongly recommend it to shadowrun lovers, such as myself.Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall:This expansion package brings a very interesting and amusing story line. Definetively worth playing if you liked Shadowrun Returns original campaign. Note that it is not a continuation of the original campaing - you cannot bring your old character into this new campaign - altough some small references can be seem during the game. It is worth mentioning that this campaign is a little longer than Shadowrun Returns original campaign, but still a very linear game. Moreover, the dificulty level is higher than in the original campaign.			"

												I'm still haunted by the notion that non-JRPGs are icky and should be avoided (even though Bethesda proved otherwise).  On a lark, I bought this game and was instantly hooked.  Storytelling, soundtrack is top notch.  Graphics aren't really a thing for me, but I suppose this game's style would turn off some of the more graphics-loving members of the gaming community.  Besides that, get this game.  It's been a blast so far and I'm only halfway-ish through the standard campaign.			"

												If you've ever played 2nd Edition Shadowrun this is a huge nostalgia trip - if you haven't it's still damn fun.The majority of the game plays out like an old-school text-based RPG like Fallout (no voice actors required) and will have you investigating the death of an old friend through a variety of standard 2050s Seattle backdrops.Combat, when it happens, is very similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Each character has a set number of action points that they can use each turn to move, shoot, cast spells, control drones, etc. Normal difficulty shouldn't pose much of a threat (I think I've been killed twice) so once you have the mechanics of it down I'd suggest playing through on Hard or better.Slight spoiler for the main story: make sure you put some points into Shotguns.

												Shadowrun is cyberpunk meets fantasy, all mashed together with the kitchen sink thrown in. Character classes include shamans (clerics), street samurai (fighters, melee or gun-based), mages, adepts (magical martial arts fighters), deckers (computer hackers) and riggers (who control drone robots). Player character races include humans, orcs, trolls (extra large orcs), elves and dwarves.The world includes lots of fantasy monsters from spirits and giant scorpions to great dragons, and also plenty of security personnel itching to die at your hands.Decking (computer hacking), and the way computers and the Internet work in general, doesn't make any sense at all. But this is totally consistent with the Cyberpunk genre, which was generally written by people with no real computer knowledge. Inside Cyberspace, you battle ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures) and even Black ICE (ICE that can kill you in real life).I've played through the original plot of Shadowrun Returns (Deadman's Switch) and also Dragonfall. I thought that both games had really engaging stories, and were generally well-paced, had good dialogue and interesting characters. The scenes and themes fit well with a cyberpunk ""high tech, low life"" motif.Dead Man's Switch was very linear, with little more than dialog choices (nice answer, neutral answer, mean answer). Playing it is a lot like reading a good book that has interactive fight scenes and some inventory management.Dragonfall was less linear, with some limited ability for the player to make world-changing choices. The important decisions are all made more toward the end of the game, though. This may annoy you, or you may like it because it gives you the chance to load your game and try a different ending with only 5 minutes more investment. Also, Dragonfall has much more lively NPCs, which makes for a game that feels a bit more social and less isolating.That having been said, it's great that the stories are good, but 90% of your time in the game will be spent in fights. Almost all of the skills that you increase with experience (which Shadowrun calls ""karma"") are combat skills, although they have some limited utility in conversation (especially Charisma). All the equipment is combat or quest related.In Shadowrun, the fighting is turn-based, with each character on a side getting a turn (with 2 or 3 Action Points) before the next side gets to act. The huge array of options can be overwhelming, especially at first. Fighting takes place in a large variety of locales and against a wide variety of foes. Sometimes your opponents get a surprise turn against you, which can be very annoying if your main character is squishy (has few HPs), as you see the entire enemy team attack your character (who is not under cover) before you get to act. I was once killed outright this way without even having a chance to react. Fortunately, I had an item that automatically resuscitated me.The fighting in Shadowrun Returns can get pretty repetitive fairly quickly, though. Once I figured out the ideal strategy (see next paragraph), it was just a question of repeating the same operations every fight. The same strategy works every fight. The only variation is a bit of difference in tactical positioning depending on how the enemy is approaching you and the layout of cover. Take cover, buff your main damage dealers, and kill your opponents. If your opponents bunch up use grenades and area effect spells against them. Rince and repeat.SPOILER WARNING the best strategy is to take a mage and buy spells that do area effect damage or reduce AP. In a 1v1 duel you can easily steal all of your opponent's AP and just damage them every turn without ever being hurt. Other viable options include a rifle/shotgun specialist or a high-Intelligence decker/rigger. The melee characters are particularly underpowered. Use shamans as support to boost your main damage dealers with AP, HP and accuracy. SPOILER WARNING ENDThe game is a bit buggy. I frequently have trouble with character equipment, where items will switch in or out of my backpack spontaneously, or I'll see different items when in combat or out of combat. I've had rare situations where I click on a HUD button and my character moves on the map instead--wasting a turn. I encountered no critical bugs that crashed the game or prevented story completion, however.There are some usability issues. There doesn't seem to be any way to manage drone equipment. It can be awkward to manage objects found in the world, since only the character accessing the container can pick up the item, and outside of combat you only have control over your main character. The game often requires extra unecessary clicks, like when using abilities that can only be used on yourself, you're still forced to click on your sprite to self-select.Overall, I consider this game worth buying and playing, especially if you're a fan of computer role-playing games.

The combat isn't as deep as it is in either games, very story focused, lots of dialogue to read. If you don't mind having to read a lot of dialogue (It's comparable to some old cRPG's with the amount), then it's definitely for you.

To be honest I played the heck out of the original with my SEGA Genesis this game is different, but better. Feels like a Fallout 1/2 or an X-com in many ways.

This game may lack a crazy amount of depth in the combat but I've found the world, characters, plot, and dialogue to be more than enough to be enthalled for the last couple of days.

Fascinating world, interesting characters, tactical enough combat, intriguing story. Would buy again.Edit after 12 hours into it: still loving it. It's a linear story, but there's enough illusion of choice that it doesn't feel linear. Protips:1. Do not give your hired shadowrunners anything cool because they keep it after the mission is over! 2. Don't bother with hiring a dedicated decker. The story so far has dropped a free pro-decker in my lap each time I've really needed one.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is so damn likable that it's easy to overlook how mediocre it can be. The user interface is cumbersome and frequently doesn't let you do what you'd expect it would. It's janky in the way that you remember crusty old PC games used to be, except it's not charming by today's standards. The default campaign: Dead Man's Switch is unflinchingly linear and the game has some odd hitching issues. But it's ****ing cyberpunk! Despite the fact that the story goes off the rails in a rather magnificent way, Shadowrun Returns stays true to the Gibson-esque tone that you want from a cyberpunk RPG and more to the point, a sequel to the original Shadowrun. The writing is what you want from a Shadowrun game. The combat is ersatz-XCOM Enemy Unknown. I'd have a hard time calling Shadowrun Returns great, but if you're as starved as I am for its specific brand of dystopia, it's a decent fix.			"

												I highly recommend the Dragonfall update to Shadowrun Returns.  If you're not a Shadowrun fanatic and passed on the first offering, that's good. This new DLC/Campaign is a great place to start because it's a bigger, fuller, better realized game.  As far as RPGs go, this is a modern classic.  There are well-developed side-kicks, side-quests, and yes, side-arms (guns and cybernetic arms...lol? sorry.)  The characters and environment have that Baldur's Gate feel, not visually but in that they seem like people/places worth interracting with and even saving. I'm only about 6-7 hours in but it's worth recommending already.			"

												The original shadowrun for Sega was one of my favorate games of all time, and certainly my favorate cyberpunk game.  The amount of detail in world creation, plotline, and character development made the original game playable multiple times.Over a decade later, I was thrilled to see a sequel.  I found that the writing and plotlines were as original and immersive as the previous original.  Some things had changed, the graphics were slightly more detailed, the combat system different, and the world much smaller and more linear.  But the essence of the game, the style, and much more was enough to make the game a great experience.I was slightly disappointed at the small size of the game compared to the original, but have since discovered there will be additional content added.  Shadowrun Returns is certainly a great start, and I look forward to new content.			"

												Shadowrun Returns offers an enjoyable walk through a cyberpunk story, which grows larger than is really sensible.  This is a linear tale, presented in the form of the original Baulder's Gate games.  Players of games in this style may be left wanting from the gameplay.  Although the player has control over team mates in combat the player has no control over their skill point allocation and may only manage their own player in this way.  Further, there is not much variety to speak of in the combat.  I'm also warned by friends to not bother chosing to play a Decker (hacker class) one's self, as there is little opprotunity for the player to make use of this class's specialities.  Likewise, there are some conversational bonues in the Charisma attribute that can ignored altogether (I think I only saw ""Academic"" as a possible response category once).  I'd recommend this one for anyone itching for a Shadowrun experience, but with reservations.  I am hoping that Shadowrun: Dragonfall offers more depth in the gameplay.  I also just remembered that this was a Kickstarter project.  Great work from that perspective.  Here's hoping future installments keep up with the excellent story-telling and also satisfy more in the gameplay.			"

												Played the main campaign awhile ago and liked it well enough.  About 10 hours of gameplay.  I never played the tabletop version and so I'm no expert as to how closely the game remained tied to the specifics of that world, but the environment felt genuine and created a very interesting and captivating setting for the story.Main campaign is alright.  Game's not retail price and it shows.  UI and movement/cover systems are a little wonky.  Tactical combat system is a bit simplistic, as are the items and inventory management.  Everything feels just a bit... insubstantial.  Still, as I said before, the environment is interesting.  Decent music reminiscent of the old top-down Fallout games.  Game suffers from some bugs, primarily related to transition triggers (I.E. When something becomes searchable, or when an NPC shifts from neutral to enemy due to an event, things tend to go a bit off-kilter at times).  Also the original campaign suffers from a lack of a save system in favor of an uncontrollable checkpoint system that can result in some frustrating losses of progress.  You can see why they went this route -- trying to get you to just roll with the punches and accept imperfect outcomes -- but for perfectionists like me, that tends to be more irritating than provocative.Regarding the Dragonfall DLC, there are some significant improvements.  NPC characters are developed with greater depth and are generally more interesting and likeable.  Story feels more complex as well, and all of the little nuggets of Shadowrun lore strewn about are a welcome help to the immersion factor.  It is DLC though, meaning that most of the fundamental annoyances (transition trigger bugs, lag when controlling friendly NPCs not originally part of the party, Slightly sticky UI design, simplistic combat/inventory management and tactical combat system) are all still present.  Still, neither the main game nor the DLC are full retail price, so one gets what one pays for.  They did put in a quicksave function which, while not perfectly implemented, does get the job done.  Being able to save at will reduces the amount of progress you lose on the occasional progress-ending bug you may encounter.DLC is about 18-20 hours gameplay (granted I did a few things over for better outcomes).  The niggling complaints above aside, I really enjoyed it.  Good story, good NPC characters, good immersion level, and decent length for the cost.I guess my biggest complaint is that this isn't a AAA full retail title.  I would have liked to see a cleaner UI, a more complex tactical combat system, and a longer campaign.  The story was so well-written and the base environment so rich and interesting that I would have happily paid more for the opportunity to spend more time there.  Looking forward to any future DLC they may release.			"

It´s got great atmosphere, cool characters, well written dialogue and original storytelling, making up for it´s somewhat shallow gameplay and ""light"" RPG mechanics. Not even considering the SNES original, if you are a fan of games like Xcom, Fallout 1 & 2 or Arcanum you should pick this one up. It may not match the complexity of these titles, but it nails the same retro feel, for which it deserves a lot of credit and your time.			"

												An essential game for all fans of cyberpunk, sci-fi and fantasy, cRPGs or PnP, and turn-based gaming.  Shadowrun Returns: Dead Man's Switch is the first turn-based game I've played in what must be a decade and I'm thoroughly enjoying every moment of it, and I hear the Dragonfall campaign is even better and apparently much longer. The DMS campaign's story is tight, although linear, but the beautiful and lush art combines with the rich fictional world of the Shadowrun universe to make the world come alive, and serves as an excellent introduction into the world of cyberpunk. The editor ensures a steady stream of excellent player-made campaigns too, so if you have any inclination to try this game out you very likely won't regret it and will feel stupid for not trying it out sooner, if you're anything like me.

												Shadowrun is a long running series, starting in 1993 as a Nintendo action adventure game, it literally blew minds with its diverse story telling. It had everything; connecting your brain to the internet, street mages, mafia trolls, crazy ex-girlfriends. the game was later adapted into a paperback rpg that has had a relatively strong run. ( its in its 5th edition.)Shadowrun Returns; Deadmans switch and its superior, Dragonfall, takes place in 2070, about 10- 20 years after the events of original. Deadmens switch is an adventure through the city of Seattle, fighting through deadly cultist plots and drek crazy doctors you manage to avenge your old partner’s death. While dragonfall is and intricate story about investigating a mysterious force in berlin while your attempt to battle forces that would appose the flux state. I belive the game play is quite sharp for a turn based game, delivering multple layers of complexty with its various custom class archtypes (rigger, adept, shaman, samurai, mage, decker, ect) you can play a muscle mage, or a shooty hacker, or any combination there of. next there's the multiple layers of customization, from bio mods to specll selection you have a large library to chose from. I've thoroughly enojoyed my adventures in the dark, an impatienly await the coming additions.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is set in a fantastic, cyberpunk, distopian earth, where mega-coorporations are running the show, drug dealers roam the streets, and mercenary adventurers, called ""shadowrunners"" take on dangerous work for the highest bidder. On top of everything else, magic has returned to the world, which puts a novel spin on the whole cyberpunk setup.This game has a brilliant atmosphere, captivating from the start, pulling you into the dirty streets of a blade-runner-ish seattle, and putting you into the skin of a shadow runner. Shadowrun returns features a great story, with lots of twists and reminds me of the Torment due to its emphasis on dialogue, rather than battles. On the downside it's very linear, with only a couple of occasional options for side-quests. But this is not necessarily that bad, because it focuses on the plot and tells the story without infinite distractions and pointless errants.Highly recomended for RPG fans who are not aversed to exploring a futuristic, cyberpunk world, very similar to the worlds of Gibson's ""the neuromancer"", or Stephenson's ""snowcrash"" but still very unique in its own right.

												Got this on a sale. LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT! Although RPG lovers, don't be fooled. It looks and acts like Baldur's Gate, but plays like Final Fantasy, as in, it's a turn based RPG.You wouldn't be able to tell that from the trailer but don't let that put you off. Was an immensely enjoyable experience although I have to say that it was a bit too short :( and the expansion is pricey! If you were a big BG fan and loved picking up side quests, there aren't that many in this game unfortunately.It's a click heavy game and the mouse interface isn't as responsive as it should be but I think they're going to fix this in a new patch.Another great thing about the game is that it comes with a custom content editor. If you love RPGs with guns, magic, great graphics and good writing, this game is definitely for you.			"

												An outstanding RPG, particularly in the expansion campaign.  Old-school, to be sure, but the environment feels lived-in, the characters entertaining.  The dialogue trees allow for you to really get into the persona of your runner.  The combat is an interesting puzzle, but, as befits a shadowrunner, avoiding combat, or searching through the environment can be yet more engaging.  It already has a few excellent user-generated shadowruns (though, like anything that allows fan creation, there's drek out there as well), and the editor should allow for yet more in the future.  Strongly recommend.			"

												To clarify, what this is not, is a sprawling open-world RPG with endless space to explore and fight and level up with the same character until you become and unstoppable behemoth that Blizzard is targeting premium content at on a daily basis. If you want that, look elsewhere.Yes the graphics are a little retro, personally it works for me, it may not for everyone, if it doesn’t for you - since there are a huge number of videos and photos available to see before purchasing the game, I find whining about it a little childish, no?What this is, is a fun and engaging storyline and an amazing opportunity for user generated content to provide a huge wealth of different experiences. To challenge yourself to find different solutions and to challenge yourself to myriad different play styles.The user generated content will get there, and when it does, there will be so much to this game (that the studio could never have afforded to produce) that I foresee loosing many many hours blissfully jacked in.If you doubt any of this look at the amount of user generated content for the dungeon crawler Legend of Gimrock, what you buy is a single campaign that takes a day or so to complete, what you get access to is a vast wealth of user generated dungeons created by people who, with the intricacy of their level design and fiendishness of their traps and puzzles, make the guy in the Saw films look like he really wasn't trying. If that can happen with this game (which I’m sure it will so long as the level creation and modding tools are there) it will be awesome.			"

												This has been an interesting experience! Isometric RPGs have been rapidly winning my heart back even since ME 3 and this one was a fresh change from the normal recipe.The skill system is nicely portrayed, gameplay is fun and with a lot of choices and the story brilliant enough to keep you invested ( don't expect crazy or unexpected plot twists here ) My two major cons here are the general linearity of the game , which doesn't allow much on the exploration department and the lack of plentiful side quests (which probably goes side by side with my first complain) This game CRIES for side questing and the characters it introduces are SO WELL portrayed that it's arguably a crime that there is no further development with them or some involving quests to further enjoy them in action (Coyote's quest for example should have been done for more characters!) There is your occasional side quest , but they are SOOO few that it makes you feel sad moving on to the next chapter like this. Finally i was REALLY bummed by the length of the main campaign .. I mean okay i understand that you guys were betting on the UGC (user generated content) to maximize replayability but really that short ??? You could have made an at least +20 hours on the Dead man's switch . Oh well..Pros:+ Beautiful Skill system+ Fun Gameplay+ Enjoyable storyCons:- Too Linear (for an RPG)- Very few side quests - Main campaign TOO BLOODY SHORT!All in all did i fully enjoy this game?

												I just finished ""Dead Man's Switch"" of Shadowrun Returns and I really enjoyed it. Just a heads up before my review, the main reason I purchased this game is because I used to play the table top version of Shadowrun back in highschool. Just the product's name brings back great memories and my review (and enjoyment of the game) of course is partially biased due to this background. Here is a quick review for those interested in the title:What is ""Dead Man's Switch""?Think of Shadowrun Returns as the client, and DMS as the story you plug into it. There is also a DLC that I've purchased but not started yet that is another story for Shadowrun Returns. I'm hoping they will continue to support this product! Game Mechanics:Smooth, easy to learn, and well done. The game plays like the first Fallouts or the Baldur's Gate series as an overhead tactical turn-based gameplay. With that said you do not need any prior experience with this type of game to enjoy Shadowrun Returns. The menu, UI, and rpg elements are all straight forward. The only thing that bothered me about the combat UI was reloading my rifle, however I'm sure there was a hotkey I could've used. Story vs. Action:The biggest compliant I saw on my own research of this game prior to purchase was the amount of dialog. The team that created this game obviously aimed to reproduce a table-top setting that focused primarily on storytelling, not combat. There are plently of short engagements throughout this product and I felt the combat was very satisifying. However, if you are the type that clicks quickly though dialog in other games you won't be impressed with this title. The best part of this game is the story and for those don't care about that and just want an action / adventure title should look elsewhere. If you have any direct questions please comment below! I just wanted to hit those two points since they I felt they were not communicated well in other reviews.			"

												Shadowrun was a breath of fresh air for me.IAmongst hordes of MOBAs and shooters, an classic RPG like Shadowrun definetly stands out. Intriguing setting, fusion between science fiction and fantasy create an unique noir-ish atmosphere of futuristic coroprate-ruled world. The closest game to this that has been released recently is probably only Deus Ex: Human Revolution.Great writing, beautiful system and stylish graphics makes you wish to play it again and again. However, main campaign, while   engagin and entertaining is relatively short. Luckily, with the integration of Steam Workshop, that could become a reality, with steady flow of well-crafted user-created content. Can't wait to play it again in my free time.9/10.			"

The story when from Neon SIgn pointing at the bad guy, to out of left field plot line.  Noire, Mystery was lacking to this cyberpunk story.NPC AI was alittle buggy every now and then.  A few times the Enemy NPC ran to an empty room then ran back, and they would switch targets when your health got low.

												I love RPG's, always have. And this game is no different. It has a fantastic combat system, an immersive story, and some cracking dialogue, not to mention the setting itself being something to truly marvel at. That being said, an RPG should have replayability, and without purchasing or downloading an additional story, replayability is something that I feel this game sorely lacks.Don't get me wrong, I recommend this game, it's enjoyable and you will find yourself drawn into the story, but it's one of those games that you will play through once, think its neat, and maybe sit there wondering ""what next?""*Please bear in mind that my review is based soley on the preloaded story 'Dead Man's Switch'. I have not yet played 'Dragonfall' and very much look forward to playing through that story arc.			"

												You might look at this game and sneer at it's graphics or gameplay, but the simple truth is that the sheer potential of the Shadowrun Universe and the modding community raises the lasting value ten or twenty fold. Most of my play time has been spent playing workshop content rather than the official campaigns.Recommend you buy the Dragon Fall DLC, the campaign is excellent (vastly superior to the original Dead Man's Switch) and the new functionalities added to the engine are used in a lot of the workshop content.Must own for any Shadowrun fun out there, and anyone with an interest in great story telling and lore should check it out.

What the game lacks in eye-popping graphics (while it has good design and looks, it's not a showcase for your graphics card), it more than makes up for in atmosphere. The story is engaging, and very well written. The combat is not too difficult, but there are a few moments that provide a challenge.Above all else, play it for the story and writing.

												A really entertaining game with quite a bit of user generated content, and only one problem.The first scenario, Dead Man's Switch is very well written-if a little predictable for those familiar with the genre, but if you want all of the loot, you'll have to put a lot of points in Decking. The Charisma required to haggle makes some sense, but one of the great things about Shadowrun is the crew you work with filling in gaps in each others' skills.Want to be a Technomage or Rigger-Shaman hybrid? Cool. Want to be able to get all of the loot? Still need to unload a lot of points in Decking because you, not your team, will be the one cracking locks to get to it.The combat system is adapted fairly well from the tabletop.			"

												I was a huge fan of the SNES Shadowrun game.  This new game not only is a worthy follow-up, but a true sequel!  Shadowrun Returns improves on all the shortcomings SNES players had to tolerate, as well as bringing the game into the modern age.  For a budget game especially, everything about this game is well balanced.  The hand-drawn graphics are slick and the lighting is pretty and immersive.  Character development is satisfying and the story is truly interesting and perfect for the world of Shadowrun.The only aspects of this game that reveal its price tag are the limited sound effects, character art and voice dialogue.  But let's be honest - how much more often do voice-overs ruin a game?  Besides, the core of the game is true and enjoyable, the limited art is beautiul and detailed, and the action is as polished as the latest X-Com game (which is also a treat.)  Do yourself a favor: if you've never played Shadowrun for the SNES, give this a try.  And if you loved the SNES game as much as I, you will not be disappointed.  Either way, GET THIS GAME!			"

												Pros:1. Very creaive world and atmosphere2. Combat although basic sparks great emotion within you3. Great story telling, not talkin about the murder mystery part, it was kinda ehh, but♥♥♥♥♥♥always gets worse and more dark as you progress4. As the game progresses characters open up to you more, spawning interesting personalities 5. Great character customization, I have never played a Dwarf Mage that wielded a shotgun, had a cybernetic eye and had the lingo of a gang member.Cons:1. Random spikes of difficulty, i mean the rest was a cake walk except these two parts, which i had to redo 10 times each2. No voice acting, kind of a bummer but youll get used to the reading3. after engaging in battle, sometimes i get stuck into the combat movement system which makes exploration a lot more time costly4. Some bugs were encountered, including gramatical, and in one instance i had finally finished the second battle that had the massive difficulty spike, which took an hour, and the guy that we were supposed to talk to after, we couldn't talk to. Causing me to have to retry the battle over, and over, and over5. Doesn't explain the universe very well, started off pretty new to the universe, when they start dropping words like SINless, Wiz(Not like a computer wiz), Null Sweat, chummer, drek, omae, Renraku etc. You kinda figure it out with time but it seems like it was primarily made for the board game fans			"

												This is a really nice game that is similar to the old style of adventure games like Baldur's Gate and Fallout, the dialogue and narritive writing is detailed and very fun to read becausr the author spends time on describing intricate details of a scene and ties it together into a readable flow which you don't normally find nowadays in games for storytelling.I'm only 5 hours in and I'm enjoying the writing as much as I do the gameplay itself, it is an RPG with turn-based combat, a feature which the game has taken from the old styled RPGs is the one where your custom designed character has a set of attribute points which are used for calculating results in combat as well as being useful when exploring or dialogue situations  (my character is good at hacking computers so I can open doors and access areas which would otherwise be inaccessible to me if I didn't have the correct skill points). Another thing this game is like is Mass Effect because it wants to combine the traditional fantasy RPG style of magic with a more modern/futuristic style of technology and and it does it pretty well.The only downside to this game is that it isnt a fully voiced game and I sometimes get tired of reading a lot of text when I'm interviewing someone for information, only a small portion of the dialogue is voiced which would make the game more immersive for me.

												GRAPHICS:  The difference between the 3D character models and the 2D backdrops and portraits really couldn't be greater.  The backgrounds of this game really help set the ambiance, being very dreary, weathered, and overall unpleasant.  The game occasionally contrasts this with very nice areas, but only to emphasize the feel of how dirty and unkempt the rest of the game world is.  All the praise and honors I give the 2D artists I would take from the 3D designers.  The characters are incredibly low-poly.  Think somewhere around Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64.  There definitely could have been improvements in the quality of the models.  That being said, you walk into this game knowing it isn't exactly Crysis.  The game's focus is in getting you into the story.  And it does that exceedingly well.REVIEW: Overall, I am having a lot of fun playing this.  The game has a really good story and a fantastic environment that really holds itself together, even with new plot points and characters introducing themselves.  It's very reminiscent of Deus Ex in it's view of the not-quite-near future, and I found myself wandering all around the game, talking to the people because I wanted to, not because I had to.  Conversations options are plentiful, not just a ""Yes, I will do the mission"" or ""Not now"".  You can be an♥♥♥♥♥to people, or you can kiss it.  Conversation options unlock if you have a certain amount of skill points in that specific area, much like the Fallout series.  If you are able to say the unlocked option, it usually helps you out with better prices or more specific information.One of my favorite aspects of the game was the fact that not all of the game was accessible because of the class I chose.  I am a hacker class, but I poured too many stat-points into combat.  This locked me out of rooms I could have gained access to if I had more hacking skill.  It enhances replayability by quite a bit.  Another element was the different fighting styles and the enhancements you can unlock.  The game seems designed to cater to specializing in one or two unique skill paths, or else you don't really get many fun abilities in combat and conversation.  This is not a bad thing by any means, but there is that feeling of regret when you see a skill you really want in a skill tree you haven't invested in.The combat is tile and turn-based.  It found quite a bit like the new X-COM combat, but without permadeath, and more weapon options.  It also resembles Fallout combat in some ways.I have always found point-and-click games tedious and fetch-questy.  Many of these games say to the developer ""Hey, we have a game that you could reasonably complete in a couple hours.  Milk three more hours out of it."" Shadowrun Returns respects the player's time.  I never noticed myself retracing my steps or stopping playing because I didn't want to ""go all the way back there"" in-game. It's much more movie-esque, where the next big scene/event is at the destination, not right where you are after you collect the three Orbs of Annoyance and Plot Forgetting from three obnoxiously far-apart places in game.  I'd really recommend this game, and for people who really enjoy a good story, you can't miss it.  Personally I enjoy taking my time and soaking in the game.  The story is great, and I really enjoy the conversations as well as combat.  This may not be your cup of tea, though.  If you power through the game, you'll miss all the good stuff and find it lacking polish.  But the fun of this game does not give itself away, you have to lose yourself in it to find it.For me, 9/10.			"

												Let's get one important thing out of the way: Shadowrun Returns *needs* the Dragonfall DLC. [EDIT: Now that Dragonfall can be purchased standalone, this game has no real reason to exist] Without it, you're doomed to a story-on-rails campaign built to satisfy gun-monkeys and leave less combat-oriented classes in the dust, to say nothing of an inferior save system.Basically, Dead Man's Switch should be considered bonus content. Dragonfall is the real game.And what a game it is. Characters feel real, like they've been lived in for a while, not just plopped all one-dimensional and tabula rasa into the story. They have motivations, interesting origins, disagreements, and so on. They feel like actual people. And those people breathe life into the story -- a conspiracy yarn full of magic, intrigue, and high-tech low-lives. Choices are difficult. There's often a clear division between the morally right and wrong choices, but the consequences muddy it up. Is it better to spare some schlub for the sake of conscience if missing a payday means you can't stop far greater evil down the line?Combat is kind of a stripped-down X-Com affair with turnbased isometric squad stuff. It's serviceable, but the real treat is the writing.			"

This game is better that I expected AAA level RPG. One note this game is not voiced, is the ye olde king of read text, luckily for you, dialogs are not that long. "

												To clarify, what this is not, is a sprawling open-world RPG with endless space to explore and fight and level up with the same character until you become and unstoppable behemoth that Blizzard is targeting premium content at on a daily basis. If you want that, look elsewhere.Yes the graphics are a little retro, personally it works for me, it may not for everyone, if it doesn’t for you - since there are a huge number of videos and photos available to see before purchasing the game, I find whining about it a little childish, no?What this is, is a fun and engaging storyline and an amazing opportunity for user generated content to provide a huge wealth of different experiences. To challenge yourself to find different solutions and to challenge yourself to myriad different play styles.The user generated content will get there, and when it does, there will be so much to this game (that the studio could never have afforded to produce) that I foresee loosing many many hours blissfully jacked in.If you doubt any of this look at the amount of user generated content for the dungeon crawler Legend of Gimrock, what you buy is a single campaign that takes a day or so to complete, what you get access to is a vast wealth of user generated dungeons created by people who, with the intricacy of their level design and fiendishness of their traps and puzzles, make the guy in the Saw films look like he really wasn't trying. If that can happen with this game (which I’m sure it will so long as the level creation and modding tools are there) it will be awesome.			"

Physical Adepts are very different, but still vialable and even fun.  They also are balanced even in stock format.  Both Deadman's Switch and Dragonfall are wonderful campaigns and great fun.			"

												Thanks to XCOM: Enemy Unknown I was willing to give Isometric RPG's another shot. I've been enjoying this game a lot in short doses, I'm kind of using it as a primer for when Wasteland 2 is officially released. But it's a solid kickstarter game that I've heard has improvements made on it Dragonfall. If you like descriptive walls of text, neon, cyberpunk, turnbased combat, and deeper RPG elements than some games released nowadays this is a no brainer, especially at it's frequently low prices on an already budget selling point.8/10			"

												I just finished ""Dead Man's Switch"" of Shadowrun Returns and I really enjoyed it. Just a heads up before my review, the main reason I purchased this game is because I used to play the table top version of Shadowrun back in highschool. Just the product's name brings back great memories and my review (and enjoyment of the game) of course is partially biased due to this background. Here is a quick review for those interested in the title:What is ""Dead Man's Switch""?Think of Shadowrun Returns as the client, and DMS as the story you plug into it. There is also a DLC that I've purchased but not started yet that is another story for Shadowrun Returns. I'm hoping they will continue to support this product! Game Mechanics:Smooth, easy to learn, and well done. The game plays like the first Fallouts or the Baldur's Gate series as an overhead tactical turn-based gameplay. With that said you do not need any prior experience with this type of game to enjoy Shadowrun Returns. The menu, UI, and rpg elements are all straight forward. The only thing that bothered me about the combat UI was reloading my rifle, however I'm sure there was a hotkey I could've used. Story vs. Action:The biggest compliant I saw on my own research of this game prior to purchase was the amount of dialog. The team that created this game obviously aimed to reproduce a table-top setting that focused primarily on storytelling, not combat. There are plently of short engagements throughout this product and I felt the combat was very satisifying. However, if you are the type that clicks quickly though dialog in other games you won't be impressed with this title. The best part of this game is the story and for those don't care about that and just want an action / adventure title should look elsewhere. If you have any direct questions please comment below! I just wanted to hit those two points since they I felt they were not communicated well in other reviews.			"

												Shadowrun was a breath of fresh air for me.IAmongst hordes of MOBAs and shooters, an classic RPG like Shadowrun definetly stands out. Intriguing setting, fusion between science fiction and fantasy create an unique noir-ish atmosphere of futuristic coroprate-ruled world. The closest game to this that has been released recently is probably only Deus Ex: Human Revolution.Great writing, beautiful system and stylish graphics makes you wish to play it again and again. However, main campaign, while   engagin and entertaining is relatively short. Luckily, with the integration of Steam Workshop, that could become a reality, with steady flow of well-crafted user-created content. Can't wait to play it again in my free time.9/10.			"

												It's ok....I wish the story did not hold your hand like it did. They should of when with more Hitchcock and less Southpark Crab people.  The story when from Neon SIgn pointing at the bad guy, to out of left field plot line.  Noire, Mystery was lacking to this cyberpunk story.NPC AI was alittle buggy every now and then.  A few times the Enemy NPC ran to an empty room then ran back, and they would switch targets when your health got low.  Again to much hand holding, even on Hard.Graphics was nice and clean, but seeing the same character models on every corner was heartbreaking for this Kickstarter game that promise to bring back the good ole days.

												This is a decent little RPG with combat that feels quite similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown. I wish they had fleshed it out a bit more as it kinda feels like a mobile version of an isometric RPG, almost like a flash game, (though very advanced for flash). This is largely due to limited character customization and costuming options, low poly character models, and there's not much in the way of loot or exploration. You don't really search through things for loot, ect. For some this will be a bonus. For me it's a let down. I like having little rewards peppered around the environment giving me positive feedback for all my efforts at exploration. Instead I get very few and just explore every inch I can just because I can.Apparently the DLC is supposed to be better than the main campaign as well, though I haven't tried it yet.			"

												You might look at this game and sneer at it's graphics or gameplay, but the simple truth is that the sheer potential of the Shadowrun Universe and the modding community raises the lasting value ten or twenty fold. Most of my play time has been spent playing workshop content rather than the official campaigns.Recommend you buy the Dragon Fall DLC, the campaign is excellent (vastly superior to the original Dead Man's Switch) and the new functionalities added to the engine are used in a lot of the workshop content.Must own for any Shadowrun fun out there, and anyone with an interest in great story telling and lore should check it out.

												A really entertaining game with quite a bit of user generated content, and only one problem.The first scenario, Dead Man's Switch is very well written-if a little predictable for those familiar with the genre, but if you want all of the loot, you'll have to put a lot of points in Decking. The Charisma required to haggle makes some sense, but one of the great things about Shadowrun is the crew you work with filling in gaps in each others' skills.Want to be a Technomage or Rigger-Shaman hybrid? Cool. Want to be able to get all of the loot? Still need to unload a lot of points in Decking because you, not your team, will be the one cracking locks to get to it.The combat system is adapted fairly well from the tabletop.			"

This new DLC/Campaign is a great place to start because it's a bigger, fuller, better realized game.  As far as RPGs go, this is a modern classic.  There are well-developed side-kicks, side-quests, and yes, side-arms (guns and cybernetic arms...lol? sorry.)  The characters and environment have that Baldur's Gate feel, not visually but in that they seem like people/places worth interracting with and even saving. I'm only about 6-7 hours in but it's worth recommending already.			"

Isometric RPGs have been rapidly winning my heart back even since ME 3 and this one was a fresh change from the normal recipe.The skill system is nicely portrayed, gameplay is fun and with a lot of choices and the story brilliant enough to keep you invested ( don't expect crazy or unexpected plot twists here ) My two major cons here are the general linearity of the game , which doesn't allow much on the exploration department and the lack of plentiful side quests (which probably goes side by side with my first complain) This game CRIES for side questing and the characters it introduces are SO WELL portrayed that it's arguably a crime that there is no further development with them or some involving quests to further enjoy them in action (Coyote's quest for example should have been done for more characters!) There is your occasional side quest , but they are SOOO few that it makes you feel sad moving on to the next chapter like this. Finally i was REALLY bummed by the length of the main campaign .. I mean okay i understand that you guys were betting on the UGC (user generated content) to maximize replayability but really that short ??? You could have made an at least +20 hours on the Dead man's switch . Oh well..Pros:+ Beautiful Skill system+ Fun Gameplay+ Enjoyable storyCons:- Too Linear (for an RPG)- Very few side quests - Main campaign TOO BLOODY SHORT!All in all did i fully enjoy this game?

There are plently of short engagements throughout this product and I felt the combat was very satisifying. However, if you are the type that clicks quickly though dialog in other games you won't be impressed with this title. The best part of this game is the story and for those don't care about that and just want an action / adventure title should look elsewhere. If you have any direct questions please comment below! I just wanted to hit those two points since they I felt they were not communicated well in other reviews.			"

												This ain't your nephew's Dragon Age 2 or Witcher. Instead of going for needless voice-overs and cheesy cutscenes, this game aims purely for great dialogue - in written form. For the uninformed, dialogue in written form is a tradition which had been going on for many, many centuries.What you're getting here is an Old School western RPG, very reminiscent of the first two Fallout games. It shares two of their biggest strengths - great writing and interesting setting. The biggest detriment is that the gameplay here follows an extremely linear plot. That wouldn't be so bad, if the game also didn't feel so short. It's absolutely adequate for the price you're paying, but you can't help but feel like there's something missing when you arrive at the end. However, that may just be, again, because of the very, very good writing.Despite the fact that barely any dialogue choices and actions has a greater impact on the story, this game inspires one to play through it again with different characters and mindsets - just to read all the NPCs' reactions to all the dialogue choices. I can't stress that point enough. Some people notice the difference between 'okay' writing and great writing, and some think of AAA titles as high art.DRAGONFALL DLC:Dragonfall, in two words: Pretty amazing. For me, what really makes Dragonfall stand out in comparison with the original campaign, is the difference in plot structure.For one thing, the game is much less linear. There are several missions to do in the middle section of the game; these can be done in any order you want, and it's entirely possible to skip one (maybe even two) of those missions.Another major improvement is the fact that companions stick with you and are there to talk to after every mission. There are more than enough of these permanent companions hanging around that you never have the need fore hired companions. The original campaign had a great variety of interesting characters who would accompany you for a mission or two; here, they stick around and have new dialogue after every major mission. There's character development, and in the end, there's even closure.Which brings me to the ending. Bluntly put, it's really, really good - enough to be a major point in this review. While the original campaign left you no choice in the end and the feeling of closure was kinda missing, Dragonfall delivers both in the end, and it does so very, very excellently, too. You are not only given a very meaningful choice which has the potency to shape the future of the setting, but the consequences of that choice are also portrayed adequately. After the end of the game, you are given one more chance to talk to every NPC of the main hub, every one of your companions and even new NPCs, depending on your choice. There's closure for every character and your choice is possibly being questioned in some of the best dialogue of the game. But, lastly, the best thing about this DLC is that it delivers more of the old. Shadowrun shines when you get to interact with strong characters and are given absolutely free reign - the first Harlequin dialogue from the original campaign comes to mind - and there is much of that, here.

												Get this game if you want to practice your campaign making, whether for video games or DnD-like sessions. I got through both the Core Campaign(Dead Man's Switch) and the Dragonfall campaign, plus a few highly recommended fan-made campaigns, so I could get a feel of what I could do with the Editor. Dragonfall Campaign is REALLY good by the by. This editor is just maddening with the amount of stuff you can put into it. Completely free to write whatever, answers the players can choose from, map, tile, and prop placement. You can get damn creative with it. Whether you want to just run campaigns(Which you can get from Nexusmods or Steam Workshop easily enough), or create them, this Hobbit recommends this game.			"

												Shadowrun Returns original campaign:This is a very nice Shadowrun based game, with a good story and gameplay. However, it is a short game and as soon as you learn how to optimize the character skills (and the enemies AI failures...) it is an easy game, even in the very hard mode. Also, it is an extremely linear game, not giving you any options besides the main track of the story. Still, it is a great game and I strongly recommend it to shadowrun lovers, such as myself.Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall:This expansion package brings a very interesting and amusing story line. Definetively worth playing if you liked Shadowrun Returns original campaign. Note that it is not a continuation of the original campaing - you cannot bring your old character into this new campaign - altough some small references can be seem during the game. It is worth mentioning that this campaign is a little longer than Shadowrun Returns original campaign, but still a very linear game. Moreover, the dificulty level is higher than in the original campaign.			"

												I highly recommend the Dragonfall update to Shadowrun Returns.  If you're not a Shadowrun fanatic and passed on the first offering, that's good. This new DLC/Campaign is a great place to start because it's a bigger, fuller, better realized game.  As far as RPGs go, this is a modern classic.  There are well-developed side-kicks, side-quests, and yes, side-arms (guns and cybernetic arms...lol? sorry.)  The characters and environment have that Baldur's Gate feel, not visually but in that they seem like people/places worth interracting with and even saving. I'm only about 6-7 hours in but it's worth recommending already.			"

												The original shadowrun for Sega was one of my favorate games of all time, and certainly my favorate cyberpunk game.  The amount of detail in world creation, plotline, and character development made the original game playable multiple times.Over a decade later, I was thrilled to see a sequel.  I found that the writing and plotlines were as original and immersive as the previous original.  Some things had changed, the graphics were slightly more detailed, the combat system different, and the world much smaller and more linear.  But the essence of the game, the style, and much more was enough to make the game a great experience.I was slightly disappointed at the small size of the game compared to the original, but have since discovered there will be additional content added.  Shadowrun Returns is certainly a great start, and I look forward to new content.			"

												Shadowrun Returns offers an enjoyable walk through a cyberpunk story, which grows larger than is really sensible.  This is a linear tale, presented in the form of the original Baulder's Gate games.  Players of games in this style may be left wanting from the gameplay.  Although the player has control over team mates in combat the player has no control over their skill point allocation and may only manage their own player in this way.  Further, there is not much variety to speak of in the combat.  I'm also warned by friends to not bother chosing to play a Decker (hacker class) one's self, as there is little opprotunity for the player to make use of this class's specialities.  Likewise, there are some conversational bonues in the Charisma attribute that can ignored altogether (I think I only saw ""Academic"" as a possible response category once).  I'd recommend this one for anyone itching for a Shadowrun experience, but with reservations.  I am hoping that Shadowrun: Dragonfall offers more depth in the gameplay.  I also just remembered that this was a Kickstarter project.  Great work from that perspective.  Here's hoping future installments keep up with the excellent story-telling and also satisfy more in the gameplay.			"

												Now, to start off, I feel the need to tell you that I have been playing RPGs since the late 1970's. About 4 years ago, I was introduced to the tabletop miniature game, ""Necromunda"". It's a fastpaced cyberpunk-style game with various gangs. I liked it and yet, found it missing a few things.I love Adv. D&D too. Now.. combining Necromunda with AD&D.. hmmm... I love the movie,""Blade Runner""... With all that, throwing them all in a pot and stirring... Amazement!!! The result,Shadowrun!!!  This game has it all for me! Now, I'm so involved in this game, I had to grab the DLCfor it. Do I recommend this game? yup!			"

												Played the main campaign awhile ago and liked it well enough.  About 10 hours of gameplay.  I never played the tabletop version and so I'm no expert as to how closely the game remained tied to the specifics of that world, but the environment felt genuine and created a very interesting and captivating setting for the story.Main campaign is alright.  Game's not retail price and it shows.  UI and movement/cover systems are a little wonky.  Tactical combat system is a bit simplistic, as are the items and inventory management.  Everything feels just a bit... insubstantial.  Still, as I said before, the environment is interesting.  Decent music reminiscent of the old top-down Fallout games.  Game suffers from some bugs, primarily related to transition triggers (I.E. When something becomes searchable, or when an NPC shifts from neutral to enemy due to an event, things tend to go a bit off-kilter at times).  Also the original campaign suffers from a lack of a save system in favor of an uncontrollable checkpoint system that can result in some frustrating losses of progress.  You can see why they went this route -- trying to get you to just roll with the punches and accept imperfect outcomes -- but for perfectionists like me, that tends to be more irritating than provocative.Regarding the Dragonfall DLC, there are some significant improvements.  NPC characters are developed with greater depth and are generally more interesting and likeable.  Story feels more complex as well, and all of the little nuggets of Shadowrun lore strewn about are a welcome help to the immersion factor.  It is DLC though, meaning that most of the fundamental annoyances (transition trigger bugs, lag when controlling friendly NPCs not originally part of the party, Slightly sticky UI design, simplistic combat/inventory management and tactical combat system) are all still present.  Still, neither the main game nor the DLC are full retail price, so one gets what one pays for.  They did put in a quicksave function which, while not perfectly implemented, does get the job done.  Being able to save at will reduces the amount of progress you lose on the occasional progress-ending bug you may encounter.DLC is about 18-20 hours gameplay (granted I did a few things over for better outcomes).  The niggling complaints above aside, I really enjoyed it.  Good story, good NPC characters, good immersion level, and decent length for the cost.I guess my biggest complaint is that this isn't a AAA full retail title.  I would have liked to see a cleaner UI, a more complex tactical combat system, and a longer campaign.  The story was so well-written and the base environment so rich and interesting that I would have happily paid more for the opportunity to spend more time there.  Looking forward to any future DLC they may release.			"

												The original game is an excellent RPG with exceptional storytelling. The first DLC expansion, ""Dragonfall,"" is a work of art. I found myself worrying about my companions emotional lives during a run, and I looked forward to coming home to our safehouse and wandering the neighborhood to chat with the locals as much or more than speculating on what our next action-packed job might entail. I actually teared up at the terrible beauty of the entirely unexpected conclusion, and unlike most of my favorite games, Dragonfall didn't leave wanting more, because the ending fit--perfectly. I am, however, eagerly awaiting any future Shadowrun installments from Harebrained Schemes. After this, their RPG work is on my buy-on-release list.			"

												I enjoyed this game very much. I'm a sucker for the cyberpunk genre, and I really thought Shadowrun was due for a reboot. It's just flat out one of the coolest takes on it that I've seen. This game is not perfect, it's a little bit linear in places, but there are a lot of ways to play it out and personally I think the atmosphere and the story make up for what it might lack in the greater scheme of things. I should also mention that I am writing this AFTER completing Dragonfall, which took a large step in the right direction. Even still I would recommend this game. If Dragonfall never existed I would still be glad I bought this and would give it a big thumbs up.			"

												You! Yes, you.  You like fantasy RPGs? You like strategy games? You like Sci-Fi? Ever wanted to mash 'em together into a delicous nerd smoothie?  Then do we have a product for you.If you're an XCOM fan, the mechanics are pretty straightforward to you.  Honestly, Shadowrun Returns as simply a game is good, but not great.  The Karma system for leveling allows you to customize your character however you like with no limitations on class, though you'll want to specialize as you approach endgame.However, Shadowrun Returns -- Shadowrun as a whole -- is so much more than a game.  It's a living, breathing world; a technologically heightened and magic-infused setting for stories of any kind.  Plots might hinge on the epic and esoteric (dangerous research into blood magic by a ruthless, profit-hungry megacorp) or the throwback noir with a twist (being hired by a dead man to find his murderer).  Sure, most of the RP of this RPG happens via old-school plain text, but you know what they call plain text in most places? Books. It ain't broke, so don't fix it!Character creation remains fun to me, even after a few playthroughs.  It's pretty neat to tell your friends about your human shaman/street samurai who packs enough heat to take on a militia even before summoning his elemental spirits.  Or about your pink-haired elvish techno-wiz equally at home jacking into corporate Matrix blocks or rigging into her homemade combat drones with her very mind.  Moreover, the skills your character chooses will assist them outside of combat, unlocking alternate routes, hidden passages with loot, chances to solve a problem diplomatically (with added EXP!), and more.The campaign that ships with the game, Dead Man's Switch, is a bit short but satisfying nonetheless.  It's an excellent introduction to the Shadowrun world, and veterans of the series will even see a few familiar faces.  Dragonfall, the DLC whose remastered version will drop tomorrow, is just plain phenomenal.  And that's not even touching the free Steamworks fan-made campaigns, some of which are truly brilliant.  Harebrained Schemes, the devs of Shadowrun Returns, have reminded us that a great game doesn't need 60 fps or 360-noscopes. You just need solid mechanics, a fascinating setting, and some hardcore writing chops.Be sure to check out the pen-and-paper Shadowrun RPG, too!			"

												I've played this game for ten hours before I eventually got too frustrated and uninstalled.What I thought when I first encountered it was a misstep, (the lack of any save/load game feature), turned into a death knell -- you WILL reach moments in the game, where despite your best planning you are left in the worst condition you could be and are unable to continue.In a typical RPG, you would restore to an autosave or a quicksave or otherwise from somewhere earlier on and roll the dice again, presumably to try and get a better result from a combat sequence -- you'd be free to because a regular game recognises the mutability of each instance of combat and provides you that opportunity. That is NOT the case in this game: if you get to the penultimate area of a mission with no health, dead team members, or no supplies, you must either run through the situation over and over from their awkwardly placed checkpoints, or start the entire mission over again from BEFORE you initiated it. This includes talking to all the NPCs, watching unskippable cinematics, recruting new team members, purchasing supplies, levelling up, and travelling to the mission area. Depending on how much preparation you require, you may spend more time in preliminary prepping than actually playing the game, going over the same (admittedly clever and consistent) dialogue, losing its significance each time.This surely seems like an issue that one shouldn't harp on, but consider how elemental even a rudimentary save system is to any RPG you've ever played, and then remove it. How many opportunities are there to say that it was a universally good choice? In this game, the absence is so notable that it almost renders the game worthless.As for the positives, the game is set in the legendary Shadowrun universe, fully realised in video game form! The writing is quite often witty and on point. There is a potential for infinite content with the open authoring tools.It's worth buying if you think you can deal with the big drawback, but it is a big one.			"

												As a first time experience, this game had me really enjoying the whole concept of shadowrun. I must say as someone who wasn't a fan before, this game had really opened up my experience and mind to the world of shadowrun.Gritty, dark and futuristic environment really appeals to me as I was not a fan of cyberpunk before, however this game has really helped introduce this genre as its environment was well designed enough to keep me interested.However, some gameplay elements can be rather repetitive and the base storyline is rather bland, however the additional campaigns online makes up for it, thank goodness for indie campaign creators (do mind me if i used the wrong terms, am new at this)Overall, a 7/10, good game, and great way to introduce people to the cyberpunk genre.

												Like every game, this isn't for everyone. The default campaign is short (took me slightly north of 10 hours without skipping sidequests), it has a check point system instead of save anywhere (getting changed in Berlin DLC, unsure if being ptached in to cover default game too), lack of lootable corpses, and no voice acting. If none of that bothers you, it's worth a look. The story isn't bad, and there's a lot of dialog.My main complaints are as an RPG, it's kind of lacking content. The campaign is very linear, not a lot of tactical depth to combat, no ability to customize anything except a handful of consumables on party members, nearly all hired runners lack any personality, and reactivity is pretty sparse (i.e. special dialog for race/gender is rare). However, where this game will really shine is future content. It shipped with an ugly but powerful editor that allows modders to fix certain things (more open world questing and lootable bodies for starters). The Berlin DLC is also planned to be more open ended.Overall, a shallow but solid default campaign. The best of this game will come to the surface in the coming months.			"

												Back in my SNES days, Shadowrun was by far my favourite game.  These days, that's the only game that really sticks in my mind when I think back to playing that console.  Over the years I have tracked where the game was going.  Horrified that Microsoft bought the rights, but thought maybe they'll do something good with it.  Nope.  2007, I saw it was just another first-person shooter, not tied to the Shadowrun universe, I sadly concluded there was no chance of ever seeing another Shadowrun game like the one on SNES.  Guess I'll have to install a SNES emulator and play the original (never got around to it).Then I was cruising around Google Play last week, when Shadowrun Returns showed up on my recommended list.  OHHHH.... darn.  No tablet.  Yet.  But tis on Steam, and it works on Linux.  REJOICE!  I tried it for a few hours and so far it's looking great.  I played both the Dead Man's Switch campaign provided by Harebrained Schemes, and a story someone is putting together to replicate the SNES version.Thanks Microsoft for giving the game's rights back to Jordan Weisman!  Thanks Jordan and HBS for bringing back the world of Shadowrun to our screens!  Thanks  Kickstarter for the campaign to fund HBS' development.  Thanks all who provided funding!  Had I known the campaign existed last year, I would've contributed for sure.			"

												Solid little retro RPG, just the kind of game that I am looking for these days. The basic scenario is only 10-12 hours long and is well written, though gets a bit combat heavy at the end. Definitely worth a play through and I'll be on the look out for the follow up.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a tactical strategy rpg which functions similar to the X-Com or UFO series games, set in the Shadowrun universe. Pros: *Nice Artstyle*Simple yet effective combat and skill system, allows you to more or less build your ""class"" by picking which stats and skills you want to learn.*Lands the Shadowrun Universe pretty wellCons:*Very short playthrough (core game, not the Shadowrun: Dragonfall expansion)*This game is very easy on ""normal"". I recommend to anyone that has played the genre before to play on the hardest difficulties.*Could use more weapons/armor/configuration. I kept feeling like there should be another drop or weapon coming soon... and it never does.Overall: 7/10Fun game, looks nice, but it's very short and could use more content and story. I am about 5-6 hours in (2 did not get recorded by Steam), and I would say according to the chapter list on most websites I'm about 75% through the game. I am looking forward to trying the expansion however, and I will update my review when I get the chance. Many reviews for the expansion title seem to point out that it's a bit more complete and a touch longer than the core campaign.I would purchase this game again, since I bought it on sale... but I don't think I would pay full price for it. This is a good pickup if you catch it on sale, and if so I would grab the expansion to go with it, otherwise the game may feel a bit incomplete.			"

												A great game, lovingly recreated to resemble the old super nintendo game I used to love.  The turn based gameplay works really well and the karma system for levelling up gives limited scope so decisions must be made carefully, rather than having a fully levelled up character before too long.  Dead Mans Switch felt linear and the responses felt as though they didn't really change the game outcome much, however the expansion, Dragonfall, addresses many issues including the ability to save anywhere.  Dragonfall is a much more honed Shadowrun campaign in my opinion and deserves an applause for the production team who clearly thought hard about the game story and characters.  A triumph.			"

												Overall, I would give this game a 9/10. Everything is fantastic, and I cannot wait to play Dragonfall someday and also play player-created campaigns. I am also inspired to pick up the paper and pen version of Shadowrun, as well as Shadowrun Online. It's just that Dead Man's Switch became quite disappointing. Just take it out, or give the players more freedom, and everything here would be stellar.*****Now for ***SPOILERS*** Kind of.*****I have not played Dragonfall, so this review is of the main campaign, Dead Man's Switch. I really enjoy pretty much every aspect of this game--the environment, combat, characters, atmosphere, etc.--except for the main story. Despite getting very interested in the storyline after the first few lines were presented to me, almost all of my excitement was lost when the Ripper was revealed. I was having fun treating DMS as a murder mystery; I was carefully examining everything and trying to figure out who the Ripper could be--I even had some evidence to support who I thought could be the Ripper--but the game pretty much points a huge sign at the real suspect from the moment they are introduced, and this is overwhelmingly disappointing. The other side of the story after the reveal doesn't even make much sense.			"

												My playthough was about 15 hours total. I went with a Troll who specialized in unarmed combat, and I really enjoyed the powerful hits that would sometimes one-shot enemies. Running into combat like a berserker was quite satisfying too, but  most of the time I would end up taking a lot of damage.  It was a little annoying not being able to get all the little secrets that require decking skills, but I managed just fine without the extra stuff.Pro:  Lots of community contentLots of class/race options and tons of ways to build a character, and lots of spells/skillsWell-executed turn-based combat with a cover system akin to X-COMGreat story that pulls you into the world of Shadowrun (very text-heavy, enjoyable for those who like to read)Con:The RNG seems off sometimes (e.g. a 90% chance to hit might fail three times in a row)The story is very linear, and there isn't a new-game+ option "

												The title of this game couldn't be any more accurate. I remember the original console shadowrun back on the Sega Genesis and the SNES. The game was immersive from a storytelling aspect that was, in my opinion, a breath of fresh air in the RPG genre.Fast forward a decade or so, and Shadowrun reappears, only to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized FPS version that didnt do the setting any justice. FINALLY I have stumbled across this game, and it truely is a RETURN to the setting from my childhood and many pen and paper RPG enthusiasts hearts. If you enjoy the classic story driven aspect of an RPG, this game is well within a reasonable price range. I highly reccommend it and hope everyone gives it a try.			"

												An old classic is rebooted with the fluid and tactical combat of Xcom mated with a mysterious Cyberpunk/Fantasy theme. The RPG dialouge is top notch and the characters are very fleshed out. Each character is unique independent of their race unlike most other RPGs.If you were ever a fan of Fallout, Baldur's Gate, Torment, or other infinity engine classics, highly recommend this and keeping an eye out for the Torment and Wasteland kickstarters. This is the first of many beautiufl reboots to come (although from what I hear this doesn't live faithfully up to the originals which I unfortunately never played having never owned the consoles needed).I would like to add the current campaign is moderate in length being shorter than most old and new RPGs. The main appeal is the mod kit which will allow for many, many campiagns and such. Also the dialouge while great does NOT affect the world greatly and is more for flavour than anything.Lastly I recommend not playing a Street Samurai. They are in bad need of balancing and it makes the game a cake walk once you unlock the ability to 'one-action kill' most enemies in the game.			"

												Solid Turned-Based RPG.I found the overall game to be solid.  Well written, enjoyable storyline wrapped with some great mechanics.  Complaints about a very linear campaign are accurate.  However, considering the price and solid execution, I feel that is more than forgiveable.  This isn't an RPG with lots of side content or derivative bits to distract you from the main story.  As mentioned, at $15 or even $20, I think that the offering is more than fair.  My only complaints are that while polished, the story and gameplay are forgettable.  The game is entertaining enough to pull you through the campaign but not memorable enough to bring you back for nostalgic purposes.  On the contrary, it will probably give you a craving for some older classics such as Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment or Fallout.			"

												This expansion for Shadowrun Returns (by Hare-Brained Schemes) evokes the old-school grand scope of classic Bioware RPGs.  More than just an expansion campaign, Dragonfall improves on the original engine in many ways, and responds directly to many complaints about the original.  Even better, it translates those improvements (like a new save system) to the original campaign as well, so folks new to the series entirely can enjoy the improved engine from the start.  The result is an improved product all around, and a memorable and enjoyable RPG set in one of the most fun alternate universes ever created.  An excellent set of custom creation tools add to the potential life of the game, as the mod community may well produce some masterpieces of their own, down the line.			"

												I never played the original Shadowrun (SNES and Sega Genesis, apparently), but after playing Shadowrun Returns, I'm going to find it.Shadowrun Returns is one of the few games in the ""RPG"" category that is, in fact, a Role-Playing Game. Unlike Dungeon Siege, Diablo, BioWare Game or Final Fantasy, Shadowrun actually requires you to interact with NPCs and the manner of those interactions actually impacts the game. Imagine that. So many games claim that NPC interactions affect outcomes, but this is the first game I've played in a while (not including the Elder Scrolls/Fallout 3 sub-genre) in which that's actually true.Dead Man's Switch (the original campaign) has a little bit of important dialogue, but Dragonfall (the first DLC campaign) is LOADED with character development and NPCs that actually behave differently depending on how you treat them.But the beauty of Shadowrun Returns isn't the official campaigns. It's the editor, and the integration with Steam Workshop. I've not actually used the editor yet, but judging from the vast range of quality in the user-created content, it must be pretty easy to use. On the one hand, that means a LOT of just pure garbage content. On the other hand, it means that learning how to use the editor isn't a stumbling block for somebody who's got a great story to tell.So while the original campaign is really quite good (I mean really, really good. It's one of the few campaigns of any game that I'm perfectly happy replaying several times in a row), Dragonfall really showcases what the game's engine is capable of.If you've ever played the old Fallout games (Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics), this is a lot like those. If you haven't played those, think of it as turn-based, squad-based Diablo, with almost no emphasis on gear. There is an equipment treadmill, but it's not very involved. More along the lines of Mass Effect 2.There are three or four pistols (for example), and you buy the most expensive one you can afford. So while there IS a reason to make more money and get the better stuff, it's not the need that it is in other games (Diablo, for example). Sorry to keep making the comparison to Diablo, but that's the other game I've been playing most recently.Shadowrun Returns is also one of the few games I've played that knows how to use a touchscreen. Most games work ""well enough,"" but SR has a touchscreen mode that makes it function beautifully. And by ""beautifully,"" I mean that the PC version plays just as well on my Dell touchscreen as the Android version plays on my Samsung Note 2.I don't know if anyone but me cares about that, but with the increasing prevalence of Windows 8, I figure it's worth mentioning.I know I'm making a big deal about Dragonfall, and I mean to. It's an excellent campaign, and is actually (in my opinion) worth the price of a full expansion pack, as opposed to the increasingly-common 2-dollar DLC. But I suppose I should really talk more about Dead Man's Switch. It's an engaging mystery with great characters. It doesn't have the meaningful dialogues and character developmnet of Dragonfall, but I was immediately taken with both Dresden and Kluwe. They're not ""important"" characters, but the fact that placeholder roles are filled with well-fleshed and well-written characters is just indicative of the attention to detail paid by the devs. It's a well-polished introduction to the world of Shadowrun.

												Okay, I finally have to write a little something after playing the Dragonfall DLC.First off, to quickly go over Shadowrun Returns:  Let me preface this by saying I am a kickstarter backer.  Back when SRR popped up on Kickstarter, I immediately jumped on board.  I'd been craving the old-school SR like the ones on Genesis and SNES which I played when I was hardly into my teens, and everything in the KS pitch sold me that this would bring it back to those days.  When SRR finally released and I played through it, I came out satisfied.  It has a solid and deep story, good combat (which has since been balanced and improved), fairly simple puzzles, and yes..it had some flaws like no manual saves (again, resolved since then), but it didn't really bug me that much.  Most of all, they made choice matter.And then along comes Shadowrun: Dragonfall.   Dragonfall absolutely oozes greatness.  There's insane depth of characters and the world, down to the smallest details, even in conversations with side characters like Simmy Kim and reading the Shadowland BBS.  It's a very rare thing where a game captures me so well that I sit and read every single piece of text I come across (and there's so much to read in this series).  I especially appreciated the design in this DLC of having the quest hub, but more importantly, there were so many more rich side quests throughout the campaign than in the base game.  They also upped the design on the puzzle elements a bit which I appreciated (the original campaign's were generally way too straightforward).  But enough of a wall of text, let's break things down:Story: Phenomenal.  Aside from the depth of lore in this world, the story of this campaign alone was so great.  Just when you     think you've got things figured out, something throws you for a loop.  You face lots of decisions that test your morals, many of which mostly seem to test just how close to ""the line"" you're willing to step, or if it's even a question for you.Characters: Great.  This time around, you've got a dedicated crew.  Sure, you could hire runners to go along with you, but the crew is where it's at.  They've got deep stories and I loved every bit of exploring them.  The SRR Dead Man Switch campaign had people occasionally joining you, like Coyote, but those companions pale in comparison to the attention given to the crew of Dragonfall.  I cared about my crew.  Hell, I felt bad that I always had to leave one member behind on my runs having only room for a team of 4.  I felt like I was neglecting them most of the game and that they were going to confront me about it at some point.Combat: Solid.  I played on hard difficulty, and essentially did the same rifle-focused street samurai build I did in SRR.  I found it much more balanced, and there were several missions with some real tension as the fights raged on.  The Matrix served a good purpose as well; it felt much more key to this campaign than the first.Graphics: Beautiful.  They already established this with SRR, they just painted a whole new world for Dragonfall's Berlin setting, and it's gorgeous.So that's it in a nutshell.Final verdict: Worth buying?  Abso-freakin-lutely.  This is an rpg not to be missed. "

Weak. Have to start over now and pick an all new path knowing what i know now. Which is no fun knowing that some classes arent as viable as others. Overall id give it a 6/10. Just fun enough.			"

												Shadowrun Returns and its DLC's are a great way to immerse oneself in this excellent RPG and novel setting. The game is really easy to master and anyone who has played X-COMM, for instance, will find Shadowrun easy. A word of advice though, be very thorough in searching for clues and other hidden objects, especially at the beginning. Going straight into fights without these is missing most of the fun. My only criticism about this game is that it lost one of the coolest elements in the RPG: the planning part. Although, there is a recruitment and resupplying phase before missions, the actual planning is limited to a bare minimum (no possibility to get any map of the area beforehand, for instance). That's a bit too bad, especially since it makes the choice of team members before each run a random game. Apart from this, great fun game.			"

												The only thing that I really didn't like about this game was that it ended.  The campaign wasn't as long as I would have liked.  That being said it wasn't really THAT short I just played the game a ton.  I got really immersed and wanted to just talk to all the NPCs and explore a bit.  I was a big fan of the shadowrun game for the SNES and love that there was a pretty significant callback to that game in this one.  It really levereged my nostalgia with a brand new experience.  I just started playing the new campaign that was released, Dragonfall and it seems that the same, if not more, care was spent on the development of it as was the original.  I just wish it didn't always have to end.			"

It doesn't quite capture the freedom of character creation in the tabletop version, but it does a great job of giving you plenty of options for your character and your team. I definitely recommend giving this game a try and picking up the art-book (which is full of great short stories) and soundtrack as well!			"

												Really enjoyed this version, having played a bit of the pen and paper version back in the 90's. The main story was enjoyable but I felt that the style and storyline of Dragonfall was superior and well worth the purchase. Especially if you can get it in one of the steam sales. While I have no intention of making my own content, there is some very good free content in the workshop that adds alot of replay value to this game, which makes the value for money greater still in my opinion.

												My review is of both ""Shadowrun Returns"" as a game engine, and the included ""Dead Man's Switch"" story. Overall, I give it a massive yes. If you enjoy tabletop RPGs, cyberpunk, or science-fantasy... get this. It's not without it's flaws however. Shadowrun Returns - The game engine is a powerful story creation tool, and it's simple to use as far as these things go. However, there are some interface issues during gameplay, as I made accidental moves on more than one occasion. But overall, it's a solid game engine that will provide many dozens of hours of fun with custom stories and the steam workshop.Dead Man's Switch - Let me start by saying that it's not very interactive. The world is well built through text and visuals, but you can't really do much with it. Any actual role playing comes in with your dialog options, rather than your behaviour in the world or choices in the story progression. If you don't mind a very scripted RPG experience then this story is really good. In fact, it's better than good, the writing is just amazing. It was like an interactive novel in some ways, with well written dialog, a ""page turner"" of a story, and great world building. I knew little about the Shadowrun universe before this game, and now I feel like I've just paid a visit to it.As a whole, Shadowrun Returns is an excellent bargain purchase for the price that will please tabletop, Shadowrun, and story rich RPG fans.What the frag are you waiting for!? Buy it, drek-head!			"

												This is a decent tactical RPG. While the main campaign is very linear and focuses more on the combat side of things, the Daggerfall DLC offers a much broader experience with proper NPC's, a decent hub and some fun sidequests with more for non combat focused characters to do. There's also some decent looking community content out there, and I reckon I'll be putting quite a few hours in on this one. Definitly one to try if you enjoyed the classic CRPG's like Baldur's Gate or Fallout.			"

												Even if you're not totally familiar with the universe, if you're looking for a great tactical RPG to knock out in a few days? This is perfect. The whole thing is like having one big tasty snack that leaves you wanting more. But that's sort of the downside. It may not give you enough to entirely satisfy you. Which is better than feeling like it's one trudge, but you still wish for more. The user created levels and junk you can download are okay, but don't really match up to the same quality as the main campaign. That's just my opinion though. And it may not be quite that replayable, or at least not as much as you'd want it to be. Say you decide to be a Street Samurai. This means you probably wont be decking any computers. And while you'll come across a few situations where it'll help, all it really does is save you some time. Same for speech options. They're rare, and don't really offer any change in the conversation.But in the end, I'd still reccomend it. It still has a great short story to tell and a rich atmosphere. I'd say plan on buying the DLC rather than relying on the user created content to get your additional fix, though. At least until some of the more major projects are legitimately finished.			"

												This has been an interesting experience! Isometric RPGs have been rapidly winning my heart back even since ME 3 and this one was a fresh change from the normal recipe.The skill system is nicely portrayed, gameplay is fun and with a lot of choices and the story brilliant enough to keep you invested ( don't expect crazy or unexpected plot twists here ) My two major cons here are the general linearity of the game , which doesn't allow much on the exploration department and the lack of plentiful side quests (which probably goes side by side with my first complain) This game CRIES for side questing and the characters it introduces are SO WELL portrayed that it's arguably a crime that there is no further development with them or some involving quests to further enjoy them in action (Coyote's quest for example should have been done for more characters!) There is your occasional side quest , but they are SOOO few that it makes you feel sad moving on to the next chapter like this. Finally i was REALLY bummed by the length of the main campaign .. I mean okay i understand that you guys were betting on the UGC (user generated content) to maximize replayability but really that short ??? You could have made an at least +20 hours on the Dead man's switch . Oh well..Pros:+ Beautiful Skill system+ Fun Gameplay+ Enjoyable storyCons:- Too Linear (for an RPG)- Very few side quests - Main campaign TOO BLOODY SHORT!All in all did i fully enjoy this game? Yes Could i have enjoyed it EVEN more ? DEFINITELY YES Do i recommend it? well yes if you are an RPG fan you will enjoy this for what it offers. But maybe try and get it on a Sale as i did			"

												I just finished ""Dead Man's Switch"" of Shadowrun Returns and I really enjoyed it. Just a heads up before my review, the main reason I purchased this game is because I used to play the table top version of Shadowrun back in highschool. Just the product's name brings back great memories and my review (and enjoyment of the game) of course is partially biased due to this background. Here is a quick review for those interested in the title:What is ""Dead Man's Switch""?Think of Shadowrun Returns as the client, and DMS as the story you plug into it. There is also a DLC that I've purchased but not started yet that is another story for Shadowrun Returns. I'm hoping they will continue to support this product! Game Mechanics:Smooth, easy to learn, and well done. The game plays like the first Fallouts or the Baldur's Gate series as an overhead tactical turn-based gameplay. With that said you do not need any prior experience with this type of game to enjoy Shadowrun Returns. The menu, UI, and rpg elements are all straight forward. The only thing that bothered me about the combat UI was reloading my rifle, however I'm sure there was a hotkey I could've used. Story vs. Action:The biggest compliant I saw on my own research of this game prior to purchase was the amount of dialog. The team that created this game obviously aimed to reproduce a table-top setting that focused primarily on storytelling, not combat. There are plently of short engagements throughout this product and I felt the combat was very satisifying. However, if you are the type that clicks quickly though dialog in other games you won't be impressed with this title. The best part of this game is the story and for those don't care about that and just want an action / adventure title should look elsewhere. If you have any direct questions please comment below! I just wanted to hit those two points since they I felt they were not communicated well in other reviews.			"

												Shadowrun was a breath of fresh air for me.IAmongst hordes of MOBAs and shooters, an classic RPG like Shadowrun definetly stands out. Intriguing setting, fusion between science fiction and fantasy create an unique noir-ish atmosphere of futuristic coroprate-ruled world. The closest game to this that has been released recently is probably only Deus Ex: Human Revolution.Great writing, beautiful system and stylish graphics makes you wish to play it again and again. However, main campaign, while   engagin and entertaining is relatively short. Luckily, with the integration of Steam Workshop, that could become a reality, with steady flow of well-crafted user-created content. Can't wait to play it again in my free time.9/10.			"

												While the first campaign, ""the death mans switch"" has great storytelling, it is appearent that it´s just the first baby steps that the company took for shadowrun returns. that becomes specially clear, when you play the DLC, Dragonfall... it is a HUGE improvement on so many levels, that i can´t point them all out here... Great storytelling is the special strenghth of SR:R, and with many sideplots, active decisions that matter, a more polished world that immediately drives you into the Shadowrun universe, lot´s of additional weapons, cyberwear and other stuff, Dragonfall makes huge steps into the right direction. HBS (the developer) activelly listened (and still does) to their players. bringing lot´s of the improvements that the community asked for. So: if you are an oldschool RPG fan, or just someone who likes to read great stories, you aren´t grafx-b***ing and can appreciate low-budget-huge-dedication,  plus you want to support one of the few small developers who really put all their heart into their game and interacts with their community then i can only recommend you buy both SR:Returns + Dragonfall... for that price you get several hours of great entertainment in a Cyberpunk/Fantasy crossover setting.SR:R is what it is... Shadowrun at it´s ultimate core			"

												I had never played the SNES version of this game.  But I was absolutley hooked on the Sega Genesis version.  This new rendition of a classic is, to say the least, Fraggin' awesome!!  The good people at Harebrained Schemes really deliver a terrific balance of new technique and classicly proven rpg elements.  Whether your here for some good old fashioned turned based RPG combat, or to lose yourself in a great story I'd recommend this game.Game-play, controls, mechanics all come pretty standard with this game.  Its a ""tutorial-while-you-play"" learning curve.  The dev's manage to balance it decently.  If youre new to RPG's, and turn-based combat, you might have a slight up hill battle learning the in's and out's of the game.  But if your a fly by fan, or hardcore RPG junkie, you'll find it easy and intuitive. Again, I highly recommend it! "

												The original campaign was more than very solid, after getting into the whole theme, I had hours of great entertainment. The Dragonfall DLC is amazing so far, it really gives you the feeling of being part and being able to change this mature world. You have your own group of shadowrunner, lots of choices, lots of different classes and skills, weapons and ingame content to explore. I am amazed by the quality of this game. Combined with an editor and a very active modding scene, it's worth every single cent.			"

												Pretty enjoyable, but if reading is not your thing then don't buy it. The story is pretty good though.Conversations and conversation options come a lot, and depending on your skills you'll have different answers at times, and the combat when it happens is turn based and needs strategy and placement of your characters.All in all, a fun experience if you're into that sort of thing.

												Not only am I happy with the mechanics of the game, the ease of movement, targeting choices, how skill points and systems make sensible differences, I'm most happy with how it feels.  This is a really satisfying outlet from my days of playing on a tabletop and gives a good sense of cyberpunk.  The writers have done a good job creating a story that draws you in and makes you want to see what all the options were.  I still don't have completions for 'Returns' or 'Director's Cut', but I aim to get there, eventually.Icing on the cake is how active the community is with the add-ons, additional stories, art sets, and general enthusiasm.  Of the various games I've played in Steam, I have liked this community the most.  Try it for yourself.  I think you'll find it was a good choice.			"

												As someone who's never played Shadowrun previously, I'm pretty happy with the system mechanics and how the story folds out. I played it on Very Hard difficulty, which didn't actually seem all too difficult (if anything, I felt like my team missed their attacks more often than they should have). This is also based on the Dead Man's Switch campaign, which comes with the game.I customized my character originally as a Rigger, focusing on Drone Control, with a few levels in Pistols. I later added Decking to my skills, keeping its levels even with my Drones, and it seemed to work out very successfully, in that I never felt that my character was over-reliant on my companions other than for additional damage output.The game does have a couple of bugs in some places: the first major one I noticed was when I bought level 2 Decker abilities, where they did not show up in my inventory/stash at all after I bought them. I had to trust the game actually did register that I possessed them, as they were also absent from the store (which is normal if you already had it), and later on in the game, when level 3 Decker abilities were made available, the behavior seemed to correct itself.The other major bug I found was in the room for the final battle (I'll try not to be spoilery). There are pieces in the room which are either active or inactive, and to keep the battle more manageable, you want to keep all of them inactive as much as possible. However, there were a few instances where I couldn't actually target an active piece (quicksave/loading fixed this), and a few times where a piece appeared inactive, but I knew based on enemy behavior in the battle that it was actually active.

												While I like this game a lot, others may not, depending on what they're expecting.If you are expecting any edition of the tabletop role-playing game, or the Genesis or SNES console games, you will be disappointed.  Shadowrun: Returns plays something like a simplified version of tabletop rules that never actually existed.I liked the plot, combat, and music.Opinions on the plot vary widely.  If you have an aversion to reading, this game is not for you.  Almost all of the plot is delivered via screens of text upon entering an area, or text dialogs.  There is no voiceover.  Some people complain of purple prose, or that it seems to have been written by someone that is immature, but the writing is superior to that in most video games, including most other RPGs.  I personally do not perceive any of these problems, and have never seen examples cited.Screenshots do not do the combat system justice.  Some of the interface is only displayed when it is relevant.  For example, the action point cost of movement, and the effectiveness of cover, only appear when you prepare to move, and when cover exists in the area you mouseover.  The combat system is relatively simple (which is reflected in the user interface), but like Chess, can be quite difficult.  The difficulty is selectable at character creation, so if you find the game too easy or hard you can adjust it.  Since almost all RPGs are combat-heavy, it's important that it not be mindless and repetitive.The music is hard to describe.  It is not ambient.  You will notice it.  I especially like the theme on the title screen.I didn't like some things about Shadowrun: Returns.It is very linear, and most decisions will not affect the ending.The gameplay in the matrix is very similar to meatspace.  It's not so much that the gameplay in the matrix is bad as it doesn't feel different enough.The game only saves on area transition.  If you have to stop playing, or die, unexpectedly, you can lose quite a bit of progress.			"

Pros:+ Solid storyline+ Various builds that change how you play+ Rewarding, challenging combat+ Clever puzzles+ Bug-free+ The game ends on exactly the right noteCons:- Game is a bit short; campaign lasts roughly 20 hours if you do everything- Relatively low replay value- Straightforward campaign; for the most part, you stay on a single track through the main campaign, with only a couple chances for sidequests- Charisma/Etiquettes*- Specializing is required.  Jack of All Trades type characters don't do well.Overall: Shadowrun Returns is fun.  You get to hire a crew and go do odd jobs as a mercenary in a futuristic dystopia.  The tone and music fits, the game gives you just enough money to get by and forces you to spend wisely, and the storyline is fast paced and fun.  The game is short, and there's not many chances for optional sidequests, but in spite of that the overall experience is still great.  If you're a fan of tactical isometric roleplaying games, this is a solid choice.Bottom Line: A wild ride from start to finish, with fun characters, rewarding combat, and enjoyable gameplay.  A little short and straightforward, but well done in spite of this.  Worth the price.* The charisma system in game works by giving you various ""etiquettes"" which will open up conversation options if you know them.  Some etiquettes are extremely useful, others are entirely pointless.  Consult a guide when choosing which etiquettes to learn.			"

												The only thing that I really didn't like about this game was that it ended.  The campaign wasn't as long as I would have liked.  That being said it wasn't really THAT short I just played the game a ton.  I got really immersed and wanted to just talk to all the NPCs and explore a bit.  I was a big fan of the shadowrun game for the SNES and love that there was a pretty significant callback to that game in this one.  It really levereged my nostalgia with a brand new experience.  I just started playing the new campaign that was released, Dragonfall and it seems that the same, if not more, care was spent on the development of it as was the original.  I just wish it didn't always have to end.			"

												Besides Mass Effect, its been a very long time since I've found a roleplaying game that I've really enjoyed.Honestly, Shadowrun Returns blew away my expectations, especially since I didn't really have any going into it. I knew that it was based off a classic sci-fi tabletop RPG, but that was about it.The first campaign, The Deadman's Switch, draws you into the world of Shadowrun very well, introduces you to some characters, and generally how the game works and feels. It's a nice introduction to the game, but it does have a few things that annoyed and irked me. Especially the linearity of it all. It was one story the whole way through, with not many different ways to approach things, or side quests to take up your time.That's why I recommend getting the Dragonfall expansion with it. I've played the expansion for three or four hours at this point, and all of my problems with the original game have been taken care of, as far as I can tell. There are a lot more things put in place to sidetrack you, and I really like that.But, there's also the horde of player created content that the game allows access to, and that could provide a lot more gameplay than the original campaign allows for, therefore not necessarily making the Dragonfall expansion worth it, but I recommend it none-the-less.

												Shadowrun Returns is an adaptation of the classic cyberpunk tabletop pen and paper RPG. Set in an alternative history future where magic has returned to the world, elves, dwarves, trolls, and orks live side by side with humans in dense urban cities, and corporations are a law unto themselves; the game centers around the segment of humanity who makes their living in the shadows, the runners. Hacker, mercenary, detective, sorcerer, where there is a job that needs doing, there will be someone willing to get paid to do it.The game itself is a single player, turn-based strategy RPG, utilizing 3/4 isometric perspective with 3D character models set against sprite based backgrounds. The sprite backgrounds are static and well done, while the character designs are somewhat poorly textured with resolution below that which the majority of modern systems could easily handle; belying the limited budget the company had to work with. Gameplay takes the form of point and click interaction with the world map and carries over directly into combat, utilizing the same environments. Combat is somewhat klunky, as there are problems with the interaction of the courser and corners of the movement field.The game itself is, however, merely a platform. It is in reality intended for players to build and share their own Shadowrun campaigns, and the full game editor comes included with the base game as well as a professionally developed campaign. Thanks to Steam Works, player campaigns are free, though professionally developed campaigns will be sold as DLC as they become available. Sadly there is no multiplayer option what-so-ever, crippling one of the intregral elements of the pen-and-paper game.Overall, the game's campaign will run you around 12 hours, and is a good buy if you can get it on sale, for any enthusiast of turn-based strategy RPGs.

												A diamond in the rough.Some people have problems with the engine and it's true, it is far from perfect. The Checkpoint system bugged many, and I thought it would get on my nerves when I first read of it but in the end it didnt bother me at all. The game has a variety of bugs but after I beat it last week they've already patched many of them.The music was made by the guy that made the music for the SNES game aswell as the guy that made the music for the Genesis/Megadrive game set in the Shadowrun world so they know their stuff.The graphics are Both beautiful but in terms of animations on the characters, sort of stiff.So the battles tend to look abit worse than when youre just walking around the world in awe of the neon glory that is the Shadowrun world.The battle system is very close to the one in the 2012 Xcom remake so all is good there.Where the game really shines is it's storytelling and characters. The writers did a damn good job and created a world that really pulled me in. I'm usually not one to play games just for its story, but if you are then this is a great one.The game is definately flawed but hopefully those flaws are worked out over time, and even if they aint, none of them ever really took me out of the experience. I'll be eagerly awaiting the expansions and I'm sure I'll be trying out some mods aswell.			"

												Shadowrun Returns' turn-based, old style XCOM-esque gameplay is solid and set in the fascinating mix of cyberpunk and high fantasy that is the Shadowrun world. The vanilla storyline is compelling the first time around, but loses much of its appeal on replays due to the lack of meaningful choices or varying narrative paths. Ultimately, no matter what you do or say, you always end up at the same place and talk to the same characters. However, the diversity in the character building/class system does much to keep the game interesting across multiple playthroughs, with Deckers, for example, playing much differently from Mages or Street Samurai. Overall, a good indie title that is well worth the price if you're a fan of the turn-based tactics genre or the Shadowrun lore.			"

												This game is absolutely great from top to bottom. The main game is a well written and well paced piece of murder mystery cyberpunk action, made with great writing and interesting characters. The writing is so good, in fact, that even characters that show up just once or twice feel really memorable. The graphic style and musical design are top notch and really help make the experience into a cohesive whole. The gameplay is a solid tactical RPG experience that's fun to play, if a bit on the easy side more often than not. The few downsides to the game start with the lack of manual saving. The game automatically saves at checkpoints (probably to prevent save scumming like some other tactical games) which can sometimes be frustrating. The locked angle camera usually is okay, but there are times where it's a problem. Some people will call a 12 hour, very linear main campaign a problem too, but I personally think that it's better to have 12 high-quality hours than 20-25 with lots of filler. So it's not perfect, but it's damned well done. And the inclusion of an editor means that in the end we'll hopefully see a lot more great content from the community.			"

												I am going to write a review of Shadowrun Returns. If you are a lover of Isometric RPGS like Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, Arcanum, and others. If you are a lover of Cyberpunk or Dystopian Futures...you need to play this game. Its $20 on Steam and its amazing. In short:1) Classes Character Building. You wanna be a troll who summons spirits and shoots people with an AK-47? You can! Dwarf Hacker/Mage? GO FOR IT! No limits save for race based stats which make sense!2) User Created Content. The game comes bundled with a Toolset, and people are already creating full adventures! There is a Remake of the SNES Shadowrun game already on the Steam workshop along with 2 other fanmade adventures (I grabbed them all) along with items and other things to use in your own creations!3) A decent bundled adventure. Took me about 12 hours to finish, and it was fairly standard but fun, and really a good way to introduce you to the game4) Turn based tactical combat with action points. Your characters get 2 actions each round, with different spills and skills taking 1 or more AP. Movement is done in a grid and cover is important. The higher your skills with your weapon and things, the better your chances to hit!You should buy this. RIGHT NOW. You will not regret it. Yes there are a few bugs (I ran into several) and you do want to read the in game manual as the game does not hold your hands..but this is exactly what I have been looking for. Oh and its light on the resource usage too!			"

												Being new to the PC/Steam community, I was astoniished and a little overwhelmed when I began browsing the Steam store for the first time. Something I am sure many people have experienced.I kept at it and as I searched through the  of numerous titles available along came Shadowrun Returns.....Now, I have been gaming for many years and one of the highlights was playing Shadowrun on the SNES (Super Nintendo). This game was such fun and the world so diverce, it is one of those gaming experiences you never forget!To find this gem among so many other great titles on Steam made my day, a chance to return to the Shadowrun world.The setting is a future Cyber Punk world, centred around a strong story driven experience with RPG/Turn based action elements. It is a game you can play when you want to lose yourself for an hour or often more. It is not as complex as other turn based stratergy/RPG titles, but still as rewarding due to an excellent murder mystery story line. It is above all an excellent place to start for people wanting to give this type of game a go. I have not played the other subsequent titles that have been released, but fully intend to as they each in turn expand the game and it's complexity with new functionality. Just check out the reviews/videos for the rest of the series available! For the price it's a steal for any gamer and will open up a new exciting experiences. Just like the SNES game did for me many years ago.Give it a go, you won't be dissapointed. "

												Frankly, I'll give anything that has Shadowrun in the name a try.  Kind of like I used to be with Battletech.  I like the atmosphere of the game.  I like the turn based combat.  I'm not a youngster anymore, so I can't keep up with the fast muscle responses of these Call of Duty gurus.  This is fun, has a little strategy and tactics to it, has a little problem solving, and has a nice cyberpunky atmosphere.  I like it.			"

												An easy buy if you enjoy xcom style gameplay and fantasy cyberpunk.I really enjoyed this game. ~10hrs of gameplay... well maybe half story and half dialogue. Played as an Adept(melee tank) on very hard but didn't find the game difficult. Looking forward to checking out the steam workshop for some extra campaigns and eventually moving onto the sequel.Paid less than $2 for it Winter Sale 2014.			"

												I marathoned this game. It is fantastic. It reminds me of Infinity Engine games like Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate, only the combat is much easier to wrap your head around. The setting is cyberpunk (William Gibson and Neal Stephenson specifically) mixxed with high fantasy. The module that is included in the game is a fun story, but don't be surprised if you call out plot points well before they happen. I've only played through it once, but my class choice (decker) seemed pretty useless in most situations. I am hoping Harebrained Scheme puts out a few more modules of their own.There is a module creator and it looks like the community has put out quite a bit of content on their own. I'm looking forward to sinking a few hours investigating that over the weekend.			"

												Shadowrun has always been a great universe. It is a real shame that it doesn't get as much attention as tradition D&D universe. So this game is much needed break from you're typical RPG. The storyline in the main campaign is pretty good but not super orginal or great. It  did kept my attention enough that I played it for over 8 on the first day I got it. It has some flaws though that may take away from the enjoy of the game. First it is a very linear game, you don't get much chance to roam around. Even more sad then that is you never really use some the advanced skills like Decking at all really. The second issue is it lack of a save anywhere feature. Even though I played the whole in nearly one sitting it was a difficult to play it through only  been able to set checkpoints. This limits the replay value because most of us, myself included normally cannot play a game without being dragged back into the real world at random times. Doing some parts of the game more then once because of fairly spaced out checkpoints wasn't so bad. It did however give the game a limited time to play or to replay without having a large amount to play it. The promise of new updates on the way and the steam workshop makeup for some of the flaws so I would recemmmend this for any RPG fan looking for a new take on the typical RPG.			"

												This game had an excellent sense of immersion in to the world of Shadowrun. I have enjoyed playing both the released main content of Shadowrun Returns as well as many of the player workshop campaigns. One of the biggest selling points was in shipping a very useful editor that put the power of creating these campaigns in the hands of the player community.That being said there are a few rough spots. The current save system (which appears to be replaced in the next DLC Dragonfall) only provided save points at the start of a map, which means in order to save ones progress you would have to complete the section you were on and move to the next load in area for it to record your progress. The replayability was also argueable. While I enjoyed some of the subtle changes each class could bring to the different dialogs and oppertunities that would arise, the game is unfortuantely very linear. Even with those subtle changes the overall story will progress the same way. The linear story did, however, showcase many different aspects of the Shadowrun world and in my opinion was successful in introducing players to different creative aspects they could explore while making their own content for the game. You have sections of story running through the matrix, attacking a corporation and even fighting through zombies. For 20$ I found the game to be worth my expectations and have played a total of 58 hours so far between main story and workshop content. I have no regrets with my purchase.			"

												A pleasant surprise. I picked up Shadowrun Returns a few years ago,  just coming off an XCOM-high and jumped the instant I heard ""XCOM-style combat"". Found plenty to stay for. The neat, if linear, story, highly customizable playstyles, and some very unique character designs/portraits.I do have a few gripes, one of which is the inability to rotate the camera, which made combat a bit of a hassel. This is understandable, though, given the hand-drawn backgrounds. Other wise, not bad. Get it cheap, finish it in a afternoon.			"

												Undoubtedly beautiful, quite immersive and relatively nonlinear. The greatest drawback of this game is the p&p RPG system it's built upon. I personally find it to be one of the least attractive p&p concepts, doubly so because it invades one of my favourite genres; cyberpunk. Personal buttrage aside, it is a smooth and decently long RPG with a good albeit uninteresting combat system. Play it for a laid-back adventure with a Dreamworks aroma, best enjoyed inside a duvet with plnety of bulk confectionary. [7/10] (personal bias) [8/10] (buttrage aside).			"

												I really enjoyed the game. Shadowrun has a very interesting world and good dialog. The combat system is okay, fairly standard for a turn based tactical game. Downsides were few: selecting things in combat can be clunky, leading to mis-clicks and an inability to move some characters where you want them: the game overall was quite easy as well. I didn't have a single character die, or even get close to death in the campaign and I don't think this is because I played particularly well. Money was very readily available, to the point where I could buy anything I wanted. Overall a good game, mainly for the story, novel setting and dialog.			"

												I am going to write a review of Shadowrun Returns. If you are a lover of Isometric RPGS like Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, Arcanum, and others. If you are a lover of Cyberpunk or Dystopian Futures...you need to play this game. Its $20 on Steam and its amazing. In short:1) Classes Character Building. You wanna be a troll who summons spirits and shoots people with an AK-47? You can! Dwarf Hacker/Mage? GO FOR IT! No limits save for race based stats which make sense!2) User Created Content. The game comes bundled with a Toolset, and people are already creating full adventures! There is a Remake of the SNES Shadowrun game already on the Steam workshop along with 2 other fanmade adventures (I grabbed them all) along with items and other things to use in your own creations!3) A decent bundled adventure. Took me about 12 hours to finish, and it was fairly standard but fun, and really a good way to introduce you to the game4) Turn based tactical combat with action points. Your characters get 2 actions each round, with different spills and skills taking 1 or more AP. Movement is done in a grid and cover is important. The higher your skills with your weapon and things, the better your chances to hit!You should buy this. RIGHT NOW. You will not regret it. Yes there are a few bugs (I ran into several) and you do want to read the in game manual as the game does not hold your hands..but this is exactly what I have been looking for. Oh and its light on the resource usage too!			"

												EDIT: After reading some other reviews, I figured I'd add that this is based off of the Dragonfall campaign. After reading them, I am horrified of the idea of playing the original campaign.Excellent story. Great idea. Utter rubbish gameplay.Originally I enjoyed this game. Then I started realizing how hard it was, even maxing out skill lines for each character, to do...anything.There is no actual tactical combat in this; your team blindly follows your character until they blunder into an enemy group, who immediately gets to react and take cover and shoot you up. You can only take cover once you've already entered combat, and you cannot manually start combat; the enemy starts combat for you EVERY TIME.Not only that, but there are either really bad bugs relating to gunshots to enemies or - and this is pure hypothesis I've come up with because there's no documentation beyond the description of Body - the Body attribute makes it so there's a chance for every single attack to only deal half damage...meaning every single attack roll has three rolls: whether you hit, whether you crit, and whether it's weak, and enemies have a higher Body score than you seem able to achieve and have a decent chance of hitting at anything but point blank range, meaning while they may not hit as often, it will hurt more. It got to the point I started quick-saving before ever shot, and my own experiences suggest that you need to take about 30% off of the shown percentages for attacks (even on the easiest difficulty level), because 99% misses about 1 out of every three attacks, and I've only occasionally landed hits with percentages below 55% (call it 1 in 20 or more).Want a definite bug that's gone through every patch thus far? When firing an assault rifle on full-auto, once one of your five shots misses, every other shot misses. Always. It doesn't matter if you've got a 99% chance to hit; if your first attack roll is that 1%, you won't hit anything at all.Oh, and you can't carry more than one weapon of a particular class, which means you can't carry both a sniper rifle and an assault rifle, because they're both RIFLES. If you want to have both long- and close-range options you have to split your karma points (XP/skills) on two SEPARATE weapons.And my personal favorite screwed-up design option? Every conversation pretends you are by yourself. You can have (or be) one of the most skilled deckers ever on your team, but you don't have an option to ask him to hack a terminal except in very rare circumstances. You can have a troll on your team with tremendous strength, but it's YOUR strength that matters for bashing things down in conversations. YOU have to know things, rather than being able to delegate or actually ask your freaking teammate who's standing RIGHT NEXT TO YOU. I totally get some of this in games like Pillars of Eternity, because some of what you do is in the spirit world and only you can interact with it, but even there some of it irks me (because I should be able to have someone else light a fire with their face if they're the right race), but at least they let you use teammates for a lot of stuff. Here, though? We're seriously talking about maybe three times in the entire game where you get to use the skills of someone else on your team, out of hundreds of times skills and attributes are checked.I wanted to like this game. I wanted to want the Hong Kong game that came out after. But after repeatedly coming across the stuff above, as well as the most recent problem I've had where there is endless combat heading into the final battle even when there are no enemies around, and my game is corrupting save games made during combat, which means I can either run the entire last level with nothing but autosaves, or run the (high) risk of having to start over from the beginning......I cannot like it, and I cannot recommend it to anyone unless they're incredibly masochistic. Finishing this game has become a task I have to force myself to do, and even then the game is preventing me from doing it with this corrupt savegame issue.			"

												Pay attention, everyone. THIS is how you adapt a tabletop system to a videogame. Shadowrun Returns is what that looks like.The game is mechanically sound and tactically interesting. The combat is straightforward enough to pick up easily, but as you upgrade your character and progress through the game, your options and strategies become more complex. Character progression is also quite well-handled; although you have tremendous freedom in choosing how to spend your ""Karma,"" the game seems to do an excellent job of keeping all your choices balanced and avoiding game-breaker builds.All of this is backed up by a lovely, slick interface (with just the occasional hiccup or quirk), an excellent soundtrack, and a content editor so that users may make their own campaigns. I have not tried the editor, but there is no shortage of custom content in the Steam workshop right now, so I presume it works.The default campaign is quite solid, itself. It acts as a perfect introduction to this universe, and features exceptionally strong writing- something I can't say about nearly as many games as I'd like. A good portion of my enjoyment of Shadowrun Returns came directly from the strength of the setting and story. (The final twist is a bit of a letdown, but in the context of everything that has already happened, it feels alright and is easy enough to overlook.)Make no mistake, if setting and story aren't your thing and you'd rather play something more strictly gameplay-oriented, this is really not that game. I say that not because the gameplay is lacking, but because the story is given such high priority. You will spend a lot of time talking to people. Interesting, well-written people, but not everyone cares for that.If that doesn't sound like a problem to you, then I would absolutely recommend this game.			"

												As a fan of the Shadowrun tabletop RPG setting since way before playing the videogames, I can say this game is a dream.Shadowrun Returns is based on a setting that I know and love for a long time. The main campaign has great writing and it feels like it was made for old time fans. But the best idea is the editor. This tool was a dream for people like me, that spent hours creating shadowrun adventures that where never played to the end.The world of Shadowrun takes some time to understand. It is a cyberpunk future where magic has returned, elves, dwarfs, orcs and trolls, dragons and magical swords get along with high-tech cyberware modifications, virtual realities that you access directly in your brain and self-conscious AIs. The gameplay of Shadowrun Returns is turn-based combat and text dialogues, no voice-acting. Still, the story is worth reading.Great game, offers a lot, but it is just a first step. The sequels are now a much better option.Positive points* Very faithful adaptation of a tabletop RPG* Easy to play, also on AndroidNegative points* Limited combat and character options* The editor engine is not optimized, you have to buy the sequels to have access to better options.

												As mentioned in other reviews, character modeling could be better, and the music could have more variety, but I've greatly enjoyed playing it. It's not a long campaign, but it's not so short. It took me 15 hours to finish it, and I loved every one of them. The best points, imo, were the background (as I've been roleplaying since the 80's and I used to love the original paper rpg), and the story. I think this campaign had a lot of what Shadowrun players used to love, with a strong storytelling, beautiful sets and 2D artwork, and enough of the cyberpunk world to fit a story of this length (not too much, not too few).And for the weakest points, I've missed looting bodies after a shooting, and that kind of stuff, but I guess it's just a balance factor to get rid of and simplify the system. But as I started the game with a pistol, and my oponents had shotguns, I could have used one of those, and sell the others! xDAnyway, I highly recommed playing it, it was great fun and made me want to play the paper rpg again! :)			"

												There's a lot more better review than the one I'm writting now so I'm just gonna make this one short:The gameplay derives from familiar style found in Final Fantasy Tactic series and XCOM series in terms of combat while throwing in elements of RPG and storytelling in it. Your character build-up might determine how you tackle each battle and in some cases ""maximizing"" the profit gained, as well influencing some of the conversations in-game without affecting the story. Was considering to jump straight to Shadowrun: Dragonfall at first but decided to give this one a shot. Short game but wasn't disappointed with it....			"

												Its about time that Shadowrun went back into the RPG in the world of gaming, i'm so bless that Kickstarter helped made this game possible and the creators did a fantastic job with having an interesting story called the Dead Man's Switch that involves classic history and film noir together. And i also love the fact that you can you create your own stories, or subscribe to other fan custom stories through Steam Workshop, now that's what makes Shadowrun Returns even more worthy of the title Returns. For any Shadowrun fan, or fans of the either or both of the 16-Bit games on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. I highly recommend Shadowrun Returns!

												I am not sure how to review this game because it has clear faults, and there are things that I wish were done better, yet I really enjoy it to the point that I know own the next 2 versions as well.That says a lot and anyone who enjoys turn based xcom style games probably will enjoy this one as well, albeit it is closer to Terror From The Deep than the most recent 3D offerings graphically.I didn't know anything about the setting for this game and it is as good as any I guess, not really my cup of tea but the game makes it worthwhile. Generally everyone is downtrodden and you are one of the few fighting against the injustice / being a thief because those you are fighting against are legally in power. If you want your character to be pure (Thing DnD Lawful Good) then you are in the wrong setting as a result, but I got over it (And all my DnD characters ARE Lawful Good).Character classes seem diverse, though it looks like melee probably has a hefty 'being shot in the face on the way' penalty but there is little in the way of nuance. You have 1 'stat' and then health, anything put into other areas just diversivies your abilities and weakens you. No spreading points around for a smooth talking gunsmith for example, or at least not if you want to be good at either.In fact as far as smooth talking goes there isn't really such a thing, all skills are combat related.Combat is good though, animations are ok, story is good and I imagine gives a very good introduction to the setting so it feels like you are being introduced to a franchise but done very well rather than forced onto you. By the end of the game I expect you will also be looking for more. Thankfully there already are more!			"

												Love this game.  I originally got dragonfall thinking it included the first one (Shadowrun Returns) and having not played any of them before and not touching any turn based games in years it was, very hard to me.  After reading that SRR is a bit slower and better to learn from I got it and have been learning a lot more about playing.  Even as I'm not that great at it and still get killed a lot and have to redo parts, it's still an amazing game. I am hard pressed to want to read dialog in most games.  This one is interesting enough that even though it is very heavy on the dialog, I find that the writing is well done, enough that you don't wan to miss anything.  It's not a lot of empty writing like filler or fluff but it drives the story and most times there are details you don't want to miss, or you might not be able to get to the next part.  The characters have personality even without the fancy voice acting and 3d character animations and cutscenes.  I'm so impressed I plan to return to Dragonfall after this, and Hong Kong is already in my library too.  (those reviews to come later) Tip for new players in this game - pay attention to your builds, learn how to use the Karma points, search for tips and tutorials if you have to or it is indeed a frustrating game to the newb.  Stick with it, it is well worth playing through - even though i'm sure I have quite a ways to go, I'm enjoying every minute.  Highly recommended!			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a story-driven RPG with something akin to XCOM's combat system (albeit a few tweaks and more customization per character).  There isn't any choice that drives the plot in a different direction but there are multiple ways to deal with the smaller scenarios you're presented with, such as how to get into a blocked off area.  These ultimately do not affect the larger story but it's nice to have these smaller interactions in lieu of that.Also, some dialog options are locked behind choices you make during character creation, and occasionally others are behind skill checks.  So that plus the multiple routes in each level makes up for what I imagine were budgetary constraints that prevented a multi-path narrative.  It was a Kickstarter after all.  I don't know if this is the case for the future titles in the series, so don't judge those based on this.  I'm only talking about the base game.The skill system in this game is satisfying, using a steady stream of points instead of levels.  I like all the different ways I can customize my character.  The classes all feel varied and interesting, and they fit the world really well.Shadowrun is well written, even if the story is not revolutionary.  It has fast paced dialog and isn't overly wordy, like the aforementioned Pillars of Eternity, or most games which people claim are ""well written.""  It doesn't bog you down in detail, yet it also provides quite sufficient descriptions to give you a good understanding of everything.  Sometimes the world's ""slang"" feels a bit cheesy (like using 'frag' instead of ♥♥♥♥).  I love a world that has its own slang, like in Clockwork Orange, but that slang was far more believable.  I don't believe for a second that people would say frag and stop saying ♥♥♥♥.Even with a bad story, I'd still be interested because the world that this is set in is fantastic.  It's a cross of D&D, Blade Runner, and Deus Ex.  I've not played any of the other games/tabletop games in this ruleset before so the whole thing is new to me, and I really found myself drawn into it immediately.  The only critique is that it's too bleak to be plausible.  No society with the technological capability of this one could crumble to the place that this one does.  Still, it is a work of fiction, and it's established well enough to overlook the unlikeliness of it.  The story deals with serious subjects like drug addiction, racism, torture, etc. but it also manages to keep a lot of levity in there as well.  It takes itself seriously enough, but not to a point where it's brooding or depressing at all.Overall it's a nice little game which I've enjoyed far more than many other releases.  I avoided the game for its middling reviews, but I am upset that I did in retrospect.  I'd have liked to play these games earlier when I was searching for something to play.  I really love the XCOM type combat, the classes are all interesting, the story is sufficient, and the world is really great.And this is gonna seem strange, but there's some real oomph to when characters get shot, and that has made me want to play the game almost more than anything else about it.  There's something about when games make something feel right that I just love.  I played Spiderman 2 on PS2 for dozens and dozens of hours just because of how web slinging felt correct.  I remember playing San Andreas and thinking about how differently each of the cars felt from one another, and how they all felt right in their own way.  This game, the way it feels when you shoot someone and it makes impact, it just feels correctly made.  I realize that there's probably nothing more subjective than to say that I enjoy the way it feels to shoot enemies in this game, but it's my review, so whatever.  Get the game.			"

												I know who Jordan Weissman is and am aware of many things he's done, but I had no idea Shadowrun was anything more than a video game, much less something of his; all I've ever known it as was, until this version, a Super Nintendo game.  But then I went looking for a wiki for this game, and holy crap at the decades of history.How have none of the tabletop-playing, hard-RPG grocking people on my friend list showed me this?  Damn Magic: The Gathering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, keeping the cool stuff all to yourselves <.< It hits like 20 of my sweet spots....its a cyberpunk Blade Runner-esq style (does anyone else remember Johnny Mnemonic? it smells a lot like that, only good.), its an isometric turn-based RPG like those of old (FALLOUT!!), etc. Now I gotta buy Dragonfall when it goes on sale, until then I'm gonna toy with some of the user-created campaigns on the Workshop to see what people can do with the tools available to them.I'd give an actual, proper review/recommendation, but honestly considering its age and history, if you care about Shadowrun (or anything else bearing Jordan Weissman's name) at all, you probably already know more about it than I do, I have to google certain words they use to understand what they're saying xD but I really dig the atmosphere and the gameplay is...well, Blade Runner-style isometric turn-based (AP system, not one move per turn, think Fallout rather than Final Fantasy) RPG, that about covers it. The thing you picture after reading that sentence is very close to being accurate.			"

												Rating: 7/10Budget: Worth it. Replayability: Low - The story doesn't change enough to warrant an additional playthrough. Length: Good - Custom missions too. Shadowrun Returns is actually a really great game. I have a few issues with it. You have to pick a playstyle extremely early in the game, and it's very difficult to know what is the right choice for you - Especially seeing as you have no way of controlling what classes your companions in the game will have. This is actually a much bigger problem than one might initially think. I tried going for a non-combat build, actually. I wanted to be the ""face"" of my party, but have my goons fight for me. Didn't work out - impossible to play this way. You HAVE to be able to fight SOMEHOW, so this was a letdown for me. Especially considering how much of the game you can actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t your way through later on. It's also fairly easy to make a character who is simply so good at fighitng that you can kill everything the game ever sends your direction. The games combat system is a bit rough and while a good translation from actual shadowrun, there's a reason that system is a bit of a cult novelty - It's just very rough in general. Over-all good game, but read a guide or something to save some frustrations.			"

Quest/story sucks, My main problem is that it is not even OPEN world; you are forced to follow the story and you cant even explore at all every thing you do and everywhere you go is controlled by the story; its more like reading a book than playing an RPG you dont get to make any choices.

												I am not sure how to review this game because it has clear faults, and there are things that I wish were done better, yet I really enjoy it to the point that I know own the next 2 versions as well.That says a lot and anyone who enjoys turn based xcom style games probably will enjoy this one as well, albeit it is closer to Terror From The Deep than the most recent 3D offerings graphically.I didn't know anything about the setting for this game and it is as good as any I guess, not really my cup of tea but the game makes it worthwhile. Generally everyone is downtrodden and you are one of the few fighting against the injustice / being a thief because those you are fighting against are legally in power. If you want your character to be pure (Thing DnD Lawful Good) then you are in the wrong setting as a result, but I got over it (And all my DnD characters ARE Lawful Good).Character classes seem diverse, though it looks like melee probably has a hefty 'being shot in the face on the way' penalty but there is little in the way of nuance. You have 1 'stat' and then health, anything put into other areas just diversivies your abilities and weakens you. No spreading points around for a smooth talking gunsmith for example, or at least not if you want to be good at either.In fact as far as smooth talking goes there isn't really such a thing, all skills are combat related.Combat is good though, animations are ok, story is good and I imagine gives a very good introduction to the setting so it feels like you are being introduced to a franchise but done very well rather than forced onto you. By the end of the game I expect you will also be looking for more. Thankfully there already are more!			"

												Pay attention, everyone. THIS is how you adapt a tabletop system to a videogame. Shadowrun Returns is what that looks like.The game is mechanically sound and tactically interesting. The combat is straightforward enough to pick up easily, but as you upgrade your character and progress through the game, your options and strategies become more complex. Character progression is also quite well-handled; although you have tremendous freedom in choosing how to spend your ""Karma,"" the game seems to do an excellent job of keeping all your choices balanced and avoiding game-breaker builds.All of this is backed up by a lovely, slick interface (with just the occasional hiccup or quirk), an excellent soundtrack, and a content editor so that users may make their own campaigns. I have not tried the editor, but there is no shortage of custom content in the Steam workshop right now, so I presume it works.The default campaign is quite solid, itself. It acts as a perfect introduction to this universe, and features exceptionally strong writing- something I can't say about nearly as many games as I'd like. A good portion of my enjoyment of Shadowrun Returns came directly from the strength of the setting and story. (The final twist is a bit of a letdown, but in the context of everything that has already happened, it feels alright and is easy enough to overlook.)Make no mistake, if setting and story aren't your thing and you'd rather play something more strictly gameplay-oriented, this is really not that game. I say that not because the gameplay is lacking, but because the story is given such high priority. You will spend a lot of time talking to people. Interesting, well-written people, but not everyone cares for that.If that doesn't sound like a problem to you, then I would absolutely recommend this game.			"

												Its about time that Shadowrun went back into the RPG in the world of gaming, i'm so bless that Kickstarter helped made this game possible and the creators did a fantastic job with having an interesting story called the Dead Man's Switch that involves classic history and film noir together. And i also love the fact that you can you create your own stories, or subscribe to other fan custom stories through Steam Workshop, now that's what makes Shadowrun Returns even more worthy of the title Returns. For any Shadowrun fan, or fans of the either or both of the 16-Bit games on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. I highly recommend Shadowrun Returns!

												TL;DR - Great story/setting, great character customisation, levels/gameplay is fairly linear which restricts the RPG elements of the game, overall a really fun game, worth the money, just have to take it as it is. Before I give my thoughts on this game, I'd like to make it clear that this is the first Shadowrun game I have played, although I am aware of the franchise and it's history. (Tabletop, PC/Console games etc.)Story/Setting: The game overall is pretty solid and good fun. It has a decent story with twists and turns and an amusing ending. You encounter likeable characters and the world is a great representation of Cyberpunk, with it's own take on things with the addition of magic.  Character Customisation:You get to make your own runner at the start of the game and there is a lot to work with from melee characters, armed characters, Deckers (hackers), Riggers (drones), Mages (spells, traps, heal), Shamans (Similar to mages, can also raise spirits, creatures and demons). However where this game shines is you really have the power to go all out with one type of class or mix any of them and make a unique build of your own. (I think I got all the classes correct there. Or near enough!) I'd say this game has great potential for replay value as you could try out all the different classes avaliable, however it wouldn't be something you'd jump straight back into after compleing in my opion, as the story and levels are fairly linear.Mechanics/Gameplay:Everything works as it should in this game and I encountered no issues at all. However I would say the game is a little lacking in RPG elements in my opinion. Let's call it CRPG-Lite! (That was terrible)A couple of areas that came to mind; In conversations you do have the ability to convice, bribe and use etiquettes to persuade and win people over to your side which you would expect with an RPG, but, what I feel was lacking was that you can't really♥♥♥♥♥♥someone off in dialogue or make them hate you and never talk to you again like you can in some RPGs, ultimately conversations (It would appear) all have the same conclusion, you just have little things you can do here and there if you spec'd in charisma, you bribe them or have the correct etiquette.I think this is because the levels and story are fairly linear for an RPG that it can't really give you that freedom. There are oppourtunities that you can miss out on if you give the wrong responses, but in an RPG I want it to be truly diverse in the sense that I can ♥♥♥♥ up an oppurtunity and then I have to go out of my way find another way to achieve my goal/quest. This game ultimately always seems to come to the same conclusion regardless. The other major area that felt a little lacking was the combat, it has the average top down, turn based combat mechanics but I wish it was more like Wasteland 2's. You can get behind cover, but some you can't shoot around, your character literally can't step out with one foot and shoot around a doorway or down a corridor. Just a bit more control over combat and the ability to make better stratergies would have made the combat near-perfect!Other little issues I had were things like not being able to examine the environments other than what the devs wanted you to see. Lack of dialogue/text box like in most RPGs, that displays examine text, Character thoughts and NPC dialogue etc.Overall:Overall this is a really fun game, I played it through in a few days and was pretty glued to it. At first I was a little disappointed with the lack of RPG elements I'm used to, but I quickly accepted that Shadowrun is it's own thing and does it a little differently. I'm really impressed with Harebrained Schemes and that they've successfully brought back Shadowrun. Now I have Dragonfall and Hong Kong to play, and from what I hear they've been improved a lot from this game!			"

												So, finally completed this and although I liked the story, and it has the potential to contain a lot more depth than the newly released Chronicles (multiplayer support) I was a bit dissappointed that the story is quite linear, unless I am missing something here.I played through as a custom class Human, using Shotgun, Assault Rifle (both upto 6) with the maximum amount of charisma unlocked (to enable dialogue options) and some minor spirit control - for use on summon points.A lot of the extra etiquette options are null and void, each only being used once as far as I can see, and there are not many side missions, only encountered a single side mission, and one that was suggested as optional inbetween a major mission arc. (involving coyote)Combat is nice, tactical settings and options all very good - cover, scenery, summon points and ley lines adding to strategy level.The way you build your team can totally alter the playstyle you adopt, but overall you can ham fist your way through the majority of the missions with good combat skills. (with a solid main character at least)This was a real shame because although some levels were a challenge it was mainly because of a poor choice in a combat round (don't summon 3 spirits then have them go rogue woops) not because I struggled to overcome the enemies.This carried on right up until the end, again the only difficulty coming from the choice of enemy used to progress difficulty (spirits).Totally worth the time invested but I was expecting a lot more conversational choices (2 of the etiquette lines are not even used) and a LOT more side material in line with the none combat skills I only encountered 3 places in the game where I couldn't personally unlock, influence or action something because it was based on - decking, strength, or intelligence.Even race choice and stereotype seems to have little impact.I get that this is a showcase for the engine, and the ability to mod in more content is nice, but overall the vanilla campaign had a lot more potential than a basic manhunt combat run. imo "

ShadowRun is the game you wish you had instead of playing DnDTL;DRRating: A soild 8/10Pros:  - Hours of playtime - Different play styles  - Many classes that suit all different kinds of play styles - A DnD feel to the game that all DnD players have to try - The story line is not narrow and you have choices on how to solve puzzels or kill enemies.  - Turn base combat system that is actually worth waiting for.  - Tons of ways to complete missions. - Complete charcter customization - Well priced for the contentCons: To begin with the game is not for people looking for a shootem up and kick everyones asses as soon as they get into the room. It's turn based. - Can get borning in some areas, but the game makes up for it with combat and great story telling. - Lacking some content, wish there was a bit more.Conclusion: The game is worth paying the $15. If you're into a DnD play style then this game is for you. Hours of fun and so many ways to complete the game. I'd pick it up if it was on sale if you want to save some money.			"

												Pros:- Nice visuals, awesome portraits, the art style is very fitting and immersive.- The combat system is enjoyable but could use some polish.- Dialogues and NPCs in general are very well written.- The story is part dumb, part engaging. It fits into the setting, altough it somewhat turns downhill towards the second half. The writing is good for the most part though.- The setting, I personally love the setting. Cons:- The combat, despite its solid foundation feels cheap and too easy. - The decking sections are super boring.- The game is waaay too linear for an RPG. It takes away from the awesome dialogues when you know you can't change a drek no matter what you say/do.- The music is rather forgettable. - The spell effects are down right ugly.- The game world is gated behind loading screens and comes in small chunks. In this regard it's similar to Deus Ex - you're being teleported from location to location, thus the world seems small and contained.They did an awesome job of bringing Shadowrun to PC, but sadly it's just isn't that good of a game. Feels more like an interactive novel, an introduction into the world of Shadowrun. The dialogues, the NPCs, the visuals and the cyberpunk distopia, the immersion of being a runner... it's all there and it's a pleasant journey for the fan of the setting. It's just it doesn't feel like you're DOING anything, other than watch the game play itself.  It's like this GM friend who's got this really awesome story he wants to tell you... but you can't alter a thing, your PC is but a pawn in his hands and you can only sit, listen and bask in the ambience. And if the story was indeed as good as he promised I would have enjoyed the ride way better.Either way, if the story was better or the gameplay was more polished the score would have been higher. As is the final score sits somewhere around 6-7/10. Still, the game is so cheap these days, and the setting is so awesome you should buy it anyway.			"

												Wow.  Great game so far.  It's like they took the SNES Shadowrun, made it a hundred times better, and merged it with the books.  Playing this games makes me want to start up an Shadowrun group with my friends, or at least merge Shadowrun elements into a DnD 3.5 set up.			"

												Extraordinary level design. The amount of detail put into each and every building is staggering.The only remark I'm having is that the game is too linear. No sidemissions you can pick up whenever you feel like making a quick buck. Other than that; A okay!			"

												I'm not sure why this game has had so many bad reviews; I really enjoyed it.Shadowrun Returns is based on the old pen and paper role playing game Shadowrun. Set in a world where magic has ""returned"" to the Earth along with races that we are all familiar with in Fantasy stories. Magic and technology, spells and hacking all blend into this mishmash of Cyberpunk and Fantasy, and for the most part it works pretty well.The mechanics of the game will be familiar with anyone who has enjoyed games such as Fallout 1 & 2 or any X-Com games. The game has turn based combat and a deep class system, wherein you level, spend points (known as Karma) and find more powerful weapons, clothing and spells.The campaign that comes with the game: ""Dead man's switch"" is quite enjoyable, if a little short, however this game has steam workshop and plenty of mods to try out once you are done.A few negative things do crop up in this game, however. First and most obvious from the get-go, the graphics are horrendous; they are actually not that far beyond the Super Nintendo game and that was made in 1993... but graphics aren't everything right? What about the fact that you cannot export your character that you so lovingly built up in the campaign into other mods? Unless you basically hack the game, that is. And just like any game with ""dice rolls"" this game is seriously suspect when it comes to calculating chance.All in all good game. It needs to have more accessibility so that you can export characters into different adventures, but you will still get alot out of it.			"

												A return to to Shadowrun is like coming back to an old friend. I used to play and love ""Shadowrun"" for the SNES - never played the P&P RPG - but I was too young to fully understand the world and lore. Getting back into it now, the memories have come flooding back to me, along with the old enjoyment I felt of exploring a cyberpunk world full of corporate elves and shadowrunning orks.This is a game without voice actors, without an advanced 3D engine, and without amazing particle effects. It is, however, a game with some fantastic and moody writing (and benefits from no voice actors because of this, IMO), a memorable story, and an ending with great closure. Before I get into pointing out a few things I liked and disliked, if you're a fan of RPGs with a focus on story and setting, this game is for you.I played once through the Dead Man's Switch campaign, and I'm still a little undecided on how I feel about the leveling system. It seems, to me, a little bit simple. It could definitely benefit from some type of ""perks"" system that you could put points into that allow the gameplay to vary some. As it stands, it's all a bit too straight-forward for my liking, without any real hard decisions to make. if you want to use SMGs and be a decker, you just put karma points into those two stat lines, and that's about it. It's not bad, just not great.The story, however, is wonderful, along with the characters. Coyote is memorable, and I hope to see her appear in the next expansion as well, and it was nice to see Jake Armitage make an appearance early. It really helped ground the game in the Shadowrun lore. There was a bit of a running red herring throughout the story (at least, I'm pretty sure it was), and I was genuinely happy to see the villain turn out a bit differently than I thought.The actual combat is a bit like a simplified version of X-COM. It's turn-based, it utilizes a rudimentary cover system, and it includes magic along with gunplay. It's fun enough, but, along with the leveling system, seems a bit on the simple side, without much variation. This could be alleviated some, I feel, by using scripting to make the combat encounters more interesting. The shoot-out in the cemetery, for example, was easily, IMO, the best encounter of the game as it added variety and surprise in the middle of the fight.And, of course, the editor! I dabbled in this for a number of hours, and it seems perfectly robust and easy to use if you've ever modded games in the past to any extent. I have experience creating modules for Neverwinter Nights, and the Shadowrun Returns editor is mercifully easier to use when scripting, as it gives you the language to select from, instead of you having to discover it yourself.All in all, I definitely recommend this game to those who are either Shadowrun fans, RPG fans that love a good story (and aren't afraid to read as it seems a lot of gamers are these days), or want to create your own stories using the editor. I would give Shadowrun Returns a 7.5/10.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a digital translation of the pen and paper game. The Shadowrun rulebook contained a short adventure/module/run/gig that served to demonstrate the game's mechanics. In those days it was expected that the GM would make their own runs. In that same way Shadowrun Returns was released with a short run. Soon thereafter the workshop filled with community crafted runs.Please do not look at this game based solely on the released run, look at the community crafted runs as well.Full disclosure: I play this for nostalgic reasons and the low metascore bums me out.

												These still waters run deep.I could try to give this a # out of 10, but I'm not measuring up one game... This isn't just Shadowrun's return... as of this review there are hundreds of other 20+ hour hand-crafted adventures / ""expansions"" / free fan-made DLC that is every bit as legit as the official campaign.  I'm not quite sure you realize without thinking for a second what that implies.You're getting every ""tabletop RPG"" story that someone never got to DM physically- virtually and free with the Steam Workshop.  Buying in to a game that only ends if the content is stopped being made.  Even the developers are in on it and expanding the game with the community:https://www.youtube.com/user/HarebrainedSchemes/videosCustomized campaigns made by dedicated gamers including the original SNES title remastered for FREE!Infinite Baldur's Gate sessions with guns and a simpler X-com-esque cover system.Unlimited cyberpunk sagas made by fans for fans forever.There are only a few games like this, such as Torchlight 2, L4D2 where the community members develop the game further than the original team had a capacity for.This game will never end.  You will never EVER finish all of the possible content AND can choose your own adventure(s) in doing so.I LOVE games like this, where it's in our hands... but this time, the developers are here guiding us, building with us, and inspiring us all the while like a good DM does.I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ you thought this game was before reading reviews, but if you sell this title short, you are literally selling short the potential of imagination and role play that this game offers.  Go back to COD, if guns without a reason to fight means that much.  But I'm willing to bet you wouldn't be here reading this review if it wasn't for a well-deserved curiousity and interest, and this game is far more interesting than at first sight.			"

												As far as turn-based RPGs go, Shadowrun Returns doesn't bring anything new to the table, and its main story mission isn't very long. It makes up for it, though, by still being incredibly fun to play-- the dialogue is cleverly written, the game mechanics are solid, and the world is well-crafted. Fans of the Shadowrun roleplay game will enjoy this, and the fact that it allows for a lot of fan-created missions makes it that much better.			"

												Shadowrun Returns tells a well-written tale of murder and conspiracy called The Dead Man's Switchstories in its long-dormant sci-fi/fantasy universe. Even though it seems like an open-world RPG, in reality it's really linear, directly funneling you from one mission to the next. There are some well-done puzzles that require information-gathering detective work, and some areas that have problems that can be solved in at least two ways – reprogram a blank access card or steal one. But very few of my decisions in dialogue had any significant impact on how events played out. I liked the great told story and the illustrated pdf with a bunch of stories. It had a cool setting I wanted to explore but couldn't because it was too linear. The light tactical combat on hard was fun and not too challenging. All in all it is a good classic RPG with some well told twists.			"

												Returns is wiz. Definitely worth the full $20, and maybe more.Though it lacks many of the finer details and nuances Shadowrun fans expect, Returns is an ambitious jump that promises to bring the world of Shadowrun to a wider variety of players through its accessible gameplay and campaign-building tools. The official campaign is a fast-paced crash course through a uniquely colorful noir world, with the writing and artwork delivering a healthy injection of personality, cosmopolitanism, and humanity to a modern sci-fi genre in dire need of an alternative to geometrically recycled blockbuster epics. Even if the simplistic game mechanics can sometimes seem underutilized or frustrating, Returns opens the gate for a broad range of Shadowrun experiences while providing a definitive introduction to newcomers and welcoming diehard fans.

												I've played through a couple times and I'm a big fan. I agree with one of the other reviewers that the writing is particularily rich and well done. I think the visuals are quite good for what you pay for and for a game so cheap, you get a lot of content. Some things seem a little 'meat and potatos', like the design of the character customization screen but generally though, well polished!Now that I've played the game, I wish I could pay 4x the price and get 4x the content.I think if you're a fan of RPGs, fantasy/sci-fi, and turn based combat, you really can't go wrong. It's $15! I've got waaay more satisfaction out of this game then the last pizza I ate.			"

And even though it's short, I feel I'd tire of this game if it went on for more missions... I didn't feel it was all that complex. You're essentialy killing baddies in every mission, with very little variance. Even the Matrix missions were just two color versions of the ""meat world."" I'd like to play other scenarios/missions with different characters though.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is in many ways a half-baked game. It's short, not terribly deep, not particularly pretty, and often reminds you that it's a game. Despite this, there's a fantastic deal to like about Shadowrun Returns.Shadowrun Returns (SR) is the second of the major profile video games funded via crowdfunding platform Kickstarter while still in the pre-planning stages to be released. The campaign ran in April 2012, and pulled in about 1.83 million dollars, well over its minimum funding goal of 400,000 dollars. SR is the fourth video game based on the pen-and-paper roleplaying setting Shadowrun, and is the first to not be called simply by its setting's name. The game builds on the story of the first two Shadowrun games - the first released for the SNES, the second on the Genesis - and disregards the third one - released for the 360, PS3 and the PC - on account of it being a multiplayer game with no story.At first glance, Shadowrun is one of the most archetypical cyberpunk settings available in tabletop gaming. It's perpetually rainy, everything is owned by soulless megacorporations, poverty is widespread and the Internet is a world in itself. In a market saturated with these kinds of settings, you need a special something to stand out, and what makes Shadowrun one of the most popular games in the genre is its overlap with standard fantasy. In 2012, magic unexpectedly returned to the world, transforming many humans into dwarves, elves, orcs, trolls, and more. Many were gifted with magical abilities, while dragons awakened from their deep slumber. Two generations later, magic and technology coexist in a society rife with racial (specieal?) tensions and little hope in sight.The game casts you in the down-on-your-luck shoes of one of the eponymous Shadowrunners - a sort of mercenary-slash-master criminal that lives in the cracks of society. Work has been scarce lately after a botched shadowrun, and you are down to your last saved Nuyens when a colleague contacts you about a job. Or, more specifically, the recording of a colleague - as it turns out, your old acquaintance got himself killed, and is contacting you to let you know that his life insurance payout is yours if you will bring his killer to justice. Having no other options, you accept, taking the first step towards unravelling the convoluted mystery behind his death.The simple motivation of trying to get at a former coworker's insurance money is a great story hook. Even the best Shadowrunner is little more than a pawn on the big corporations' boards, and, to mix metaphors, you're little more than a deuce in the Suit of Pawns at this point. As a result, the story is largely personal, and it's up to you if you're just in it for the money, justice or revenge. The interaction is reminiscent of Planescape: Torment, in that much of the environmental interaction is done via dialogue trees or by reading text hovering over the environment, although SR never comes close to Torment's sheer verbosity. All in all, the story is excellently told - it's well-written, has good twists, ups the stakes at the right spots, and has interesting characters. That said, the last third isn't as interesting as the preceding material, as the focus starts to move away from your own story, and it must be noted that there is a complete absence of voice acting in the game - a shame, as the dialogue is superb.Who your character is is up to you - the character creation system is open-ended, and doesn't restrict skills to certain character classes like many RPGs do. Although you may opt to choose one of the ready-made decks, such as the melee-centric Street Samurai or the hacking-oriented Decker, there is no penalty for distributing skill points according to your own preferences instead. You can pick your own name, be male or female, and may choose to be human, elf, dwarf, troll, or orc. The choice of race (species) gives certain minor bonuses and affects the maximum level a particular stat can reach (each skill or subskill is tied to a particular stat, and can't be higher than the stat or skill it's nested under), and you will be treated differently in-game depending on your choice of race (species) and gender. All in all, it's pretty standard stuff for an RPG, but the system is very open, and if you feel like playing as a troll Decker who dabbles in shamanism, go for it.The game is controlled from an isometric perspective, and is divided into two discrete sections: exploration and combat. While exploring, you can only control your own character, and mostly click on objects or non-playable characters to interact with them. There is usually not a lot to interact with, but there is usually just enough to keep exploration rewarding, even if it's just in the form of another description of the environment. Skills and stats are frequently used to solve problems in ways that give better results, although since the game is fairly short, most skills are only used once or twice each. The game is also fairly rigid; the player has little input on how the story plays out, aside from the details. Interestingly, SR does not use an experience point-based system; instead, ""karma points"" are doled out after completing certain tasks. These points are then spent in the skill tree, improving your character directly. Oddly, ""evil"" decisions will apparently not yield karma points, which is a strange design choice. That said, there are more than enough karma points to go around.Unlike most CRPGs, SR is a very linear game. Each level is its own microcosm that can't be exited until the game tells you to, and while there are a number of recurring levels throughout the game - most notably the Seamstresses Union, the town-equivalent you visit between missions - most of them occur in sequence; as such, it doesn't feel as if you're returning to places already visited, but rather to different versions of them. This plays into how the game rewards the player as well: on certain levels, skill checks will have become noticably harder, and equipment upgrades will usually by straight numerical improvements. It's somewhat immersion-breaking, as it feels as if you're just being rewarded for the sake of it. In combat, the game switches to what might be termed XCOM-lite mode. The combat is turn-based, with each participant moving their entire party on their turn. Each character has two or three action points, and each point allows you to move a certain amount of squares or perform some other action, such as attack or cast a spell. Scattered throughout the environment are walls and objects that can be used for partial or full cover. If a character is outfitted with a ""datajack"" they may access the Matrix (the Internet); however, Matrix gameplay is little more than an underdeveloped version of normal combat, and it is a mixed blessing that it is used only maybe half a dozen times, mostly in the second half of the game. Overall, the combat is not outstanding, but it does the job, and it can be rewarding to successfully play off each character's attributes to achieve optimum results. Graphically, the game looks alright. The backgrounds are high-res images, and while not fantastic-looking, they do contribute a great deal artistically to the atmosphere. Sound effects are what you would expect, and the music is mostly moody synthesizer tunes that complement the setting well.Shadowrun Returns may have its rough edges and be a fairly shallow experience at times, but the superb writing, great atmosphere and satisfying gameplay makes it well worth the low price that matches its length. Finally, since tradition dictates I say it: never, ever, cut a deal with a dragon.			"

												Summary:  This is probably the best ShadowRun adaptation to a video game I've ever played.  Fun RPG sci-fi experience packed into a small game.  Gameplay and innovation over pretty effects and graphics.  The game also has a toolset you can use to create your own adventures, which is a bonus.  Even better, you can use the Steam Workshop to download cool stuff other people have made to add massive replay value to the game.  For the price, this game is definitely worth it.Cons:  Short.  I think it took me less than 20 hours to finish.  The graphics are unimpressive, and there is no voiceover or flashy effects that you see in most modern games.  This definitely has a ""shoestring budget"" feel to it.  Pros:  Great story.  Great storytelling.  It had a very nostalgic feel, and I liked it.  The gameplay was a lot of fun, which trumps everything I listed in the Cons section.  It doens't matter how pretty the game is if it's not any fun to play.  I love turn-based strategy and RPG, and this game blends the two together very nicely.  Lots of latitude on how to shape your character, and multiple ways to finish challenges in the game.  The Shadowrun universe was nicely represented.			"

												I am told Dragonfall is the good stuff, while the original campaign is crude and crappy? Well, I have not played Dragonfall (yet), but I can tell you the original campaign is one of the best RPG stories I have played in a long time. It's a solid (linear) story. Just like the old pen and paper Shadowrun I used to play, you never know where the rabbit hole ends, and if you don't try to rush through it, you are in for one hell of an epic tale that will keep you engaged for several days. There are some difficulty spikes, but never had to retry a mission more than once. You will adapt easily.The engine is functional and effective, the graphics are beautiful, the writting is more than good. The modding tools a huge bonus.One negative aspect: while the atmosphere is well developed, the music is terribly repetitive, specially in combat.EDIT, AFTER PLAYING DRAGONFALLSadly I didn't finish Dragonfall, so what I can say about it is limited. What I can say, however, is that it appeared uninteresting to me to the extent of ultimately dropping it. I didn't really care for the characters and the atmosphere was kind of out of place in my opinion.			"

												Dragonfall is an elegantly constructed true roleplaying game. I have been playing roleplay for 25 years, and I would most definately recommend this plot. The storyline is surprising and detailed. For instance playing the standard nice-paladin-nice and getting all bonus quests etc. simply will not work, you will get comments like ""kissass"" and will help maniacs if you do. You really have to make true choices all along.NPC interactions are well constructed, but not as good as in Dragonage.Graphics is still primitive, like Baldurs gate 1, with very limited interaction possibilities.The cybersamurai with an Ares Alpha still rules, but if you want more challenge, try playing a mage.Mostly you can use the skills of your team, but sometimes it is impossible to do certain things like looking at a panel in astral space despite having a mage on the team. Total evaluation is 10 on the story. 4 on the graphics. A must-play for true roleplaying fanatics like myself.			"

Note: This is for the base game only, Dragonfall review is on the standalone Dragonfall game.+: Great graphics for what it is, creates the Shadowrun atmosphere and feel very well.+: The story is pretty great until the end, not that it gets really bad but they just didn't do it as well as it could have been done.+: The gameplay is really solid and this is a solid recreation of the tabletop experience as a turn based strategy RPG.+: People who played the original SNES game will enjoy their homage to it. :)+: Workshop has a bunch of new campaigns you can play for free, some of which are really good.-: There isn't enough choices in this game. Not too much you can do to change the ending much and some skill trees are just out right not useful or far too useful.-: Party members aren't as engaging or as likeable as they should be. Some of them kind of just feel like they are there to round out your party and be better than the people you could hire. Also kind of lame that you can't change their skills or equipment really.-: For anyone who is a Shadowrun fan, they did Harlequin absolutely terribly, it is actually absurd how bad he is in comparison to his tabletop character. This is actually the thing I like the least about this game, but if you aren't a big fan of Shadowrun you won't care/notice the issue.			"

												First of all, I'm not a long-time fan; My first contact with the Shadowrun franchise was with this game. Though of course you miss out on stuff if you're not familiar with the lore, it's easy enough to catch on. Cleared Dead Man's Switch and Dragonfall. Ten hours for the former, twenty for the latter. Combat is a turn-based tactical thing that would be best described as a slightly more streamlined but also dumbed-down version of XCOM's battle system. It's okay.DMS is pretty linear and has a relatively barebones story, but gives room for roleplaying. I played a decker, however, and it's really unfortunate that decker skills are pretty much useless in it.Dragonfall is much better, with more options to end each quest, well-written characters with their own backstories who stick with you throughout the game (this might not sound like much, but it's what DMS was sorely lacking), and chances for all character classes to shine (my decker/rigger actually did awesome stuff!.I VERY highly recommend this.

												Returns is wiz. Definitely worth the full $20, and maybe more.Though it lacks many of the finer details and nuances Shadowrun fans expect, Returns is an ambitious jump that promises to bring the world of Shadowrun to a wider variety of players through its accessible gameplay and campaign-building tools. The official campaign is a fast-paced crash course through a uniquely colorful noir world, with the writing and artwork delivering a healthy injection of personality, cosmopolitanism, and humanity to a modern sci-fi genre in dire need of an alternative to geometrically recycled blockbuster epics. Even if the simplistic game mechanics can sometimes seem underutilized or frustrating, Returns opens the gate for a broad range of Shadowrun experiences while providing a definitive introduction to newcomers and welcoming diehard fans.

												I've played through a couple times and I'm a big fan. I agree with one of the other reviewers that the writing is particularily rich and well done. I think the visuals are quite good for what you pay for and for a game so cheap, you get a lot of content. Some things seem a little 'meat and potatos', like the design of the character customization screen but generally though, well polished!Now that I've played the game, I wish I could pay 4x the price and get 4x the content.I think if you're a fan of RPGs, fantasy/sci-fi, and turn based combat, you really can't go wrong. It's $15! I've got waaay more satisfaction out of this game then the last pizza I ate.			"

												So I'd only recommend this if you're fond of the Shadowrun series. I liked the narrative, fits well with the mood. And even though it's short, I feel I'd tire of this game if it went on for more missions... I didn't feel it was all that complex. You're essentialy killing baddies in every mission, with very little variance. Even the Matrix missions were just two color versions of the ""meat world."" I'd like to play other scenarios/missions with different characters though.			"

												This is a good game, no question about it. It does however keep the old school roots this once tabletop game had, and doesn't thread far from its base mechanics we once played on the original NES. So this game is either for those fans of the original or those who can't get enough of cyberpunk inspired games.However, since this game is open to user made content, it does open up a whole slew of possibilitys. par example; some one is remaking the original Shadowrun on NES as a complete mod.

												Shadowrun Returns is in many ways a half-baked game. It's short, not terribly deep, not particularly pretty, and often reminds you that it's a game. Despite this, there's a fantastic deal to like about Shadowrun Returns.Shadowrun Returns (SR) is the second of the major profile video games funded via crowdfunding platform Kickstarter while still in the pre-planning stages to be released. The campaign ran in April 2012, and pulled in about 1.83 million dollars, well over its minimum funding goal of 400,000 dollars. SR is the fourth video game based on the pen-and-paper roleplaying setting Shadowrun, and is the first to not be called simply by its setting's name. The game builds on the story of the first two Shadowrun games - the first released for the SNES, the second on the Genesis - and disregards the third one - released for the 360, PS3 and the PC - on account of it being a multiplayer game with no story.At first glance, Shadowrun is one of the most archetypical cyberpunk settings available in tabletop gaming. It's perpetually rainy, everything is owned by soulless megacorporations, poverty is widespread and the Internet is a world in itself. In a market saturated with these kinds of settings, you need a special something to stand out, and what makes Shadowrun one of the most popular games in the genre is its overlap with standard fantasy. In 2012, magic unexpectedly returned to the world, transforming many humans into dwarves, elves, orcs, trolls, and more. Many were gifted with magical abilities, while dragons awakened from their deep slumber. Two generations later, magic and technology coexist in a society rife with racial (specieal?) tensions and little hope in sight.The game casts you in the down-on-your-luck shoes of one of the eponymous Shadowrunners - a sort of mercenary-slash-master criminal that lives in the cracks of society. Work has been scarce lately after a botched shadowrun, and you are down to your last saved Nuyens when a colleague contacts you about a job. Or, more specifically, the recording of a colleague - as it turns out, your old acquaintance got himself killed, and is contacting you to let you know that his life insurance payout is yours if you will bring his killer to justice. Having no other options, you accept, taking the first step towards unravelling the convoluted mystery behind his death.The simple motivation of trying to get at a former coworker's insurance money is a great story hook. Even the best Shadowrunner is little more than a pawn on the big corporations' boards, and, to mix metaphors, you're little more than a deuce in the Suit of Pawns at this point. As a result, the story is largely personal, and it's up to you if you're just in it for the money, justice or revenge. The interaction is reminiscent of Planescape: Torment, in that much of the environmental interaction is done via dialogue trees or by reading text hovering over the environment, although SR never comes close to Torment's sheer verbosity. All in all, the story is excellently told - it's well-written, has good twists, ups the stakes at the right spots, and has interesting characters. That said, the last third isn't as interesting as the preceding material, as the focus starts to move away from your own story, and it must be noted that there is a complete absence of voice acting in the game - a shame, as the dialogue is superb.Who your character is is up to you - the character creation system is open-ended, and doesn't restrict skills to certain character classes like many RPGs do. Although you may opt to choose one of the ready-made decks, such as the melee-centric Street Samurai or the hacking-oriented Decker, there is no penalty for distributing skill points according to your own preferences instead. You can pick your own name, be male or female, and may choose to be human, elf, dwarf, troll, or orc. The choice of race (species) gives certain minor bonuses and affects the maximum level a particular stat can reach (each skill or subskill is tied to a particular stat, and can't be higher than the stat or skill it's nested under), and you will be treated differently in-game depending on your choice of race (species) and gender. All in all, it's pretty standard stuff for an RPG, but the system is very open, and if you feel like playing as a troll Decker who dabbles in shamanism, go for it.The game is controlled from an isometric perspective, and is divided into two discrete sections: exploration and combat. While exploring, you can only control your own character, and mostly click on objects or non-playable characters to interact with them. There is usually not a lot to interact with, but there is usually just enough to keep exploration rewarding, even if it's just in the form of another description of the environment. Skills and stats are frequently used to solve problems in ways that give better results, although since the game is fairly short, most skills are only used once or twice each. The game is also fairly rigid; the player has little input on how the story plays out, aside from the details. Interestingly, SR does not use an experience point-based system; instead, ""karma points"" are doled out after completing certain tasks. These points are then spent in the skill tree, improving your character directly. Oddly, ""evil"" decisions will apparently not yield karma points, which is a strange design choice. That said, there are more than enough karma points to go around.Unlike most CRPGs, SR is a very linear game. Each level is its own microcosm that can't be exited until the game tells you to, and while there are a number of recurring levels throughout the game - most notably the Seamstresses Union, the town-equivalent you visit between missions - most of them occur in sequence; as such, it doesn't feel as if you're returning to places already visited, but rather to different versions of them. This plays into how the game rewards the player as well: on certain levels, skill checks will have become noticably harder, and equipment upgrades will usually by straight numerical improvements. It's somewhat immersion-breaking, as it feels as if you're just being rewarded for the sake of it. In combat, the game switches to what might be termed XCOM-lite mode. The combat is turn-based, with each participant moving their entire party on their turn. Each character has two or three action points, and each point allows you to move a certain amount of squares or perform some other action, such as attack or cast a spell. Scattered throughout the environment are walls and objects that can be used for partial or full cover. If a character is outfitted with a ""datajack"" they may access the Matrix (the Internet); however, Matrix gameplay is little more than an underdeveloped version of normal combat, and it is a mixed blessing that it is used only maybe half a dozen times, mostly in the second half of the game. Overall, the combat is not outstanding, but it does the job, and it can be rewarding to successfully play off each character's attributes to achieve optimum results. Graphically, the game looks alright. The backgrounds are high-res images, and while not fantastic-looking, they do contribute a great deal artistically to the atmosphere. Sound effects are what you would expect, and the music is mostly moody synthesizer tunes that complement the setting well.Shadowrun Returns may have its rough edges and be a fairly shallow experience at times, but the superb writing, great atmosphere and satisfying gameplay makes it well worth the low price that matches its length. Finally, since tradition dictates I say it: never, ever, cut a deal with a dragon.			"

												Summary:  This is probably the best ShadowRun adaptation to a video game I've ever played.  Fun RPG sci-fi experience packed into a small game.  Gameplay and innovation over pretty effects and graphics.  The game also has a toolset you can use to create your own adventures, which is a bonus.  Even better, you can use the Steam Workshop to download cool stuff other people have made to add massive replay value to the game.  For the price, this game is definitely worth it.Cons:  Short.  I think it took me less than 20 hours to finish.  The graphics are unimpressive, and there is no voiceover or flashy effects that you see in most modern games.  This definitely has a ""shoestring budget"" feel to it.  Pros:  Great story.  Great storytelling.  It had a very nostalgic feel, and I liked it.  The gameplay was a lot of fun, which trumps everything I listed in the Cons section.  It doens't matter how pretty the game is if it's not any fun to play.  I love turn-based strategy and RPG, and this game blends the two together very nicely.  Lots of latitude on how to shape your character, and multiple ways to finish challenges in the game.  The Shadowrun universe was nicely represented.			"

												I am told Dragonfall is the good stuff, while the original campaign is crude and crappy? Well, I have not played Dragonfall (yet), but I can tell you the original campaign is one of the best RPG stories I have played in a long time. It's a solid (linear) story. Just like the old pen and paper Shadowrun I used to play, you never know where the rabbit hole ends, and if you don't try to rush through it, you are in for one hell of an epic tale that will keep you engaged for several days. There are some difficulty spikes, but never had to retry a mission more than once. You will adapt easily.The engine is functional and effective, the graphics are beautiful, the writting is more than good. The modding tools a huge bonus.One negative aspect: while the atmosphere is well developed, the music is terribly repetitive, specially in combat.EDIT, AFTER PLAYING DRAGONFALLSadly I didn't finish Dragonfall, so what I can say about it is limited. What I can say, however, is that it appeared uninteresting to me to the extent of ultimately dropping it. I didn't really care for the characters and the atmosphere was kind of out of place in my opinion.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a game for ""old school"" gamers who like old school  turn based RPG's :DIt has an awesome art design, and soundtrack, but most important for this type of games, it has tons of text a good quality dialog.Some say it's a short game. Maybe....but i put in 37 hours, and you will find interesting content created by fans with that awesome Editor that comes with game.Story is good. It can keep you on some sort of tension until you reach half of the game. After this moment the story begin to be previsible.It has no loot, and almost zero exploration. Yep, it's quite  linear and story driven game.On the other hand the combat system works flawless, and the skills tree it's original and interesting. But because you can control all your party members, you will play with almost all classes available from first playthrough. So....re-playability is not so good.I recommend this game to those who look for an old school turn-based RPG placed in an original cyberpunk world.			"

												It's a great turn-based strategy RPG. If you like cyberpunk the setting won't dissapoint and although I kept hearing the story campaign that is included in the game is too short, I do not agree at all. It's not 40+ hours, but around 15+ it works just fine and the story feels like a proper tabletop RPG campaign. That's also true for the rest of the game; character development, dialogue options, combat, etc., really feels like a videogame version of D&D, Shadowrun (although I have no experience with the latter) etc.I'm not much of a creator, more a consumer, so I don't think I will create any campaigns myself, but I will check out some user generated content. It seems there is a lot of cool stuff being made and I'm also looking forward to the 'official' expansion.'Not an overabundance of content then, but for the price and the potential that comes with the creation tools, this is a really good game to get!

												Chuck full of references to past Shadowrun games and lore, this game surprised me. It faithfully recreates the mood and feel of a great run in the Shadowrun PnP... complete with all the twists, turns and double crosses you expect. I found myself enjoying the characters, storyline and music more than I thought I would.This is not to say that the game doesn't have its flaws. The lack of a tutorial lead to a slight delay and me overlooking ettiquette options. The game bugged out occasionally on certain actions late in the game and if it ran for a while and I alt+tabbed, the game would kind of lock up. Wish there was more in the way of skills but Iunderstand them streamlining the options on their first outting.Overall, fans of the setting and the PnP game will like this game. Its system may be a bit dated or old school but where it lacks in that department, it makes up in good storytelling.			"

The ability to create my own content with very few restrictions is what makes a game for me.  There are few developers that give such creative freedom to their fans so I am very pleased that Hairbrained Schemes have gauged their audience well and given us what we desired out of a Shadowrun video game.

												A late '90s PC RPG with the good sense to replace typical late '90s PC RPG combat with a sort of low-impact XCOM substitute. Unfortunately for a cyberpunk piece all the cyberspace stuff is downright awful (the base combat system minus urgency and strategy) but it's largely avoidable anyway. Very enjoyable for ten hours or so after which the plot takes a turn for the idiotic.			"

												Isometric western-style RPG fans rejoice, Shadowrun is back and this time to stay. Comprehensive character creation begins the hero on  their quest to help an old friend. Numerous ways to complete missions in a sprawling city filled with gritty fururistic realism and magical fantasy bring the world of Shadowrun to life unlike has been seen before. The feel of tabletop and the accesability of PC gaming mesh perfectly to make an easy to play and emersive enviroment for the gamer. The characterization of the main character and the runners you choose for your missions can drasticaly alter how you can complete a run. Hack into the matrix to shut down defences while your team defends you and clears the area, cast wild shaman magic to cleanse the technological jungle, construct fireballs from the will of Street Mages to quell thugs: nearly anything is possible.If you are a fan of pen and paper games, the Dungeons and Dragons style isometric PC games (i.e. Baulder's Gate series, Torment) this game will fit nicely into your collection of story-driven RPGs.
