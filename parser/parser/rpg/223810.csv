 Useless bit of trivia first.  The amount of times these games have been redone is truly mindblowing, but then again Ys has been around since 1987. What we have here is an enhanced port of a PSP port of an enhanced edition of a windows remake of a combined turbografx-16/pc-engine remake of a pair of games on an ancient japanese pc. Rolls right off the tongue and I'm not even gonna get into how many ports the original games themselves got. I'm fairly certain this won't be the last remake either.Now that I got that bit of nonsence out of the way let's move on to the review. Story  The island of Esteria which is known for its trade in silver has been cut off from mainland Europe by a phenomenon called the stormwall for the last six months. Enter Adol Christin, a 17 year old young man with a passion for adventure and measuring women and little boys. He sails to Esteria from the port town of Promarock (or Promalock depending on the translation) but his boat gets caught in the stormwall and he shipwrecks off the coast of the island. He is found by villagers and taken to the nearby town's clinic. This is where the game starts. From here on cue battles with monsters, ancient civilizations, saving the world and the usual business when it comes to JRPGs. Overall the story is not a groundbreaking epic that will shock you with amazing plot twists, but it is really well written and will suck you in if you take your time with it. Even the most trivial NPCs usually have something new and interesting to say as the story moves forward (this is something Nihon Falcom does a lot). Ys II takes place immediately after Ys I, so my recommendation is to play both games in one go. There's also a bit of humour added by XSEED which fits quite well since it's put in the right places and doesn't feel forced. muh grafix  If you've read the nonsence at the top or looked at the screenshots you should already know what to expect in terms of graphics. Enhancements or not you're looking at slightly improved visuals from a 1997 Windows game. That said Chronicles does have a nifty feature where you can pick from the original PC interface or the PSP one as well as picking between the original late 90s anime artstyle or the more modern artstyle for the character portraits. That's all there is to be said about the graphics, wether you like them or not is up to you, but I wouldn't judge the game based on looks alone.PS: There is no FPS lock, so stop whining, you babies. Music  INCREDIBLY BIASED OPINION INCOMING   As far as I'm concerned Falcom Sound Team JDK are musical gods and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise. With that out of the way, you have the option to pick from three different renditions of the soundtrack in the options menu (or just mod in whatever the hell you want because PC). The original PC-88 soundtrack from 1987, the PC Complete soundtrack from 2001 or the new Chronicles soundtrack from 2009. All three are great, though which one you go with depends on you. My personal recommendation is to mod the turbografx-16 audio in and enjoy one of the best versions of the soundtrack (why they never bothered to use it again is beyond me), some dude posted a mod for both games on the forums, you can find it if you look around.Long story short: Music is 11/10. Gameplay   While the rest of the games in the series are more traditional in terms of combat, Ys I & II are more of an acquired taste. The reason for this is because unlike most action RPGs at the time here you don't press a button to attack enemies. Instead you ram into them (slightly off center), that's it. In Ys II you get some spells which allow you to attack at range but the meat of the combat is once again dryhumping things with your sword (hence why a lot of people call it the bumper cars system). Personally I wouldn't call the lack of an attack button a bad thing since in this case it makes the combat LIGHTNING FAST. I'm not even joking, you'll be murdering masses of monsters with such rapid speed it'll make someone like Guts look like a pansy in comparison (you don't mess with Adol Christin, the guy's a walking apocalypse). It also makes the usual grinding in JRPGs almost nonexistant which for me is a plus. I don't hate it mind you, but it gets stale fast if the game relies on it too much. Anyway on normal difficulty you'll be swimming in cash and exp before you know it. The boss battles are the highlight of the series. In Ys I they are mostly hit and miss. Some are really good and there are others like Vagullion aka THAT !@(*$^ BAT and Dark Fact known as Dalk Fukt in Japan (if you manage beat him on nightmare mode you have the full right to rub that in everyone's faces because you earned it). Things get much better in Ys II, but it's also the better game. Ys I is essentially a glorified prologue but you shouldn't skip it since you'll miss half the story. TL;DR  This is where the Ys series started from. The games are great but they are not for everyone. However if you do try them out and end up liking them you'll be in for one hell of a ride you won't soon forget. PS  I've started a slow project of making as many versions of Ys I & II's soundtracks as possible usable ingame. Download links for the ones I've done are on my profile. If you have any specific requests feel free to let me know.			"

												Ys I & II, being the first two games in the long-running Ys series, have had quite a number of releases over the years. It’s hit a number of different platforms, including the PC88, TurboGrafx, PC, Nintendo DS, Sony PSP, and now PC, each with their own tweaks to the game to fit the platform they were released on. XSEED Games and Falcom, who started their partnership  with the release of Ys Seven, have set out on bringing the definitive version of Ys I & II to the PC. The question is, how does this port in the long list of existing ports fare?Originally released in the late 1980s, Ys I & II definitely shows their roots in their story presentations. You play the role of Adol Christin, a (now very well-known) red-haired adventurer who sets off on a journey of excitement and ends up washing up in a nearby coastal city where he learns of demon attacks which are driving the country’s citizens into hiding. As you progress through the game, it becomes clear that things aren’t as simple as they seem, with items called the Books of Ys being collected as you progress through your journey. These later become important to unraveling exactly what is causing this country’s plight and showing how to set things right.Most memorable for its combat, Ys I and II combine all the elements of a traditional JRPG: towns, shops, NPCs, equipment, character levels, exploration, and even some minor side quests and secrets. Ys I is more simplistic than its sequel, but both games are strikingly similar and tell two parts of the same narrative, even if those parts are two nearly identical story arcs. Each game can be beaten in less than ten hours, both have moments of great frustration, and they both climax in thrilling and memorable bosses. Ys I and II may be most well known for their shared ""bump"" combat system in which our hero Adol collides with enemies to injure them (and to be injured by them). The lack of an attack button and Adol's swift running speed make the action so frantic as to be absurd, and at times I found the red-haired sprite's action downright hilarious. I was skeptical and critical at first, but I learned to enjoy the simple combat, particularly during boss fights, which require much more thought than the dull standard enemies. Unfortunately, diagonal attacks are so overpowered in Ys II that regular enemies are slain with ease, and both games suffer from clumsy menus and balance issues. Being that this is an older RPG, there are some grinding issues present in this release. Ys I, being merely a prelude to Ys II, only allows for Adol to level up to Level 10. Levels control whether you win or lose in Ys I, and at times you’ll have to grind in the initial dungeons to get through some of the bosses. This issue becomes a bit worse in Ys II, which ups the level cap to 55, but lessens the EXP gained from enemies as you level up. This requires players to, at times, spend time farming enemies in one area of a dungeon, lest they get instantly killed by enemies in a later part which Adol can’t touch with gaining more levels and grabbing enough gold to get the best weapons for that period in the game. Some of the latter bosses are particularly unfair in this regard, forcing players to gain 3-5 levels above what the enemies are at just to get through the boss fight with a sliver of life remaining. While this only occurs in a few parts of the game, it’s still an annoyance that could have been fixed with a few slight tweaks by Falcom for this release. Players who enjoy a challenge will find no problems with this though.As both titles were released back in the 1980s, the RPG mantra of including key items in obscure places holds true. Numerous times in Ys I players will be unable to progress through the story because they forgot to talk to or walk into a specific story event that was either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all. While Ys II fixes this for the most part, there’s one key item in one of the final dungeons which requires players to go to a unmentioned room instead of a house in town, which is where players would assume it was located due to the game’s dialogue. The game could have greatly benefited from some streamlining for newer fans of the series.Even with those negatives, as with most Ys titles, the first thing players will notice is the game’s soundtrack, which like in Oath and Seven, runs circles around most other games. The soundtrack, composed by video game music legend Yuzo Koshiro of Etrian Odyssey fame, along with Falcom stalwart Mieko Ishikawa, is easily the shining gem of this compilation. As explain before, Ys I & II have appeared on numerous platforms in the past, so the game compliments this by allowing players to choose between three different versions of the music.One of the most impressive parts of Ys Chronicles outside of the soundtrack has to be the game’s storyline and translation. For a title which was released back in the 1980s, the story still stands shoulders above many other titles of that era, as well as some of the RPG hits of the 1990s. This combined with the music and the general artistic presentation of the game makes for some very heartwarming moments. The main storyline was translated in a way which feels authentic without falling into the “ye olde” trap that most remakes of classic RPGs fall into. XSEED also threw in a couple pop culture jokes in some of the more obscure areas of the game for those who take the time to check out everything.Despite some of the negatives I've listed here, I thoroughly enjoy playing through these adventures. Being a long time Ys fan I owed it to myself to play the adventures that started them all. There is magic in Ys, and everyone should get a chance to see it.Highly Recommended "

												Ys I is a simple, fast-paced action game disguised as an RPG. Maybe too simple for a generation who're used to combo systems, collecting a dozen new abilities, and other new hot features adopted by the genre (and later games in the series). But I like that simplicity! It's a comfortable old friend of a game, with just enough interesting use of its one mechanic (ram the other guy off-center) to last the duration of the adventure.And then you can play Ys II, which throws in a bunch more toys to play with in a larger world!Make sure you play in the original 4:3 mode: the zoomed-in mode doesn't quite match the aspect ratio of the original game window, and areas designed around it will feel cramped if you have to scroll more.

												Another remake of the old Nihon Falcom action RPG classic, which finally brings this great game to english speaking PC gamers.This version seems to improve everything beyond the previous versions (at least the ones I played, that is the Sega Master System version from the early 90s and the Turbo Duo release from a few years later), with one exception - it doesn't have voice acting, unlike the Turbo Duo release, which did have some (not much, but still...).The control is great, the graphics are up-to-date, and the awesome soundtrack is at its best, as usual. The game is relatively short (8-10 hours if you've beat it before, but could take much longer for first timers), but offers plenty of fun. This is really one of my favorite games.			"

												Even on the easiest level of the game - it still has a high level of challenge and difficultly but the way you attack enemies is different - you must bump into them. A plus is that you can recover HP if you are standing still in most places. If you are familiar with Y's Book 1 and 2 on PC Engine, you have a pretty good feel for this story , however some elements have been reworked to provide an element of challenge in order to advance to specific portions of the game. Some early bosses - You will find out quickly that you have to level up so high in order to beat them. That may take a long time but in the end, your Gold Level will rise high and you can buy some of the more expensive items from the get go. Another plus of this game is the choice of soundtrack. You have Chronicles, Complete and PC-88 to choose from. For nostalgic purposes I turn it on PC - 88 because I love the retro music. Being that I own Y's Oath in Felghana and Y's Origin , I had to play this. I had realized that this was also released on PSP but never owned a PSP. Beginners and seasoned Y's players will find a variety of stuff to do in both of these games and its a bargain for the price that was paid for the game. You don't see quality console  RPG Games like this on PC that much.			"

Then, you play YS1 and YS2. It's been a long time I haven't played games with such good story. Good job, Falcom!PS: Please bring the YS4, YS5, and YS7 to Steam too.

												The Ys games are small, short JRPGs. What really makes them stand out is the combat. Instead of turn based, selecting your move from a list, Ys instead adopts a mechanic wherein you “bump” into the enemies. This is done by walking into the enemies either off centre in the first game or at a diagonal in the second game. The games overall are relatively simple. Bump into enemies, level up, continue on your quest. If you can no longer damage enemies you need an equipment upgrade or to level some more. The story is also pretty simple in both games as long as you pay attention to where you need to be heading, otherwise you can find yourself getting one hit killed by encountering certain enemies too early. Both games have a great soundtrack, are bundled at a cheap price and are JRPGs that don’t take 60+ hours to complete. A warning though, the bosses in the second game are more bullet-hell so make sure you are prepared.			"

												I love the descriptions in other reviews calling Ys antiquated. Who would have thought a game made in 1987 would feel antiquated by today's standards.That aside, it's great to hear how troubled today's players are by its gameplay and storytelling. I'm sorry children, Adol doesn't talk much, and you're not going to be spoonfed what's going on during his adventures. You simply have to pay attention and use your imagination (and read the **** in-game books)I don't have a button to attack? Deal with it. It's hilarious how the only justification for this system being bad is ""it's old"".The level cap is too low? Oh dear me, I didn't know it was wrong to challenge people by putting the stats against you. If you're unsure that you'd like the game or that it'd be too old now to enjoy, then I'd tell you not to worry. If you enjoy action games, you owe it to yourself to buy this game. You'll want to invest hours and hours into it and you'll certainly be happy that you did. Edit 24th September 2016 21:00 o'clock... dude... the last Dungeon.. is so... bad... Go to floor 20th. Then floor 11. after that floor 16 to go back to 11... to complete the dungeon go back to floor 25.... dude....Dont... do... this... to me.... again ....			"

												An old school rpg with a unique style of combat that may not appeal to those used to turn based combat. In this you bump your character model into the enemy at angles and deal damage according to said angle, taking damage if they're directly facing you. Soundtrack is top notch, and the sprite work is pretty nice for a game over 30 years old. The story overall is your average fantasy tale, once you start playing it isn't hard to see where it's going to end. Worth picking this and the second game up for continuity, neither are particularly long, which is fine for the price you can pick both up for.Since both games are tied to the same review apparently I'll continue with the second game. Like the first, the combat mechanic carries over using their bump system, so if you hadn't played the first which I'd recommend just for understanding the characters and what is going on with your situation, then you get to now. Honestly, this game is just more of the same and just finished the whole story off. If you liked the first, you'll like the second.			"

The game itself has nice characters, wonderful story, good development, and a nice animation tone to it. There are variations however the game is truly lived to it's run. The series has met what it did before and transferring it here for those who can't get it, helps out a lot and a bundle to. I loved playing these treasures from ways ago.

												Whereas games like Super Mario Brothers complicated gameplay by requiring you to jump atop the heads of foes, Ys requires that you merely bump into them, and it is wonderful!For a game that can be played largely by only ever touching the directional pad and using a few buttons to navigate menus, I found the gameplay to be incredibly enjoyable. It's a top down adventure RPG, with elements of Metroidvania - lots of backtracking and puzzle solving, finding items, finding uses for items that open new paths. Plenty of NPCs to talk to. The game manages to make some challenging boss fights with incredibly simple mechanics.The visual style is incredibly pleasing to look at, the music was beyond surprising - it sounds almost piece for piece like something from Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia, and the pace of the music suits the breezy combat well! All in all, I wasn't expecting to even play the game - I picked it up incredibly cheap off a Steam sale. Instead, I've been incredibly surprised with a delightful game with superb presentation and classic gameplay that left me with nothing but good feelings. And I've only finished Ys 1, the first game of the pack.			"

												Oh Adol with your hair of red, won't you bump into monsters until they're dead?I think I make a better poet than a game reviewer.Ys I & II is quaint by action-RPG standards. These games were released in 1987-1988. Despite ports on many platforms and numerous remakes (including this one), the game-design has remained unchanged. This is interesting, considering that Ys III was given a complete re-imagining in 2005 (Oath of Felghana). While I'm sure many people would love a Felghana-level version of Ys 1 & 2, there's something to be said about allowing a classic to stand on its own.There isn't much to say about Adol Christin. He's the guy fate calls for when evil threatens the world. Every adventure seems to start off with him showing up at just the right time. Either that or he's just prone to shipwrecks. He's not particularly talkative, aside from his knack for explaining the current situation. In Ys 7 and Memories of Celceta he even says a few words during battle. He's not mute, but he's usually surrounded, by extremely talkative NPCs that do the talking for him. Adol prefers to keep quiet, so he can save his strength for the next fight.Actually, the Ys series doesn't fit the description of ""action-rpg"" all that well. This is especially apparent in the first game. The level-cap is a mere 10, and you'll be max-level before the first 1/3 of the game is completed. Money will cease to be relevant half-way through Adol's adventure. In fact, the latter half the game takes place in the lovely Darm's tower. The average play-through should run about 5 hours, maybe a bit more due to the freakin' backtracking right before the final boss. As it has been stated time and time again, Ys 1 has a ""bump2win"" combat system. There aren't any buttons to swing your sword, you simply run into the enemy. Not directly of course, that would be suicide. This off-center approach represents the entirety of your interactions with monsters. Aside from the bosses, you don't have to worry about projectiles, sword slashes, clawwing attacks, or anything else when facing demons. Combat can get annoying, especially if you choose to leave diagonal-controls turned on. Like I said though, once you max out your level, there isn't any incentive to fight. The boss battles are definitely challenging, since they fill the screen with dangerous crap, and it isn't always apparent when they can be damaged. For the most part however they are fair and entertaining to fight.Except for Dark Fact of course. He is one truly bull ♥♥♥♥ piece of ♥♥♥♥. Fighting this jerk on normal is what caused me to grow my first white hair. I'm not ready for nightmare-level Fact.On the bright side, once you defeat him you can move onto the much-improved sequel.Ys 2 employs numerous changes to the combat system. On the surface it's still ""bump2win"" but there's a bit more to it. Well, maybe less depending on who you talk to. The off-center approach works just as well as before, but now enemies can be diagonally attacked. This simple move is far more effective. The enemies of Ys have seen changes to somewhat counteract this. Enemies will now fire projectiles, swing weapons, and generally move around just a bit more. The game has still become easier, but it's also become more dynamic, and more fun.The combat changes include the ability to cast spells. Early on, Adol receives a fire rod. This weapon completely changes almost all of the boss-battles. Now you're not expected to run into the openings, you just have to blow them away. The boss-battles somewhat resemble a 2D shooter, or one of those genre mash-ups like The Guardian Legend. Unlike the previous game, Adol explores a larger variety of locales. The final dungeon is pretty massive, but it doesn't take up half the game like Ys 1. Instead you get to explore great locations like a fire cavern, some mines, a land filled with snow, sewers...Hey where are you going? Oh...yeah I guess going through the same areas as every other videogame can be really tiring. Keep in mind that this was all really novel for a game made in 1988. Of course, this excuse doesn't fly when Ys 3 (1989!) also features a fire cavern, some mines, a land filled with snow, and sewers. The entirety of Ys 1 & 2 isn't just running through dungeons and bumping into foes, there are some light adventure elements as well. At a certain point in Ys 1, Adol has to wear a mask to see hidden passages (at the expense of seeing dangerous monsters). There's a staff in Ys 2 that allows Adol to change into a Roo, and actually converse with demons. Some additional scenes can be viewed by fulfilling certain conditions (most of which also award achievements). While they don't affect the game-design, they're a nice touch all the same, especially for fans of the series.The first entry in the Ys series can be difficult to appreciate. The story isn't anything special, the combat -- while not without its charm -- isn't even a patch on Ys 6 and beyond, and there are some flat-out dull moments. Early on you're practically required to grind for experience and cash. I still believe that it's worth a play-through. If nothing else, you get to embark on an adventure without a lot of fat, and see the humble beginnings of a classic action (with RPG elements) series. I think Ys 2 holds up far better. It's more approachable, still retains its identity, and is generally more fun.			"

												These games renewed my love for 2D RPGs, a genre I haven't touched since SNES. The soundtracks are definately a standout which you can hear in the trailer. All combat is in real time and remarkably fun. It works on a bump system so depending on what angle and direction you hit the enemy determines a sucessful hit. The story is pretty simple and the hero is a bland, enthusiastic young kid but the gameplay easily supports the game's few negatives. And after you're done the achievements are a lot of fun to go back and solve.Ys I: The leveling system is so perfect in the first game. Every level makes you feel more powerful and that you've achieved something. The maps are serpentine but not too frustrating. The areas feel distinct and the art is just beautiful. The boss battles are really quite wonderful and the final boss was easily the hardest part of the game for me. It involved so much genuine strategy and forethought that finishing the game felt so darn satisfying.Ys II: Very similar to the first game in music, art, maps, story, and combat but with the introduction of magic. One spell basically dresses you in a kangaroo onesie so you can talk to enemies. Every enemy. I honestly felt bad for killing hoardes of enemies that just wanted to go home but were there because I was their badguy. The biggest negative would have to be the final boss. They were a joke and the easiest boss in the game due to the items they give you beforehand. The third boss gets a special mention because they may be the most horrifying thing I have ever seen in 16-bit. Ys II is just more of a good thing and is immensely fun. "

												I admit that I’m new to the Ys series and Ys Chronicles is my first foray into the franchise.  That said, I really enjoyed both Ys I and II.  Despite the original games being more than 25 years old, Ys manages to hold up remarkably well.  It’s fast paced and accessible and the story is simple yet charming.  Sometimes the game does show its age with baffling maps and level design and there are a few annoying puzzles sprinkled throughout like relics from an earlier age of game creation.  But the game is competent and fun overall.  Of special note, however, is the music from Ys: it is fantastic, and the updated versions present in Ys Chronicles are a joy to listen to.  All in all, I can see why the Ys series has so many fans.			"

												  If I were to describe this game in a few words, it would go like this: ""memorable boss fights and awesome music"". Rarely have I felt so much satisfaction after defeating a video game boss (specially the last one of Ys I, which I can proudly say that I defeated on nightmare - and which I am ashamed to say, took me a few days to do).  Needless to say, this is not for everyone: you will see the game over screen a lot. But the game is not unfair, every boss has a weakness or pattern of attack that can be exploited (though it still requires some skill to do so).  The other strong point os this game is the soundtrack, the developers really put their efforts in it. The soundtrack of Ys is, by far, my favorite.  After playing this game I became a fan of the series. The mechanics of the game changed a lot over the years, but the difficulty, awesome music and memorable boss fights remained. If you are a hardcore RPG gamer, give this one a try (or try the prequel, Ys Origin, it has a more modern action/RPG type of gameplay that became a standard of the series).			"

												Ys 1 is a solid, classic action RPG. Its fairly short, so it can be beaten in one sitting but it serves as the start of the amazing series of games. Yukihiro Jindo's arrangement of Yuzo Koshiro's music is faithful and as memorable as the original -- as an added bonus, you can enjoy Koshiro's original compositions too! Combat is interesting, as you must hit enemies off-center in order to do damage to them, which leads to some fast frantic gameplay where you also never stop moving, and versus many bosses, its pretty easy to die. Overall, its hard not to recommend this game. These remakes serve as the start for anyone to get into the Ys series.			"

												This game screams: Epic. Retro. Action RPG. While we're at it, Ys Chronicles+ kicks Major ♥♥♥ (this is an E rated review)! The game mechanics are so simple and so addictive that you can literally spend hours grinding monsters, just because! And then you look at the clock and think, “Holy Pants! It's tomorrow! ...But maybe just a little longer...” and then you turn into a zombie. Yea, this is a hyperbole, but it's not as much of an overstatement as you might think.And did I mention that this is a package of two games? Quick history lesson. When Falcom was developing Ys, limitations forced them to split the epic into two, resulting in two games, Ys I and II, collectively called (in this case) The Ys Chronicles (Ys Complete, Ys Eternal, Ys Epic Remake VII, these two games have seen a plethora of remakes, and Ys Chronicles+ is the latest and arguably greatest).Pros:- Impossibly good soundtrack- Addictively simple (or simply addictive) gameplay- Epic, just epic- Two games in one- Too many subtle little things to listCons:- Some bosses (Ys I only) can be frustrating- A few very minor things- Review doesn't do it justice (but hopefully comes close)Ys soundtracks are... you know what, there is no word that can properly describe how phenomenally awesome the music in Ys games are. In fact, Ys soundtracks should have their own special term. No really. I'm going to make one up right now: Ystoundingtrack. ...Maybe a work in progress. If you think the music doesn't somehow contribute to the addictiveness of this game, think again. The gameplay is addictive on its own. Now throw in the energizing rock music from the Ystoundingtrack and suddenly you have such an unstoppable locomotive of energy that you just want to cheer every time an enemy explodes into the aether (what a mouthful). The track that stands out the most in this respect is the Ys I overworld music. It's perfect. The rest of the Ystoundingtrack in both games are kick-♥♥♥ (darn E rating), but it's that overworld theme that's going to awesome the hours away.Speaking of gameplay, Ys Chronicles has one of the most unbelievably simple yet inhumanly addictive gameplay ideas to every grace the world of video games. You ready for this? You sure? Well here it is: you bump into enemies, and they die. That's basically it. The game is presented in the standard top down perspective of retro RPG fame, and all you have to do is bump into enemies off centre to damage them, and then they die (if you run into them dead centre from the front or they run into you, you take damage... it's a little hard to explain with words alone). Now you might be thinking, “but how can something so mind-numbingly simple be so mind-numbingly addictive?” This gameplay element has been described by it's creators as the game equivalent of popping bubble wrap - they're not wrong. The gameplay results in very tight, fast paced action, and that only helps contribute to the energy of the game.Other than the basic gameplay element, this is also an RPG. In Ys I, the RPG element is very downplayed, and by the time you reach the big mid-boss of the game, you basically have to be at max level (level 10) in order to face him. In Ys II, the RPG element is more developed and balanced. You also get the additional gameplay mechanic of magic in Ys II through the use of magical rods (bologna! they're magic wands - for those who don't know, bologna is pronounced: boloney). Ys II has a lot added features compared to Ys I (I'll get into some of these as I go along). In Ys I, the only thing enemies do is run around at varying speeds. It gets repetitive. Fortunately, Ys I is a short game, and it makes up for it's repetitive nature with creative and interesting locations (extra points for the enemies looking cool). In Ys II, however, every enemy has its own unique attack in addition to the regular means of damaging you.The bosses are where Ys I becomes fiendishly hard. Don't believe me? The big bad mid-boss is a monster! A superboss!! Add to the fact that you can only properly fight him with... well I won't give it away, but if you've talked to everybody, you should have an idea of what you need to fight this boss. And that's not even the hardest boss in the game. That trophy goes to Ys I final boss. Every other boss can be defeated on skill alone, once you know what to do. The final boss, however, has such a luck factor involved that it's... awesome! Unbelievably, they somehow managed to make a luck based boss that's, in addition to frustrating, so frakin fun to fight that it's awesome. Don't ask me how, I honestly don't know. The bosses in Ys II aren't as challenging. In fact, that's the one thing I though was a downgrade from Ys I. The challenging bosses in Ys I is one of the things that I found made the game so enjoyable and memorable. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of enjoyable and memorable to be had in Ys II. And the bosses are challenging and fun, just not as challenging as I would have liked. Also, most of the bosses can only be killed with fire magic. It would have been nice to have some of the other magic come into play, but... oh well.Ys II makes up for this by being a huge game compared to Ys I with a much grander story to go with it. The story in Ys I is more basic with fewer characters, and because it has fewer characters, it feels like they had more time to focus on and develope them. In Ys II, while the many characters do get time for developement, it's hard to focus on any one character because there's just so many of them. Heck, there's also a present system in Ys II, and if you give people presents they'll say something different than before. Heck+, with the right spell, you can TALK TO EVERY ENEMY IN THE GAME! Did I mention you can BURN VILLAGERS?! (They don't die, they just say something funny). Everyone and everything has something unique to say, and often more than one solitary thing. The most memorable characters of both games leave a lasting impression for one reason or another (in one case, literally because of a hole in the wall). The plot of both games is basically the same, and it's RPG generic, but the story weaves its way around the plot in such an interesting way that it transforms the simplicity of the plot into a foundational strength. That takes serious skill. While not what I would call a perfect story, the characters, the locations, the events, it all works together to make for a truly fun and enjoyable experience.As a retro RPG, these games do have some minor annoyances. In Ys I, there is one point where you have to talk to a character about something pointless before being able to proceed to the final dungeon of the game. All the other stuff you have to do makes sense, but this short conversation... doesn't. Why was it necessary (maybe it's a bug)? Ys II doesn't have this problem. Instead, it has the hide important gameplay elements issue. There is a very minor gameplay element that is critical for dealing with one boss (you can technically fight the boss without it, but that's nearing the realm of impossible). So, what do they do with the explanation of this gameplay element? As far as I know, one of the characters tells you about it, but only if you give them enough presents, and there are a huge number of characters in this game. Personally, I don't think stumbling onto gameplay elements is good game design. It's always fun to have some puzzles in a game, but these puzzles should be a unique application of the gameplay elements you already know, not somehow stumbling onto the fact that if you press a certain control a certain way for a certain magic, something different will happen (as an Easter egg it would be OK though).Ys Chronicles+ are two phenomenal games filled with great energy and fast paced fun. Recommended. Period.			"

												Ys Chronicles+ is a decent two-for-one package, though mostly only for the second of the two games provided.Ys IYs I was originally developed in the 80's as one of Falcom's first games, and its age clearly shows. Normal enemies are all incapable of anything but walking in the four cardinal directions and attempting to ram your character for damage, with the only difference between enemies being the damage they deal, the amount of hits it takes to kill them, and the speed at which they move. It ends up making for pretty dull, repetitive combat once you get the handle of the bump combat system. This is slightly broken up by the boss fights, but sadly boss design typically only falls into one of two categories: Ridiculously easy, or obnoxiously random/luck based. Money and exp distribution in Ys I is somewhat unbalanced as well. You'll most likely reach the low level cap well before even starting the final dungeon (which makes up about half the game). You'll also get tons of money drops in the final dungeon, all of which is completely useless since you can't backtrack out of the last dungeon to buy more items. There is a positive side to this, however, as it does mean you can bypass late-game enemies without worrying about missing out on anything (unless you're an achievement completionist).Ys I does have a few redeeming traits, though. There's a wide selection of difficulty levels to accomodate any player. The combat system is extremely simple and easy to pick up, and as a whole, the game is short enough for the combat to avoid getting too tedious and repetitive. The story is decent with a fairly wide variety of characters. The updated visuals look nice, and the rearranged rock soundtrack is absolutely kickass.Overall, Ys I is not that bad of a game, but its age clearly shows. I would only recommend Ys I to players who are already fans of the Ys franchise. For those just looking to get into the Ys universe, I'd instead recommend starting with this game's prequel, Ys Origin. Overall: 6/10Ys IINow this is a massive step up from before. Ys II pretty much addresses everything that was wrong with Ys I fantastically. Combat is much more engaging. Basic enemies can now move in more than the basic four directions, and have varying traits beyond boasting different strength, HP, and speed values. Some enemies are immune to certain types of damage, some have projectile attacks, and some have much more erratic movement patterns than others. Boss design is much stronger in this game as well. Successfully taking one down feels like a good accomplishment, rather than being a free victory or a matter of getting a good dice roll.Another big change is the introduction of a magic system. This allows for alternative combat options to the old bump system. You can use fire magic to attack at a range, time magic to freeze enemies and make them easier to kill, or alter magic to turn yourself into a demon and avoid enemies altogether. The amount of detail put into the alter magic is impressive; every single enemy spawn in the game has unique dialogue that you can trigger while in demon form.The level system is now broken up from a short 10 level system to a more game-length-appropriate 55 level system. This allows for more consistent growth throughout the game with level-ups occurring at a fairly frequent pace. There is also a significantly higher amount of items for purchase throughout the game, ensuring that gold keeps its value throughout the duration of the game without abruptly becoming totally useless halfway through.The strong traits from Ys I are also present here: Good variety of difficulty levels, strong storyline and cast of characters, nice visuals, and a robust modernized rock soundtrack. The game is somewhat longer than Ys I, but thanks to all the fixes to the problems mentioned above, that instead simply amounts to there being more of a good thing.Overall, Ys II manages to take the same formula from Ys I and turn it into something pretty impressive, especially considering its age. It still stands up remarkably well today, and it's a game I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone who is interested in a more old-school action RPG.Overall: 8.5/10 "

												Wonderful port of a wonderful classic gem that is similar to the classics like Zelda and Neutopia. After the Sega Master System and Turbo Grafx-16 versions, this is the third version of Ys I I've played. For newcomers to this series, the combat in the first two Ys games will be rather shocking- you simply run into the side of enemies. It may seem way too simple at first, but the richness of Ys is its world, dungeon exploring, secrets and set equipment building.			"

Make sure you look up the bump style combat and the history of the original games before you buy, as it may not be your thing. That said, it makes for a fun, short, and easily replayable adventure that ends up feeling more like a Zelda-esque adventure game than anything else.

												I'm going to review the first and second chapters separately since they were originally separate games. First though, the things the two games have in common, like the combat system, which to some may be a turn-off since it uses the ""bump"" system to attack rather than the traditional ""push button to attack"". Personally I didn't find it to be a problem - in fact, it makes the game even more action-packed this way. The two games also sport absolutely phenomenal music - some of the best I've ever heard. Ys I though is very archaic in its design - it's easy to get lost, and the game doesn't give you enough clues to tell you what to do next. The map is confusing. The game also doesn't have much variety - just ram into enemies and talk to villagers. Ys II, on the other hand, corrects all the problems of Ys I. The inclusion of magic makes the combat significantly more fun, and the game now has a ton of variety of scenarios - my favorite is disguising as Roos. Ys II is just pure, unadulterated fun. Ys I - 6/10, Ys II - 9/10.			"

												Ys I & II Chronicles+ is somewhere between The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Dark Souls. Being a top-down JRPG it very much looks and plays like classic Zelda, but the leveling system, combat fluidity and (brutal) bosses make it feel very much like Dark Souls. That said, this game is DIFFICULT and there's definitely a Dark Souls-esque learning curve for the combat (more below), trial and error with dungeons, and hair-pulling-out feeling when taking on bosses (the bosses are, for the most part, really great though). Also very much in the vein of Dark Souls, this game is very, very rewarding when you finally make your way through that maze of a dungeon, or beat the boss whose pounded your face in for the last hour.Combat: How can a Zelda-like game have Dark Souls like combat that's fluid and got a high learning curve? Ys uses a ""Bump System"" for combat; what this essentially means is your hero automatically attacks with his sword, which is initiated by ""bumping"" into enemies. Effective attacks are made by bumping enemies off-center, from behind, or at angles. If you hit an enemy head on or don't lock them down with effective ""bump"" attacks, they'll parry you and do damage when you attack. At first I didn't know what to think about this system, but it's AWESOME. It's fluid because you can attack quickly, move around a ton to dodge and attack, and not have to interrupt your movements with pressing a button to swing your sword (magic in Ys II however, requires a cast button for range attacks). It also provides a really high learning curve because you have to learn the best ways to attack and not take damage, and it FORCES YOU TO BE AGGRESSIVE - sorry folks, there's no standing in a corner and swinging your sword at enemies when they come at you to damage them, push them away, and repeat. The Bump System requires you to run at enemies, do it quickly, and always keep moving. It's HARD, but it's FUN.Story/Progression: Like the classic Zelda-like JRPG's (and Dark Souls), you'll find no quest-trackers here. Instead, you're forced to speak with NPC's to get hints and figure out what to do, and how to do it. Also like Dark Souls, often you'll think you found where to go only to be one-shotted by enemies and realize, ""nope, this comes later."" Sometimes you'll find it's hard to find out exactly how to progress, but you'll come to appreciate the thought and effort that is required to do so (or, you can use a guide). Characters are engaging, and story is simple but interesting.Bosses: Also very Dark Souls-like, they have tons of health, complicated attack patterns that require dodging and attacking in certain ways, and often you get to them and get your face absolutely crushed in and realize, ""oh crap, I need to back up and find some better gear and grind out some more levels"". I've only played the game on Hard and Nightmare mode - it's not unusual to have to try a boss 20 times before you beat him, and even then it's hard to beat them consistently. Difficulty primarily affects the complexity of boss attack patterns.RPG Elements: Your HP/MP are automatically upgraded as you level up, and you gain XP and Gold from defeating enemies. Most of the customization in these games comes from buying or finding upgraded armor, weapons, and other ability-altering items in dungeons. You will often need to customize your equipment and items for best effectiveness against certain bosses, or to make it through certain dungeons. The RPG elements are just enough to keep you engaged and actively adapting to the situation, and just simple enough that it doesn't take away from the fluidity of the gameplay (no stat-point allocation to agonize over to be found here).Other gameplay info: Story in these games is about 10 hours for Ys I, and a bit over 15 for Ys II. Given the ease of running these games, they're also great for playing on a laptop when you're away from your gaming rig. While you can play with a mouse/keyboard, I recommend using a gamepad. There are also cusomization options for visuals (upgraded or classic), however they're pretty similar and don't impact the game. But, BE AWARE that ""Movement"" settings DO HAVE AN IMPACT ON PLAYABILITY - there is an option for 360 degree movement (like a modern joystick) and 8-Directional movement (like a classic arrow-pad. Certain bosses and dungons will be MUCH easier/more difficult based upon the movement settings you use, so don't be afraid to switch it up to increase mobility (360) or movement accuracy (8-Direction).Verdict: Excellent game, and a definite must-buy for any classic Zelda and Dark Souls fans. Regularly can be found on sale for under $5.			"

												After playing Ys Origins and absolutely loving that game, I decided to play Ys I and II. I'm giving both games a thumbs up, but. . . . . .The original game was released in 1987, and it was one of the first action RPGs ever made. It shows it's age through design even if the visuals and audio were updated. I guess I'll go over a few pros and cons.PROs:- Fighting is fun. Even if the idea of ""running into enemies to deal damage"" doesn't sound appealing, it's at least an interesting idea to try out since you've probably never played a game much like it. Boss fights are awesome in design since it requires a LOT of movement, precision, and timing in order to defeat them. Be warned that there are some challenging parts in this game. Magic is also a mechanic in the game, and it really helps add variety to the combat when you get bored with running into enemies to beat them.- World is somewhat cohesive, and the town NPCs are at least a little memorable. It's also good how the townsfolk talk about each other even when the different people are towns apart. You get to see a grandma in a village complain about her children trying to get her to move to another town, and you also get to talk to the children in the other town talking about their struggle of trying to get their mother to move to their town. This sort of thing is important because the town-exploration that is required by the player can really bog down the game if it isn't good. - Overall, I'd say that the story is good. It doesn't take a front-seat in this game, but it is able to find a place in a game where you are suppose to be an adventurer discovering the world, helping people, and saving the land from demons and destruction. The story is mostly established as you explore the land and talk to various NPCs. The story isn't handed to you on a sliver-platter, and I think that this is a good thing for this type of game.- Oh yeah. the game has an RAAAAAAAAAAAD soundtrackCons:- A very large number of the enemies in the game behave in the exact same way, and the way you fight them is the same a lot of the time. Just run into their side, and beat them. If the enemies each had different patterns of movement and different ways that they could damage you, the game would be much better, but at least the bosses are good. This is where the ""bump-to-attack"" mechanic shows its flaws. This is perhaps the worst part of the game. . . . .boring enemy design. (not in visuals but in the the way that enemies fight) - It also becomes very boring fighting enemies when you're lv. 20 while fighting lv. 1 enemies. Also, being able to rest on the overworld at the player's leisure just decreases the tension and fun that one could have from fighting enemies normally. This is a natural symptom to RPGs, but. . . . it still is true.- There isn't a world map, and it is fairly easy to get lost since the screen is zoomed in, and it's hard to orient yourself to the map when the different parts of an area are indistinguishable. I suppose that the game is old-school though, and perhaps there can be some fun found in drawing your own maps with pencil and paper.- Back-tracking to open treasure-chests that you already found but didn't have the key at the time isn't. . . . .particularly fun. It feels more like busy-work.So, my conclusion. . . . generally good gameplay, and a good story that works well with the gameplay-focus of this game.  Oh yeah, did I also mention the AWESOME MUSIC????7.5/10			"

												Some context on Ys I: the game originally came out in 1987. Therefore, it can be difficult (even on Normal mode), confusing, awkward, and, at times, incredibly outdated to gamers who are more accustomed to the countless developments in game design the decades have brought us.

												at first i dont really know about this game, i play oath of felghana, and expecting this game had same gameplay, and this really caught me off guard, the gameplay totally different.at first i had no idea how to win the first area, so i died multiple times. but after a hour or two, i starting to grasp the gameplay, and im addicted to the end game, and before i knew it, im at the last boss.verdict:- its a fun game if you willing to learn the ""unique"" play, (after i finish the game i just realize i prefer this gameplay rather than the newer version/- i can play it with one hand- its a good challange to dare your friend for a boss fight.- why are you still reading this review, go buy and play it !!!!

												If I traveled in time and told my past self from years ago that in 2013 I will be playing a remake of a Japanese RPG from some obscure platform where you attack without pressing buttons (movement doesn't count) that I'll obtain from an internet service that lets you legally download games for a fee, I would probably laugh into my face before the universe screws itself over with a time paradox.This is a very solid set of two old games with a nice 'paint-job', including three different versions of music, two different sets of graphics and plenty of tiny details for more dedicated players. Keep in mind to expect a different experience from Origin or Oath in Felghana, and you will hopefully have fun with the games' fast, sword-ramming action.			"

												Some context on Ys I: the game originally came out in 1987. Therefore, it can be difficult (even on Normal mode), confusing, awkward, and, at times, incredibly outdated to gamers who are more accustomed to the countless developments in game design the decades have brought us. For instance, the level cap is 10. Yes, 10.

												One of the first PC games I ever played as a kid, and loved immensely. A simple RPG with an equally simple combat mechanic: no button-mashing or commands, just run around and bump into enemies. Direction and angle are the only factors involved.The updated version gives this game a whole new life and feel. What was once before a barebones plot akin to the games of the late 80s (here's a paragraph of exposition, now go be a hero) is now a storyline you can follow and become involved in. Cutscenes and NPC movement add to the narrative, and a few NPCs—and even some items—that were once inconsequential have purpose to the story. And all the NPC now have little stories of their own. The monsters have a 'bestiary' as well now, and you're encouraged to fight them more to learn all there is to know about each one.The graphics and sounds are both greatly improved, giving it a feel of a later-generation game. Even the simple combat is improved with the addition of sword-slashing animations and SFX, and enemy death animations. Rings can be swapped with a press of a button, you can toggle the display of stats and equipment (or turn them off completely), and there's even an option to turn off the blood effect, if you want the game to be more kid-friendly. Also, the controls are now configurable with 'righty' and 'lefty' options, one giving you the classic NumPad/arrow key movement and the other the now-standard WASD movement.The only downside, and I hesitate to call it that, is that like many other old 'remastered' games, it removes the inherent advantage of hardware lag and makes some gameplay elements harder than the original. For this remake, it's mostly in the boss fights. While a couple of them are actually *much* easier than the original, the rest are significantly harder and rely on luck a little more than is fun. This is especially true for the final boss, which is now a 99% luck-based bullet hell DPS race with an instant death factor. To be fair, it's the same exact fight as the original, but the original's hardware limitations at least gave you a fighting chance. However, the remake has introduced difficulty levels (though personally, I can't even begin to imagine beating the final boss on Nightmare), so you can make those tough boss fights a little easier. All in all, a great older title that paid for itself many times over in every way, and a fun nostalgia trip to boot. If you're at all a fan of the old school JRPGs, Ys Chronicles is well worth picking up.			"

												Ys 1 and 2 are two great story lines patches around a unique and rashly designed, but altogether satisfying fighting system that allows you to auto-attack your opponents by hitting their ""bubbles"", hit spots. Essentially split up into two games, the two games actually rate differently from each other, with the second game likely to be your favorite.First, Ys 1 is a good game with a great story, it just gets pulled down by the inconsistent boss fights that were more from a lack of game design. Essentially, at least two bosses require the kind of patience of a Jedi Master because the controls and the gameplay are so inconsistent. Still, there are plenty of laughs to here, and I liked the way Reena is built in the game.And yet, Ys 2 is amazing comparatively. Not only are the fighting mechanics improved, but throughout the game they change accordingly to the story. Compared to Ys 1, Ys 2's battles feel more mature and feel more satisfying in victory. Furthermore, the story is fantastic in Ys 2, with amazing detail for everyone you meet. Even the monsters you fight have things to say, and I was really impressed.Ys 2 is without a doubt a masterpiece and together the story fits perfectly in a book or movie (there are some shows, but it was early Anime and not much effort is given). I loved how the game pulled me into the story, made me feel nervous and desperate as Adol races towards the top of a tower in one of the focal points of the game.Likely, you'll beat Ys 1 and call it conquered, but Ys 2 will be the game you will nostalgically remember and play again. A fantastic series that was waylaid by its own mechanics in the beginning, Ys 1 and 2 stand out as fine examples of superior JRPG story-telling, and really feel in many ways like your watching the events unfold in front of you.

												So far I have only finished Ys I, but I will update my review as soon as I finish Ys II.This was my first Ys game ever, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. I am not a big fan of turn-based RPGs, and was happy to see that this game is of the real-time combat variety.The story revolves around the main character Adol, who is washed up on the shore of an island where monsters have started appearing. You start out by helping the various characters on the island, and eventually embark on an adventure to find the Books of Ys.You kill enemies by running into them from the right angle. If you just charge straight into their face you will end up taking a lot of damage. That's pretty much how the combat works. No spells or anything, just bumping, pure and simple.As soon as you learn how important it is to be at a high enough level and to have the best weapon and armor available equipped, the regular enemies won't be too much of an issue, even on nightmare difficulty.The bosses, however... Some of the bosses are so easy to defeat it's stupid, while others are ridiculously and frustratingly hard. One boss I was able to beat on my first try, another it took me a lot of tries to beat. Still, despite making me want to throw away my controller at times, the bosses were definitely the most fun part of the game. After finishing the main story you also unlock Time Attack Mode, which let's you try to defeat all the bosses in the game as fast as possible.The last part of the game consists of running around talking to people, looking for items, and just figuring out where to go next. There were a couple of times where I had no idea what I was suppose to do next, however the game world is luckily not too big, so you will figure it out eventually.I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and will definitely be playing Ys II, as well as probably all the other games in the series.Highly recommended!

												There's so much good to say about Ys I and II Chronicles. First of all, it's two games in one, and both games are of stellar quality. Excellent sprite and artwork, an absolutely stunning soundtrack, endearing characters, especially that of the main character, Adol, and a surprisingly efficient and fast-paced combat system.When a game features combat but 'not' an attack button, that would give any gamer pause. On paper, that would seem clunky at best and unintuitive at worst. However, the ""bump system"" implimented renders the need for an attack button practically obsolete, to the point where I actually question the very existence of what is otherwise an unquestionably essential feature in an action game. What the bump system does is automatically calculate your attack, your defence, and your receiving of damage upon colliding with any enemy, and the chances of how that collision will play out change depending on which angle you bump into the enemy. If you hit them from behind or from an angle, typically your mow through them like a lawn mower. If you get bumped into yourself, you'll take damage, and if you collide face first with an enemy, you and the enemy will either take damage or block, and both will be knocked away. Once you master the bump system, you'll literally mow down enemies at a much faster pace than you would a Zelda title, which this game resembles aesthetically. In fact, the Ys series is, in many ways, the Sonic to Zelda's Mario. Where Zelda is a more balanced and safe experience, where you can always expect a blend of puzzles and combat, Ys games, typically, are faster, flashier, and more experimental than any Zelda title. While this has had mixed to poor resulte for Sonic, I've yet to play an Ys game I didn't like.If you're looking to get into the Ys series, this is definitely the game(s) to do it with.			"

												I bought this after I have played Ys Origin cause I wanted to see the rest of this amazing world and history. Even though it is nothing like ys origin I still loved it but I can see why others didn't. Ys I: The battlestyle is kindof strange at first as you battle by bumping into the enemies (I personally had not done that before). But the battlestyle makes it quite challenging cause you need to master it to not take to much damage and die. The boss battles are pretty easy though especially after have playing ys origin but still challenging enouth due to the dumping battle system.The achievements is nice and challenging but requires alot of grinding.I would recommend this for those that loved ys origin not for the gamestyle but for the story. If you loved the story, the history and characters you will recognize alot of them in this games.			"

Finding Rhea in the city walls would be a complete accident, but after that, the game does offer some hints on how and where to get the silver sword so I'll let it slide.Since the one thing that ruined the game has become clearer now, I'll be changing my recommendation to positive.

I remember playing Ys: Vanished Omen on the Sega Master System as a child and puzzling out how to get past each roadblock in the days before internet walkthroughs were a thing. I was always impressed with how much fun the game was despite being very simple. To kill enemies all you had to do was bump into them! (Preferably from the side or back.) This is probably my fourth time playing through this game on a different platform (Sega Master System, MSX, Turbo CD, & PC) and it still grips me to this day. It's definitely worth trying out. Finally, I cannot end this review without mentioning the amazing soundtrack. The guys and gals of Falcom really put together a great game here; Also, thanks to Xseed for bring this to steam!!			"

												[Characters - good]: You play as Adol, a red-haired swordsman who habitually washes up on the shores of lands with towers to climb and sealed ancient bad guys to slay. You must also sniff every girl who needs rescuing and frolic in their beds when they aren't looking... Also one boy became the target this one time. >_>[Difficulty - good]: I've heard myths of the higher difficulty levels of some bosses, you won't be disappointed if you want a challenge. For those with poor reflexes, easy is totally playable and you shouldn't have too much trouble even on the most difficult bosses.[Story - good]: Ys I: Climb a tower and leave nothing alive as you climb to the top. Ys II: Climb a variety of places while leaving nothing alivefireballs now included. It may be short and simplistic but it's still well-written and easy to understand...besides, this is an action rpg and you're really here to kill things. :)[Combat - excellent]: It's really a pity that Ys I & II are the only games to ever use the ""bump"" mechanic because I ended up having a blast using it. Ys I did not have magic but Ys II fixes that and polishes the ""bump"" mechanics a little more to make it even better. You can't go wrong with combat that allows you to literally plow through enemies and thus never have to stop moving to make for a very fast progression through the lands and dungeons.[Graphics - good]: Though everyone has preferences for graphics, I'm in the retro crowd and prefer older games. Besides that, there's a lot of animation and detail packed into these games and they even included the option of the original character art or a newer style AND it has some rather beautiful cutscenes.[Music - head bangingly awesome]: Seriously, you will get at least one song in either of these games stuck in your head at some point. They offer 3 variations of the musical score including the original score. I ended using the most recent variation which is orchestral and rock which was really well done.[Replay - average]:  It would actually be bad but given the challenges some like to do on higher difficulties, there's the option to make it last longer. It does have amusing achievements though.[Overall - good]: Ys I & II's combined playtime is about 10 hours on easy, give or take idling time. I had a lot of fun with both and really hope more Ys games will make it to Steam one day... For more adventures with our troublemaker, Adol.			"

He's not particularly clever or witty (being painfully mute) and he's not even that strong, especially compared to his best friend who can punch through ♥♥♥♥in' walls. He's just a red-headed doofus who shows up in a given kingdom just in time to get embroiled in the sinister plans of some evil sorceror, and ultimately ♥♥♥♥s up said plans with nothing but tenacity and repeated assaults on their periphery. If Adol can save the world from a tyrannical fallen god, anyone can, and that's inspirational.			"

												As far as remakes go, this isn't half bad. It suffers from many of the same problems the original did, like confusing dungeon layouts and an occasionally directionless objective. The Ys I ending/Ys II intro cutscene also doesn't make a whole lot of sense compared to previous versions, It feels a lot more rushed. The addition of new escort missions is also somewhat aggravating.That being said, the originals were great games and the Chronicles+ remakes are no exception. The dialogue has been touched up and it makes the story a lot easier to follow.The improved graphics are great, although a part of me misses the brighter colors of the originals. But by far the biggest improvement is the gameplay. The addition of 360 degree movement really takes away the frustrating aspects of the originals, especially during boss fights.The ability to choose between different versions of the soundtracks released throughout the years is a nice bonus (although an option for the Turbografx-CD music would've been nice)Overall, if you've never played Ys I & II before, or if you have and just want to re-experience them, this is a perfectly fine way to play them.

The soundtrack for this game is awesome as well.			"

												Ys1:Since The review is for both games, mine will be incomplete until I finish the second. There is an interesting story to be hhad with this game. It is perhaps the only thing that may keep you playing as the combat isn't really engaging.The combat is you running in to monsters untill they die. There is not strategy or fun really to be had there. Its not bad but it doesn't really add anything to the game. I think if the game had been any longer than it was it would have gotten old. I am hoping the second one adds something to this system as im sure I am not going to like it if it is the same thing for another 4 hours.There are also a lot of strange solutions to progressing in this game that you are going to need a guide for if you dont want to be annoyed.The soundtrack is very good. I enjoyed all of the music that played even if at times it didn't fit what was happening well.Ys2:*Coming Soon*			"

												The music, the character interactions and the small touches make this a very good game with attention to detail expected of Japanese developers.Whether you will love this game or hate it, though, ultimately comes down to if you like the combat system or not.If you are considering buying this game, educate yourself. Look up videos that show off the combat so you will know whether you like it or not.I personally think the combat makes the whole game more fast-paced and the sound and graphic design makes it extremely satisfying.However, if the combat does not appeal to you, you will throw away money if you buy this game.

												I didn't expect this to be so amazing. This is an extremely well-ported remake of the first two Ys games, 100% compatible with any modern windows operating system (7, 8, 8.1) and it runs smooth as butter out of the box - all that's required is to set your screen resolution in the config program. It will automatically recognize your xbox 360 joypad (I'm using a ps3 joypad with a 360 joypad emulator) and it can run at any refresh rate (I'm playing at 120hz @ 120fps which is an incredibly smooth and pleasant gameplay experience with super responsive input.The gameplay is extremely enjoyable. I had played Ys: oath in felghana before and I absolutely loved it, but Ys I & II blew me away. The combat system is unlike anything I've ever seen before: you basically have to bump into enemies at precise angles to maximize damage without getting hurt and your character will automatically attack as you bump into the enemies. This makes fighting extremely entertaining, with its extremely simple yet fast-paced and challenging-to-master mechanics.The game is filled with cool secrets / extras that add tons of replay value along with the newly added steam achievements which will make you want to play through the game all over again.The soundtrack is asbolutely amazing and I loved every single track of it. I am going to play the hell out of this game and probabilly get as many as the achievements as I can.			"

												I purchased Ys I & II Chronicles+ when it was on sale. Ys I & II Chronicles+ is actually two games bundled into one, with Ys II being a direct sequel to Ys I. These games are short. Each game took me about 8 hours to complete on normal difficulty. I filled out the notebook to get the steam achievements so it probably took a bit longer than average. I've heard the game can be frustrating to beat on harder difficulties but I have yet to try. The game works great with my Logitech F310 gamepad and I preferred control through the gamepad rather than the keyboard. Overall, a great game with an intriguing fantasy setting that JRPG lovers should enjoy.			"

												Ys I & II Chronicles plus is a remake of the first Ys games from '87 and '88, offering some old school fun for fans of the Ys series who want to see how the story started or to relive the old times.For those familiar with the other games of the Ys series, like Ys Origins on Steam, this game is more like older 2D Zelda games. It features a ""Bump combat system"" which makes combat simplier (You only need to hit enemies from corner without pressing a button, this doesn't apply for bosses however) and a magic system on Ys 2, but this doesn't make things less fun: You'll be fighting tough, fast paced enemies and bosses like usual, rocking to a great soundtrack!While simplier than the newer games, these games offer a good look to how the series started with beautiful 2D graphics, 3  soundtracks to choose from for those who want those old chip-tune sounds or modern studio performance music and a well done english translation.If you love old style 2D action games or want to see how the Ys series started, I highly recommend this game: It'll give you your money worth of old school goodness!

												This is a full version of Ys I & II as it was released on early machines, with a visual and audible modernisation ""glaze"", both which can be reverted to the original format if you so wish.This game chronicles the beginnings of Adol, a recurring protagonist of the Ys series that starts 700 years after Ys Origin. Most of the two games surround one of the main 'evils' encountered, which manifest in two forms -- one at the end of each game.Combat in Ys I & II is awkward at the beginning, as it involves Adol bumping into enemies to attack them. To prevent return damage, he has to bump off-center or at the side. This eliminates the need of button-mashing and simplifies grinding -- even more so in Ys II. The audio is perfect for the two games.Overall, what you are getting is the original experience, not some rework treatment like Ys: Oath in Felghana -- but these two games stand alone for its simplicity and engaging storyline.

												It's like Zelda on bumper cars. And it's awesome.Don't let the fact that Chronicles doesn't have an attack button turn you off this game, that mechanic is what makes Ys I+II unique from other games and makes you think about how you should literally approach enemies. The music, originally written by Yuzo Koshiro, is amazing as expected from Falcom and you can switch between three different versions of the soundtrack:1. The original PC-88 version2. The Complete version, which is a somewhat enhanced version of the PC-88 soundtrack3. The Chronicles version, which is played live with actual instruments and not FM-synthesized like the previous twoIn short, get this game. In case this game is too old-school for you or you want a more modern Ys game, check out Ys Oath in Felghana or Ys Orgins. Both of them are on Steam.			"

												A classic that retains much of its charm, but also is bogged down with antiquated mechanics. The + edition is far superior to the original graphically and really helps the game get over some of its hurdles.This game is not for everyone.The Ys series are ARPGs with very minimal progression elements.  You wont be sifting through tons of loot, and you wont be spending stats or making builds.  You will instead be engaging in lots and lots of combat, which is the games biggest flaw. The fights in this game are very rudimentary, and they happen to the point of ad nasuem.  Sadly the progression elements render any kind of strategy null, as you'll either be far beyond any enemy in power, or unable to take two hits from them.  I may be ragging on the game a bit here, but Ys 1 & 2 are actually good games. The music is pretty decent, the visuals, especially the updated ones, are pleasant and harken back to high fantasy from the 80s/90s.  The world and environment really hammer the fantasy atmosphere home.The story and characters arent all that intriguing, but that is owning, again, to the games dated nature.  The narrative here is nothing new, but it isnt annoying.  Faint praise, I knowHonestly, I do recommend this game, but cautiously.  If you enjoyed a lot of old high fantasy material, or you played some of the more recent games, give the game a go.  It may surprise you. If you instead play many RPGs or ARPGs of today's modern game designs you may find the barebones systems and story a bit too lackluster to get into.			"

												Ys I & II Chronicles is a much improved remake of the 1987/1988 Falcom games for the NEC PC88 and PC98 computers.  The two games are essentially one, with II being a direct sequel to I.  Unlike most Ys games, where the events are loosely connected and don't need to be played in any particular order, Ys I and II should be played together, in order.  I also personally recommend these games as an introduction to the series, as they introduce some of the main recurring characters of the series.  Both games come with 3 soundtracks - the original PC88 version, the Ys I & II Complete version, and the Ys I & II Chronicles version.  While I personally have a love for the FM synth of the original (PC98 VGM is amazing), all 3 soundtracks are fantastic and there's really no ""best"" version.  Having multiple choices was a very nice touch from Falcom.  With introductions out of the way though, let's get into the individual games.- Ys I - Ys I is a mediocre game with an odd charm.  While not nearly as good as its sequel, it's still a nice game.  Much of the time there's little clue where to go or what to do, but something about freely roaming the world talking to NPCs to find a clue as to what to do next reminds me of a simpler time and just has a nice feeling to it.  Also, unlike many RPGs, every NPC has a name and a small sense of uniqueness that makes the interactions with them more enjoyable.  This is honestly one of my favorite parts of this game, and of Falcom games in general.The combat is pretty simplistic in Ys - bumping into enemies will damage them, but hitting them head-on will hurt you a lot as well, so you must hit them from off-center to avoid taking damage.  It's a nice system, and I like it, but it wasn't executed as well as it could have been in this game.  You reach the maximum level about halfway through the game, which makes fighting enemies feel unrewarding for the remainder.  The boss design also a bit poor, which is sad.  They're functional and not really ""bad"", but they're still some of the poorer-quality bosses of the series.  That said, while the gameplay is a touch mediocre, the characters, story, and music still work well to make the game feel nice despite its flaws.- Ys II -Ys II is the direct sequel to Ys I, taking place immediately after the events of its prequel.  This game takes everything that made Ys I good, and makes it better.  Then it takes everything that was bad about Ys I, and makes it good.  The game's progression feels so much smoother and more straight-forward than the first, and the combat system has been improved by adding magic to the mix.  Early in the game, Adol will gain access to his first spell, a chargable fireball spell, giving more choice in combat alongside the traditional bump-combat.  The boss design has also stepped up from mediocre to magnificent.  Ys II's bosses are very much up to par with the later installments of the series, and are by far the best of the 2d games.  Most bosses can only be damaged by the fireballs, giving them a shoot-em-up type feel, where you must dodge their attacks while shooting them with your charged up fireballs.  Also, unlike the first game, Adol will level up continually throughout the entire game, and experience gains are now adjusted relative to the difference in levels from enemies, helping to keep the player from being over or under leveled.  There's also lots of small touches to the game that add so much to it, such as being able to give gifts to NPCs for additional dialogues or other small secrets.  Ys II is a fantastic game and one of the best in the series, definitely standing up well alongside its 3d successors.  I highly recommend it.			"

												Ys I & II use a different combat system than the newer games in that you only have to walk into enemies to attack them and the direction that you walk into them determines if you will take damage.  In Ys II you do get some direct magical attacks, though they are mostly useful for boss fights.  It keeps the pace of combat pretty quick and really almost relaxing.The storylines aren't bad for a JRPG, the music is really high quality and the games aren't all that long assuming you don't try to be more comprehensive with achievements and such.  The games are designed to encourage grinding before boss fights, but I never had to spend unbearable lengths of time doing so in order to progress. There are sections of both games that can be a bit convoluted or would require a bit of running around/backtracking to figure out and find missable or hidden items, so I would suggest using walkthroughs for a number of areas in the interest of time.The only bug I encountered was with the final boss of Ys I, where running the game in fullscreen causes him to spam projectiles at insane speeds, so change it to windowed mode before then and then back to fullscreen before the ending if you prefer.  Might only occur on 120hz displays.Both games come with a launcher that lets you set the visual mode to Chronicles+, which gives you a better fullscreen view without all of the fluff around the edges, adds improved art and I think more cinematics as well.  Definitely turn that on, as I don't think it is by default.In the end, if older JRPG games appeal to you then these are great quality PC releases.  I wanted to go through them to get some context before playing Ys: The Oath in Felghana which is the remake of Ys III.			"

												These games are worth buying for the chance to try out the interesting combat system. It's not just ""run into enemies"" combat. That will just lead to you getting quickly killed. It's about running into an enemy from a proper angle that is facing away from their attacking area. There is a bit of nuance to this, and different enemies requires different areas to to be charged into. There are also other gameplay systems, but their influence ranges from minimal to very miminal. The soundtrack is also very harmonious for this type of experience. You will quickly see what I mean. The (possible) downside------The setting and aesthetics of this game are very typical late 80s anime. The (probable) downside------ The boss fights are not fully cooperational with the gameplay. They don't always feel properly designed. (though they are much better in YS ll )  "

												People play Ys Origin/Oath and buy this expecting the same stuff, then get surprised when its old schoolJust look at them trailers/pics and tell me with a straight face that you expect it to play like the newer entries in the seriesI personally prefer this combat system over Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior's, because it is simple, fast, and goes excellently to advance the rather simple story of ""You are Adol, Hero of Ys. Defeat X and save the day!""The combat system works for its time, the remastered graphics and music are great. Bosses are hard until you memorize their pattern, which applies to most bosses in video games of that time period.Get this if you want to experience the legend, but go in with the mindset of reading a book, not watching a movie.

												You should only buy this if you are a serious fan of the Ys series.  The story is what you would expect from a very old game, but you will love it if you played Origins or Oath in Felghana.  Soundtrack is fantastic with all three different options to choose from, it's hard to go wrong with any of them.  The bump attack mechanic is a bit basic, but it will grow on you if you find all of the intriguing things you can do wth it.  I played the games on hard and got a very good challange out of playing both the games, but got stuck on a few bosses.  Overall I had a great time with the games and they are worth getting if your a fan of the Ys series.			"

												Ys I and II feel like they are made for people just getting into RPGs. The game is short, but challenging. By ""short"", I mean there are about 3 dungeons. And the last one takes up about half of the game. And the max level is 10. Because of such a short game with a low level cap, gaining a single level or a new piece of equipment can make a boss MUCH easier than the first time you fight it. The characters have some color to them, and there are even a few sidequests! I believe this game is very ideal for people who are looking for a good RPG to start with, but don't want to be thrown into an hours-long epic.			"

												Great game. First time I played, I was just delighted. It's not complicated, the story is not as cliché as other games, music is a lot better than the original and the gameplay, despite being different to the first versions, is still good. Even though the bump system, and item use in Ys II gets kinda annoying sometimes, you get used to it. And once you master those, game's a piece of cake. Worth buying if you love old japanese action-rpgs.			"

												Ever play these classic style Ys and feel like you miss the sword button? You are missing the damn point then.The exclusively movement controlled melee is the reason you should try the original Ys, here in the best form possible. The high point is the remixed bosses, which are nothing short of brilliant. At least in Ys I. The magic fighting in Ys II ends up making it disappointingly easier. It's still excellent, with some gorgeous looking and fun to fight bosses, but the problem is that the final boss of Ys I was the damn high point of complex bump'em up combat, and at least I expected Ys II to push it even further like it did in the Turbografx version.Still, these are the absolute best versions of Ys I and II and the best way to experience their unique combat design. And if you get a taste for it, by all means check out the PC-Engine version of Ys IV for more high-quality bump'em up action.			"

												I started this series with Ys Origin, so it took a while to get used to the bumper car combat. Instead of pressing a button, you walk into an enemy to attack. They do the same, so you need to hit them at an angle or toward the side to deal damage without trading. This allows some silly situations like pushing smaller enemies against a wall to lock them while Adol goes nuts with the dps. It takes getting used to, but I've enjoyed seeing what the bosses are like, especially since the Origin bosses are remakes of these original ones. These bosses are MUCH simpler than the later entries, but it's been fun just comparing how they were implemented.Play if you like Ys, especially if you've ever wanted to play bumper cars with a giant centipede doing donuts... In a game other than Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past.			"

												Ys I & II use a different combat system than the newer games in that you only have to walk into enemies to attack them and the direction that you walk into them determines if you will take damage.  In Ys II you do get some direct magical attacks, though they are mostly useful for boss fights.  It keeps the pace of combat pretty quick and really almost relaxing.The storylines aren't bad for a JRPG, the music is really high quality and the games aren't all that long assuming you don't try to be more comprehensive with achievements and such.  The games are designed to encourage grinding before boss fights, but I never had to spend unbearable lengths of time doing so in order to progress. There are sections of both games that can be a bit convoluted or would require a bit of running around/backtracking to figure out and find missable or hidden items, so I would suggest using walkthroughs for a number of areas in the interest of time.The only bug I encountered was with the final boss of Ys I, where running the game in fullscreen causes him to spam projectiles at insane speeds, so change it to windowed mode before then and then back to fullscreen before the ending if you prefer.  Might only occur on 120hz displays.Both games come with a launcher that lets you set the visual mode to Chronicles+, which gives you a better fullscreen view without all of the fluff around the edges, adds improved art and I think more cinematics as well.  Definitely turn that on, as I don't think it is by default.In the end, if older JRPG games appeal to you then these are great quality PC releases.  I wanted to go through them to get some context before playing Ys: The Oath in Felghana which is the remake of Ys III.			"

												If I had to sum up the experience of Ys I & II in one word it would be ""Charming"". Both games are very short compared to your average jRPG and the stories fit together really well, so that it's like playing two halves of the same great title. The sprite and character portrait artwork, whether you choose the older or newer style for portraits, is beautiful. As are the soundtracks. Likewise the bump combat system is fun and fast once you get into it (I highly recommend using a controller) and the magic system mixes things up a bit for boss battles in Y II. While I don't think there's a bad song in either game, they do suffer a bit from a shortage of tracks. Most areas have only one song, and some songs are spread out over several areas. This problem is alleviated somewhat by the ability to change which version of the soundtrack you're listening to on the fly. Tired of the Chronicles orchestration? Switch to the Complete edition's midi rendition, tired of that? Switch to the original PC-88 version. You can do the same for character portrait style if you want to change that at any point in the game.Probably the biggest problem with this package is the bosses for Y I, in that they're all terrible and mostly very easy. The Ys I end boss battle is especially bad because it hinges a great deal on luck. But don't let these minor annoyances stop you from enjoying two beautiful and surprisingly touching classics of the jRPG genre. Playing them it's not hard to see why they spawned such an enduring franchise. And honestly how many games let you turn into a kangaroo monster and go back to speak to every non-boss enemy in the game if you want to?			"

												Welcome to Ys,* a world filled with magic** and fun*** combat!*Disclaimer: Ys disappeared into the sky 700 years ago and Ys I takes place in Esteria.**Disclaimer 2: Magic may cause demon invasion as a byproduct. Also not available until Ys II***Disclaimer 3: ♥♥♥♥ bump systemSerious time. This series started in 1989 on the PC-Engine, predeccesor to the TurboGraphX 16. Betcha haven't heard of either of those, have you? I grew up with a TGX, but i believe the PCE was Japan-only. *ahem* Now, these aren't the original games, obviously. This is Chronicles+. The steam version of Chronicles, which was originally released on the PSP, as a remake of the originals. there's also Ys I&II Eternal, Complete, and a (Terrible) DS version: Legacy of Ys.If you've never heard of these games before, Ys is widely-known for it's balls-hard difficulty, bosses in particular. Unfortunately, the bosses in these two games aren't very fun. In Ys I, you get a VERY small window of attacking for all of them, save for two which you just have to tank all the damage for and hope you can out-damage them before they kill you.Ys II is a bit better, though every boss Except for Dalles and Darm Can only take damage from Fire magic. It's about as lengthy as you'd think.Let's talk music, which is easily the best feature out of all of the Ys games. It kicks some serious ♥♥♥. Give it a listen.You also have diffrent options for the music, i might add. Heading into options, you can swap out your reorchestrated masterpieces for... er... the original PC-88 chiptunes? And the soundtrack from Complete, which is like a remix of the chiptunes, and actually sounds good! Like it came right out of a good SNES game.But gameplay, oh boy...If you're playing the series in chronological order and you just came here from Origins? Prepare for an ♥♥♥-whoopin', sonny. These games use a ""Bump System"". Which you will hate. It goes against all logic you'd expect of a gamer and it'll screw with your head by the end of this.So what IS this bump system? Well, you attack enemies by running into them. But if you don't do it off-center, you'll take damage. There is no attack button. You swing your sword automatically. This is PAINFULLY bad, especially in Ys I, as you have no other means of attacking. It's a big learning curve, but it's actually quite fun when you get used to it. When i moved to Oath in Felghana, i actually subconsciously started running into enemies.Ys II handles this MUCH, Much better. For starters: You only take damage if the enemy is facing right at you when you hit them. this is a GODSEND. You can also attack diagonally, which is reaaaally helpful, and makes the system a lot more fun. There's also Magic, if you hate the bump system as much as i do. Fire magic, Light magic, Return magic, Alter magic, Time magic, and Shield magic.The story is also great! Though there are a few plotholes if you've played Origin.•Gee, Darm tower sure has changed drastically in the past 700 years even though no one can go inside.•So apparently, the whole land of Ys went up to the sky, and not just Solomon Shrine? I thought the land of Esteria WAS Ys.•No mention of Hugo or Yunica. Cain being Darm isn't adressed either. *sigh.*As well as others that i either can't recall or won't bring up here.Overall, these are great games. I reccomend giving them a shot when they go on sale, but if you're in it for the story, play Origin first.YS I: 5.5/10YS II: 7/10 "

The others on various systems sure were fine too, but this remake give's you some extra todos like collecting NPC's or monster information, which will also add an extra challenge to the already challenging game itself and results to rewards with archivements. Besides that, the game let you choose of various settings like which music, graphic style or filters you want to play, which will result in an own ""remix"".This Ys in general is a must play for newcomers but also who already played I&II on other systems before will have theier fun.

												It's harder to recommend this than the other Ys games. It's a remake of a NES game that's so simple you don't even have an attack button, you just bump into the enemies at off-center angles to deal damage.Ys 1 hasn't aged too gracefully, even with all the updates. The entire game is basically a fetch quest. Most of the boss fights are simple to the point of not being much fun and the game tries to compensate for its small world with constant backtracking. The power curve is also screwy since the max level is 10, so a boss will be impossible until you gain a level at which point it'll be a cakewalk. Funny enough it actually improves during the final dungeon which takes up half the length of the game.Ys 2 is much better, the bumper combat has been improved so that it feels like less of a crapshoot, and the power curve is much smoother. The boss fights are still simple, but the new magic system makes them fun, and there's far less backtracking than in Ys 1. Both games are very uncaring towards the player. Ys 2 will let you kill yourself against a boss over and over again without telling you that you need to learn how to throw fireballs to damage it, it's usually not too hard to figure out you're missing something, but there's that.The music for both games is pretty rad, you even get the choice betweeen the original PC soundtrack, the Chronicles soundtrack or the soundtrack from the 2001 port. It's a bit rough but still fun (mostly Ys 2). Oath and Origins are better though.			"

												The key to push forward in any Ys (pronounced eese) game is to grind to level up and also save ALOT. I saved immediately after I get items and stand in front of a bosses door. And as for leveling up, some bosses are hard if you don't level up.As for the game itself, there was something lacking with this version versus the TurboGrafx version that lost it's charm, however it is still a fun game to play. The list below metions some of the bad parts of the game.      - Why isn't there a front entrance to Minea?       - Triggers to make the game progress are SO ANNOYING (ie. Jeva, Feena)      - Why must I EAT the Rhoda tree seed? This was not in the original.      - The last thing is the annoying amulet you must get in the tower after climing all the way up to the top. This also annoyed me in the original TurboGrafx version.Overall, the music was spectacular, but still doesn't compare to the Turbo Grafx version. Something is just missing.Great old school game!! But play the Wii/Turbo version if you want a better game.And as for all you whiny babies who need to swing a sword and stopped playing because of it, give it another try! There is nothing like ramming into monsters when you are fully powered and acting like you are playing Zelda on crack.I give this game an 8.5. The TurboGrafx/wii version a 10. "

While the first game is 5 hours long, the second one will take you around 8-13 hours to beat. Audio: If you don't like Yuzo Koshiro for some odd reason, then you shouldn't get this game. You'll hear classical pieces, and then some heavy rock sounds with the coolest solos in a rpg game. The music likes to let you know that you're a badass who just can just kill anything if you run into them. Graphics: It's a 2d sprite based game, with a bit of 3d objects into the mix. While it doesn't really matter, enemies and characters look well in 16-bit sprites. Plus, Lilia and Feena are hot so points to them too.Gameplay: You just run into things for the first game, and in the second game, you can use magic while running into things to kill bosses and monsters ( Fire is OP though ). There's a small mix of puzzles but you backtrack to places which can be repeitive sometimes. Dungeons are pretty big, and you can get lost ( I did too ) but it's not so bad.Replayability: I wouldn't replay the game unless you're doing achivements honestly. There's Time Attack which is essentially boss rush.Falcom, you got me hooked onto the Ys series. Now I have to buy their games too!			"

												After completing Ys I and just finished Ys II. I can now write my review of this classic RPG title.Ys I & II Chronicles+ is a mix of both the first and second titles that I have no clue how I never knew about. It is one of those amazing JRPGs that perhaps not many know about.Ys I is a very short and simple game compared to the slightly longer Ys II, but it introduced me to a unique battle system I didn't expect, the Bump system. Tho I was a bit weirded out by this, I quickly started to enjoy the combat, I started to believe that some recent RPGs like Half Minute Hero may have been influced by Ys, but now I'm just rambling away. Going back to the review, Ys I will not hold your hand and lead you to the quest, that is for you to discover, something I honestly enjoyed as many games tend to hold your hand and lead you without thinking for yourself.The music for both titles is absolutely amazing and well done, personally my favorite was the Complete version, and I played that soundtrack in its entirety through both games the majority of the time. The world of Ys itself is beautiful to view, even with the good old graphics. The game is filled with great characters to meet and talk to, you may grow attached to some of them on your journey.The story of Ys I & II will captivate you, it presents a great story for such a small package. The enemies are difficult depending on how much you grind and what weapons you buy/find on your journey. I advise those to grind a few extra levels for good measure, especially the 2nd game as the first, you'll max out very quickly. The one thing I want you to remember is when you meet Dark Fact, he will show no mercy to the weak, if you are hardcore, Dark Fact will behappy to see you over and over again.Overall Ys I & II are classics I wished I played in the past, but thankfully it is never too late to discover amazing games now matter how old they are. Now I am interested in playing the other titles in the franchise, thus I have become a fan. You will not regret playing these games.			"

												It is a fun game, the story seems solid enough. Combat is simple, just bump ememies. That being said, it is a JRPG so expect it to be tough. If you want to see how tough watch an LP showing the bosss fights. Mainly the bat Boss. So I recomend it as it is 2 games, but be ready for some frustration.			"

												As someone who has played the original Ys games before they started gaining a following; I am satisfied with my purchase. Let me begin with saying that this collection is the ideal remake for a game. These two games are fairly close to the originals with the second game straying a little farther than the first. HOWEVER, if you do not like classic JRPG games the game might feel a little too simple for you. The bump battle system turns off a lot of people due to its' simplicity; it was implemented in a time where it had to deal with the limitations of the Sega Master System, and the Famicom. I suppose you could say this is one of the original ARPGs due to Ys' unique active battle system. Like most Falcom games the OST is pretty good so that shouldn't be an issue. If you want to take advantage of the replay value of these games; there is a Time Attack mode available for anyone who wants to speedrun the game. These games however are not difficult at all, and you can take advantage of the bump system VERY easily. You will be rewarded for grinding in this game, because a single level difference can make a big deal. To be more concise; this is a great collection of two JRPG classics, and I recommend them to anyone interested in the genre.			"

												A refreshing change of pace! This game is definitely an example of a retro-stryle of gaming.I'll warn the readers RIGHT NOW. You probably need a gaming controller to play this, because it utilizes this rather unique (read: slightly annoying sometimes) combat system called the ""bump system"". You run into enemies to hurt them. So with a keyboard, it's rather hard to maneuver sometimes. But if you go into this game with an open mind and expectations of a challenge like I did, it's rather fun.I am nearly finished the first game, Ys 1 (95%, at the final boss and stuck! Haha -_-""), and the difficulty of the game is rather good! I'm only playing on normal mode, and it's harder than most games today. In comparison with other RPG games readers might have played, Ys 1 is HARD in my opinion so it may not be for everyone] I've yet to play Ys 2, but I hear it's a great improvement upon Ys 1, so I imagine it can only get better.My overall score for the game is 8/10. It's retro, it's has nice neat illustrations/graphics that give the player a feeling of playing a piece of the past, and the music is not bad. "

												I'm torn on this one. Whereas with the TG-16 version of the game, I loved Ys 1, and loathed Ys 2. With Ys 1&2 Chronicles+, I loathe Ys 1, yet love Ys 2. The bumping in the first one just feels off, it's almost like both the analogue and 8-directional controls ruin it, IDK how since I didn't have the same problem in the second game. I say play the TG-16 version of the first one, and only play this for the second game. Overall, Ys 2 on this compilation is the best out of the 4 games/versions, so it's most definitely worth playing.. Hope I made sense =P			"

												A remake of the cult-favourite action RPGs from Nihon Falcom (thanks to XSEED for bringing it to Steam). Very simplistic but fast-paced action RPGs with minimal button inputs, as you bump into the enemies in order to defeat them (we cannot just bump in anyway we want, we need to bump with a slight offset in order not to get damage). The games are very recommended, they are pretty simple and fun, and not overly complicated like recent games.			"

												A very energetic, fast-paced action RPG. With great music, awesome pixel art, and a healthy dose of challenge, Ys I should keep you entertained if you're in the mood for an RPG, but you don't wanna dedicate 40+ hours to it. However, the ""bump-based"" combat takes some getting used to, and some of what you have to do is a little unclear near the end. It's nothing a quick glance at a guide doesn't clear up, though.			"

			While the Ys games are an action RPG series that come highly recommended, do they stand the test of time? The Gentleman descends into the game to discover whether they are or not.		

If that's not your style, here's the short version.  By the way, most of this will focus on Ys I.YS IFor a remake of a game dating back to 1987 (and also remade before), Ys I remains a fun excursion.  It goes to show that some games can stand the test of time, even if their more current competitors are more high-toned and fancy.  For instance:*The ""bump"" combat is a refreshingly simple system.  While appearing simple, it did have a considerable amount of minutiae to keep it engaging.*The musical arrangements now come with three options and styles.  I personally chose to listen to the Chronicles version, and I enjoyed many of the songs.However, there is a darker side to these same points.....*At times it feels like the ""bump"" system relies a little too much on luck.  While it looks like you hit the enemy just to the side of head-on, the foe will still get a counter-attack in like you hit them head-on.  This is particularly concerning early on in the game while you are weaker than the enemies.*Due to the limited programming options of the original release, there is not much variety with the music, which means you may get tired of hearing the same songs over and over again.Other pros and cons to take into consideration are:*Pro: The graphics look amazing, considering the source material. *Con: At times the difficulty is low, and then suddenly there is something disproportionally challenging.*Con: At times it can be difficult to figure out what you have to do, or there is a specific order that things must be completed in if you want to progress.*Pro: While I had difficulty understanding some facets of what I had to do at times, there was a very rich backstory.*Pro: The game's clarity improved over time.Even with these flaws, I found myself enjoying the game considerably.  In addition, many of these issues are improved or corrected in Ys II.YS IIYs II is a lot like Ys I, except for several key facts:*It's much clearer than its predecessor in terms of what to do.*There's magic now, which offers a brand-new dimension and means by which to combat enemies.These changes create a much easier to work with game, and I am enjoying it more than the first one.  However, something to keep in mind: the bosses can be INSANELY difficult.  Yet they are still really fun encounters. So if you like action RPGs, I recommend taking a look at these classic Ys games, and have fun bumping off some foes.			"

												Are you tired of pushing a button to swing a sword?Do you want to show your might by pushing monsters out of the way?Then the Bump System is for you.The Combat is centered around pushing or bumping monsters with the hero.It seems odd at first but quickly becomes an easy, simple and brillant way to kill monsters and talk to people.Story:  You are a sailing adventurer that shipwrecks into someone else's problems,You take on their problems to be the hero.You meet some girls that are more than they seem.Beat the bad guy and save the world.....not quite yet, start Ys II.There are also 2 different anime artstyles you can view the game in, chronicles or complete.Each one has slighty different drawings for people you meet and opening intros.These two games together are a spectacular example of well made rpgs.Both games in one package is a great deal.

												These are remakes of the first two Ys games Ancient Ys Vanished: Omens and Ancient Ys Vansished: Final Chapter which really are more like one game split up into two parts then one game and it's sequel given that there isn't much diffrent between Ys 1 and Ys 2 in terms of gameplay or really plot since the story of Ys 2 is just a countiation of the story of Ys 1, though Ys 2 is the longer game of the two and the only real changes made are the ability to attack a monster diaganally and the use of magic.  Now if you played Ys Oath in Felgana, Ys Origin or Ys 6 you may find yourself dissapointed with the combat, there is no hack and slash system in these two, these use the ""bump"" system from the NEC PC 88 orginals where you run into your opponent off center, from the side, from behiend or in Ys 2 from a diagonal direction or else you will take damage and more often then not get killed really quickly. Now sure it sounds antiquated and lame but once you get used to it, it's kind of fun and is quite fast since if you land on your target right you land alot more hits.Also since these are faithful remakes of two old 1987 Japanese action RPGs orginally made for a old series of 8bit computers the game is fairly grindy but not too bad at least on difficulties lower then hard, I found myself reaching the max level in Ys 1, which is 10 btw, by time I reached the third boss which was in the second dungeon and had almost all but the highest level gear and in Ys 2 I bearly level grinded at all and still did alright of course in Ys 2 I found myself getting lost so often that I end up killing tons of monsters anyway. Yeah Ys 2's levels can get pretty maze like the worst is the last level.   Also in Ys 1 there is some slight padding especially in the final dungeon where you will find yourself reaching the final floor of the tower only to have to back track back down to level 11 to speak with one guy to get one item that you need to unlock the final door and fair word of warning the last boss of Ys 1 is the hardest boss in the series all I can say is watch where you attack him as for every hit you land on him he takes away the peice of the floor you were standing on when you hit him so you have to watch for that and the massive rain of fireballs that come down during the fight. And the story in Ys 1 is pretty weak but that's mainly do to the fact it's a set up for Ys 2, all the story is there for is to lay the foundation of what you get in Ys 2. The music is fantastic and you get 3 renditions of them the newer arraganged version which I personally love which was done in house by Falcom's in studio band, the 2000 midi versions and the orginal PC 88 version. While it would of been nice to have been able to get the TG-16 CD/PC-engine CD-rom version of the soundtack as well but eh what can you do. I know it sounds like I am being hard on these but you got to point out the low points. But I do love this series and these two in paticular there is a reason why I keep going back and playing Ys 1 and 2 after all these years, I just love them and they are that damn good if you can look past the few old school flaws.  Highly recomended but if you want something that is a bit more modern try Ys: Oath in Falgana which is a complete redo of Ys 3: Wanders of Ys, Ys Origin and Ys 6.   "

												JRPG in which you beat on enemies by bumping into the side of them. Actually kind of hard at first but gets easier until the boss fights. Also there's an escort mission in each of these two games for some reason, and if you don't hold their hands they'll walk into walls and die miserably. Why even put things into the game if you're not going to make sure they're good?It's still fun though. I recommend it.Four out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( )			"

												I have been intrigued about these games since one of the re releases that came out in the early 2000's. I really enjoy the game, until I get to a boss level. Then it seems like the game turns into a monotonous grind that depends more on reflexes and luck, than it does actual strategy. This ruins the RPG experience for me. The game looks great, plays great, has a good story line, but the ridiculous boss fights are no fun at all. I think I will stick with turn based RPG's from now on.			"

												I dont agree with the JRPG tag, as I would liken it more towards Legend of Zelda / Alundra style adventure.  ""JRPG"" suggests stats for everything and grinding to advance past things if need be, as well as the classic JRPG ""fight / magic/ item/ run"" menus.   None of which is in the Ys games.			"

												Amazing game, this game is an action/rpg at its finest. The story is well thought out, and doesnt get stale. It may be a little shorter than some other classic rpg's, but it's probably for the best, if that makes sense. the combat is unique, and uses a ""bumper"" style system, where you damage enemies by running into them, which might seem completely absurd at first, but after about 15 mins of playing, It's actually quite fun, and kind of addicting. Definitely check this out if you were ever into zelda, tales series, soul blazer series, or secret of mana series. 8.5/10-Chauchy			"

												Summary: A remake of a short action-RPG with gameplay elements similar to The Legend of Zelda, Ys I is challenging and will easily frustrate the average gamer. The game is largely unforgiving and boss fights will make you want to tear your hair out as they rely more on luck and chance than actual skill. When starting the game for the first time, I highly recommend normal difficulty and secondly, to save often as there is no automatic save feature. All in all, the game is a 3.5/5.Originally for the PC-Engine, Ys was released in 1987 and received critical and commercial acclaim. It paved the way for Ys being a flagship RPG title in Japan and with localizations in the US. Interestingly enough, the story may have roots in the mythical city of Ys (Is) that was built off of the coast of Brittany in northwestern France, a city that had befallen the same plight as Sodom and Gomorrah and due to the sinfulness of its' inhabitants found itself swallowed up by the sea. The world of the game Ys however, takes place on an island called Esteria, where the ancient kingdom of Ys once stood. A young adventurer named Adol Christin decides to cross the Stormfront, a massive seastorm isolating Esteria, and finds himself shipwrecked and rescued. Nursed back, Adol adventures through the land and a seer named Sara guides him into collecting the books of Ys. Six books that tell of the history and downfall of the ancient kingdom of Ys. As Adol goes forth to collect these books, he will meet a host of characters that shape and guide his adventure until the fateful encounter on top of Darm Tower.Plot-wise and of course understanding that this is a remake, I found no real issues, things generally made sense and where I needed to go next was generally not a problem. There are only a few characters that you will meet reoccuringly, but given that the game is roughly 5-6 hours long, you won't develop any strong bonds with any supporting characters.The gameplay probably needs the biggest explanation as it really doesn't fit nicely into any game I've played. Sure, the easiest way to explain it is, ""it's like The Legend of Zelda,"" but even then there are some big differences. You don't control any type of attack animation, to attack an enemy target you simply move Adol into them. If you're offset, or hit them from the side or behind, you do damage and avoid damage to Adol. This can be frustrating sometimes, find enemies in a narrow corridor and your options are limited, enemies move at the last moment and you get damaged. Just remember that saving often is imperative in this game, there is no auto-save and you will die alot...ALOT. Just the first few battle sequences are challenging and once you start your first boss battle it will be harsh and unforgiving. Adol does level up with each monster he defeats, but there is a cap at Level 10, which you will probably have by mid-game. You can't simply farm yourself or strongarm yourself through the game, and being anything less than level 10 by the time you tackle Darm Tower is suicide.There are some bosses that will just make you livid and frustrate you. The final boss is the perfect example, because it's simply a matter of luck and chance rather than skill that will carry you to win. The first boss can also frustrate new players because of how unforgiving one wrong move can be, but remember to save before each boss battle and to just keep trying. It took me about 40 tries to get the final boss, and the more you play it the easier it will become to predict his pathway.The graphics is so-so, it's a remake but obviously there are limitations in how much could be changed without alientating the fans. The music is fantastic in some levels, especially when you start up Darm Tower, and although I never played the original, I'm guessing that they are remakes from the original PC-Engine tunes.Overall, if you want a quick but challenging action-RPG, I would recommend Ys I. I'm planning on playing the second game, and with everything I've read it should improve on everything from the first game. 3.5/5			"

												After playing through The Oath in Felghana and Origin (once, for now), I finally got Ys I & II Chronicles+, expecting to get pretty much more of the same.Man, was I in for a surprise.The combat is EXTREMELY different. Instead of pressing buttons to use your weapon, you run into enemies to hurt them.Yes, you run into them. This is the first game I've ever seen to use such combat mechanics. And no, I'm not saying it's bad, but it really needs some getting used to, especially at the start of the game, when you have very low health and many monsters can kill you pretty quickly.You also run into NPCs to talk to them, which can be annoying once in a while, because they tend to walk around aimlessly, often crossing your path, which leads you to run into them, which triggers a conversation (or a monologue, to be exact).After you familiarized yourself with the combat, you shouldn't have too many problems along the way, although some of the boss fights might be a tad annoying (especially the end boss).Other than the combat, the game is pretty much your standard fantasy action RPG. You have lots of characters to talk to, many places to visit, monsters to fight, equipment to get and so on and you really should pay close attention to everything or you might miss some rather important things. And I'm not talking story here, I'm talking equipment, that is rather vital to your survival and progress.The game features not only a great soundtrack, but it also looks really nice. Reminds me of the good old action RPGs of the past, which this game actually is, too, as it was first released around 1988.The combat is rather strange, but apart from that this is an absolutely great and fun game, albeit a bit challenging from time to time.If you've played The Oath in Felghana and/or Origin, give this game a try, too, even though the combat is vastly different.And if this is your first Ys game and you didn't like it (because of the combat), give Origin and The Oath in Felghana a try, because it has pretty much your standard action RPG combat.ADDITION:Just finished Ys II, but as you can't write a separate review for it, I'll add it to the review on Ys I.The sequel takes place pretty much right after the end of Ys I.After killing Dark Fakt, you're transported to Ys, where you have to once again defeat evil.The story is, obviously, pretty standard for a JRPG: save the world from evil and stuff.Gameplay-wise it didn't change much, but additionally to the bump combat you now get to use magic, too, which I only used in the boss fights (where you have to use it, because most bosses are immune to melee attacks). The bump combat stayed pretty much the same, although I found it to be much easier to kill enemies now. Just run diagonally into them and keep on doing that and the enemy can't evade or counter in any way. You obviously have to look out for other enemies while doing that.The graphics, imo, have aged pretty well. While it certainly isn't some fancy 3D stuff, the graphics look absolutely beautiful, especially when you consider that the game is over 25 years old.The soundtrack, again, is quite good, too and you can even find the whole soundtrack in your Steam folder! And not just the new arrangements, but the original versions, too :)If you liked the first game, then playing this should be a no-brainer, especially because you already own it anyway :P			"

												Excellent Videogame from the people of Falcom with music composed by the legendary Yuzo Koshiro, this version is a great remake from the original game that was realeased in 1987 for the Japanese PC-8801. The battle system is pretty different from other action adventure games of the same age, like zelda, because you need to advance to an enemy monster and Adol, the main character attacks automatically. The difficulty is not really high, but i really don't recomend the Nightmare one to unexperienced players.			"

												Granted there's been overhauls since it's release (1989!), it still stands as a very nice game with some rather interesting unique features such as that the people you meet you can actually get more info by talking to them more or by talking to others first!Or that the NPC aren't bound to some specific in-house route instead certain character almost acts as they do in Skyrim.And not to offend the tactical jrpg lovers, but it actually has a for once a brand new system and which only requires you to run into an enemy and you deal damage!If you don't own this game yet... Buy it, it's well worth your time.			"

												The first set of JRPG games I've ever played, and to be perfectly honest, I got hooked on them. It was very easy to pickup and immerse myself In. It it reminiscent of old SNES games in both the style of artwork, play style and difficulty. The combat system is easy to learn, but it takes real skill to master. Basically you run into enemies until they explode. This makes for really quick gameplay and doesn't take away from the pace of the game. This is one of the few games I've played where difficulty actually dictates the game, the hardest difficulty isn't like most games, enemies aren't just stronger, the bosses have different attack patterns, are less forgiving and gold and xp are harder to come by, also every enemie after a certain point has max health. I have beat the game on Nightmare, for my first playthough I was enjoyable, and not soul crushing as most games on the hardest difficulty are, as you can save basically whenever except boss fights. A couple of drawbacks that Ys I has is that you reach the max level fairly early, as LVL 10 comes quick when your grinding for a new set of gear, and you'll almost always do Darm's tower at the max level. Ys 1 is also a fairly short game when you get down to it but, the final boss, Dark Fact, singlehandedly one of the hardest bosses I've ever faced. Also filling the bestary takes a load of time and makes it seem to fall into the department of redundancy department when your slaying megabeasts just for the entry at the top of Darm's tower. Overall Awesome Game! For Ys II, it follows the exact same thing, as it is on continuation of Ys I, solid game with a whole new set of epic music, boss fights and magic! Along with being able to use items in boss fights its a glorious sequel to a stellar game			"

												Oh the game of my childhood. This game was one of my few games that I GOT to play as a child. What I mean by ""got to play"" was that I had a tiny time spand of me having the mental capacity of using the home computer and open up video games to the time where all the CD games became incompatible to the computer to play this game. The incompatibility made half of the CDs work inefficiently, others with having all but one language corrupted and one made only the first area crash free and this game was the last of the pick. To fill this void I would always watch the guides on the local VG channel. Fast forward many years after forgetting this game ever existing I saw a DS version of this game and I had to get it. Soon I found out that the DS version was more or less a ""baby mode"" so after seeing the game on Steam, well, yea...So long story short: ""Why are you reading this?

It's definiterely something different from the classic JRPG-style games. Which isn't something I mean negatively.

												The first set of JRPG games I've ever played, and to be perfectly honest, I got hooked on them. It was very easy to pickup and immerse myself In. It it reminiscent of old SNES games in both the style of artwork, play style and difficulty. The combat system is easy to learn, but it takes real skill to master. Basically you run into enemies until they explode. This makes for really quick gameplay and doesn't take away from the pace of the game. This is one of the few games I've played where difficulty actually dictates the game, the hardest difficulty isn't like most games, enemies aren't just stronger, the bosses have different attack patterns, are less forgiving and gold and xp are harder to come by, also every enemie after a certain point has max health. I have beat the game on Nightmare, for my first playthough I was enjoyable, and not soul crushing as most games on the hardest difficulty are, as you can save basically whenever except boss fights. A couple of drawbacks that Ys I has is that you reach the max level fairly early, as LVL 10 comes quick when your grinding for a new set of gear, and you'll almost always do Darm's tower at the max level. Ys 1 is also a fairly short game when you get down to it but, the final boss, Dark Fact, singlehandedly one of the hardest bosses I've ever faced. Also filling the bestary takes a load of time and makes it seem to fall into the department of redundancy department when your slaying megabeasts just for the entry at the top of Darm's tower. Overall Awesome Game! For Ys II, it follows the exact same thing, as it is on continuation of Ys I, solid game with a whole new set of epic music, boss fights and magic! Along with being able to use items in boss fights its a glorious sequel to a stellar game			"

												Oh the game of my childhood. This game was one of my few games that I GOT to play as a child. What I mean by ""got to play"" was that I had a tiny time spand of me having the mental capacity of using the home computer and open up video games to the time where all the CD games became incompatible to the computer to play this game. The incompatibility made half of the CDs work inefficiently, others with having all but one language corrupted and one made only the first area crash free and this game was the last of the pick. To fill this void I would always watch the guides on the local VG channel. Fast forward many years after forgetting this game ever existing I saw a DS version of this game and I had to get it. Soon I found out that the DS version was more or less a ""baby mode"" so after seeing the game on Steam, well, yea...So long story short: ""Why are you reading this? You probably don't even know this game, but play it if you like.""			"

												I'm playing Ys I right now. Any comments I make here will be based on that game alone, since I haven't gotten to #2 yet.So far, the game is reasonably entertaining, as far as action/RPGs of its generation go. The combat system is a little overly simplistic, though: you attack by running into monsters, and whether or not they hit you depends on the direction they are facing and the angle at which you hit them. You don't need to hit an ""attack"" button to smite your foes, and you don't need to hit a ""dodge"" or ""block"" button to deftly evade their attacks. Frankly, you could play most of this game with one hand. If that doesn't sound particularly entertaining, this game probably isn't for you.Story-wise, you're looking at a pretty generic JRPG plotline - some warrior-type wakes up in some village, and goes on a quest to slay monsters and ultimately save the world/kingdom/etc. It's a little more detailed than that (as one might hope), but I'm sure any prospective players would prefer to not have the spoilers.Anyway, if you want an action/RPG that's a bit on the light side, this is as good a game as any. $15 is a pretty reasonable price tag for two games, and if you snag it on sale, so much the better.

												i really like the setting and story of thiese games, but they do have some quite step difficulty curves when it comes to bosses, (First game) it begins with the 3:rd boss that sometimes uses an attack that can spread to the whole room making it impossible to avoid and at higher difficulty you can die from a few of these, the other bosses are managable until the last dungeon where it has some of the best and worst examples of bosses i have seen in a long time, Bad1 boss you have to simply rush to defeat,1 with destructible floor that breaks when you attack him so you can't attack all the time but he also practicly drains your health every second with fireballs so you don't have much time to kill him, he does follow a path but he is faster than you so you can only strike him a few times every cykle and with the floor broken, maybe not at all. very frustrating boss that needs 90% luck.Good,1 you have to have patience and only strike at certain times making it nerve wrecking when it's almost dead,       1 that follows a certain pattern and you can only attack him after he has attacked and if you are carefull can be beaten with full health remaining.the second part is more forgiving but it also has a few bosses that are anoying but not close to part 1:s last boss.

												[I wrote this Review for Ys I, since I didn't play the second game yet.  It looks like more of the same though.]I didn't know what to expect when I bought this game. I had never heard or saw anything of this series before but was positively surprised once I started playing.The combat took some time getting used to and was frustrating for a little while.Another frustrating thing is, if you're playing for the first time, you essentially have to be at certain levels to beat the bosses comfortably. I had to check a walkthrough of the game, when I got stuck at the first boss because I did so little damage. I thought I missed something or I was doing something wrong. The walkthrough basically said to be at least be level X (which was 1 level above mine), once I got the extra level I quickly beat the boss and didn't really have any more problems with the game.The game is pretty short, though that didn't bother me, in fact I preferred it. This might give you some incentive to re-play it on the harder difficulty, since it's not a huge commitment.Overall a good game, definitely recommended, of you can get it during a sale.			"

												After finishing Ys Origin some time ago, i decided i have to play the original games. First of all, the Bump System. It's a little quirky, and weird, but once you get used to it, it's fun, because it makes for super fast battles. Even Boss Fights are generally very fast, however they aren't easy, at all. Ys 1 however, while fun, was a little bland because it was all about bumping, and had some stuff that really needed improvement. But that where we got to Ys 2.Ys 2 improves the Bump System, adds a Magic system, and improves alot on what was in Ys 1. It was much more fun. If there is one thing to criticize in Ys 2 however, it was that it was too maze-y, without having a Mini-map. Doesn't reduce the fun much tough (except if you keep going full circle for hours like i did in some Areas xD). Ys 2 has also some nice Story as well (not to be compared with Trails, Falcom's Other Series, tough)I recommend Ys I & II Chronicles+ for:-Ys fans who didn't play it yet. Especiallly those who only played Origin, as it explains the events 700 years after Origin.-ARPG fans who love some fast Action. The game, as i said, is really fast. -Those who want to try something unique (I don't know any games with a fast bump system) and simple.-Touhou fans will love the boss battles starting from Ys 1 Final boss. Touhou fans should play this on Nightmare.-And even if you don't play such games, you can buy it just for the Music. Yes, it's that good.Now to go play the other Ys games i didn't play yet.			"

												Be warned—these aren't complete reinventions like Oath of Felghana was to Ys III, but updated versions of the original games.  Both have somewhat redesigned maps, a little bit of additional items and playable content, unlockable boss rush modes, and (most significantly) the ability to move diagonally, but these are both still essentially the same games as the originals.There are some elements of the games that haven't aged well, notably some inscrutable puzzles (save yourself hours of confusion and just look at a guide once you get the hammer in Ys I), mandatory level grinding, and plenty of backtracking through large, mazelike dungeons.  That said, these are still charming action RPGs with a fun and unique battle system, well-designed bosses, and what are still some of the best soundtracks in the history of video games—and you get three versions of them!Ys I & II Chronicles is too similar to earlier versions of the games for me to highly recommend it to people who have already played them, yet different enough that I can't quite call it the definitive version.  If you have a Wii, you might want to download the Turbo CD version (Ys Book I & II) instead—it was one of the earliest CD games and is really interesting from a historical perspective.  Either way, these are games that deserve to be played.			"

												So, here we go, the first two parts of critically acclaimed Japanese series Ys. As I already played Ys Origin (that I really liked) I expected having similar fun, though I knew from beginning that this games have different (unique) combat system.All combat is done by bumping to your enemies - you bump his back/shoulder, you deal damage. If you bump your enemy directly in the front, he'll also deal some damage back to you. It's not complex at all, it's pretty much undemanding. But here comes the right question - Is it fun?Well, it might be fun for the first time, but after you beat tenth NPC? What about hundredth NPC? If you are going to play Ys I & II, plan for grinding. There's a lot of grinding for experience and gold with obsolete formula - if NPCs around you are too hard to beat, return to previous zone and kill as many enemies as you can. Once you get stronger, get back to the following zone and beat everybody, thinking about how easy it is.The game even encourages you so hardly to grind enemies that you'll clearly see that any NPC you kill is respawned in few seconds. Welcome to the game where running and bumping enemies with your sword is the meaning of life.All this grinding actually ruins impression from the environment and story for me but if you can get over it, you can be happy for many seriously written fantasy dialogues, sweet pixelart graphics and good soundtrack. Anyway, if this review make you lose interest on Ys, I'd still recommend you to try other Ys games as they have taken different (and more classic) take on combat. I'm still definitely going to play the other Ys games later.			"

												The game is very simple in gameplay: Grind grind grind slash slash slash with a bit of skill involved at some points. The game is mostly about enjoying the story and feeling satisfied over your power increases.This game is not for those that are gameplay-motivated. This is the stereotype action RPG: Pretty much turn-based fighting with action thrown in for the sake of seeming less stale. However, if you can enjoy a decent story, great music, and great visuals for what it's trying to be, then this game is for you. The music is enough to keep me going throughout the games of the Ys series and it's enough to keep me going for a very long time. If they ever make another ys game beyond their latest one, I'm going to jump on it asap.			"

												Ys Vanished Omen is a great remake of the classic 1987 RPG. It has improved graphics and an outstanding soundtrack (you can also choose the original PC-88 soundtrack). While not being as deep as todays RPG's, to be honest it's rather simplistic, I had a great time replaying my first RPG I ever played (on the MSX-2) . All I can say is for the price you get two great classic RPG's which you owe to yourself to play if you've never played them before! 8/10			"

												Solid oldschool game, the storyline seems kinda trite now but it's pretty damn old and from a time when these elements were basic. Plus, the lore and mysticism holds up, and it's a solid foundation for the sequels. It's a PC port of a rerelease of a PC remake from over a decade ago and it shows, but the artwork when communicating with villagers and during cutscenes is still top-notch, and the music is incredible. The bump attacking system requires you to ram into enemies at off angles to avoid taking damage yourself, and takes some getting used to. It tends to be called 'basic', while amusingly being more demanding of precision than the 'tap button for wide arc or poking sword attack' of similar games..The stat gains an strength differences between each level up can be pretty stark, so if you get through one dungeon rather smoothly without much bumping, you're gonna have to grind a level. It also starts slow, since you're almost useless until you gain your first level-up... The bosses start extremely easy, but the last couple are a nightmare. One is a severe battle of attrition where he spends 90% of the time taking up far too much space and chasing you around the chamber. He's completely invulnerable and chipping away at your health with random movement patterns that require tricky maneuvering, before deciding via what seems like RNG to make himself a target for like a 5th of a second. lol Some of the required actions to advance or gain an almost necessary edge in terms of equipment can be slightly obtuse, and finding quest important items in random chests in dungeons is kind of jarring, if not vaguely explained away in-game. It's rather linear too, but segues into the sequel nicely. It's oldschool, quirky and a nice update to an important slice of history for the ARPG genre, retro enthusiasts and people who like being challenged will love it and people who don't like said challenge will.. Not. 8.8/10 (Kappa)			"

												First thing first, the ""bump"" combat system is both incredibly stupid and kind of fun at the same time.  You don't swing a sword or cast spells in this game, you simply run into enemies and depending on the trajectory of your bump, you do x amount of damage and take y amount of damage from the enemy.  There's something to say about just bashing into your enemies, like how any Pac-Man action game should've played out.  You still get equipment and stuff, but it just affects how much damage you do and how much you take.  Level-ups are also a huge thing in this game.  They make big differences and an enemy that was giving you trouble on Lv.4 is trivialized by being Lv.6.  It's also very likely you'll hit the level cap a ways before the end of the game.This version of the game has a few different alterations to choose from.  You can change the character portraits between a classic and remake version and there's also a number of different soundtrack styles to pick from.  This is a cool feature more remake games should try to implement.Being a remake of an older game, Ys I gives you a bit more freedom to go about things than a more modern game of this type would.  It doesn't give you equipment to start the game and it's quite likely you'll head into your first dose of bump combat outside the initial village and die.  That said, annoying as that can be, it also lets you find good accessories and armor early on by not gating certain areas, so if you feel like running around a mine dodging enemies, you can loot the place a number of levels before you're supposed to head there.  There's a decent bit of interesting things like this in the game.The game lets you save wherever, whenever.  Thank you Falcom for this.  I don't care for arbitrary save-points, and this being a a PC game, I like being able to save a step away from a boss in case I die and not have to re-run parts of the dungeon.  As for the bosses, there are two in particular that are just extremely annoying and got me this close to putting the game away for good.  This is mainly because bump combat makes fighting them a pain.  The story is completely throwaway.All said, a solid 2-D action/RPG that's fairly short.  Has some interesting old-school conventions in not holding your hand at times but can be frustrating due to game mechanics and how reliant the game is on levels.			"

												I really wanted to give this game a chance. I really did. But forcing me to use Steam cloud saving and corrupting my save files when it decides NOT to save will probably frustrate you more than it did for me. Let me explain. In a certain part of the game you obtain a sword, but you have to work around a glitch that causes your game not to save and get corrupted. You'd think that's the only way to prevent a corrupted save, but no. I spent an hour and a half of progress, and midway through a cave I went through, I got the dreaded ""Couldn't save to Steam cloud"" error, and my save game disappeared. So all of the time I put into my game was gone forever, and it was the third time that my game got deleted.If you don't have a PSP, do yourself a favor and pick up that version instead. It may be at a steep price, but it's not a botched port like this one is. I have a feeling that this one little error will go unpatched anyway, so it'll save you the trouble.			"

												I honestly didn't like this game (Ys I). The level cap was too low, I hit it about half way through the game. The shops became useless almost immediately since their stock never changed. Money was very easy to come by and (in spite of that) you found some of the gear that you will use in the final fight before you had enough money to buy the best the shop had. Any fight that wasn't a boss fight was generally very easy and the boss fights were exercises in frustration. The method to kill them was generally unclear, requiring you to die repeatedly (or use a guide) to figure it out and even once you had figured it out, it was difficult to believe that you had because, more often than not, skill was at best half of what you needed to win, and the other half was luck. I finally just gave up on the last boss because I don't care enough to put up with a fight that is 90% luck and 10% skill. This game simply isn't worth the frustration.			"

												My frist Ys game played was Ys: The Oath in Felghana.  I absolutely LOVED that game.  The best action RPG I've ever played hands down.  I bought this chronicles pack on the holiday sale so the money wasted is negligible.  What completely kills this game?  The absolutely terrible ""bump system"" of combat.  I'm sure the veterans of the series will be up in arms about this, and I totally understand the company keeping it original, but it's just EXTREMELY BORING compared to the Ys games without it.  My complaint isn't about difficulty, but circling your enemy over and over and rubbing into them until they die just sucks.  I'm not upset that I wasted money, again it was a negligible amount, I'm upset that this game isn't fun at all and the other Ys are.In short, veterans of the originals, you will likely love this; newcommers, beware of the garbage that is the bump system.

												Infuriating. I liked the story tho it was exceptionally short at best leaving out massive gaps. The soundtrack was ok, but i really dislike the walk into things to attack it's the weirdest thing to get used to in a game. i highly recommend a controller do not play on the keyboard. It's totally doable as I beat the game with a keyboard but my hands hurt from sitting in the same position to long, so take breaks. The graphics are what you expect but i really had a massive issue with navigating thru the final part of the game. It's supposed to be a circle but you'd never know if you didn't google the maps to figure out by shape which floor your on. With like 25 floors that's highly annoying. I'd say if your a fan of the game get it, but if your like me who never even heard of ys I'd totally pass. Its a game for games sake but that is about it to be honest. As soon as I finished it I deleted it and never plan on going back. I was disappointed. Thankfuly this was a christmas gift so I got it for free, my friend claims he can beat it in 30 minutes and I still think he's lying as it took me  4 hrs via using google taking pics of the maps with my phone and going back into the game so that I could figure out where I was and what I needed to do. For a game this old I shouldn't have to google every 5 feet to play it. Will say if you do play this game look up a guide (make sure theirs no viruses on the site and that its FREE do NOT pay for any guide ever!) and get the heal ring. Also just like the elder scroll series, save save save save save. I had 5 seperate saves going just in case especially at darm tower.			"

												I feel that the original two Ys games, regardless of any degree of modernization, were something you simply had to experience when they released in the late 1980s in order to enjoy fully. The games are brief experiences, even when paired together, so luckily this history lesson does not take a long time to convey. Equipment and story progression is fairly single-track and are not very deep in and of themselves. It’s impressive when you factor in the time and situation in which the game originally released, but it just doesn’t hold up.The art and music are great, and there is just enough story to hold everything together. It was quite interesting to see the “callbacks” to Origin, having played them in the chronological order instead of the release order. I probably derived more enjoyment from these ties rather than from the game itself. The music is fantastic, and I probably enjoyed this soundtrack here more than that of Celceta. It makes the ho-hum battle system more enjoyable in any respect, anyway.4/10			"

												Ys I - While fun for parts, several of the boss battles are far too chance based (rather than skill based). Also, you're going to waste a bunch of time unless you play it with a guide because it there's usually not a clear logic as to what you are supposed to do next. Other than that it's kinda fun, but the randomness of the bossess really ruins it for me. I felt like I was just following a recipe as I used a walkthrough to beat it, which detracted from it.Ys II is probably better in terms of randomness, but I don't know if it's really worth suffering through Ys I to play Ys II.

												This game is just mediocre. It's not a bad game but it gives no satisfaction. Story seems on the weak side, graphics are pleasant, the music is good. The combat system is the weakest spot of the game. You have just to bounce on enemies. Weaponry too is just plain bad. I would not recommend this game, better to stick to other series (like Suikoden, Final Fantasy, Breath of Fire, etc.). Unfortunately on Steam we have no the likes of Suikoden, Breath of Fire or Final Fantasy.Anyway I'm a bit unfair since the game is just a remake of a very old game (1989).Will try Ys II, hoping the core game is improved.

												First I have to say that I really love RPGs - especially when they are frustratingly difficult and intense - but Ys I is just something I can not and do not want to handle anytime ever again!I bought this game expecting an awesome, story driven J-RPG with a battle system that differs from the classic RPG's type.What I actually got was a halfhearted story, a weak and really annoying battle system as well as boring characters. The game itself is very frustrating, but not in a good way that encourages you to grind more and level up (the player's level caps at Level 10 and I reached that after the second boss of I think seven), but in a demotivating way, that makes you wanna dump this insult to the RPG genre. The frustration does not come from the difficulty of the game, but from the ridiculously bad battle system - you basically have to ambush the enemy from a certain angle to damage him without being injured, what becomes very boring and annoying - especially during boss battles. And it always is a gamble.Now that we talk about boss battles, I have to mention something: The bosses don't have ANY relation to the story and fighting them is even more repetetive than grinding. The player needs to think of a different approach for every boss, which  I quite liked, but once he figured out what to do, the boss battle loses everything that made it interesting - and even that was little. Especially the second to last boss had nothing to do with having fun playing a game. It was mere routine and repetitive ambushing from a certain angle for about 5 minutes.In short: If you have the money and want to experience this failure of developers and an insult to RPGs and RPG fans, then go ahead and buy Ys I. Else I'd recommend buying 14 cheese burgers with the cash. I certainly regret not having done that.I have only played Ys I and I will give Ys II a chance, but not just yet. I need a lot of distance to this game series for a while.			"

												Only played Ys I, so this will just be covering that. As spoiler-free as possible. It started out pretty straightforward, and once I accidentally discovered some game mechanics which for some reason weren't mentioned in game at all, it wasn't too challenging early on (which it shouldn't be anyway, on Normal).Later on, there didn't seem to be much direction whatsoever, and I eventually just got into the habit of checking a walkthrough every step of the way just because I wanted to finish it. Half the time after following the directions I just laughed, thinking ""how the hell was I supposed to know to do that?"". There is vague direction, but it's mostly trial and error if you're trying to move on with only the information the game gives you. I don't know if it's supposed to be like that, maybe figuring out the randomest things imaginable is supposed to be the actual challenge of the game. The challenge certainly isn't from the bosses, those are either pathetically easy or laughably luck-based. I liked the easy ones more.The final boss is just the worst, without spoiling things, I can only say that it has absolutely nothing done right about it. It's flat-out horrible in terms of story, gameplay, and, well... The music isn't that bad actually, the first few times. Unfortunately if you can't get the luck you need to beat him early, you may wind up listening to the same music for hours.That's generally how the music in this game is, throughout the whole game. The game doesn't really have any bad music, but most of it is heard for too long, making it tedious, and it gets annoying after a while. If you want to simulate the experience without playing the game, look up one of the songs on YouTube or something, listen to it once. It's pretty good, right? Now listen to it again, for about an hour, and see if it's still good. One positive thing is that there are three different versions of music you can choose from, one from what I assume was the original version of the game, one from this modern version, and one from in between. I often found myself switching between the three because just listening to one was painful.			"

												My first meeting with Ys was Ys online (sadly discontinued during beta) and I loved the game immediately, eventhough it was pretty tough. Then I bought and played Ys Origins and loved it immediately because of the close resembelance of the action RPG meganics that Ys online used. In the mean time I've bought the whole series aside from Ys seven (can grab it for my PSP) and all of them are action RPGs.Ys I & II are not like the rest of the series at all. These two are more like the old NES / RPG maker jRPGs with a twist. First off, the battle system sucks balls. They prolly thought it was innovative for the time to use a 'bumb' system to attack. This also means that you probably won't be able to use ranged attack (I really can't see why XSEED didn't change the combat system in the 2009 version of the game - there are 2 versions of each game, the old one and the revised one).Then the story. Most of the old NES / RPG maker jRPGs it takes you about 10-15 minutes to get into the story and you can say if you like it or not. Ys I & II are different there and after half an hour and having spoken to every one in the village you wake up I still had no clue what I was to do, other than just leave town and see where it'll bring me. Truth be told, the main plot was explained, but from there on not the slightest hint of where to go or what to do.Somehow YS I & II just lack something for me that other NES / RPG maker alike jRPGs  had and I definately won't recommend this game to anyone, unless you've played them back in the days and want to play them again.Before anyone starts ♥♥♥♥♥ing to me about not knowing NES / RPG maker alike jRPGs, I have played (most of them never completed, but that's normal for me) Final Fantasy 1 trhough 4, Star Ocean 1 and willing to play 2, Tales of Phantasia (still ongoing on the PSP, means when I'm traveling). I know jRPGs and Ys I & II just miss the clarity the other titles I named have.			"

												As a fan of Japanese style games and RPG's this game looked interesting. The game however is a strange fusion of multiple anime art styles in the intro, as well as the game having an ear gouging sound track that seems to break the atmosphere of the game. The bump combat is interesting, but it causes the game to lack responsiveness. The game also gives you little to no feed back so whatever you do in the game does not entirely be said. The game is decent for the price but I would not recommend this game unless you have extra money, time, or will. This game gets a 5/10.			"

												Why does this still have ""bump"" combat in this day and age? This isn't the MSX and it isn't the 80's....Honestly, I thought the game had been given a control upgrade, but the upgrades were only in graphics and music. My first outing with Adol resulted in his death after two enemies because I didn't hit them at just the right angle and there was no indicator he was being damaged until he died... I wanted to know the adventures of Adol before those in ""Ys 3: Wanderers from Ys"" which is redone in 3D as ""Ys: The Oath in Felghana"", along with the events after ""Ys: Origins"" which could be called ""Ys 0"". Both are far superior in every way to this badly-aged, bitter nostalgia cash grab of a turd. I don't even wish to play Ys 2 after this disappointment.If you want a better Ys game, go play the other two I mentioned. If you want a better Action-RPG game, play almost anything else... examples are: Fable, Rusty Hearts, Castle Crashers, hell, any Legend of Zelda, even Majora's Mask!			"

												Review for Ys I: Game starts off pretty well. Loved the art style and music. I grew up on classic consoles and that's where this came from. It's simple to get into. You attack by running into enemies. There's no loot, no stats to allocate, and a short storyline. The combat isn't bad normally.But the end will leave you very frustrated. The story frequently leaves you with no indicator of where to go to progress. You end up wasting time or googling it instead and there's too much backtracking at the end. The difficulty of the bosses at the end will leave you frustrated and looking for strategies. The final boss will frequently kill you in 1 hit. The saving grace is that reloading saved games is instant so you can replay those boss fights immediately until you get it right (and you will be doing this if you buy this game!).			"

												the bump system is a little messy and i couldnt really get the hang of it and judging from some other reviews im not the only one that wasnt a fan of it, you bump into enemies to attack and they do the same.At lv1 you cant do damage to a monster literally 30 second away until you grind to level 2 and this is right at the start of the game. This the least honed of the Ys series for me and it lacks that addictive hack n slash combat that was so great in the other games.			"

												There are no clues to the advancement of that game after a certain point. ABSOLUTELY NONE. There are no reminders either. Unless the player is into exploring every nook and cranny of the game, it's a waste of time. The bosses are tedious, boring, and are annoying; especially the Bat Boss of the mines. I'm just very tired of this game.I absolutely HATED the grinding I had to do in this game. Both the levels and the actual ""grinding"" I had to do to enemies to kill them. Really. I have better things to do than to rub my body against monsters and hump them to death. If I wanted to grind I would go clubbing.			"

												Ys 1&2... I bought the both of 'em on the Steam Sale, and I must say, even for 5 euro's I regret my purchase. I was looking forward to playing this game a lot, the anime/retro gamemaker style really appealed to my nostalgia..Yet... This is where it went wrong.- The world is small- The story is really bad- The ''anime'' is for cutscenes and special interactions only.- You're character development when it comes to visuals is 0.- The game does NOT explain itself- No quest log.. I mean seriously.. ( I can get into the whole ''listen and write down/remember'' aspect but sometimes things that seemed unimportant kept me wondering for far too long -.-)- No map.. No......Map.....- 0 Character Depth- Repetative soundtrackThere was a time (where I quit the game and never came back btw ;D)Where I thought the game had ended! without letting me know, I just beat a boss, followed up with 0 dialogue, I stood in front of the door I had to pass... Couldn't enter it, so I looked at my friend google, and people said that I had to play part 2 of the game... I mean really? Force a person to play the second part without leaving them with any feelings of completion towards part 1? I felt cheated, and badly too.. The game does NOT inform the players.Now a quick list of comparisson between 1 & 2.- You start off the same as in Part 1.- Same textures- Same person.. - 0 Improvements towards the character depth/story/quest log and any of the bad errors they made in part one was desribed above ^.Please people, it may seem tempting but I found this game unworthy of my time and money. Unfortunate really, I was looking forward to this game and went in with a positive mind and a lot of patience, they tested it, and it could not live up to it's expectations, no matter how little they were. 2/10			"

This game absolutely REQUIRES a walkthrough to make any sort of progress. Even though the ""bump"" combat style is quite charming, and the game remains playable for the most part, I wouldn't suggest purchasing this bundle for it, unless it's very cheap.

												WTF is this??? A game for ants??? You fight monsters by bumping into them. You interact with townspeople by bumping into them.  You pick up items by bumping into them. You solve puzzles (in the loosest sense of the word) by (you guessed it) bumping into them. They should have called this game 'Blunder Boy and the Uncredibly Bumpy Dungeon'.The graphics are weak (even for 2001). The music isn't bad, but highly repetitive, even with the Complete Pack. Stat leveling is completely automatic (and one-dimensional). There are no powers, secondary abilities, or any sense of growth other than the number of times you have to bump into an enemy to kill them (typically 1 once you're high enough level). Quests are also automatic - you have no choice in their resolution or even to accept them or not. You just initiate them once you... bump into them.4/10 would not buy again.PS If you still want to buy the game, a controller is highly recommended. Played this with a kb and with a shield controller, and the controller massively improved the playability of the game (such as it is). If I had been stuck w the keyboard, I'd have ragequit in the first 10 minutes.EDIT: I've finally found the perfect adjective to describe the 'bump' combat system: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FrotteurismEssentially, Adol is a pervert that gets off on rubbing himself against his enemies nonconsensually until he 'defeats' them.

												I was really interested in starting to play the Ys Series, since I grew up on SNES Jrpgs, Secret of Mana/Evermore, Final Fantasy, Lufia, Terranigma, Chrono Trigger etc etc. The graphics were really compelling and the series seems to be quite successful given how many sequels there are. So I thought I start out with the first two installments and give it a try. Well...having played through the first one on Normal up until the last boss:Nope, not recommended.tl;dr: grinding, backtracking, unbalanced difficulty, generic linear story with no ""red line"" to guide through, stupid gameplay/core mechanic. Nice combat music - overall, keep playing the classics and save it on this one.This is a prime example of a game that aged really badly.Horrible, downright unacceptable game design by today's standards, that was *maybe* acceptable 20 years ago.- Core game mechanic: ""bumping"" into enemies is not only trivial and uninteresting, it's also random af. Hitting an enemy and getting no dmg vs getting hit, because the enemy turns around and hits you back in the last second is not only a world of difference, but there's nothing you can do from your side to ""safely"" execute it. You just bump into enemies sideways and ""hope for the best""; no strategy or thinking/planing involved.- Unbalanced and outright ridiculous difficulty. It starts with you being laughably underpowered and you having to GRIND at the very start of the game to even get your starter equipment to sort of start your quest. Then one or two levels down the line your enemies go from almost unbeatable to oneshots. Its like playing WOW, where you constantly either fight a mob that is 3 or more levels above you, or you are fighting lvl 1 critters. And the last 2-3 bosses are plainly insane, even on normal difficulty.- Generic, bland story & characters & villain: Not the worst thing in the world, if the narrative was interesting at least, however...- NO narrative whatsoever. You basically have to run around and guess what to do next. Not even at the start of the game do you have a clear objective, where to go and what to do next...it just sort of plays itself out because the number of locations is very small and eventually you would have talked to everyone.- Grinding.....seriously..grinding in a SINGLEPLAYER game is a cardinal sin. There should be NO REASON to ever having to grind other than OPTIONAL late game stuff, like secret bosses (FF series). When you have to grind to progress in the MAIN PLOT, there's something wrong with your game balance guys..and not only that...but grinding at the START of the game? Like right off the bat grinding for your START EQUIPMENT..holy ♥♥♥♥.- Backtracking... a lot. What you are dealing with here is an ordinary linear rpg, except almost all areas are open to you at once and you HAVE to have certain items or spoken to a certain person to progress. And if that person ist literally 9 dungeon floors in the back..too bad, happy backtracking or you shall not pass. Backtracking is just like grinding: In almost every case it's bad game design, plain and simple. And this has nothing to do with the age of the game either. There is no grinding or a lot of backtracking in any RPG that I mentioned above. There's no ""this game is old"" excuse. I could probably write a paper on everything what's wrong with this game, but I have to stop for now...The music in the Chronicles version however was really awesome in some places and the graphics are indeed quite nice. But that doesn't cut it. If you are interested in retro rpgs - play any of the ones I mentioned in the beginning and save yourself the time. Sadly the first game in this series ruined my desire to play any sequels, and even though I know this might be unfair - the difference between good and bad Final Fantasy or Breath of Fire installments for example is, they are independent story arks. The Ys series however seems to be in continuity and if I didn't like the first game, whats the point of playing the rest?			"

Who came up with that nonsense?

												I'm not going to say this is a bad game, but what I will say is that this is a bad port. As such an example, turning V-Sync off actually makes most of the game ridiculously harder as the game is very frame dependant on a few bosses. If your frames are low enough, you're guaranteed to get hit on one of the bosses, while if your frames are high enough another boss rarely allows you to hit him (and this is already a very RNG dependant boss). So why is this an option? Because more options are supposed to make it better, right?Beyond that, there's many things that have no reason not to be updated, but weren't. This is pretty much a remake four times over, and they've still left it so you need a guide. Lets also mention that some of that guide used to be an instruction booklet, something you're not /really/ going to have in the same sense with a digital game. I can't even begin to account how much of my time was wandering around aimlessly before I just opened a guide.Here's an example, to progress in the game, at one point you need to talk to an NPC who's outside, an NPC who's inside, leave the city, then talk to the outside NPC inside as well. No hint that you need to leave. A normal person would even think ""Well, I've already checked on her, so there's nothing of use."" Nope, you need to check on her twice, in two different area, to progress. No hint whatsoever. And lets not forget these things could be patched. Things like additional dialogue boxes to tell the player where to go, or what options break what difficulties don't take long to implement. There's more that could be complained about, but you should really get the gist.			"

												I love almost all old school RPG's.I think out of all of the series, i must have about played at least of 70 % of all rpg's ever released to europe/usa.I never played the Ys series though, so i wanted to try it.And this might have some good story, but besides that it is UN playabel in this port on steam.And the game itself is very mediocre executed in the first place.A bad emulated version combined with mediocre game.Create a completely BAD experience.There is about 0.0 intro to what to do.There is no mini map for easy navigationInstead of a catching story start, it is more comparable to something like Grandia 1.The difference is that Grandia 1 is worth playing.This is just another one of those RPGs that starts of typically.You ended up in some far away village, 6 months ago the village was overrun by guess what """" MONSTERS"""" oooh scary.You may not go outside, after you awaken and have to search for some guy in the armory, i found him in 2 minutes, he sure talks alot about neighbouring cities and stuff, but he does not start any event what so ever. I stumbled through all the other houses in the town it took me barely 10 minutes to talk to eveyone, & read everything.And after that returned to where i woke up in the hospital.Guess what still the same text, no new events start, there is not even 1 sign where you need to go.You do not even get a sword.But since there was nothing to do here anymore, i went outside the village,A very cheap picture looking tutorial pops up about the BUMP combat system.Okay easy i get it i have to attack enemies from the side.Bad system in teh first place, but okay acceptable for that era.Now the REAL problem pops in, i already had the feeling the game was running way to fast on my GTX1080 i7 processor and 32GB of RAM.GUESS WHAT !The game Runs Full Screen at 60 FPS. Which both are good things on itself.However the Emulation Speed this publisher set for you is way too high.There is no way to limit it, VSYNC only affects the refresh but it does not impact the emulation speed.Fighting is impossible without a sword in the first place, but combined with a silly BUMP playstyle, and the speed of a SPACESHIP, there is no way to fight whatsoever.Within just 3 sceonds my character attacked a stupid TREE guy for over 45 times from the side that is how fast the animations of this game look in this extreme BAD version on steam. Aiming is almost impossible im surprised i managed to hit it that much before i dropped dead after being hit myself for just 2 times.There is no WORK AROUND or anything.You are better off just downloading an Emulator and playing it that way.That makes me remember i shouldnt buy crap like this on steam.because Steam throws anything on here even from bad publishers, and those never update anything.This is just a rip off, and they are lying that they updated it recently.The configuration tool recognizes my CPU as an MMX processor from an era long past in pc gaming even, the early 2000s.It means they sell a game that has last been updated in 2001, even though they pretend they have updated it recently, it are simple lie's and there configuration tool completely shows that as proof at more points, like recognizing windows 10 as Windows server.net system 2003 Family Edition.In an emulator at least you do not have to enter a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ file menu to save your game but can just press 1 or 2 buttons for it.And you can set teh emulation speed slower to make games that run too fast playable.This publisher included NONE of those options.MY ADVICE PLAY IT FOR FREE, The modernized Sound track and slightly newer Hand drawn Pictures for story text may be nice, but are not worth it.Especially because thats all they affec, some PRE- Set Story Events.The BUMP system basically is not even that bad of an idea, when it runs at the normal meant speed, but combined with a version that runs DOUBLE maybe TRIPLE the intended speed of the original game your just screwed.You can barely aim from the sides, it is even already HARD to navigate through a door of a house, Thats how fast it runs. I expect the same from 2 because they are a package.Hopefully the rest of the series are better, at least those are not emulated like this way.This is a serious poor JOB, it is garbage, and you should not buy this.All the positive reviews are from fanboys that played the original or emulated versions.And maybe the story is a good one further on after the cliché start.But it is simply unplayable on a modern PC.It is just stealing of your money, even though i just payed a few euro for it in some sale.

												You know I was nearing the completion of this game before I deleted it from my library. I honestly had to google who was this made for because it cant be for sane individuals ;this game  and its ' bumping system at the right angle"" is nothing but frustration and is simply not worth it. I heard it is a gem for the console it was bulit for; wonderful for the console. Maybe it is a poor port for PC. I dont know but running around a boss to hit him once then dodge his attacks repeatedly for 10 times is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. That is not fun and is instead meaningless. No healing items. No direction really after a certain point, just random..... I don't know, just confuzzled to say the least. Its best to buy something else than waste time on this.			"

												This review is just a warning for those who enjoyed Ys Origin and Oath in Felghana, and are expecting more of the same from Ys I and II. That's not the case here. All the fighting in the entire game is accomplished by bumping into enemies with movement keys/analog stick. No skills neither magic, just charging at enemies. If you are a person like me, who enjoyed the action element present in Ys Origin, the bump fighting mechanic will ruin your overall experience, I can guarantee that. In addition, most of the boss fights are frustating, as they employ cheap tactics to swarm you with attacks and obliterate you within few seconds. And, even after beating the last boss in a battle that reminded me of a space shooter, Ys I+ didn't feel rewarding at all.It's not an awful game, but I would avoid it.			"

Its only saving grace is your character runs through the game like the Flash on meth with the wind at his back so it all moves incredibly fast and all to the beat of super fast 80s butt rock electric guitar.

												Really don't know how this game is any good when the combat is the worst mechanic i've ever seen.Started it on normal, talked to everone, got a shotsword, died after fighting like 3 of the first enemies. It might help if combat wouldn't require me to run into enemies to deal damage. Attacking from an angle like the game tells you barely works, and eacht ime you get hit you lose 25% of your max health.I start the game over on easy, talk to the 2 main people and exhaust all their dialgoue, DON'T get a shortsword for whatever reason, get killed again even faster by mobs. Similar older games like the  a Link to the Past or Terranigma have proper real time combat, yet this game, ♥♥♥♥s it up completely.0/10 waste of my time.			"

												I've only played Ys I. It started off decent enough, with combat that's simple, yet satisfying. Unfortunately, the game just goes downhill once you get into a dungeon. It's hard to enjoy the dungeons when they're as confusing as they are. The combat remains pretty simple, with the first couple of bosses dying in a single hit if you happen to over-level as I did. The third boss (I believe) will completely destroy you. Your attacks don't land correctly, and it turns out that you need a certain weapon. Unfortunately, getting that weapon is a pain in the ♥♥♥.You know, there's nothing wrong with back-tracking in a game, but it's a serious problem here when people throw out hints about stuff that you need without providing you with any context for it. Given how much was actually improved over the original versions, it's just really disappointing how confusing this damn game is.I won't even bother playing Ys II, and I just deleted my Ys I save and uninstalled the game. Not fun.			"

The only thing worse than the grinding is the dread that follows of how much time you wasted on bad games instead of living your life. You could have a girlfriend.

												I don't play the games for the weapons or fighting style but for storyline, atmosphere and immersiveness. The storyline in this game looks almost like satire of the worst and most predictable plot in a JRPG. You're  a chosen hero who needs to defeat the lord of evil. Sounds familiar? And let's not even go into the way the game delivers your quests. ""Hi, I'm the sorceress Mary and I have been waiting here all my life to give you this quest so you save the world. here, take this sword and go kill the lord of evil"". Whoa, that was a bit anticlimatic. Plot just sucks, characters are nonexistent. There is three small towns and a few random villagers. I imagine it might have been a masterpiece in the 80s before I was born, but it's just sad in 2014/2015.I thought the battling style was actually fun and different unlike most people here.Not recommended except for nostalgia.

												If you like fast paced games and Action RPGs, this is the game for you. It has a rather unique ""bump"" attack system where you run into enemies to attack. It's not as easy as it sounds though, and has more depth than it would seem as well.Personally, I find the bosses in Ys I to be rather lack luster, if not cheap. However, this is much improved in Ys II, along with much much more.Additionally, you're getting 2 versions of each game (""Chronicles"" from the PSP, and ""Complete"", the original (or previous, at least) PC release) with 4 difficulties, 2 diferent art styles (Complete and Chronicles, configurable ingame at any time), and 3 soundtracks (also configurable ingame at any time). That's quite the bang for your buck if you ask me.If you're picky like me and don't like image filtering, I recommend using the 4:3 aspect ratio mode (Complete) as opposed to 30:17 (Chronicles, which is secretly 16:9, and shall be referred to as such from here on). Using the 16:9 aspect ratio will cause the game to pan out during boss fights. To do this without staying pixel perfect, it filters the image and it becomes really blurry. You can also see more in 4:3.It's a lot of fun, rather challenging at times (it certainly won't be holding your hand at all), and has fantastic art and music. Highly recommended.			"

												A good JRPG to play over a weekend. It's relatively short as JRPGs go but feels neither rushed nor padded out. The story, while hardly original, is good enough to propel things along. There is a good sense of humor buried just beneath the surface -- you don't get much of it if you just stick to the main quest without deviation, but try doing off-the-wall stuff and a lot of time the results will be pretty funny. Combat is quick and doesn't get stale, and there's a good variety of boss fights, some of them quite difficult even if you've leveled up.			"

												A classic beautiful game with a beautiful story that still manages to pull me in to this day even after so many replays throughout the years.For starters I would actually recommend starting with Oath in Felgana and Origin, then playing I&II. Why? Because the other 2 games have the more exciting gameplay and are more polished, and because once you've played those games you'll be invested enough in the world and the story to actually give the old school bump-monster to attack mechanics a try.(Although I have to say you'll probably get used to I&II's gameplay much faster than you think)I could go on, but to make it short from the story to the gameplay to the beautiful music Ys is by far the RPG series I love the most.

												Ys I & II Chronicles+ is one of the better games I've played. It has the ""features"" from the old Zelda games, which is always nice. Where you ""run around"" collecting items, and progress through the levels. The story is rich and well told, and has a red line through it from start to finish. The constrols work fine, but might take some effort getting ""used to"" how to fight efficiently, but this should not take to long. The game also provides good explanations on what you should do next, without making it to easy. Only problem is that there is no place that I've found that ""records"" what people say, so you will have to remember it or write it down.Also and word of advice, even though the other game in the series is called Ys Origins, you should play 1 and 2 first as Origins refers to things happening in those games.Definitly a great buy, even more now that its 75% off!

												Considered one of the first ""Action RPG""s...while the run & stab combat system may seem clunky today, it blew people who were used to turn-based games out of the water.  Y's II kicked it up a bit by also letting you use magic attacks assigned to an action button.  This is just a audio/visual facelift, it plays almost exactly like it used to. (possibly too exactly, it has been discussed that certain bosses that move around the screen actually seem to move faster at resolutions higher than default and slower on lower resolutions, while the players speed remains the same, with the effect of making them easy to cheese through just by dropping through to a smaller window mode, so some old code from before the dynamic resolution sizes may have been reused.)

													I just finished with both 1 and 2 and glad to say these games are timeless classics. One thing you will love about these two are the great storytelling. You will definetly be drawn into the lore of the franchise just like you will into the two games' main stories due to a cause of fascination. The characters in the game are great and really memorable especially the main character. Another this is the gameplay is a major improvement over Hydlide on the NES, In wich this game was hated by many including famous gamers like the Angry Video Game Nerd and Jared who now has his own YouTube account. The familar battle system goes through where Hydlide went wrong and fixes a whole lot of problems making it as enjoyable as intended. The game rewards you for exploring everthing especially when the game now has achievements. One last thing you will love about them is the great presentation.The games visuals are astounding even when in the animated cutscenes. The music is so beautifully orchestrated, they need their original soundtracks because From the rock songs to Feena's calming theme which is a great example of how great of a job you can do when it comes to classical music, these songs are would be nice to have on your music player. These two games are really great and are not worth missing out on. I am now into the Ys series itself. Now my aims are towards Oath in Felghana and Origins.			"

												For $3.75 I could not pass this up! I have never played the originals. This game is a must but! Easy to pick up and play! The gameplay is solid and it offers multiple difficulties and a boss rush mode. You can play with keyboard or gamepad (use the gamepad). The story is great for a game made back in the 80's. The max level you can achieve is 10. The game is fairly short so unless you spend time farming you will hit ten just before the final dungeon. The bosses pose decent difficulty at higer difficulty settings. They are for the most part very easy and don't require much thought. The music is where this game shines! 10/10 It has been a long time since I have heard such a quality lineup of tracks! The best part is none of the music is recycled outside of bosses. I would buy a soundtrack! Overall, If you love fast paced RPG's this game is a must buy! I was highly impressed.

												Neat little action-rpg. Has a unique combat system where you just walk right into enemies, and if you walk at the right angles, they can't attack you back. Story is pretty basic, but the game is pretty old too so that's understandable.			"

												Some older games hold up well as time has passed.  This one doesn't.  Unless you have a specific reason for wanting to play this game I would avoid it.  If you are just hoping to sit down and have a nice casual RPG experience, avoid this like a plague.  If you are unfamiliar with the series you'll likely spent your first 2 hours of gameplay talking to viallagers in the starting town and getting killed by the first 5 monsters in the field.			"

												Great game (and serie), classic JRPG from master system. However the last boss is way too random. Had a hard time beating him in nightmare. This game is a great challenge and a good experience for old-school RPG lovers.(If you still didn't played it, jump on it)+ :Beautiful retro graphics.Choice between originals artworks/OST and ramade ones.Great OST.Interesting story.Unique fighting features.Did i say Great OST ?Challenging mode (NIghtmare).You can save everywhen and evrywhere (excepted in boss battle of course)Hidden funny success.- :You can't grind (Might be hard for people new to RPGs).Some Boss are kinda Random.A bit short for a RPG.

SummaryWhile not too particularly interesting as far as gameplay goes, the story is decent enough and the characters are likeable. They're pretty short, which is a good thing considering the combat gets stale very fast and there is almost no differences between the hundreds of different enemy types other than damage and health values. Ys II has a questionable level design philosphy. However, in the end, it was the fun little things about the games that I really came to appreciate, such as ""measuring"" Feena, or seeing the NPC's reactions as I burn them with fireballs.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ys I can be completed fairly easily without spoilers, but I highly recommend a walkthrough for the second game as the maps in Ys II are very large and convoluted with innumerable amounts of branching paths, and the game does very little to give you a sense of direction. Completing these areas involves a lot of wandering around searching for the correct path and there is a lot of backtracking involved. Solomon Shrine in particular is just a gigantic labyrinth that will have you walking around aimlessly for hours until you manage to accidentally stumble upon the correct room.If you speak to them in Roo form, many of the enemies even comment on how giant it is, with some of them even claiming to be lost. As this game is very old, I believe the developers went with this approach to pad the game out and make it feel like it's bigger and longer than it really is.Combat in both of the games is very simple. Ys I combat feels somewhat binary - you either have high enough stats, or you don't. Ys II combat felt a lot smoother, however the problem with Ys II's combat is that every enemy was a complete pushover. Even if you're twenty levels lower than the enemy, all you have to do is walk at it diagonally long enough and it will eventually die, with absolutely no risk to yourself. Equipment in the game is very arbitrary; all it does is raise your strength and defense. There is no difference between any of the equipment other than those two stats. If they completely removed the equipment system and increased how much strength and defense you get from levels to compensate, there would be absolutely no difference to how the game plays, other than gold being even more useless than it already is.Magic in Ys II was one of the best additions they could have made, and it is the only equipment that actually has any meaningful value. One minor complaint I had with the magic is that only half of the magic types had any interaction with the magic button. The other half were always on 24/7 and drained your magic constantly unless you unequipped them. There is absolutely no reason why they couldn't be toggled with the magic button, and it results in a whole lot of fumbling around in the inventory as you equip/unequip the magic constantly.Despite all of these complaints, the game was very enjoyable.

												This is the definitive version of the first couple Ys games. The classic unique gameplay is joined by beautiful updated 2D visuals and kickass music. In fact, the soundtrack for these games is among my favorites of all time. And if you are feeling nostalgic, you can switch to the original versions of the songs on the fly. Portraits can also be changed to another version, bringing the best of all worlds into this version.

												Ys has changed rather dramatically over the years but Ys I & II Chronicles+ is as good a place to start as any. As with most early Ys games on the PC Engine, Ys I & II has a ""bump"" mechanic for combat. The idea being that you chip the enemy sprite to maximize your damage. Honestly it's a love or hate kind of thing but I personally love it. Thankfully most of the Ys games are stand alone but I suggest playing I & II in order at least.			"

												This is for both Ys 1 & 2, since steam seperates them as two different titles. I would just like to say that this is an amazing remake of both games. Having finished the second game after a 10 hour marathon, I have to say that they really improved the gameplay dramatically. It flows much better than the PCEngine(TurboGrafx 16 in North America) version, which was the first version of Ys 1 & 2 that I had played. The music is simply amazing. The old tracks are reworked by Nihon Falcom's in house band, Sound Team JDK. All the remixed music sounds great, and has a hard rock feel to it. All in all, if you have never played any Ys game, and you enjoy top down ARPGs such as Zelda, I can't reccomend this enough. Definitely worth the asking price and more if you ask me.			"

												This review isn't going to try selling you on the games, because I have no reservations to admitting that I am a diehard Ys fan, and that YES, YOU SHOULD BUY THESE, PLAY THEM AND LOVE THEM. DO IT. DO IT NOW. Instead, this is just some thoughts on the nature of the latest round of remakes and how, it seems, Falcom is just stuck in their ways.The one thing that bothers me the most about the first Ys is that, no matter how many times it's remade by Falcom, they never once increased the level cap. The DS remake by another company did this, albeit simply by halving the stat boosts you got, effectively making you have to work twice as hard for the same stat boosts in any other version. Couple this with the fact that you should in no way be lower than max level before entering Darm Tower voids any reason for enemies to give EXP, other than to have yet another number for your bestiary. Also, not being able to harm Dark Fact without the whole set of silver gear, which is NOT Cleria (even though the silver sword should technically be a Cleria weapon via Origin) and is inferior to the battle set also makes no sense, other than that Falcom is so set in their ways that they refuse to modify anything outside of the graphics and music in any remake of Ys I.Ys II, for all the hidden content and overall amazing upgrade, has undergone exactly one change, content wise, which is the inclusion of mascot key chains. In all of these years, that's the best Falcom could manage? Again, much like the first game, it seems as though they are stuck in this mindset that the first two games should never be changed in any radical way, while the other remakes, Oath and Memories, have gone through such radical changes that it's hard to believe that they're from the same company.Why are Ys I&II meant to lanugish so, chained to a past that Falcom doesn't seem to want to forget, yet other remakes are free to be so different? I don't think anybody will ever know for sure, and I'm positive that in 20 years time and after several more remakes, I will still be asking why Adol has a level 10 cap and why he can't win with the battle set in Ys I Ultra Hyper Turbo Redux Mega 2035 Special Edition that came with a life size Feena figure.Also, YES, YOU SHOULD BUY THESE, PLAY THEM AND LOVE THEM. DO IT. DO IT NOW.			"

												Ys I:Great game.  Combat was a bit hard to get used to, but by the end I quite liked it.  Story was decent.  One complaint, the final boss is the worst most bull**** fight I have ever experienced.  Do yourself a favor and when you get to the final boss, just watch someone else do it on YouTube and pretend you did it.  Took me 3 hours to do a boss fight that, when I finished it, took about 30-40 seconds.Ys II:After playing Ys I I went straight into Ys II and after finishing it I have to say, I think it is quite a bit better than the first.Improvements over Ys I;- The combat is faster and, in my opinion, quite a bit easier.- The monsters are harder, which combined with the easier combat is a good thing.- The addition of magic adds another layer to a game which was really fairly basic without it.- A level cap higher than 10 also gives you a way to improve and work for, since in Ys I you can get to level 10 pretty quickly.- The bosses are less luck based and more skill based, including the final boss thank god.- Return magic, Return magic, Return magic!- Mascots...Cons;- Sometimes the monsters are a bit too tough, though it is possible that I just didn't have good enough equipment at the time.- The limit on items like apples, flowers, etc. is somewhat annoying, though I can understand why it's there, since you could just grab like 99 herbs and never die during a boss fight.Very few complaints about the games, Ys II is definitely an improvement and I look forward to playing the later games.

												YS II is a fantastic game despite a few rough spots (Escort Mission, cough cough) but overall is a classic, well designed Jrpg that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the genre. True the combat can take adjusting to, but it has it's charm - which is why it wasn't updated. YS II is balanced and well made, and therefore not hampered by the antiquated combat system. YS I is also a great game. To a point. There will come a point in the later game, where you will encounter a boss. We'll call him ""Mine Bat Boss"" because you will need to Google this a lot to find ""helpful tips"" on how to ""beat"" him. Don't expect this to happen however, as it is literally impossible without cheating. The boss in question is the biggest exposure of the weakness in the ""Run into him really mean like"" combat system Ys was born on. My character, at max level, with the best equipment, cannot beat him. It can't be done. I have tried for over a year and just plain gave up - watched the ending on YouTube and moved onto the 2nd game. Ys II is worth the price of admission. And Ys 1 is great, if you want to play 3/4 of the way through before questioning the existence of a loving god. It does have lots of important story aspects for those 3/4 though, and should you beat the boss in question. I applaud you. I am a broken gamer, and will now drown my sorrows as I boot up YS 3. The...the remake...not the horrible SNES one.			"

												Two classic games, one great price! Very unique and old school gameplay system that has you run into enemies off center and diagonally respectively to damage them. These games can be easy at times but more often than not they are tough as nails. If you're looking for a challenging fast paced game then look no further. Ys I+II aren't very long games (10 hours or so on normal) but the Nightmare difficulty is very challenging and unforgiving, Demon/Dark Souls unforgiving at times or even worse.			"

												I think I agree with the several hundred people in these reviews when I say that this is one of the finest games I've ever played. Let me just give you a quick overview:+you fight your enemies by bumping into them at specific angles. Your weapons will auto-attack them, and if you attack at the right angles, they won't be able to counterattack. Takes time to master, but it's very rewarding. I think this is actually a viable replacement for traditional turn based combat, odd as that may seem. You just surge through the game's dungeons at a brisk pace. Difficulty can be adjusted, allowing you to breeze through if it's too hard, but giving you an alternative if it's too easy.+I'm very surprised how much I liked the story. It wasn't in-your-face like most story-heavy RPGs, and it knew when it to ease you into something big. I give it a nice plus because of it. +soundtrack is beautiful, and you get a nice choice between the chronicles version, complete version, and nostalgic version. I recommend all three+graphically the game is beautiful. It has a top notch sprite team, and it was very revolutionary back when it first came out. Even today it still holds up.-the only downside I would consider is that the game doesn't hold your hand, which is normally a good thing, but this game gets downright cryptic. You need to remember every single thing about your world, and remember all of your items and their various uses. You will be tested on how good your puzzle and memory skills are. Myst and Riven have nothing on this.The bottom line? Get. This. Game. It put a tear in my eye, a smile on my mouth, and a very small dent in my wallet. I truly fell in love with Ys because of this. So get a move on and give this game your time. Once you master the combat, I guarantee you won't regret it. I didn't, and this is coming from a guy who had no hope for RPGs/action games on steam.

												I enjoyed this jrpg, though it lacked the depth of many of the more recent gmes I've played. I likes the ""bump"" combat, though it was by no means perfect. To keep from taking damage, you need to hit from the side or back, but the enemies spin so quiickly, it's nearly impossible. I just decided to deal with the damage and heal up after battles. The battle system did make for a much faster playing game. It's amazing how much time is spent in the battle system of most jrpgs.In addition to the simple combat, the story was very simple and the world quite small. I would call this a casual jrpg. That said, some of boss fights are devilishly difficult.I recommend this if you want something that's quick and easy to jump in to.			"

												Combat sucks. There's virtually no skill involved as all you do is literally bump into an enemy. If you bump them head on, you'll both be damaged. If you can manage to bump them off-center or from the back or side, you'll be fine and they'll be damaged. The problem is the enemies change directions almost constantly so it's nearly impossible to attack skillfully.Another huge issue is that for a lot of people the ""Use Item"" key simply doesn't work. The only way to use an item is the ""Use Item"" key and there are several points, apparently, wher you must use an item manually in order to progress the story. I've seen various people saying that disabling Steam Cloud worked. Some people say simply canging the keybinding worked. The only thing that worked for me was changing the binding to the number ""1"".Also, the game difficulty is very inconsistent. The very first boss fight, when I reached it, was impossible to defeat. It would have taken several dozens hits, but there are flamethrowers in the room making it exceptionally difficult to move around much. From that point however, leveling my character 1 level higher and upgrading my weapon one level brought the number hits required on the boss down to 3. So ten minutes of playtime brought that fight from impossible to win down to impossible to lose. That boss wasn't the only enemy like this, either. All the new enemies you find have similar difficulty curves.			"

												Well this is the second game I've played in the Ys series till now (origin being the first) and I must say I enjoyed it quite alot. The origin of the awesome music that Ys is renowned for, and the intriguing story though simple and perhaps something you've seen alot in for instance certain anime, it is still one of the early RPGs and therefore also quite original for its time.Though some boss battles are easy and some quite difficult, the fighting mechanism is but running towards enemies in certain directions (no use of mouse or any attack key whatsoever). It's all about your dodging skills, reflexes and reaction. Also having the proper equipment for certain ""dungeon adventures"" and also boss battles is important to take notice of. But in the end with such an awesome music accompanying the game, it makes the gaming experience all the better. Though I finished the game on normal difficulty, for those ""masochists"" that dare take the challenge till the last boss fight on nightmare mode are welcomed to try this little sucker out. But be wary, though this game may seem short, it packs the deal for a good game even for an 80s game.Also recommend not to play origin first if you want more of a ""mystery"" element to the story itself, and it also makes certain tasks in the game take alot more time, considering many elements, bosses, normal enemies and equipment are taken from this game in origin, but this is only if you've never played any Ys game ever.Best order to play it is Ys 1 and 2, and then do origin, and continue with the others.Either way highly recommend to those who enjoy JRPGs some difficult challanges, and like somewhat typtical animesque storylines.

												Its an RPG that skips the grind and you kill enemies by bumping into them.  It has a good soundtrack and is a fun game.  Some bosses are hard but they are straight foreward to kill.  Keep in mind these are remakes from games made in the late 80s, so the AI is stupid, the mechanics are basic, and the level cap is 10.  Overall though i would definately recommend this to anyone who wants a decent jrpg story without the grind of a typical jrpg.			"

												The YS series are probably best described as Action JRPGs - even though they have a traditional JRPG aethetic, they use a Legend of Zelda style overworld.GameplayYS IThe gameplay is very... unique. It's buttonless, and you attack by charging around the battlefield, with Adol (the protagonist) swinging his sword as he hits enemies. They will hit back unless you come at them from a corner or just off centre. Initially its a bit hard to get a hang of it, but once you do its a blast. There's very little grind after half way through the first game, meaning you can just rush through areas you've already gone through, trashing weak opponents quickly and cutting down backtracking time.The bosses are the real highlight, most of them are very challenging and rewarding to fight (with one exception...) with the final boss being a strategic fight as much as an action-packed brawl. There are also puzzles; some of them can be a bit obtuse, but I never had to use a guide until I was trying to get some of the more obscure achievements.In terms of level design I found the mine dungeon confusing to get through but apart from that it was fairly reasonable. YS II The combat gameplay is kept largely the same, with the introduction of new unique spells like the fireball, which gives a lot of variety, especially for most of the boss fights. The other spells are nice, especially this one that adds a stealth element shall we say (I'll say no more for fear of spoilers.)There is another mine in this and it is just as confusing, as well as this temple thing near the end that sometimes feels like a maze (not as bad as either of the mines though). Graphics/AestheticsYI+IINothing amazing, but I fins the combination of sprites for gameplay and portraits for talky-bits well-executed and with some retrocharm in there as well. The aesthetic design for the character portraits is very 90s -JRPG, so if anything animeish reduces your enjoyment of a game, you have been warned.It won't blow your socks off though.SoundYS I+IIThis WILL blow your socks off. The music is this crazy good rock music that stands apart form the usual JRPG faire and suits the frenetic pace of the combat. The boss themes in particular are heartpounding. It sounds great and complements the gameplay perfectly so it knocks it out of the park as far as I'm concerned.Story YSI + IINothing spectacular. Held back by a silent protagonist and a rather simple world (which improves marvellously in the second game). However, it is well told and well paced, with some great supporting characters to keep it going. There are definitely some standout moments. Most importantly, it is well written (thanks be to XSEED, long may they localise) and never lets the talking get in the way of the action.ConclusionIt's well worth the price; solid retro action and a decent story. The one thing I will say is that the challenge level is reasonably high, especially for a JRPG. This is particularly true of the final parts of the first game since grinding is not an option. I'll say this as well, its made me very interested in the sequels and Falcom's Legend of Heroes series.At a guess it takes about 10-15 hours to beat both games.			"

												Third game of Ys that I played after Origin and Ys I. Its even better than Ys the first part and 100% recommended if you like action RPGs. Thanks to XSEED and Nihon for publishing this game in PC, otherwise who knows if I had had the delight to play it.Artwork, Music is amazing and the new FMVs tough short are beautifuly conceived.

												This is a fun little game, nostalgically remembering me of old school RPG like Mystic Quest Legend. There's no big plot, just the typical ""yo stranger, go and save the world will ye? There's a good lad, off with you."" But it's fun.The game has a few weapons and armour, but no magic and skill system. You run into everything you encounter, preferably in a diagonal way. That's all. :)			"

												This game has some of the most frustrating bosses and kick-♥♥♥ music I've ever seen in a game.This is honestly a pretty good port, considering it's basically just the PSP re-make. Has two different versions of the game, controller support (which you'll probably want in a game like this), and three different versions of the soundtrack that you can switch between at any time during gameplay.I only have a few complaints:1: The hitboxes for enemies are a little wonky. It feels like the game favors the enemies over the player in terms of what counts as you hitting them Vs. what counts as you getting hit, so be ready to die a lot. This goes double for bosses, since you can't heal once you enter a boss room and several of them can ignore your defenses outright. Save often, and you'll save (*rimshot*) yourself a lot of trouble.2: Grinding is an outright necessity. If you don't max out your level, you can't beat the game. In fact, you probably can't even get to the final dungeon if you don't. Luckily, level grinding doesn't take too long and the level cap is pretty low, being only 10. It's more the fault of the way RPGs were when the original game was released than truly poor game design.3: The game doesn't come with the OST. Major missed oppertunity, since the music is the best part.8.5/10, probably going to buy every Ys game on Steam just for the music.			"

												While I have yet to finish even the FIRST of the two original Ys games included here in this ""Chronicles+"" package, I can already quite firmly say that I am thrilled with my purchase, and would highly recommend this!  Whether or not you played any of the earlier iterations of these games, all RPG fans should be well pleased.  Even for those who are familiar with the original games (and the, before this, most superior version on Turbo CD) will have a good deal of new features to interest them and keep them excited.The game offers a high level of customization, to allow for the best possible play experience, also.  I personally prefer to use a gamepad for MOST of my gaming, and with my Logitek controller playing this feels just like the good ol' days of 8- and 16-bit RPGs.  However, if you want to use your keyboard and mouse, that is fully customizable as well.  Also, you can choose to play the game with the map taking up the entire screen area, OR in the classic bordered (""windowed"") view from the originals.  You can also choose the graphics style -- classic or the new updated version.  For me, it seems an obvious choice to play it fullscreen (within the game and on the monitor!) with the updated graphics -- as everything is absolutely beautiful and really keeps the feeling and spirit of the original while updating it for a new era.  As much as I love the classic look and feel of the oldschool stuff, when an update is done this well it truly does come off even better than the original.The first two installments of Nihon Falcom's classic series are brought to life in an excellent way, and I highly recommend this game (and the other Ys games on Steam)!

												Most of the reviews in here tend to think people are whining because the game feels dated. The reason this game isn't good is because the game mechanics aren't good. You attack things by running into them, you get no additional ways to attack (read: magic), the way you beat the game is by running into things until you're strong enough to run into other things. Taking too much damage from those enemies in the mine? Run into things until you can 1 shot them. I played it on Nightmare until almost the end of the game, then I realized I was playing a cursor simulator. There are SOOOO many better action RPGs out there to spend your money on.			"

												Its an RPG that skips the grind and you kill enemies by bumping into them.  It has a good soundtrack and is a fun game.  Some bosses are hard but they are straight foreward to kill.  Keep in mind these are remakes from games made in the late 80s, so the AI is stupid, the mechanics are basic, and the level cap is 10.  Overall though i would definately recommend this to anyone who wants a decent jrpg story without the grind of a typical jrpg.			"

												Ys I:Great game.  Combat was a bit hard to get used to, but by the end I quite liked it.  Story was decent.  One complaint, the final boss is the worst most bull**** fight I have ever experienced.  Do yourself a favor and when you get to the final boss, just watch someone else do it on YouTube and pretend you did it.  Took me 3 hours to do a boss fight that, when I finished it, took about 30-40 seconds.Ys II:After playing Ys I I went straight into Ys II and after finishing it I have to say, I think it is quite a bit better than the first.Improvements over Ys I;- The combat is faster and, in my opinion, quite a bit easier.- The monsters are harder, which combined with the easier combat is a good thing.- The addition of magic adds another layer to a game which was really fairly basic without it.- A level cap higher than 10 also gives you a way to improve and work for, since in Ys I you can get to level 10 pretty quickly.- The bosses are less luck based and more skill based, including the final boss thank god.- Return magic, Return magic, Return magic!- Mascots...Cons;- Sometimes the monsters are a bit too tough, though it is possible that I just didn't have good enough equipment at the time.- The limit on items like apples, flowers, etc. is somewhat annoying, though I can understand why it's there, since you could just grab like 99 herbs and never die during a boss fight.Very few complaints about the games, Ys II is definitely an improvement and I look forward to playing the later games.

SummaryWhile not too particularly interesting as far as gameplay goes, the story is decent enough and the characters are likeable. They're pretty short, which is a good thing considering the combat gets stale very fast and there is almost no differences between the hundreds of different enemy types other than damage and health values. Ys II has a questionable level design philosphy. However, in the end, it was the fun little things about the games that I really came to appreciate, such as ""measuring"" Feena, or seeing the NPC's reactions as I burn them with fireballs.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ys I can be completed fairly easily without spoilers, but I highly recommend a walkthrough for the second game as the maps in Ys II are very large and convoluted with innumerable amounts of branching paths, and the game does very little to give you a sense of direction. Completing these areas involves a lot of wandering around searching for the correct path and there is a lot of backtracking involved. Solomon Shrine in particular is just a gigantic labyrinth that will have you walking around aimlessly for hours until you manage to accidentally stumble upon the correct room.If you speak to them in Roo form, many of the enemies even comment on how giant it is, with some of them even claiming to be lost. As this game is very old, I believe the developers went with this approach to pad the game out and make it feel like it's bigger and longer than it really is.Combat in both of the games is very simple. Ys I combat feels somewhat binary - you either have high enough stats, or you don't. Ys II combat felt a lot smoother, however the problem with Ys II's combat is that every enemy was a complete pushover. Even if you're twenty levels lower than the enemy, all you have to do is walk at it diagonally long enough and it will eventually die, with absolutely no risk to yourself. Equipment in the game is very arbitrary; all it does is raise your strength and defense. There is no difference between any of the equipment other than those two stats. If they completely removed the equipment system and increased how much strength and defense you get from levels to compensate, there would be absolutely no difference to how the game plays, other than gold being even more useless than it already is.Magic in Ys II was one of the best additions they could have made, and it is the only equipment that actually has any meaningful value. One minor complaint I had with the magic is that only half of the magic types had any interaction with the magic button. The other half were always on 24/7 and drained your magic constantly unless you unequipped them. There is absolutely no reason why they couldn't be toggled with the magic button, and it results in a whole lot of fumbling around in the inventory as you equip/unequip the magic constantly.Despite all of these complaints, the game was very enjoyable.

In fact, the soundtrack for these games is among my favorites of all time. And if you are feeling nostalgic, you can switch to the original versions of the songs on the fly. Portraits can also be changed to another version, bringing the best of all worlds into this version.

												Ys has changed rather dramatically over the years but Ys I & II Chronicles+ is as good a place to start as any. As with most early Ys games on the PC Engine, Ys I & II has a ""bump"" mechanic for combat. The idea being that you chip the enemy sprite to maximize your damage. Honestly it's a love or hate kind of thing but I personally love it. Thankfully most of the Ys games are stand alone but I suggest playing I & II in order at least.			"

													I just finished with both 1 and 2 and glad to say these games are timeless classics. One thing you will love about these two are the great storytelling. You will definetly be drawn into the lore of the franchise just like you will into the two games' main stories due to a cause of fascination. The characters in the game are great and really memorable especially the main character. Another this is the gameplay is a major improvement over Hydlide on the NES, In wich this game was hated by many including famous gamers like the Angry Video Game Nerd and Jared who now has his own YouTube account. The familar battle system goes through where Hydlide went wrong and fixes a whole lot of problems making it as enjoyable as intended. The game rewards you for exploring everthing especially when the game now has achievements. One last thing you will love about them is the great presentation.The games visuals are astounding even when in the animated cutscenes. The music is so beautifully orchestrated, they need their original soundtracks because From the rock songs to Feena's calming theme which is a great example of how great of a job you can do when it comes to classical music, these songs are would be nice to have on your music player. These two games are really great and are not worth missing out on. I am now into the Ys series itself. Now my aims are towards Oath in Felghana and Origins.			"

												Ys one chronicles starts the offical story of the red headed swordsman know as Adol Christin. It has a very unique style of gameplay called the bumping system. I found the bumping system to be very fun and intuative to the kind of action rpg I was playing.You literally have to just run into the enemies but, at an angle or from behind or they will counter you're attacks and kill you very quickly. The strory of Ys is a very enjoyable one and the characters are very rememerable. I found myself starting the second half of the story as soon as I finished Ys I. I give Ys I chronicles a 8/10 a great start for the red headed swordsman! YS II chronicles what can I say, it was a great conclusion to the first half. I enjoyed it even more than Ys I chronicles and found the dialog to be way better as well as more humorous. Ys II had a differnet feel to it than the first half of it's former game and presented itself in a more polished thoughout gameplay experience, I loved it a 9/10.			"

												I only played one playthrough of both games Ys 1 + 2 but it was definetly worth it. It feels so oldschool and back to the roots that you will miss the old days. It is very challenging (the last boss fight probably is a frustration experience you have never lived through before) but an experience i didnt want to miss. For this price you should probably buy this game if you ever thought about it a little bit			"

												Considering this is two games instead of one, I have two reviews instead of one for them:Ys I is regarded as a classic retro game by most who have been able to play it. And it earns this title with ease. However, due to the game’s most common versions being on systems that didn’t really make it in the US, it is also a lost classic… but a flawed one. There is a lot of good to be had here, but some baffling decisions hold it back from being one of the best classic games you have never had the chance to play. To see my full review, please visit my blog at http://redsectorshutdown.blogspot.com/2013/05/ys-i-pc-review.htmlYs II, on the other hand, is basically the game I wish Ys I was. The original was a classic title and made it obvious to see why, but it also made mistakes that could never be overlooked and prevented the game from being possibly one of the best of it’s time. Ys II seems to have been made to fix that, and is overall a much better game because of it. Once again, my full review is available at my blog at http://redsectorshutdown.blogspot.com/2013/12/ys-ii-pc-review.html "

												It feels like the guys who did this re-release noticed what we all hated in the re-releases of other JRPG franchises :cough:FF7:cough: and avoided them.The visual options are pretty sensible-- since it's a fundamentally sprite-based game, it looks good without anti-aliasing, as long as you like the 16-bit look, and widescreen is functional.You get a choice between three distinct sound sets, ranging from ""well, that's indeed what it sounded like on a 1980s home computer"" to orchestral.The controller support is not perfect-- everything's labelled in the config software as ""Button 6""-- but the defaults are pretty sane with a 360 pad.Unlike, say, Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest titles, these are actually a linear story with the same lead character and background.

												funny that as far as Steam is corncerned there are no reivews here, so in case you heard about the games and want to give it a try here's the deal:-what's this game?: a pseudo remake from a very old game, made from the ground up and updating it while trying to be loyal to the original in terms of gameplay-how does it play?: think the original The Legend of Zelda but instead of there being an attack button you run into enemies, while the original was realeased a year after Zelda it actually rips off another game called hydelide so no, it's not really a zelda clone-does it hold up?, Ys 1 does and has a charm to it but it has a terrible dificulty spike at the very end, it's not imposible and it's very short anyways, note that Ys 1 is kinda like Ys 2's Ground Zeroes in this package so the real meat is in Ys 2 wich in turn drags on forever and feels unfair at times-is this game representative of the entire series?: short answear: NO, Long Answear: Ys 1 and 2 are the only ones in wich you run into enemies and while Ys 1 is fun because of it's arcaic dessign, the other ones from Ys 3 onward are far superior and if what you want is an instantaniously fun and enjoyable game skip to Ys 3 onward, note that Steam's Ys 3 (Oath in Felgana) is actually a remake with entirely new gameplay based on Ys 6 (originally for the PS2, PSP and aviable here on Steam) as for the new gameplay it has more in common with Brave Fencer Musashi or Zelda Minish Cap (the last one just barely since the combat is way more complex)-do i need to play Ys 1 and 2 if i want to get into the franchise?: not really, since it's based on an old game aside of some tangential arcs there is barely any story on the game and can be read on a wikia, feel free to try Ys 1 since you can finish it on a day if you want but bare in mind that the story ends on a cliff hanger ending that goes directly into Ys 2's begining and Ys 2, for it's maze like level dessign in EVERYTHING has aged terribly bad, so feel free to wiki it and go for Ys 3-so what is the game's chronollogy, do i need to play them  in order?: since the games are Adol's travels and narrations the games from Ys 2 onward are out of order and while there is a time line i recomend you playing them in ny order as long as it's 3, 6 or Zero, then moving into seven and then into 4 or else you'll be struggling with the changes in gameplay since 0, 3 and 6 are based on the same gameplay, seven refins it and 4 beign the newest one takes a lot from 7 with some new twists, 0 BTW it's a prequel-so how many Ys numerical games are?: there are a lot of old Ys games but no old release is now considered canon and the steam and PSP/PSV versions are either remakes, amalgamations of old games (there used to be 2 Ys 3 games with different gameplays and 2 Ys 4s with different stories) or re imaginings of them so avoid anything pre PS2, that said aviable in their digital form there are:Ys 0 (here on Steam and PS4 and soon enough PSV)Ys 1 & 2 (on PSP/PSV and Steam)Ys 3 (on PSP/PSV and Steam)Ys 4 (the newest one so far only on the PSV)Ys 5 (so far no new version exists and the original Super Famicom version seems to be no longer canon)Ys 6 (Steam)Ys 7 (PSP/PSV)and that's pretty much it, Ys 1 and 2 are not bad games but are old and not for everyone so i do recomend them IF you have the patience and want to experience the stoy first hand			"

												A classic beautiful game with a beautiful story that still manages to pull me in to this day even after so many replays throughout the years.For starters I would actually recommend starting with Oath in Felgana and Origin, then playing I&II. Why? Because the other 2 games have the more exciting gameplay and are more polished, and because once you've played those games you'll be invested enough in the world and the story to actually give the old school bump-monster to attack mechanics a try.(Although I have to say you'll probably get used to I&II's gameplay much faster than you think)I could go on, but to make it short from the story to the gameplay to the beautiful music Ys is by far the RPG series I love the most. Yes, even more than Final Fantasy or Elder Scrolls series.			"

												Ys I & II Chronicles+ is one of the better games I've played. It has the ""features"" from the old Zelda games, which is always nice. Where you ""run around"" collecting items, and progress through the levels. The story is rich and well told, and has a red line through it from start to finish. The constrols work fine, but might take some effort getting ""used to"" how to fight efficiently, but this should not take to long. The game also provides good explanations on what you should do next, without making it to easy. Only problem is that there is no place that I've found that ""records"" what people say, so you will have to remember it or write it down.Also and word of advice, even though the other game in the series is called Ys Origins, you should play 1 and 2 first as Origins refers to things happening in those games.Definitly a great buy, even more now that its 75% off!

												Considered one of the first ""Action RPG""s...while the run & stab combat system may seem clunky today, it blew people who were used to turn-based games out of the water.  Y's II kicked it up a bit by also letting you use magic attacks assigned to an action button.  This is just a audio/visual facelift, it plays almost exactly like it used to. (possibly too exactly, it has been discussed that certain bosses that move around the screen actually seem to move faster at resolutions higher than default and slower on lower resolutions, while the players speed remains the same, with the effect of making them easy to cheese through just by dropping through to a smaller window mode, so some old code from before the dynamic resolution sizes may have been reused.)

												Not the typical RPG, this is the 'action' RPG where you literally need to bump-kill enemies. While it sounds like a fun/refreshing way to combat, it isn't really that much fun after you missed the enemy and gotten killed in return. Due to the limited leveling and item/equipment to purchase as well, the point of grinding/exploring the areas are very much dead too as there ain't much reasons to farm experience or money. IMO playing with a controller makes it easier (I was  using a PS3 controller) but keyboard is still perfectly fine.Pros:*Funny scripts (from time to time)*Decent music*Simple and linear gameplayCons:*Bump-attack is a bummer (you will tend to just run around and around bosses/monsters to both hit and avoid them)*VERY short game (I spent around 3 days to complete nightmare...)*Stories are not fully detailed out in just one episode (I still don't know what Feena's all about and I guess I MUST complete Ys 2 to know...)Summary:Get it when it is discounted and provided that you do not mind old games, there ain't nothing fancy and nothing complicated here.

												Woww, why did nobody tell me just how GOAT this series is? Just finished 1&2 Chronicles + & im about halfway through Oath. For how simple the games are its the visuals and soundtrack that keep you roped in. Although the ""bumper cars"" battle system isnt very innovative in itself, it wasnt a game breaker for me, it was actually kind of refreshing to just have simple battles like that in an RPG for once. Bosses were actually difficult, and there are enough missable easter eggs that you can play through it a couple times and still not get them all. All in all a great series, for any rpg lover, and it looks like they are going to flash sale in about 20 minutes, so pick this up if you have the extra 3$.			"

												Ys I+II has been remade so many times over so many systems, and with good reason. It's a classic action RPG game similar to Legend of Zelda with a very basic battle system, a good story, and some of the best music you'll ever hear from a game. With this package you get two games for the price of one, and the choice of 3 different soundtracks to listen to (Chronicles, Complete and the original PC-88 versions).

												*WARNING: This Review is specifically for Ys I. I have yet to finish II (although I recommend that one too), but until then here's my review for I.The game itself is very short in my opinion in terms of story, however the story is surprisingly compelling (or rather, interesting for those who don't feel the same enthusiasm). Gameplay is fun and simple. I can literally point my character in the right direction for an attack and go about that and drink a cola with my other hand.! Ha ha, well jokes aside, the game is beautiful and has a linear yet, NON-linear story to it. The game encourages you to explore and doesn't give you much direction at first, but trust me, you won't regret the exploration.			"

												XSEED has released several of the Ys games over here, and I'm very glad that they have. The later Ys games play like a combination of Zelda with Diablo, or some other action-adventure RPG. These remakes of the first two are a bit different, with combat being based on the ""bump"" system, where enemies take damage when you run into them (though you'll take damage too if you run into them head-on). The plots are pretty much excuses for you to explore dungeons full of enemies and take artifacts, but the gameplay itself is quite fun.While I enjoy the later ones more, and there are a few annoying elements that haven't aged terribly well, the games still remain fun, and these remakes tie in together with the remake of Origin (also available on Steam) very nicely. Highly recommended, especially to Zelda fans.			"

												Having played YS oath of felghana and YS ark of napishtim and YS Seven on PS2 and PSP respectively; i was not sure what to expect from Ys 1+2 and i am overjoyed to say it is the same fantastic top down action RPG / with fantastic NPC's and a simplistic yet enjoyable plot. I highly reccomend this game to anyone that are fans of RPG,s / action titles.I have yet to start YS 2, but YS 1 truly hooks you right away with a great style of presentation that the series is known for, although a little on the short side [10-15 hours or so] thats only the first title of the game. It intially threw me off guard that you need to run into enemies to do damage but that quickly subsides after an hour or so. Ys games are well known for their difficulty and amazing music and boss fights and this game does not dissapoint in the slightest. The soundtrack is fantastic and always fit the mood/setting perfectly. it is just pure joy to hack and slash dozens of monsters while exploring this intriguing envronment.  the boss fights are also challenging and on thing i love about the game is it does not hold your hand, you are free to explore wherever you will even if that means multple deaths trying to reach that elusive chest or just testing the waters in a new area, that lack of linearity is something i love about the YS games and this is no exception.A simple yet dynamic equipment system, a great bestiary and plenty of personality in the NPC's is something i love about the YS titles and this one delivers in that regard yet again. this game came out quite long ago [1997 or so] and i can definitely say it has stood the test of time as it is very enjoyable which is an impressive feat in itself.Honestly, i reccomend this game to its fullest extent. the YS series is one of the most unique and under appreciated RPG series out there and it deserves much more recognition. With the new YS game on PSP Vita just coming out, im hoping this series continues to excel at what it does best. Amazing soundtrack, Fun hack and slash elements, fantastic NPC's,  great sense of exploration, and a simplistic yet great plot are thing you will find in Ys 1+2. I sincerely reccomend it! "

												Easily one of my all-time favorite RPG franchises, this is where it all started. Chronicles revives the vision Masaya Hashimoto had by introducing a re-vamped soundtrack, art, sprites and general configuration that supports modern systems and resolutions. The Ys Vanished saga is included in two parts, each one being a seperate game, and both games also enable the option of experiencing the game with PC-88 art/music, as well as the 2001 variant officially known as Complete.Simply put, if you are looking for a somewhat minimal action-rpg that has an engrossing plot, varied landscapes and engaging boss fights, then this is the game you're looking for. Seriously, you WILL have fun if you enjoy fast-paced action-RPGs. There are obviously a few flaws to the game such as an awkward leveling system (only in the first one), and inconsistent difficulty between bosses (also more prevalent in the first one), but the pros definitely outperform the cons for this fantastic epic.Also as a side remainder, there is a heavy lack of jRPG ports on PC from Japan to America. This is indeed a very sad, but real problem that we have had for the past many years now. XSEED is famous for making ports like these a reality for many of us niche players, as well as other rpg-gamers who enjoy these sort of games. This is why I urge anyone who actually enjoys jRPGs and especially the Ys franchise to support XSEED and purchase all 4 Ys games they've published so far (Ys I and II are packed, so it's 3 in the store along with Oath and Origins). With continued support we can expect XSEED to translate and pot even more jRPGs in the future, and that's the kind of thing that I could only dream of for so long up until now.So please, I know many people tend to pirate games since money is indeed a hard thing to come by, but make an exception to this great franchise, especially since it tends to go on sale once in a while for 75% off. It's how we can secure a good future for the ported/translated pc jRPG market.			"

												Just finished Ys 1, the game is surprisingly good for how simple everything is, the combat seems dull until you fight the first boss, then you find out that this game is way more thought-out, is not a just a hack'n'slash, you can't even hack nor slash, the game does it for you when you get close to the enemies. This could be a bad thing but the game is built around that system, add a bullet hell and that's Ys 1 and 2. The story so far is not amazing but keeps you interested, I never skipped a main dialogue. Plus, is very cheap and a nice time-killer.			"

												I really had no idea what the Ys games were before I bought the Chronicles when they were on sale. I figured that since they had high ratings they were some sort of hipster rpg games that you've never heard about.Boy was I wrong. I played through the first one in one sitting on normal. The next day, I played it on easy to get missed achievements. Next day, started playing II. Next day (today) started the first one on Nightmare.They're simple games. You bump, you gain exp, you do a few quests, and you die. On nightmare. You die a lot. On easy it's a breeze, don't stand in fire and all will fall before you. But they're so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ addictive! I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a game as much as these two. First time runners: unless you're looking for something to just kill some time start with *at least* normal. Skipped from normal to NM so can't tell how the game is with hard, but I doubt it's anything you can't overcome.And the best thing. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ soundtrack. I've had my share of game OSTs but this went to the #1. Even now I'm listening to soundtrack on Youtube. It's just unbelievable. Well, some might disagree.Why you should buy this game? Great arpg, simple but addicting combat, bosses are actually bosses (the bat doesn't exist) and the challenge is always there, but almost always it feels fair.Why you shouldn't? If you're looking for a deep story, character customization and/or a long playthrough following a single campaign, this isn't propably your ideal game. But if you see it on sale like I did grab it and give it a shot! You just might find a new favourite franchise....			"

												A wonderful starting point to a long-running series that is well worth exploring in its entirety. Once you adjust to the rather peculiar ""bump system"" combat, where you defeat enemies by colliding with them rather than using a dedicated attack button, you'll find a wonderfully fluid, fast-paced action RPG with great pacing and a clear understanding of When To Stop.Lovely pixel art, incredible music (plus two older mixes from previous incarnations of Ys I and II) and a compelling story make Ys I & II Chronicles+ a great jumping-on point for those who are yet to learn how Falcom does things.To find out more, check out my in-depth features on the series as a whole over on my site MoeGamer[moegamer.net].

												The Ys series is possibly one of the best rpg's out there and has brought it's creators such joy that they've ported the game 6 times, 4 of which have been improved on with better graphics, music and include the options to switch to older graphics/music from each port.Oh and did I mention the original was published in 1989? The only way the original FF even matches up is because of releases for Android/Windows/iOS phones and the ""Wonderswan"" But they never updated the graphics!			"

												YS I & II Chronicles are oldschool, revamped games updated from the original games made about 20 years or so ago.  I never played the originals but I remember reading about them in gaming magazines and had some brief experience with one of them on the Super Nintendo so long ago.  Ever since then I've always beeen curious to see what the Ys games are about.The game is fast paced with a very simple interface.  The entire combat system is bump based.  Just run into badies and they die.  The challenge is that you cannot hit them directly on center or you will take damage.  It takes quite a bit of getting used to and you can quickly impale yourself on your enemies sword on Nightmare difficulty.  The music is just as energetic as the gameplay and keeps you moving along.  The xp system like all xp systems allows you to grind but you'll find no need to do so.  The character seems to level fast enough without the need to spend extra time smashing bad guys for no reason.  Which you'll probably do anyway because why not tackle everything in sight?!The story is fairly short and seems oddly familiar like most games of its era.  For some this may be disapointing.  I honestly enjoyed playing through the game with it's clear story that stays on track.  So many JRPGs of late take steps way out into the realm of crazy and confusing.  This game keeps it simple.  By the end I was satisfied but don't expect to spend countless hours in this game because it has no side quests or objectives at all.Final Verdict: Neutral Buy this game if you're a fan of Ys and like short games.  Avoid if you've got better things to do.			"

												A good JRPG to play over a weekend. It's relatively short as JRPGs go but feels neither rushed nor padded out. The story, while hardly original, is good enough to propel things along. There is a good sense of humor buried just beneath the surface -- you don't get much of it if you just stick to the main quest without deviation, but try doing off-the-wall stuff and a lot of time the results will be pretty funny. Combat is quick and doesn't get stale, and there's a good variety of boss fights, some of them quite difficult even if you've leveled up.			"

												The care and charm put into these remakes is truly remarkable.  Just as Oath in Felghana triggered a wave of nostalgia, this game manages to provide a truly classic gaming experience, with just enough modern flare to ease (pun?) over some of the rough edges sometimes associated with classic gaming.I found the antiquated 'bump' system quite addictive after a while.  The combat, at times, resembles what would occur if 'the legend of zelda' and 'geometry wars' had a baby.  It's hard to describe, but it's tremendously satisfying.  What is truly outstanding about this game is the personality which pervades every corner.  The random townsfolk all seem to be part of a bigger picture, and have a myriad of dialogue options depending on how you interact with them.  They all seem to have a bit more individual personality than the common run of the mill NPC, and it's easy to grow attached to them.  Not only that, but under certain circumstances, even the enemies can be conversed with (in ys 2 at least).  Not just some of the monsters, but ALL of the monters have their own character and dialogue trees.  Even the steam achievements made me laugh out loud on more than one occasion.Truly this package lets you relive a bit of gaming history without it being some sort of archaeological exercise.  Great music.  Great gameplay.  They're just fun.  Good and fun.About 23 hours.P.S.  Use a frame limiter to cap the frames per second to exactly 60 to eliminate input lag.			"

												This review isn't going to try selling you on the games, because I have no reservations to admitting that I am a diehard Ys fan, and that YES, YOU SHOULD BUY THESE, PLAY THEM AND LOVE THEM. DO IT. DO IT NOW. Instead, this is just some thoughts on the nature of the latest round of remakes and how, it seems, Falcom is just stuck in their ways.The one thing that bothers me the most about the first Ys is that, no matter how many times it's remade by Falcom, they never once increased the level cap. The DS remake by another company did this, albeit simply by halving the stat boosts you got, effectively making you have to work twice as hard for the same stat boosts in any other version. Couple this with the fact that you should in no way be lower than max level before entering Darm Tower voids any reason for enemies to give EXP, other than to have yet another number for your bestiary. Also, not being able to harm Dark Fact without the whole set of silver gear, which is NOT Cleria (even though the silver sword should technically be a Cleria weapon via Origin) and is inferior to the battle set also makes no sense, other than that Falcom is so set in their ways that they refuse to modify anything outside of the graphics and music in any remake of Ys I.Ys II, for all the hidden content and overall amazing upgrade, has undergone exactly one change, content wise, which is the inclusion of mascot key chains. In all of these years, that's the best Falcom could manage? Again, much like the first game, it seems as though they are stuck in this mindset that the first two games should never be changed in any radical way, while the other remakes, Oath and Memories, have gone through such radical changes that it's hard to believe that they're from the same company.Why are Ys I&II meant to lanugish so, chained to a past that Falcom doesn't seem to want to forget, yet other remakes are free to be so different? I don't think anybody will ever know for sure, and I'm positive that in 20 years time and after several more remakes, I will still be asking why Adol has a level 10 cap and why he can't win with the battle set in Ys I Ultra Hyper Turbo Redux Mega 2035 Special Edition that came with a life size Feena figure.Also, YES, YOU SHOULD BUY THESE, PLAY THEM AND LOVE THEM. DO IT. DO IT NOW.			"

												(Ys1) The game is really difficult for stupid reasons; but it saves itself by offering up a decent story, and lead ins  to the sequel. It suffers from the lack of tangible enemy ai that just wander around the area beyond the few that are sentient enough to know that Adol exists. Bosses are the big issue with this game since it's more RNG than skill based, if you mess up while attacking, you simply got a bad pattern if you're competent in using the awkward bumping system to attack. Despite it's shortcomings, it's oddly fun to redo fights over and over again because the save system is so flexible. You will however be unable to Save during boss fights... I can't recommend the first one because it is simply not worth playing if you're not looking to play the entire series. It's very short in length, and is very Vague at times as to what to do during your progression of the game. (Ys2) This is where it starts to actually get good beyond the soundtrack or updated graphics of this Remake. This time around you actually have a competent way with dealing with bosses and enemies using the magic system. Enemies also seem to have fair to competent ai, so you will be challenged in your ability to either use the bump system or magic to defeat them. The second game fixes most of the issues from the first, so if you plan to buy this game, make sure you're playing the first to lead into the second right away.			"

												The game is a fun 2-D world exploring adventure. It is a great old style gaming experience that relies on skill of the bump system which brings out the game to it's full potential as a hardcore actiion rpg. The game is meant for it's hard bosses on the harder difficulty's that exist. But the downside is the first game throw's you in to some crazy story of a vanished land barely spoken of and at the start of the next game people suddeny know of this land. The problem is the exposition of the story is better in the second half. Also the there is no map so some could get lost easily if no one pays attetion. But the game overal is small  and you can get by. Also the positives of the game keep you interested enough to keep going. But I also feel the game lacks bosses in the first game. But is fixed in the secon game. Overall i feel the second game is better then the first in all ways but takes a few hours to get digested in it and the world.			"

												Another port of Ys I & II that doesn't really bring anything new from the PSP ports. But if you haven't played Ys before, or haven't replayed them in a long time, Chronicles+ is definitely worth it, especially when on sale.It retains the bump combat system, which is easy to learn.If you're new to the series, I would almost recommend playing Ys II first if you don't mind a little interruption in the story, or even buy Ys Origin, a modern prequel to the series that is very very fun to play. Ys I can be a little frustrating on first playthrough, or even second. The story is great, but might not be enough to keep you playing if you dislike bump combat or wandering around for ages trying to work out why you can't open the door. Ys II, in my opinion, is better in every way.So:New to Ys? Consider buyPlayed and liked Origin? Definitely buy.Played Ys before? Buy.Played the PSP port recently? Skip/buy on sale. "

												Ys IAn ARPG classic. The bump system may put some people off by it's simplicity, but it generally feels good and looks cool. Keep in mind that this is based on a game released in 1989, so some of the system's features are strictly bare-bones, but the remake has been upgraded in some aspects to make the game a much smoother experience than the '89 original. Boss encounters are a bit hit and miss, and usually rely on you being a certain level or having certain equipment to beat, but are enjoyable all in all. Not especially tough, but they can still be challenging enough for you to have to retry a few times before you understand the patterns. I played it on normal, but if you find the game too easy there is always the option to try a higher difficulty setting.The music is great, also, as is usually the case with Falcom games. Also, there's an option available to switch to/from classic and remade tunes, which is always nice.The minimalistic story is interesting and Adol Christin is a cool protagonist, but don't expect a convoluted epic; this is a standard tale of a dualistic nature, with good and evil, dark and light. Progression through the game is generally uncomplicated, and the areas you are supposed to visit are few and easy to find, but the game can, however, be a bit cryptic when it comes to what you're supposed to do next, so if you're a newcomer you should expect to get stuck a few times before you are able to proceed. That said, the game is pretty short, short enough to be suited for speedrunning and such, for sure. I mostly play it for nostalgic reasons nowadays, but, nostalgia aside, it is still a pretty good game and still holds up fairly well even today. Thoroughly recommended.Ys I score7.5 / 10Ys IIYs II continues the adventure of Adol Christin and concludes the story of Ys I & II Chronicles. The bump system is back, and not much has changed. Included, however, is the ability to use magic, which have a variety of uses ranging from an attack spell to spells useful to progress the game. Basically, if you liked the first game's system, there should be no reason for you to disike the one in Ys II, as they are pretty similar. Boss encounters are a bit more challenging than the ones in Ys I, but sometimes it comes down to just finding out cerrtain gimmicks in order to beat them.The music is at least as good as in Ys I and has some of my favorite Ys tunes of all time. Definitely one of the highlights of the game, and the abiity to switch between classic and remade tunes is a plus. Top notch.The story in general has a bit more depth than Ys I, and is less melancholic, but all in all it's still pretty simple. There are some surprises down the road to make it interesting though, so it is fairly well conceived, although I don't feel like the villains are as intimidating as the ones in Ys I. I liked the first one better, but it's all a matter of taste. Progression through the game is fairly linear, but there were a number of times where I got stuck and didn't know how to proceed. It usually boils down to not having the required items or paying close attention to your environments, though, so if you can't proceed there is probably something you've missed an area accessible to you at your current point in the adventure. The game is probably twice as long as Ys I, but can be completed fairly quickly if you know what to do and where to go.Recommended.Ys II score8 / 10Score for both8 / 10			"

												The Ys series is possibly one of the best rpg's out there and has brought it's creators such joy that they've ported the game 6 times, 4 of which have been improved on with better graphics, music and include the options to switch to older graphics/music from each port.Oh and did I mention the original was published in 1989? The only way the original FF even matches up is because of releases for Android/Windows/iOS phones and the ""Wonderswan"" But they never updated the graphics!			"

												I enjoyed this jrpg, though it lacked the depth of many of the more recent gmes I've played. I likes the ""bump"" combat, though it was by no means perfect. To keep from taking damage, you need to hit from the side or back, but the enemies spin so quiickly, it's nearly impossible. I just decided to deal with the damage and heal up after battles. The battle system did make for a much faster playing game. It's amazing how much time is spent in the battle system of most jrpgs.In addition to the simple combat, the story was very simple and the world quite small. I would call this a casual jrpg. That said, some of boss fights are devilishly difficult.I recommend this if you want something that's quick and easy to jump in to.			"

												Well this is the second game I've played in the Ys series till now (origin being the first) and I must say I enjoyed it quite alot. The origin of the awesome music that Ys is renowned for, and the intriguing story though simple and perhaps something you've seen alot in for instance certain anime, it is still one of the early RPGs and therefore also quite original for its time.Though some boss battles are easy and some quite difficult, the fighting mechanism is but running towards enemies in certain directions (no use of mouse or any attack key whatsoever). It's all about your dodging skills, reflexes and reaction. Also having the proper equipment for certain ""dungeon adventures"" and also boss battles is important to take notice of. But in the end with such an awesome music accompanying the game, it makes the gaming experience all the better. Though I finished the game on normal difficulty, for those ""masochists"" that dare take the challenge till the last boss fight on nightmare mode are welcomed to try this little sucker out. But be wary, though this game may seem short, it packs the deal for a good game even for an 80s game.Also recommend not to play origin first if you want more of a ""mystery"" element to the story itself, and it also makes certain tasks in the game take alot more time, considering many elements, bosses, normal enemies and equipment are taken from this game in origin, but this is only if you've never played any Ys game ever.Best order to play it is Ys 1 and 2, and then do origin, and continue with the others.Either way highly recommend to those who enjoy JRPGs some difficult challanges, and like somewhat typtical animesque storylines.

												I think I agree with the several hundred people in these reviews when I say that this is one of the finest games I've ever played. Let me just give you a quick overview:+you fight your enemies by bumping into them at specific angles. Your weapons will auto-attack them, and if you attack at the right angles, they won't be able to counterattack. Takes time to master, but it's very rewarding. I think this is actually a viable replacement for traditional turn based combat, odd as that may seem. You just surge through the game's dungeons at a brisk pace. Difficulty can be adjusted, allowing you to breeze through if it's too hard, but giving you an alternative if it's too easy.+I'm very surprised how much I liked the story. It wasn't in-your-face like most story-heavy RPGs, and it knew when it to ease you into something big. I give it a nice plus because of it. +soundtrack is beautiful, and you get a nice choice between the chronicles version, complete version, and nostalgic version. I recommend all three+graphically the game is beautiful. It has a top notch sprite team, and it was very revolutionary back when it first came out. Even today it still holds up.-the only downside I would consider is that the game doesn't hold your hand, which is normally a good thing, but this game gets downright cryptic. You need to remember every single thing about your world, and remember all of your items and their various uses. You will be tested on how good your puzzle and memory skills are. Myst and Riven have nothing on this.The bottom line? Get. This. Game. It put a tear in my eye, a smile on my mouth, and a very small dent in my wallet. I truly fell in love with Ys because of this. So get a move on and give this game your time. Once you master the combat, I guarantee you won't regret it. I didn't, and this is coming from a guy who had no hope for RPGs/action games on steam.

												Combat sucks. There's virtually no skill involved as all you do is literally bump into an enemy. If you bump them head on, you'll both be damaged. If you can manage to bump them off-center or from the back or side, you'll be fine and they'll be damaged. The problem is the enemies change directions almost constantly so it's nearly impossible to attack skillfully.Another huge issue is that for a lot of people the ""Use Item"" key simply doesn't work. The only way to use an item is the ""Use Item"" key and there are several points, apparently, wher you must use an item manually in order to progress the story. I've seen various people saying that disabling Steam Cloud worked. Some people say simply canging the keybinding worked. The only thing that worked for me was changing the binding to the number ""1"".Also, the game difficulty is very inconsistent. The very first boss fight, when I reached it, was impossible to defeat. It would have taken several dozens hits, but there are flamethrowers in the room making it exceptionally difficult to move around much. From that point however, leveling my character 1 level higher and upgrading my weapon one level brought the number hits required on the boss down to 3. So ten minutes of playtime brought that fight from impossible to win down to impossible to lose. That boss wasn't the only enemy like this, either. All the new enemies you find have similar difficulty curves.			"

												There is something special about the gameplay and story-telling of a lot of the games released in the late 80s and early 90s.  I cannot put my finger on exactly what it is, but VERY few games, if any, nail that exact formula today (The most recent I can think of that I played being the first Golden Sun). Despite the limited graphics and simple gameplay, there is just something that makes the stories and characters seem to come to life and the world just call out for every house, forest, cave and secret to be explored. I would be tempted to chock it all up to nostalgia, except that I had never played a single Ys game until recently here on steam. Thus far, I have finished Ys I and cannot wait to move on to II. This game, originally released in the late 80s and updated with beautiful 32-bit style gameplay graphics and hand drawn anime style cut-scenes and character profiles, nails that formula. It's been given a nice new paint job and some optional updated musical scores, but even with all these things the old heart and soul of this classic game still shines through, perhaps all the brighter, and even to a new comer like myself. I am reminded of the first time I played The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (so perhaps there is some form of nostalgia at play here after all).I was VERY skeptical of the strange ""bump combat"" system at first.  I still wouldn't say it's ideal. I'm glad it did not become a standard in games, but after spending some time with it, and leveling up a little, it actually is nowhere near as bad as it seems at first and becomes quite enjoyable.The graphics, artwork (of which you can select 2 versions), and music (of which you can select a few versions) are absolutely beautiful.  The characters and dialogue are interesting, fun, and memorable.  The story is engaging. The puzzles are fun.  The combat can range between frustrating and fun, but isn't bad once you get used to it.Overall I would recommend this game to just about anyone, but especially to those looking for that missing charm that games once had.

												Probably one of the best little known games from ye olden days i could think of. Unlike a lot of rpgs *cough*Final Fantasy*cough* at the time this one used a creative bump combat system mixed with magic. The bosses are creative and the story is enthralling but not important either. If you like old school rpgs and hours of grinding, this game will have little downsides. Plus there's a secret where you grope a goddess, that should imediately give it 4 stars, the rest gives it a fifth.			"

												Been a while since I played it, but I doubt anything has been changed.Started out playing Ys Origin when it came out on steam. I loved it's combat and music. Amazing game. Instantly bought Oath in Felghana (also a great Ys game) and Chronicles+ the moment they hit steam.Althought the combat is different with its bumper cars, it's still great. It's not a combat system that you would find in modern games today, which is kinda sad, since it works extremely well in a 2D, top-down view game. It's a fairly simple system. If you hit an enemy, you damage the enemy. If you hit it face-on, you'll take damage, but hit it in the side or from an angle and you can easily melt every normal enemy in the game without ever taking damage. It's fast, fun and fluid. The controls are responsive and the hit detection is very good.The music, as for every Ys game, is absolutely kick-♥♥♥Ys I is fairly short, but it's a great build-up for Ys II which is even better than Ys I.I'd recommend this to everyone who's looking for a fastpaced action game, with a few RPG elements in it.Do keep in mind that the game isn't, of course, for everyone. If you can't tolerate the bumper cars, this simply isn't the game for you. But in my opinion you'd be missing out as I find it very fun and the satisfaction of beating a boss, to a kick-♥♥♥ soundtrack, is amazing.			"

												Short review: You're in for a damn good time. Get it.Long review: Ys I & II Chronicles+ is a remake of the two 1980's RPGs Ancient Ys Vanished: Omen and Ancient Ys Vanished: The Final Chapter. As such, they still retain the same basic gameplay and design as their original 80's counterparts, so the gameplay takes some getting used to. You don't have an attack button, you run into enemies off-center to kill them. You don't have a plethora of healing items, you have a single potion, and otherwise just stand still.Ys I is a fun and short adventure, clocking out on an average of 5 hours, even if you're completely lost. It's a fun adventure with a simplistic story but a great, connected world with a lot of lore. However, nearly all of the boss fights are terrible, and are only difficult through arbitrary means. It's still definitely a game worth playing, though, as it leads directly into Ys II.Ys II is a damn incredible game, and improves on the original in every way. A more expansive world, a deeper storyline, incredibly fun boss fights, absolutely beautiful music. There's not much else I can say except for the fact that Ys II is worth all the trouble you'll have in Ys I. And hey, don't like Ys I? The good news is that you can completely skip it and just go straight to the second one if you so choose (though you might be a little lost on the story at first).Long and short of it, Ys I & II Chronicles+ is a collection of two very old but classic action RPGs. You're really in for something great here.			"

												Ys I and II feels weirdly dated; as in, when you play a classic game, it feels like ""yeah the game is gold, but it's also old."" But when I'm playing Ys I and II, I know from my mind it is an old game--it's based on Eternal versions released in 2000--but I feel like I'm playing a relatively modern indie game.The thing that differentiates a good old school indie games from the bad ones is how modernized the game design actually is. It's not like Ys I and II doesn't have UI problems, and the dungeon design in Ys I sometimes gets downright frustrating, but the overall game design is blazing fast and mostly user-friendly. Sometimes, I feel like I'm playing a really good, modern indie ARPG with 16-bit aesthetics and pseudo-old school nostalgia, instead of a game that is actually old. And that's not a bad thing at all, because that's what makes old games like these timeless classics.			"

												Fair warning: I'm gonna use an extended comparison to a more modern and well known game for the bulk of this review.These are to date the only Ys games I've played and I enjoyed them. The combat system is unique even 30(!) years after their original release, with the main battle mechanic being ramming your enemies in the flanks. This gives the games a feeling of quick movement that for today's gamer can trigger an interesting response: I found myself using the same skillset, especially in regards to fight or flight, that I'd developed playing Darksouls.The feeling of the games being a top-down, technicolored, 80's Darksouls never went away either, with common enemies that will tear you apart if you waste all your time on them and difficult boss battles. Ironically, playing this way made the bosses much harder for me (at least in Ys I) because I wound up fighting them horribly under levelled. This isn't to say either Ys is as hard as Darksouls, though if you took the bosses from Ys I and the mooks from Ys II (who were shockingly more powerful than Ys I, the bosses however...) you'd probably wind up with a game that, despite being in a very different (sub-)genre would both feel weirdly familiar and give any veteran Darksouls player a run for their money.Finally, loved the music. Also worth noting the games are very short, first one is less than 10 hours, second is a lot longer and has a magic system that lets you do some cool stuff including hit enemies with something other than a sword.

												Thanks to YouTuber, Happy Console Gamer, I finally bought this under his recomendation and I dont regret it for the most part!The start of the game is a little rough around the edges as you learn a combat system unlike any you've played before with only 20HP to your name and a little popup window explaining the mechanics. That's it! No hand holding of any kind, no quest log and no map. Just NPC dialouge, your wits, and a pinch of luck. I seriously could not have beaten the first game without a few hints from GameFAQs. Without it, my playtime would be doubled. Seriously there are lots of quests and VERY important items that can be missed and ignored entirely. This i find to be a huge flaw and I almost gave up entirely when i forgot to grab the Evil Ring back on the 2nd floor while trying to enter the next area on the 16th floor.Other than that, The graphics are charming, bringing me back to my childhood days. Coupled with a super awesome soundtrack mixing together heavy metal and synthesizers, helped to keep me motivated throughout the journey. The dungeon designs are very well laid out maze like puzzels that made my head spin. The boss fights at times can be unfair, but with patience and a bit luck, you'll get through them. Thankfully you can save anywhere and load back VERY quickly if you die.Also I do need to include a small rant about the final boss though... Dear god in heaven, worst Final boss i've ever faced in my life. Learning his pattern is the first 10%, the other 90% is luck.All in all, I had a great time with the first game and already feel like i got my $15 out of it and theres still a whole other game to play! Probably one of the hardest games i've played, only because of the lack of hand holding and how easy it was to miss certain items/ details. If you're looking for an RPG thats different and have the will to press on when the going gets tough, you'll have a great time! This was like a mix of old school Legend of Zelda action combat, dungeoneering, and item collection with a decently epic storyline like Final Fantasy. "
