												This was the first game I ever actually played. Growing up I would always sit down and watch my dad play. For hours I would sit, fascinated, watching the spells, the different zones and npcs, the loots, everything. When I was about 10 years old he built me my own computer so I could start playing with him... we still have that computer, it had a 10gb hard drive.I remember having to cover my eyes when he would type in the password for me because he didn't trust me playing on my own as young as I was. I remember after learning the basics and being able to actually play and be of some importance, becoming his ♥♥♥♥♥ necro so we could fear kite mobs he normally wouldn't be able to solo as a ranger. Growing up this game was among the only thing my dad and I did to spend time together... our relationship was molded mostly because of this game. If I could go back I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. I wish this game was still alive like it was then, but time moves forward. Now I pay my monthly prescription to log in perhaps 2 or 3 times a month, kill some things I used to kill, then solemley close the game, until next time.			"

												The best gaming period of my life. I bought EQ when it first released, and played up until planes of power.EQ set the bar high for other MMO's, while I appreciate what newer MMOs have done to attract more casual players and increase your time actually spent ""playing"" the game. They all detract from what EQ had to offer, a real virtual world. Want to travel to a new city? then take a long boat ride or spend an hour walking. No mounts, paying for teleports, everything was hard to kill, obtain and get to, and everything took forever, which made everything 1000x more rewarding. Dynamic weather, true cantseecrap dark nights. EQ had it all, the most immersive game ive ever played regardless of its graphics.We'll see if EQ Next can recapture what made EQ great, but I doubt it.. if it even gets finished in the next decade.

												Free-to-play with upgrade options ( Silver and Gold accounts ), Everquest still has population on many of its servers. Content up to VoA ( Veil of Alaris ) can be accessed for free, and characters can obtain up to level 95 ( without gold or purchase of the latest expansion ). It's never been easier to pick up, and catch up.Whether returning for nostalgia, or coming into the game for the first time, Everquest still has something to offer. There are plenty of guilds available, group and raid content, and solo opportunities for any class you're willing to invest in.			"

												I adored this game. I started playing with The Ruins of Kunark release. Oh my, the magical world of EQ. Never before and never since has there been such an amazing game.  I played all the way until Sullon Zek PVP server merged into Zek and guild Pandemonium had the server on lockdown. But, long before, this game was pure magic.I went on to beta test WOW, and EQ2 and played those games quite a bit... but EQ was still pure gold. Trouble was the game engine and graphics had fallen so far behind. Eq2 was fun, great in fact, but a different game. And so for all these years having playing every MMO from Vanguard to Age of Conan to Aion to Tera to FF XiV and even Archeage...EQ the original, will always have my heart and soul.  I wasn't terribly sad to hear EQNext was shuttered by Daybreak... because the idiotic SOE Devs had done it again... simply created a whole new game.  None of the original EQ fans ever wanted a different game. We wanted oue beloved EQ, simple as it was... only with a new game engine and better graphics.  Heck, all the expansions are there... all we ever wanted was a company with the vision to simply update and reboot the ORIGINAL in a more optimized way.Perhaps Daybreak will decide to do that one day. I'm sure it would cost a lot less than the cash wasted on ""recreated"" a ""new vision"" with ""ground-breaking technology"" which is... not fun, and no one from the fanbase EVER asked for or wanted.And if they don't... they do not understand what makes an MMO ""great.""  WOW only dominated EQ... because it had the same kind of magical world and endgame... with upgraded graphics.  A remake of EQ would have dominated WOW and every clone ever since... because it was simply... MAGIC.			"

												Ah, EverQuest, one of the great-grandfathers of all modern MMORPGs.  I played it when I was younger, but then ended up stopping my account when my PC decided to go out in a blaze of glory.   It took me ten years to get back into it, but to be quite honest, it's still got that same magical spark.  Even with its twenty-first expansion on the horizon, people still play this.  I have a couple characters, but at the same time, it can be really just kind of depressing choosing to roll up a new character, and finding that you're the only person in the starting zone.   To be honest, there's not really a lot of players on the lower-end of things any more- most of your players are essentially those who have still got their high-level characters and are chruning through higher-level content as it comes out.  There are still a handful of players in the lower levels, but to be quite honest, if you like soloing, this is the class for you.  The mercenary system is a godsend for those mobs you can't handle on your own, but you'll still run into quests that you just can't handle on your own. For example, the newbie weapon for Wood Elf Druids requires you to break the throne room of the castle in Camp Crushbone, and even with a merc, it's not really something that you'll be able to accomplish on your own until you get to a level where you can easily find things that outclass the reward.  The graphics are really dated- there are games with much better graphics out there right now, but at the same time, they're not as hard to run on non-top of the line computers any more.   If you're not running a graphically-intensive computer with a three-hundred dollar card in it, no worries- this runs fine on my laptop. Gameplay is still solid, even after all these years, but at the same time, it's not really changed that much.  The addition of the tutorial is always a plus, but to tell you the truth, it makes for a better way into the game instead of just being dropped into a newbie zone with nothing to do.  You can easily grind up to 13 or 14 here, if you accomplish all the missions, and you can find some decent equipment, too. To be honest, though, it's free to play, and you can't go wrong with a game that won't tax an older machine.  If you enjoy a trip back to the days of groups looking to hit up the Halls of Honor or the Plane of Disease, download this game- just be ready to do a bunch of soloing.  If you used to play, all you really need is your sense of nostalgia and for your memories to come flooding back once you hit up your old favorite zones and hear that old, familiar music.			"

												EverQuest is a very old game. Well, sort of. It predates most of the MMO market by a few years, especially a certain other exceptionally popular game anyone remotely familiar with the genre will instantly know. In its heyday, it was one of the most popular MMOs, with about 100,000 subscribers, give or take. The epic scale of the raids still hasn't been replicated to this day.But has it aged well? Sure.EverQuest has always been about change. Sure, you can't have a dynamic influence on the world in most cases, but the game has always been changing. Where once you couldn't do anything without a group unless you were a specific class, now nearly everyone is capable of soloing for experience.Don't get me wrong, the game is still old and looks old, but there's a wonderful charm to it that other games really haven't come close to replicating.Oh, and it's HUGE. In the old days, it used to be said that it took six hours to run from one end of the map to the other on foot. Well, the game has gotten bigger since then, to the point that they've added a number of hub zones to make travel easier. The down side to this truly epic size is that very few zones are consistently occupied by players.There's also a bit of a disjointed aesthetic to the game. While many older zones and models have been updated over time, just as many have not. While Freeport and the surrounding Commonlands have received overhauls to the point it's almost a joke in the community, Qeynos and the Karanas are mostly unchanged from the time of launch, barring a few new quests that make you visit there.Now, let's talk about the sound. It's dated, sure, but that little factor hasn't stopped people from loving music before. And EverQuest has some real goldies. Kelethin, the sea approach to Freeport, Rivervale...great music that will stick in your mind forever. It's unfortunate that some of this music, such as the Rivervale theme, are in places you'd never normally visit, but sometimes it's worth it just to hear it.It's not all rose colored glasses, though: The UI is cluttered beyond belief, to the point you'll be glad you can alter it to your liking. The previously mentioned disjointed graphics can also be rather jarring when you compare newer cash shop aesthetic outfits with older, standard armor. Everything works, but unlike most MMOs these days that are like receiving a new toy with karate chop action, EverQuest is like receiving one of those totally awesome playsets...with the words ""Some Assembly Required"" etched on the front.But if you ask me, it's worth it.

												EQ is hands down one of the hardest MMOs when you're brand new. Most EQ vets I know either laugh at you or wince with pain when you tell them you want to start a new character on a new account. Grinding from 1 to 90+ solo is an extremely daunting task even as the best solo class in the game, necro. Sony tried to make the grind a little more solo friendly with the addition of mercs and more forgiving solo zones, but as free to play, you can only use tier 1 or 2 mercs, which are not that great. You are also limited to 250 AAs max as free to play which is extremely limiting when you do get to that point in the game.The world is big. The quests are epic (especially the ones to get your epic weapons). Possibly the most important, the people are civil and helpful. Get into a guild ASAP.			"

												I First played EQ back in 2001 i loved the game but didnt realize how good it was till i left it in 2003 , Since then ive played nearly all the popular MMOs , WOW, Neverwinter , AoC , Lotro , Swtor etc etc , .Having played most of these games i suddenly hit a wall , and decided all the mmos were the same they all hold your hand there is no challenge , except 1 , EQ. Everquest still is even with outdated graphics one of the best mmos, if you feel its to hard they dont care , if you feel its unfair you lose exp when you die they dont care.By far the benchmark for other MMOs and in my view still the best MMO out there , Want hardcore you got it with heaps of respect and a community that cares.10/10			"

												I played everquest from day 1 for about 8 years before quitting. I've come back to the game hoping for some good nostalgia only to find that the garbage company that owns the game now has completely destroyed what made this game great. The struggle and work towards gaining a level made it feel like you accomplished something . Now you can get to level 60 in an hour or 2 or buy a premade max level character. You level so fast your skills cant keep up and I think they lowered the rate at which you gain skill ups to almost force people to pay money.  This was one of the best games of my teenage years and now its been completely ruined. It makes me sick.			"

												This is the game that's responsible for making me a ""gamer"". It's the first world that I had become fully immersed in, and I think that all the games I've bought and played over the years since have been in a way seeking to get the same sort of feeling that Everquest had provided for me. I still have the fondest memories of my days as a young Dwarf, finding adventure and misadventure in and around the Butcherblock Mountains; being chased by Corflunk and Zarchoomi; being blasted to bits by a brownie in the Lesser Faydark, and enlisting other low-level guildmates to run interference while I make a naked corpse run to get my stuff back; camping Crushbone forever, so that I can get as many belts as I can to turn in to Canloe Nusback for the faction boost. I remember drowning while trying to find a certain island with mermaids on it in the Ocean of Tears. I remember being beaten to death by farmers in East Karana while trying to seek refuge from a lion that was chasing me.These days, I'm not much for the MMO experience -- I'm not wild about forced socializing -- so I like to look for games that provide the sort of open, persistent world full of possibilities to explore and adventure, which EQ provides so well. Graphically, I can't say the game has aged too well, although it doesn't look too bad for a 15-year-old game. The best thing is, though, it's still alive! It's still worth playing. The world of Norrath is so incredibly huge, and now that there are elements put into place that makes the game easily soloable, it's worth it to get out there and explore. And, hey, bring a friend along for even more fun.			"

												This is probably my favorite game of all time. That being said, I am extreamly reluctant to recommend it if you haven't played it before. It is 15 years old, which means that the graphics are horrible, the gameplay is kinda clunky, and it has many bugs (though they are mosly animation bugs, nothing game-breaking). This game is also very complicated. It has a lot of features that you would never know about unless you have been playing for a long time. The best comparison I can make for this game is to Daggerfall. Old, clunky, not very nice to look at, but if you can look past all of that, you will find a great game with a rich world. If you dig deep, there is some very interesting lore. Every old ruin, or named mob has some back story (you just might have to ask google what that story is LOL). In short, it is an amazing game, but you probably wont like it if you have not played it before. Also, don't get the steam version, it likes to mess with your options to make the game unplayable on newer machines. Just go to the EverQuest website and get it from there.			"

												May 2016 is actually my first experience with Everquest, so this review should give you an insight about the game unrelated to the Nostalgia most of the players play for. My personal MMORPG background is just Vanilla World of Warcraft (2004-2006).Pros:- A huge amount of content, more than a thousand zones and a big choice of where to lvl in.- Very friendly and mature community.- Runs well on pretty much any computer, my girlfriend runs it on a Microsoft Surface 3 with no problems and that is actually a Windows tablet with an atom processor and no dedicated GPU.- The Free2Play model pretty much doesnt restrict you till lvl 50 which should give you an idea about the game and wether you want to sub to it.Cons:- The UI is a total cluster♥♥♥♥ and it requires more than just patience to figure out. It is in fact so off putting that I would say that this is the biggest flaw of Everquest.- Everquest is absolutly not casual... When you plan to play say an hour in the eve, half of it will be spent just figuring out which spells/skills you need to take with you to an adventure (there are literaly hundreds even in low lvls).- Quests are incredibly hard to do without the help of the internet, it takes ages to figure out where is what npc and what exactly should one give to whom and from where.- Graphics and animations are pretty bad (1999 Engine) but atleast the game runs well on almost any kind of hardware.Conclusion:- For a casual experience probably not.- For a more deep experience or even just to see how MMORPGs used to be, it is definetly worth a try.- Server wise, I recommend you to start in Firiona Vie (RP), it seems to be one of the more active ones.

												This is one of the oldest MMOs still in operation. There's a very good reason why it's still running: virtually all the MMO tropes we know and love came from EverQuest. Raids, the Holy Trinity, LFG - you name it, it's probably here, and it probably came from here.Got tired of WoW's pigeonholes? Annoyed by GW2's ""zerker meta""?

												I have been playing this game since release back in 1999. I still play it off and on. Ignore the hours played on here as I mostly played the official download before I got it on Steam.  I was very hardcore into the game from '99 until '04, playing nearly every day. It's the only game that has EVER held my attention for that length of time, with no breaks. I have not experienced end game content since those years so I can't comment on current end game content. However, I can say that the game is extremely fun without even reaching end game. The amount of content, the amount of zones to explore, is just crazy.This game does have a very old school feel to it. SOE has changed a lot of things, however a lot of things are still the same. If you have never tried it, I highly suggest doing so. If you are used to todays MMOs, it may take time to get used to. But with everything that you are able to do, on top of a very great and helpful community, this game can easily pull you in and keep you entertained for hours on end every day.			"

												I came back to try Everquest again, after so long a lot was different, but a lot was still nostalgic. I will leave you with my review.Released in 1999 Everquest is a hugely influential MMO, Influencing the genre even to this day. I am not as naive as to say that Everquest Started the MMO craze. I can say however that it most definitely helped get it off the ground. The game is still going strong with around 20 expansions to date. I have got to say if you want that classic feel in an mmo come on back to Everquest. Its still here, and still strong!I may prefer Everquest 2 more, but I think its great that the game is still open for those hard core Everquest 1 fans, and new people interested in the game alike.EDIT: My previous review I just noticed looked as if I typed it drunk. so I completely replaced it with this review.

												In late 2006 I was curious about WoW and went to the local video game store to satisfy that curiosity and ended up going home with the EQ Titanium Edition( it seemed like a better deal moneywise ). I fell in love with the game back then but ultimately couldn't afford the subscription so I quit playing. I picked it up again recently and found it to be even better than before. I'm more of a solo guy and the addition of mercs is wonderful.I like oldschool games. I don't need flashy graphics and what not, just good old fashioned RP grinding and fetching and farming and so on. If you truly want to get lost in a game and adventure in a giant world full of neat places to explore and creatures to battle, then EQ is for you.			"

												Everquest was the first 3D Fantasy MMORPG and is STILL my #1 all-time favorite game.  No other MMORPG comes even close to the amount of content and features as Everquest does with over 18 huge expansions. Everquest sets the Standard for this genre of games.  (Only Elder Scrolls series even comes close)Gameplay has considerably changed over the years, EQ is no longer as strict in many aspects such as corpse recovery is no longer needed and powerful, customizable mercenaries are available to enhance game play, greatly reducing the need for groups or organizing guild raids.  You can solo your Epic Quests at level 80 now with a Mercenary on a Paid Account with a dual-boxed team, no problem!  You can even upgrade or create a character at level 85 character, fully complete with raid gear and platinum coin for a very reasonable fee, to explore the high-end content.Even with the lower server populations after 10+ years in existence, there still is way too much to do in this game, living up to its name of Everquest.  The number of vast zones, huge dungeons, hidden lore and equipment, enormous cities, it is simply overwhelming.  Character depth with 100 experience levels, hundreds, or even thousands of spells and skills, and group mechanics so perfectly complex as one must really master their character classes to achieve end-game experience levels, especially when dual boxing solo, which brings entirely new challenges to the game.

												Before I begin, Id like to give you my background in MMO's so you have context to this review. I've played several mmos over the years but the 3 which ive spent the most time in were Runescape (1 year), WoW (2-3 years), and Everquest 2 (2006-today) which is my current favorite. I had always heard stories about Everquest's difficulty and coupled with the expectations of an ugly game with clunky controls that is outdated in every manner, I was left with the impression that this game would not be for me. Logging into Everquest for the first time I instantly note that the textures look nice despite the low polygon count. Character creation was vast in terms of race/class choice but limited in hair/face models. It offers you an optional tutorial which I suggest you take because I caught on quickly thanks to its guidance. This is the only MMO that I have ever played which forces you to actually read NPC dialogue as you need to respond or click key words to choose dialogue options. Additionally there is no quest helper, but you are given enough details on the quest in your log. Many problems I have with older MMO's is that theyve become a cakewalk. Im the type of player who enjoys the journey more than endgame itself and Everquest is no cakewalk. Granted that its much easier than stories I hear from 1999 but I found myself struggling and needing the help of a mercernary even in the tutorial. The thrill of finding a new item or defeating that one enemy which stumped you several times in the past is there from below level 10 and on. Another problem I have with many older mmos such as Everquest 2 is that it can sometimes be a ghost town, but much to my surprise Everquest 1 is still filled with players. In the tutorial I remember joining several groups and having to wait my turn for a boss to spawn for a quest. The Ui is fully customizable as well where every window allows you to change opacity and shape in addition to font size.There are several aspects of the game which add additional challenge which I appreciated, one being that you're not automatically given new abilities every time you level but you need to find an NPC vendor in order to learn a new ability. In addition to this you can only use a handfull of abilities at a time causing you to change your loadout depending on which enemy you face. As a paladin I would have to choose which spells I werent planning to use and replace them with spells which were effective against the undead, because without them I would have been toast. When you die your body is left behind holding a portion of your experience, finding it will return this experience to you. Long gone are the days of loosing everything on your character which im half thankful for, but part of me would like to experience this challenge. Probably the most rewarding challenge that ive met so far has been going into a large zone and having absolutely no map, getting lost and having to use my compas in order to find my way out without dieing. In these situations you can always google zonemaps, but I prefer to use the games cartography tool which allows me to create my own map. You can do this by running along roads and borders of the map to create lines or leaving notes in various areas informing you of locations. Crafting is also challenging as well, even at low levels you're required to create several other items used in the process of crafting the item you originally needed. Everquest 2 requires you to play a minigame while crafting and farm random ingredients from nodes (for example blueberries from a blackberry bush). You never know what you will get and I'm glad to say that I prefer crafting in EQ1. Materials fall from enemies, and theres no minigame with crafting. Currently I am level 27 and I was left with such a strong impression that I felt the need to share my experience. EQ1 is a game filled with personality, which I find charming and sometimes comical. Little touches such as comical loading bars which are basically inside jokes to the likes of; ""warning, half elves are now 49.9% elf"", ""Polishing Erudite forheads"" ect. When choosing an enemy, theres no way to know their strength by looking at them, pressing C to consider will give you a readout of their relative strength which ranges from ""this can be risky"" to ""what would you like your tombstone to say?"" I probably enjoyed these little touches more than I should, but sadly as a long time player of EQ2, these touches were missing. My experience with other players has been mostly positive. I've made a few friends and joined a guild right out of tutorial which is filled with friendly players who are more than willing to help me out with my noob questions. Players in zones will ask you to trade buffs with them which I found helpful. My only negative interaction with another player was when I had my zone camped by a higher level player when I was trying to complete a quest but this has only happened one time. While EQ1 is still challenging to a new player, I have found a few areas of handholding which you may or may not appreciate such as getting a letter in your inbox every time you level up which tells you where you should go. I will probably appreciate this at a higher level though. I also with death consequence was a bit more harsh because I find myself not caring enough to walk the distance to gain the exp i dropped. I am only level 27 though so I cant speak for this in later parts of the game.In conclusion, Everquest is a game which I choose not to see as outdated by nearly 20 years, but a game which has been refined for much longer than anything else on the market. Its a welcoming experience for new and old players alike. I am currently a free player and outside of the occasional popup advertisement, I do not feel limited in terms of bagspace or character options, however I do hear higher quality spells and armor are restricted to paying members later on in the game. Enjoy!			"

												This is the best mmo /rpg there is. I have over 400 days played..   In 15 yeaars I played for almost a solid year of actual game time.  This game was that good .  Played it on dial up.. Bought another phone line and computer becuase my wife and I would have to share one computer.  Lots of fun .... none of this easy mode crap nowadays.  Sometimes you would spend weeks camping a mob for aa chance at a drop.  This game require teamwork and select  group classes .. none of this bull crap a mage heals beter than a Cleric adn a cleric dps better than a rogue or mage .  Tooo many stories and horrors lol.

												 Pretty decent free to play oldschool MMORPG. They give you tons of free expansions. I think you can go to level 90ish for free now. Nowadays you're able to solo if you don't want to team by using NPC ""hirelings"" of various classes called ""mercenaries"". They are definitely worth their value. Good amount of races and classes to choose from. Cool spells. Cool iconic monsters. They even have ""dailies"" that are worth a nice amount of XP and give decent loot. Everquest has a very oldschool feeling and sometimes I still log in to remember the old music and sounds and areas of the world that still hold my interest today. You will never run out of things to do in this game. For a game made in 1999, it's actually still what I compare other MMORPGs to. If it had a clear built in voice chat it would have every feature I've ever wanted in an MMORPG. I can't think of any flaws really, it's just ""old"" but that doesn't mean that it's automatically bad just because a lot of time has passed. The developers really cared about tailoring the game to make people happy because of all of the things I've seen added over the years. I give this game a thumbs up because it still makes me happy when I think about the old times. If you understand that it was made in 1999 and you still want to play, it's definitely one of the best MMORPGs out there from it's time. It's amazing that they still keep the servers going for us.

Playing this again makes me realize how modern games baby the user; this game is not for the faint of heart.

												Played since 1999. A pretty good game, but REALLY clunky in comparison to modern MMO. On the other hand, there's more content than you can probably ever play and, sadly, more than you'd probably want to. Certain parts of the game world haven't been updated since 1999, and the rusty swords and rawhide-leather armour you'd pick up there at lvl 8 could never compare to the magic, stat boosting, enchanted gear that you get just by ambling through the tutorial. This just means that you'll miss-out on most of the game zones, simply because you'll never have a reason to visit them. You'll also find (or, more likely, completely fail to notice) entire expansion-worths of mechanics that you'll never use, like the 'Lost Dungeons of Noreath'.-HOWEVER-If you can find a guild of likeminded individuals, you'll probably have a blast. It's a huge world with tons to see... even if you can never be arsed to visit the Kunark or Velious landmasses. I'm not sure if they have any 'vintage' servers. If they get some, I'll be back in a flash.			"

												Love this game. The community is still very strong in this game and the Devs just recently put out a new xpac. I played it while in elementary school when it first release as an erudite necromancer. I still play it to this date periodically. The free version of this game comes with 18 expansions and hours. days. months. years of things to do, to the point you could probably play this a year or two straight and not find the illusive rare spawns or items. The part that made this game great, much like earlier games such as UO, was the STEEP learning curve and extremely harsh penalties for messing up. They have made these a lot easier since you can recruit a merc and powerlevel yourself up to around 60ish without much sweat, but after that it is the old everquest grind(since this is where grinding was born imo ).I play the sony official download, since you can launch multiple sessions and multibox to make some of the mundane dailies easier.If you played this 10 years ago and want to hop back in, its still a thriving community and lots of daily players at all times of day. Even just logging in to run a lower guk session for an old yak blade is worth downloading this.			"

												It's just not the same as it used to be....at least not if you're playing the free version. Now, everyone starts in the same town, which to me limits the point of playing different races/classes. I suppose I could start out the game by hiking back home to Kelethin, but it makes me sad that the only way to start there is by paying. Meanwhile, I might be willing to pay if not for the fact that, since the default newbie zone is now Crescent Reach, there were literally zero people in the Greater Faydark area when I was playing. So...do I recommend the game? Only if you're playing for nostalgia sake or you've got some friends waiting to join you online...			"

												By far the most amazing mmorpg iv ever played. This is the game that started me in MMO's 16 years ago, and iv been on and off it ever since.I would like to warn ""newschool"" mmo players that this is nothing like WoW and if u like WoW u will prob not like EQ, bc its not an easy game, and u have to work hard for your levels n gear. If u start playing now there is a progression server that just opened up a couple months ago that the masses just joined, so there is plenty of people to game with at all levels, its def worth it. This game will always be the one that got me into gaming, the memories i had and the people i met in the game made it worth the massive amount of hours i put into it. So try EQ if u like a challenge and a oldschool feel. Id also recommend using the oldschool graphics, they are better imo.			"

												EverQuest is basically the only game you'll ever need.Incredible world filled with so much content. Group interactions basically a necessity. Great player base (many aged 30+ who grew up playing the game and came back for more)For new players: The low levels can be a bit rough, but as you level up you'll start to realize how much this game has to offer. I recommend the progression servers to get the same feeling we all did back in the days (ahh.. sweet Velious days)The only problem with this game is if that you're single, you'll probably stay that way. If you're already happily married and playing this game: consider yourself one of the lucky ones! If your significant other plays also: you should go buy a lottery ticket.The nostalgia us ol' EQ Veterans get with this game is like a recovered drug addict that is about to relapse.Note: The soundtrack is pretty awful, but the nostalgia of it somehow brings tears to your eyes like the best love song you've ever heard.

												Everquest has come a long way. And the place it went to SUCKS. For 15 years SOE listened only to its whiniest customers & what we're left with is Fable the MMO.Sorry but a good MMO has to suck a little bit. Built-in maps, quest markers & teleportation kiosks make the game more convenient, but they also turn norrath into an online amusement park.Also, you're constantly reminded that if you want to skip 90% of the game, just click here & send SOE $50 & blammo! level 80! So even if you do get to the end-game its no real accomplishment.Howabout instead of charging me to skip most of the game, you just make a game thats fun to play so i wont WANT to skip most of it?!?1999 was the best year for this project.

												 Since Daybreak has acquired this game/company there is no staff in game anymore and barely any customer support(all staff moved to H1Z1 or EQNEXT).  Their security on accounts is a joke and long time CEO has step down due to lizardsquad openly hacking them. Game was a great back in the day thing, but now that the last and final expansion (21 overall) is out for a year now with barely any new content unless you want to overpay for it.  Expect no more then a cash grab and lackluster experience with really no new players joining/playing and just the diehards left holding on or finishing whats left of content they havent experienced, and they rather watch people struggle then help.  By the time you would be at that level 105 / 10k AA the game will be closed up.  Oh just to mention as well enjoy adds popping up in the middle of combat if your going free to play every 10minutes.I played in a top 5 guild until i retired before this expansion, so please take my word for it, game is great if your in a top 5 guild other then that i wouldnt recommend it as you will never experience the top end content as far as raids go without struggling mightly. I would recommend Project99 at this point as that version is free to play(no adds/paywalls on gear) and has a better community overall, not to mention have signed an agreement with SoE/Daybreak so they wont be shut down.  They are also releasing Velious so much fun.			"

What is Everquest?Everquest is kind of like being thrusted straight back into the 90s, when your computer could barely run solitare and your mother was pretty hot. I had never played Everquest back in it's hay day, I instead played World of Warcraft back in the Cataclysm days, but it was obvious that when I first started up EQ, that it was the OG of MMORPGS. Enough chit chat, what's it like in-game?It's very complicated in my opinion. But obviously people opt for a different experience over the 'hand-holding' that most MMOs give you nowadays. You kind of feel a sense of 'freedom' when you embrace these mechanics in particular.Combat is pretty niche, similar to the likes of Morrowind. Honestly, I could only relate to Morrowind as that was the only game that I played that had similar combat mechanics. Interacting with NPCs was quite profound too. You would have to either press the 'h' key on your keyboard or say 'hail' (hitler) to the NPC you wanted to talk to. From there you have to continue the conversation through the chat box with the highlighted words.Is it fair on the average 'newbie'?HAHAHAHA no. Simply put, this game is pretty rock hard honestly. I found myself dying in pretty awkward situations and failed to see why the game hated me so much. It obviously takes a lot of time to master what's in game for sure.Conclusion?I honestly don't know what to say about this game. If you want to feel the rush of nostalgia and cheesy 90s movies and commercials throbbing through your veins, then give it a shot. If you're looking for an MMO to try however and haven't really scratched the surface with online gaming, this game might not be for you.			"

												Everquest is a free to play MMORPG. It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  It is now 18 years old.   Everything about the game is so old school.  The graphics looked ok for it's age and the UI was understandable somewhat.  It has a tutorial and starter zone. It has 16 races and 16 classes, with both male and female gender.  Races can play certain classes.  Free to play accounts can make 2 characters.  Any SOE, Daybreak Games account will work to login.  Not sure if there are other people playing this game on the server i picked. Try it, if you like Retro MMORPGs.For more info:

												For all the 12 year olds looking for a new game, just walk away and take your bad reviews with you. This game takes time and isn't as action packed as all the newer games coming out, so don't expect much from a game that has been out for as many years as this one. It is confusing when you just start playing, but it is a massive game with 16 classes to choose from, and so many zones that I doubt you will ever see them all. I was introduced to this game by my dad and played with my brother and him, so I guess I'm a little biased but it's still annoying af to see people going in thinking it's gonna be a new MMO. (Yes, it does advertise premium but you can exit out of the small pop-up with a click, and as for the premium, you literally don't need it for anything if you just want to play the game)Also, I have a LOT more hours than this outside of steam.

												As the years have worn on in Norrath, players tend to stick to themselves, do not invite for grouping and ignore others using 2 or 3 boxing and mercs to accomplish everything ruining what an MMO is about.  TO bad was the best MMO in its prime.			"

												Everquest has defined the Mmo rpg genre long ago-Highly recommended for all PC gamers, new or veterans to mmo's and for many epic reasons. The Free to Play system is fair in terms of what you might spend on other FTP games. Buying the latetest expansion of Everquest grants you all previous 19 expansions also. The game is massive in content. The players are extremely loyal and helpful too.  Factor about Everquest that is apart from many many modern mmo's is that EQ was built/designed around the round table of -in my own words ~grouping with players to advance. Sense 99 there are thousands of tales from players including myself of reminiscing the 'glory days' of eq.Bottom Line- FTP is a honest and fair deal if you decide to pay-Subscriptions and content is also very generous and affordableCountless roads to venture in the worldEQ Unique AA system for classes sinks every mmo's 'talent choices' for classes.

												I played EQ from 1999-2004 and enjoyed it immensely. I saw it had gone F2P and decided to check up on my old account. I was excited to try out the mercenaries, as I had always wanted the ability to solo in EQ.Well, long story short -- everything interesting or cool is locked behind a paywall. And so are a lot of the old standard features (and my old characters!). All the worthwhile mercenaries, the ability to buy and sell gear, the ability to USE good gear, and so on. Just very basic features, locked behind a paywall.I don't mind paying to speed up progression or make it easier, or for cosmetic features, but when a company advertises a game as F2P and gimps your character such that it literally cannot be competitive with paid characters no matter how much time and effort you put into it, this is an immediate turn-off for me.Too bad. I have a lot of fond memories of EQ.			"

												I played EQ from 1999 to 2006.. I really did enjoy the game, at that time. Learning and teaching languages. Getting my Iksar Monk amiable in Freeport, Qeynos, the High Elf and Dwarf cities and any other place  could find to grind positive faction. Good times and fond memories.I came back a few days ago, when I saw the game was free. I thought: Why not relive some fond memories.It was enjoyable for a first couple of hours. I was entertained.BUT.. The game is just dated. Really dated. The graphics do need to be seriously updated. As much as I initally liked the retro graphics, I was sick of the poor quality after a few hours. the game play was ""clunky"". I guess I'm spoiled by modern day games, with vastly better graphics and smoother game play.You'll either love or dislike EQ, especially if you're coming back. My heart wll always love EQ, but I've moved on, unless the current owners get their finger out and give the game a much needed overhaul.Currently there is no way in Hell I would pay AU$10 a month for the full access subscription to EQ. For that price, you might as well play WoW.			"

												Firstly, I've been playing Everquest for 14 going on 15 years at this point. The amount of hours that Steam has tracked don't do me any justice. That being said, Everquest has some serious problems. There was a time when I would have recommended the game and I have recommended the game. That time is past.Pros: - A good community. The community overall is full of nice and helpful people. Yes, there is some people who definitely don't fit that description but they are few and far between.- The game being modeled after tabletop D&D. The fact that somebody can have a max level character with all the best stuff in the game and still miss/have attacks dodged by lower level mobs is hilarious. Cons:- Servers. This has been a hot topic lately on both the forums and in game. The last several months especially there has been a ton of problems with servers crashing regularly and lagging. Additionally, the other major problem server related is the fact that they continue to create new servers when the game's population is relatively small. With the introduction of progression servers a lot of guilds on the regular servers have disappeared entirely which has also snowballed into people quitting the game because the rest of their friends moved on to progression servers. The developers of this game only seem to pay attention to the latest and greatest progression servers while the regular servers suffer badly. I speak from experience on this as my guild of 14 years went from about 40-50 regular raiders down to about 3 other people online every now and then besides myself. Daybreak has done an excellent job of destroying long established communities.- Customer Service. Customer service since Daybreak took over for Sony has been hit and miss at best. Where the GM's used to help you with everything no problem now you sometimes get a GM that says ""sorry, just do it again."" or ""sorry, just wait for a fix.""- Expansions. The expansions are a copy and paste disaster of already existing content. The last 8 expansions have been primarily copy and pasting of mobs while simply increasing the numbers (I.E. the mobs levels and how hard they hit). This sadly applies to the raid content as well as the vast majority of raid mobs have become humans or other playable races. The imagination factor of creating beastly looking creatures to slay is gone and dead.- Lack of communication. The developers don't have a whole lot to say in regards to these issues. The only things they talk about for the most part are their ""new"" progression servers where you have the ability to start all over again. Additionally, when you add the game to steam the most recent news is from back in 2013 where they announce the launch of Call of the Forsaken. They haven't had any news to add to steam in 4 years evidently. (I guess The Darkened Sea, The Broken Mirror and Empires of Kunark weren't news worthy.)- Lag. If you play with any sort of graphics on the game actually runs pretty badly. I got my computer sometime around 2012-2013 and play with all the newest models and spell graphics on (as you should be able to do in any game, especially one as old as EQ). I use the Steam FPS meter to monitor how well the game performs and in group content FPS ranges anywhere from 15-60 with an average of about 25 FPS. On raids FPS will range anywhere from 0 (the meter simply disappears)-15 FPS. To put things in perspective, heres a list of my PC specs:Intel Core i7 3930k @ 3.20GHz2x NVIDIA GeForce GTX 66032 GB RAM*EDIT: Since I listed these PC specs I have since had one of 660's die. I upgraded to 1x NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 and gained virtually nothing for doing so.  I notice maybe 1 more FPS over my above mentions.*- Graphics. The game still very much looks like an old Playstation 1/Playstation 2 game. The graphics were good for back when this game was created. Some of the graphics were even upgraded to look better in 2001. However, there hasn't been any modernization improvements since then. Games today like RIFT and Elder Scrolls Online are significantly more pleasant to look at. Additionally, when you first enter a zone the game has a tendency to zone you in before any of the textures load. That being said the entire game world looks like gray squares and nude character models until the textures catch up.			"

												Don't get me wrong - I love everquest.  I put a good 5 years into this game when it first came out and have not been able to find an MMO that gave me the same feeling accomplisment that Everquest gave me when I would grind for months for one damn item.  I thought I would go back and see what has happened to the game since 2004 - and I was having a great time playing it too.  It's a little more user friendly now-a-days and it copied a bunch from multiple MMO's in terms of the UI and quests that are available.  It even updated its graphics a bit.  My problem came when I tried to buy a months membership to  Daybreak games through what they call Kronos.  This is when things went downhill.  I thought I would support the game and get some of the benefits of being a member - a win win.  This is when I got banned.  They gave me zero notification about the ban, not even an email.  Through their page I was told I needed to make a new account to put in a ticket and contest the ban.  I did that close to a week ago and still have yet to hear back from their support team. I even entered an second ticket and sent multiple emails.  It's a bit ridiculous.  Apparetly if you fat finger some numbers on a credit card account, it doesn't deny the charge like any other game or website  (again I just assume this is what happened to me)- it just bans you outright and give you no rhyme or reason.  So, sadly I would never recommend this game to anyone just based on Daybreak having horrible customer support.  Go play Rift - any time I would put in a ticket Trion would respond quickly.			"

												I have been a very long time player of this game since 2002 or so. FTP however is limited to your spells and level, content too. If you want to see what this game is like to decide if you want to purchase it or not, it's a good start to have FTP. With each expansion however that is new or comes out you have the option to get it or not too. I have the full version because of my main character being the fact I've been on and off in this game (Antonius Bayle server) for so long. At the time, there was no FTP option, also I got a Steam card for wanting something that Steam didn't have but I did find the newest expansion here.. so I bought it, gave me a code for the actual paid version to input and I enjoy endless amount of content from fighting to skills, AA's and of course best of all, the friends you meet along the way.

												This game was good 10 years ago.Now it is junk, crashes, log-in issues, lag, and 15 year old graphics are what its about now. EQ is free to play but with conditions added. Daybreak makes new expansions with consist of 75% old zones that have been upgraded to a higher level and maybe 1 or 2 new ones. Mobs are copy and paste from all other zones so no new ones in a long time.All the special events are old ones that just keep coming back. Once in awhile something interesting will come along but far and few between. So after reading this i cant say any thing good about EQ anymore, theres other free to play games that are a lot better. But the one upside to EQ  is that it does have a nice community, people are always willing to offer advice that will help you along.			"

												Avoid anything Daybreak.  They close games and lie and steal money.  Just avoid anything owned by them.  I played EQ1 from Kunark and was a collectors edition preordered EQ2.  I had paying subscriptions until they went FTP and killed all the games they felt were not money makers anymore.  Vanguard - Dead, Matrix - Dead, Landmark - Dead, EQNext - Dead.  Just pass on them.

												Everquest was the first MMO I ever played. I remember playing it every day after school, doing chores to pay for my sub, and even crying when my uncle got to playing with me. He came from Ultima, so I was eager to play with him. So many hours lost, so many days spent just standing around or running around. I forget his name, but I played a Half-Elf Ranger and loved it. Granted, the day finally came I shifted to other MMOs with my friends. Wow, FF, etc. Needless to say, Everquest was forgotten for awhile. Expansions came, the sequel came, etc.Fastforward I wanna say Ten-ish or so years, here I sit, bored of Wow's Endgame, FF14 kinda.. Meh? I see Everquest is still around. Maybe not as true to the original as I remember, I see a lot of pay for access stuff and a company I'm not entirely fond of has taken over, but as I log in and play I feel the euphoria from when I was a child.Granted I'm on the Roleplay server, so my chance to meet others and experience the game as I used to is varied. So far I haven't met many others, but I'm also fresh into the game. But Everquest is still alive. Its still around. And I still love it.And yes. I made a Half-Elf ranger again. Just like old times.I would call it a 9/10. Not the pure game most of us remember, and obviously dated by todays standards, but it was the father of MMOs... Or well, Son. Ultima and all...			"

												Recommended ONLY for Veteran players that wish to revisit Norrath.  It will be oddly heart breaking.Over 5,000 hours played on one character alone.  The community has changed substantially over the years and the charm many of us felt for EQ on initial release has long since fizzled.  The ""awe"" and ""excitement"" has waned over the years and the wonder of exploration has died a slow, painful death.  PVP is a joke (even moreso than initially).  Old players fondly remember the earlier involvement of GMs with events in the Plains of Karana and remember the first time being run over by trains in Karnor's Castle.  It's hard to place a finger on it, but this game simply is NOT the same.  Having said that, I still put over 300 hours into this game after being away for several years, so there is still an odd draw to the game.  Nevertheless, this game is not ideal for the new player and I only recommend this to veterans who wish to jump on from time to time.  Your old characters are still there, so that IS something.			"

												What can I say about EverQuest that hundreds of other players have not said before? For it's time (I'd say circa 1999 - 2004) EverQuest was the greatest gaming experience to be had, and as one of the lucky players who was fortunate enough to play during this time period I can say beyond a reasonable doubt that EverQuest was the greatest gaming experience I have ever had.For what it was, EverQuest was simply an epic adventure that nothing since its time has been fully able to live up to what it presented. It utilized online game play before any other really massive games (save Ultima Online if so it can be considered) could offer for the time. The beauty of this game, however, really was drawn for it's difficulty, its immersion, and its community - and unfortunately, the EverQuest of today does not do these properties justice.There was a stark fear that entered me the day I played this for the first time. For one, it was expensive, it required a subscription, and I was not used to such things as a 13 year old - but with enough allowance and perseverance I made this game happen and it changed me personally on many levels as a result. To date, no other game has been able to offer the same feelings that this game truly did as an adolescent, and I feel that this game really places the bar at which I judge other MMO's and RPGs. It was fixed to first person, quests needed to be obtained through dialog, death was unforgiving, your possessions remained on your corpse, experience loss was a veary real fear, getting lost was a very real fear, other players were judged on their merit as individuals, and I could go on about every finite detail that made this game very revolutionary for its time.The EverQuest of today has been very watered down and filled with so many cash shop items and meaningless expansions to fuel the gear treadmill that I am deeply saddened. However, I do understand the stipulations behind keeping a game like this alive in a world of gaming where the ""lesser"" MMO's must really nickle and dime it's players to keep afloat, and for that reason I can never return to this magical place that shaped my childhood and outlook on gaming.Despite this, however, I keep this game and its developers in high regard for the opportunities it offered for me at the time. For many of us, the rose-colored glasses weigh heavy on tired eyes, but like your first love - this isn't something we can ever forget. For a real opportunity at the game in its hay-day Project 1999 (www.project1999.org) may be something to experience - but part of the magic that made EQ something awesome really did stem from its technological superiority of the time, and this may take away from the experience you may otherwise have.I will stop waxing nostalgic at this point and leave your judgement to its rest, but as an old EQ player I will forever stand by this game as an unparalleled experience that....sadly....really can never be experienced again.

												What can I say? I started back in late 2001 and was there to witness the good old days of EQ. Then Luclin came and the world as I knew it changed. But I experienced the sudden shift in paradigms, the loss of inocence, the dawn of a new era.There was no WOW back in the day, Meridian 59/UO were practically the only other contenders in the MMO segment.So I decided to make Norrath my home, invited friends over and decided to just go around exploring what the world had to offer ... and believe it or not, even today there is still stuff I don´t know much about, and only two years ago ended up finishing my Beastlords´s epic XDI mean, what drives me here? Is it the nostalgia? The remembrance? The Friends?Well , EQ is perhaps one of those few mmo´s that have managed to keep me coming back to it for WELL OVER A DECADE, and that surprises me. I left (to my chagrin today, knowing what I know now) EQ1 back in 2003/2004 when EQ2 launched ...Man how I regret that decision. After that I started a road of complete homelessness in the Virtual World of MMO´s , jumping the ship to EQ2/CoH/CoV/TR/MO/MU-O/Vanguard/LOTRO/WAR and many many other MMO´s that just kept filling me with hope of finding a nice quiet place to settle.It was then I realized there simply has been ONE and ONE home alone for me, with all its flaws, odd mechanics, drug-induced vision storyline of twisted roundabouts and myriad quirks and customs : EVERQUEST 1You see, it is my personal belief that we as gamers sometimes fall upon the LURE of the NEW, the supposedly new&fresh/exciting STUFF someone will make and instead of enjoying it begin a futile search for the NEXT BIG THING of NOTHINGNESS that will fill a strange hollow void in our souls, almost as if we were waiting for Godot to arrive to start having fun and be all right. But it is a lie, a subtle lie of epic proportions that meshes with our current middle age crisis/existentialist angst/suppressed teen anger/isolation and alienation that the modern world forces upon us.You see, home, the virtual home is a chimera of our own mind and looking for it constantly only shows how much we miss it.Like a weird quest to return to the womb, a virtual one, this has been my experience. There will ALWAYS be a new flashy MMO, filled with wonder, with promises of awesome pvp/pve, with new flaunted combat systems, with amazing rendered spells, with gorgeous buxom beauties of pixelated proportions so fine you will barely notice the missing seams in the avatarrs .. But it´s a lie. What you are looking for, what I have been looking for is that permanently looped Nursery that was found in The Dancers at the End of Time, whhose technology was applied to the already dying universe to loop it in time perfectly for millenia of everliving the good old moment of the eternal now (blame Michael Moorcock for that not me)And where is it found? That permanently looped in time place that is my virtual home?HERE, in this game that has maddened me to no end, that always makes lousy design decisions yet continues to be underneath all that filth the good old Everquest.And no friend, this is no madman rambling, there are thousands of us, still trying to live in that perfectly looped anomaly outside the universe.There is P99 (recently recognized by Daybreak) and many other private/public shards of EQ that alongside official ""Live"" servers try to perpetuate this strange world of wonders and mysteries.I am not writing this to try to convince you to play the game or to hate it, only to show you a small door to my own path, which might be the same as yours.Yes, modern MMO´s have a TON of Quality of Life enhancements, but this has made them as tasty as Fast Food, greasy delicious fast food, that you love to consume , but EQ? EQ is the awful porridge your poor parents forced you to eat because the war was in its apex and all you could eat was that sludge made from a mix of unknown victuals as your family and fellow refugees huddled close together by the slowly consuming candle as thunder and perhaps incoming shells sounds  reverberated in the sky. You see, even today, when you eat that porridge, you ... REMEMBER. And that alone friend, is what made you what you are today.Thus Everquest. Forever. Yes, I highly enjoy this game, no, the hours in steam dont reflect my true use of the account, I have many more lost in the true logs of the servers. Yes it is an old game, but honestly, it is the only home I have ever known and the others have been just weird foreign towns that don´t know how to make that dreadfully delicious bland porridge of sadness that for some twisted reason make me happy.Man I love this game, will always return to it, and will always play on the TLP servers when given the chance. Also no other game has this trinity/support classes so well defined as EQ. No other game has an Enchanter Class nor a Necromancer class like the one EQ has to offer. They don´t really, for some reason as time passes Modern Games tend to dilute and break these classic archetypes of gaming turning them into something they are not. Anyway it is time for my medication, and I think the Ward already noticed I am not in my roomLove you all guys, remember me, I will remember all of you, my fellow players of Everquest, you have given me for years the best gaming moments of my life and hope that this will be so in the future too.Hugs to you all!o/			"

												Came back to play on a TLP server for the first time and get the ""old school"" player feelings like back in the early 2000s -- LOL.....wrong. I can't say much about the normal servers as I didn't play them much. However the TLP (Time Locked Progression) servers, specifically Ragefire (since I played there). Absolute trash....garbage to the max....People are botting and macroing EVERYWHERE. You don't quite see it ""as much"" at the lower levels unless you happen to see a train of 7-20 people all named pretty much the same and all on auto-follow. However the higher levels, you will find these guys perma-camping epic drops, high value loot drops, the dragons, etc....Everquest sadly has turned to crap since back in the good ole days...reputation doesnt matter here anymore, due to 3 reasons lol 1.) GMs dont do anything anyways 2.) The people that are screwing their reputation up, do it along side there 20 bot army and all their friends doing it so they dont really care or need to care/worry 3.) If you really want, buy a name change and poof....youre now a new player.....			"

												I had many hours of fun on this game. Even when I needed to poo I would hold it in because I didnt want to leave my computer in case someone trained me.One day I held it in for so long that my feces compacted until its mass was that of a watermelon. My body started to think I was ready to give birth and I began to lactate colostrum. This caused my nipples to become irritated and require a lot of twiddleing and pulling to ease the overwhelming itching sensation, which is why they are so droopy in my picture.My ♥♥♥♥ bled for weeks after I had passed brown -but I survived this dark time in my life, all thanks to Everquest.This game saved my life.

												This is one of the greatest MMORPG's I've ever played in my life. This was THE blueprint for spawning new MMORPG's to date. No other game comes close to the experiences I've had with the adventures, friends, and epic quests. This game has an extremely high replay and nostalgic value. However, if you've played before and looking to get back in, prepare yourself for a complete makeover because that is exactly what Sony did. It's not the worst, but I would say it's confusing for people who is use to play EQ back in 1999 and on. And need I dare say it? It's not the same game I use to play before Sony decided to milk the crap out of EQ with needless, countless expansions. I would review my take on Project 1999 but unfortunately, I never got the chance to play it nor acquire EQ Titanium (an accumulation of EQ expansions plus original).I could go on and on taking a teary trip down memory lane about EQ but more importantly I am proud to say that EQ is/was the cherry on top of all MMORPG sundaes.

												Oh Everquest, I loved you so much! This game was absolutely amazing when it first launched and for the first four or five expansions. The current state of the game does leave much to be desired. The core gameplay has changed a bit and I feel there is not much of a challenge to the game any longer. I was a bit shocked to see how much the player base had dwindled and how many bots roam the landscapes of Norrath these days.The game has turned in to a cash shop nightmare and has really taken the core elements away from the original spirit of Everquest. Some folks might find an enjoyable game, but with the addition of mercs, this really takes away from the entire point of making new friends to tackle content. I suppose some guilds might be active and still keep that spirit alive, but overall, this game has taken a huge plunge from the amazing game it once was.It feels like you're playing a shadow of the original game these days. I was very disappointed with my return to the game and seeing everything that has changed. The time lock servers were fun for a little while and helped to capture some of the old school nostalgic moment, but the live version is out of control. I regret to say that Everquest might be appealing to some, but the dive in the player base speaks for what is has become.			"

												Thinking about playing EverQuest for the first time? Don't. Only come back if you've played back in the day and you are returning for a nostalgia run. This is not an MMO you should visit if you've never played before. Why? Well, let's see:Terrible Developer Communication-- The developers have poor communication with the community. They never explain what is happening when the servers are down, they never explain why they decided to take X path instead of Y path, they lock any threads on the official forums if you criticize them, and they don't reply to any threads outside of their own. Unacceptable and completely unprofessional.Outdated-- If you've played back in the day then you'll be used to the graphics, thus you probably won't be too taken aback by how ugly EverQuest looks.-- You also have the jumbled, unorganized, messy UI the game gives you. When you first log onto your character you'll be surprised how I wasn't exaggerating. It's that bad. I honestly think it's the worst UI out there from any other game I have ever played.Lazy Developers & Lack of ContentAnother developer complaint? Yes! They deserve it. They are in charge of what direction the game is going, and they are always going down the wrong path. Incompetent?-- Back when the first EverQuest expansion was released ('Kunark') you got 28 zones, that's right 28 zones to explore and tackle. How many zones in the current expansion of EverQuest? In 'Empires of Kunark' you get.... 7 zones! Hahaha... It's hard not to laugh when you compare the two. This expansion takes place on the same continent of Kunark. You lack 21 zones to explore due to the current lazy developer team. It's quite sad.-- No maps. That's right, you get very little in-game maps. You need to go to a third-party website to download maps. This shouldn't happen...-- Speaking of the current expansion, did you know they have the nerve to charge the same amount they charged for 'Kunark' for the most recent expansion 'Empires of Kunark'? With 1/4 the content! How people accept this is beyond me. Actually, thinking about it, they are probably lifelong players who can't take off their nostalgia goggles to see things clearly.Lack of Players / Forced to 'Box' to Make Progress-- Let me explain how things are going to go for you if you are new and/or if you decide to come back:Level 1: ""Wow... this is an ugly UI. Um... What do I do?""2 - 11: ""Ok, I survived the tutorial. I was alone the entire time... Maybe I can join a group once I leave here?""12 - 50: ""Crescent Reach looks cool! Nice zone."", ""Hmm... still no groups even though I'm level 50! What the hell? Where is everybody?"", ""How did that guy writing that review on Steam know this would happen? Does this happen to everybody?""51 - 65: ""What the hell happened? Why is it so hard to level up? I'm getting less than 1% a kill and it's taking FOREVER to make progress."", ""Also, where are the groups? This game is top-heavy, I guess. Maybe if I keep pushing forward I can finally get a group.""66 - 75: ""Ok, I'm going to quit. The grind is real and it's a real bore. Not even difficult, just killing hundred of enemies for less than 1% EXP.""75 - 105: ""Finally, I'm high enough level to group with somebody!""You: Hi, level XX [class here], want to group?Players: No, you're not in our clique, so...You: ...Damn it! Guess I'll ""box""What is 'Boxing'? - Boxing is a term used when a player has more than one account -- usually one or two additional accounts. You do this so you can tackle the games content since the game was designed for you to have a group. If you control three accounts, you can place three mercenaries (computer controlled players) in your party to complete your party. Instead of playing $15 a month, you pay $45 (if you have three accounts total). Depending on how good you are at controlling all your characters you can tackle every single thing in EverQuest besides most raids. Solo content? Obviously. Group content? Depends on what classes you picked and how good you are. Raids? A lot of old raids you can take, however once you reach the 12th (out of 23) or so expansion it nearly becomes impossible due to mechanics and needing 6+ players to enter the zone.In conclusion...Only come back if you have played before and you want to take care of that itch you have. Don't bother with EverQuest if you are new and want to try an ""old school"" MMO. It's not worth it. Any other MMO besides EverQuest, is what I suggest. The game shows no signs of improving, terrible developers, not enough content, and most importantly: no players!!			"

												I used to love this game. I played it for years when it came out and it was the best MMO I had played at the time. Recently came back for nostalgia purposes. I even bought a subscription so that I could use the bazaar (auction house feature). However, when I went to use an item that dropped for me and it asked for even more money on top of my subscription in order to use the item, I cancelled my subscription and wrote this review. The company isn't even american anymore. It is run in russia and they charge real money for EVERYTHING in the game and that's even if you pay the monthly fee. Screw that and screw Everquest.			"

												So the ""free to play"" is a little misleadingIts free to play, on the original ♥♥♥♥ servers that no one actually plays, the only way to play on a server with actual humans, and not one guy botting ten accounts, is to pay.Eq is dead, i would not recommend, if you want an actual eq experience, go play P99, its still got a crap community, but atleast its actually free.

												Everquest is great if you're looking for a nostalgia trip back to 1999 era MMOs, but otherwise is lacking in many departments.

												Garbage. And to think that SOE makes you pay monthly for all the features. This game lacks any kind of playerbase whatsoever making the game basically unplayable. All the amazing and interesting content that once made EverQuest an exciting adventure is now just an empty wasteland of what was. You will find a few people playing in the starting zone, and a few people that are high level doing raids. In between is nonexistent. If enjoy soloing MMO's this game is ok, but if your hoping for a social experience you wont find one.			"

												The very first 3D MMORPG is still a blast to play. Though the games mechanics have changed quite a lot since 1999 (progression servers that are locked to older content remedy this), EQ still delivers an old-school MMO feel with tons of additions inspired by newer games. The community is small, but very much tight knit and very helpful. Just make sure you research which servers have a high enough population to suit your fancy.One huge plus with this game is the exploration oppurtunities and the pure sense of adventure in a fantasy setting. The game is gearing up for its 22nd (yes, 22nd) expansion pack. That means this game is chock full of zones, quests and loot to find. Characters are also able to embark on very long, detailed quests for ""Epic"" weapons which are class specific. These epic quests involves traversing huge swaths of the world, looking for extremely rare spawns, building reputation with various factions and taking down raid encounters with an organized group. The main flow of the game is centered around camping mob spawns, doing quests for items, experience, gear modifications or lore/class related advancement. Character customization is primarily loot based, with a huge emphasis on augmentations for said loot. Once a player hits 51, Alternate Avancement points come into play to further customize how your characters play. Time consuming but very rewarding. The game also allows for soloers to have fun by using ""mercenaries"", basically CPU group characters who fulfill specific roles such as tanking, healing or DPS.All in all, download the game. You get plenty to do for free and a complete experience if you pay for a subscription.			"

												Have been playing EverQuest since 1999, with just a few breaks here and there. Some expansions were great, some were good, and some could have been better - but the entire trip has been well worth it for me :)The game has a much more challenging risk vs. reward system than never MMOs, which is probably also why the community ""matters"" more - you can easily ruin your characters name on your play-server, if you act like a total jerk to others... and that will come back and haunt you when you find yourself barred from the guilds that can bring your character forward progression-wise.With the recent additions of new Progression servers (where you start with the original game enabled only, and then ""unlock"" expansions in the original order, as time passes) - there has never been a better time for new, as well as old, players to experience EverQuest and all it has to offer :)			"

												One of the biggest freedom online RPGs in existence. You can create your own stories, adventures, quests and so on. You don't have to do what the NPCs or whatever else tells you to do. Sure, doing the things they offer you can give you really nice rewards, but you can also get really nice rewards doing your own thing. There are other games out there that allow you to do this, but it's a lot more limited. Ever Quest has very few boundaries.This game is purely amazing and it's your choice weather you want to play your own way or not, or both. Both ways are great. I do both myself. So if you’re asking yourself, ""Can you play solo and not get involved with people?"" ...Yes. You can. However, you can gain a lot of good by teaming up with people for groups and raids, but it's not needed and you can have just as much fun  playing by yourself. I am mostly a loner player and I make and find my own stuff. I wander the vast world, and explore with no quests attached. I do a lot of NPC quests, but mostly I just do my own personal quests, stories and adventures. Playing this game is like playing a fantasy book you wrote. If you never played this before, and love older fantasy books along with using your vast imagination, I recommend you play this.  The graphics aren't that real looking, but are pretty nice, which leaves a lot of room for you to see it your way and not an already created way. Don't worry about the rating, this game is for you to figure out. The rating will not tell you how you feel about the game. Trust me. It's too unique to go by other people’s ratings. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely for those who always wanted to play a game that's how I described. Here's a big plus too... The character customization is awesome. I don't mean the standard looks; I mean the equipment, stats and advanced looks.Yes, if you’re new to the game... there will be a lot to learn and takes a lot of time, but it shouldn't be hard at all.

												So long ago I paid lots of money for a lot of expantions for this game. Spent over two years playing this game. What did i gain from it? Now all those expantions are free and what do you know they have another. They raised the level limit so much its just sad at this point. (was 60 I think when I started playing. Kunrark) Also when you get to higher levels 60+ you can loose a good bit of work in a single death. This doesn't seem like fun to me. The free play is very limited even to someone who paid a lot of money already into this game. Also when I played this like more then 10 years ago I had a different email and there is no way to change your email with out answering a secret question no way I will remember by now. Everything takes large groups of people at some stage and lots of pounding same keys over and over like mindless drones. My advice is run away!!!			"

												''FREE TO PLAY'' More like Pay 2 win, you litterally can't do much or anything if you're not buying a membership for your account.Free 2 play in a nutshell in everquest:- You can't do much in a guild excepted join one- Can't sell anything in the bazar, you're restricted in buying so you're pretty much stuck with your newby gear. Which sucks because you cannot really make money if you cannot sell your things in the bazar first.-You're restricted to 2 character. Not really that bad.-You cannot play on TLP servers and experience the first contents of the game-You will have a hard time leveling if you don't have a good merc to tank mobs. Yes, there is ranked mercs, and in F2P, only rank 1 and 2 are available, but they are bad. Upper ranks are the only good mercs to be able to tank anything correctly and without much trouble. AND there isn't much people in low levels that you can group with to level up.In a nutshell: Want to play normally and be able to progress on your character without much trouble? Then pay.			"

												If you are used to more modern MMORPGS then this game is NOT for you. This game is old-school as hell and it shows. The UI is so clunky and unintuitive, you pretty much need a 3 day seminar just to learn how to use it alone. Then accepting and turning in quests is ridiculous with you having to type phrases into a secondary chatbox in order to advance dialogue with NPCs and the combat is also clunky with you having to target an enemy and basically go into combat mode to start fighting things. It's really, really hard to learn and even harder to master.If you like the hardcore, oldschool style RPGs or MMORPGs of that time then this should be fine for you, if you have a ton of patience and free time to sit down and learn the clunky UI and dodgy combat controls then you'll probably enjoy it. But this is not a good first MMORPG or even a good MMORPG for anyone who has spent a lot of time playing WoW, Guild Wars 2, Final Fantasy XIV or any other modern MMORPG.			"

												The only thing that made me play was simply the nostalgia. Now do not let my play time fool you a large portion of that was me AFK looking/waiting for a group on the premium servers. Now there were good times do not get me wrong. However for someone to go in with little to nothing about how the game works and functions you are going to have a bad time. Play on a free server get a glance at what the game was log off. I love EQ and it makes me sad that it's very likely that because of daybreak it will not be given new life for some time.. if ever.

												Honestly, I think this game is great! The things I like about it is it's a 1999 game, you can go anywhere you want and conquer mobs your LVL. And i know, the grapics are oudated, but I dont care! I first played this game when i was 9 and still play it along my friends, we would go to dungeons and OWN mobs with our OP characters! It is complicated and complex how things work but I got the hang of it and already have a LVL 20 in less than 24 hours!You can literally create your own quests and decide how they go instead of doing the Quests the game has provided you with! That's the reason why they called the game ""EverQuest"". I would say i is 110/100 best MMO ever realeased of all time, forget WOW, Guild Wars 2, and Wildstar! This is how mmo's were supposed to be like. I will recommend this game to anybody who wants a challenge and enjoy the crap outta the real MMORPG that came out 17 years ago! :)			"

												(I played this game starting at 2001-2015 so what it says on steam is a lie I have played my fair share of EQ.) This game was great, the best MMORPG out there. You paid I think around $15 bucks a month for a subscription, and the game was filled with content you could do almost anything this game, It was a challenge to master, you had to talk to people make freinds go on raids/groups and work together, Then everything when Daybreak go ahold of this game. (the fire nation attacked) They are stomping the few players left in the game into the ground and spitting on them. So now unless they pull somthing spectaculer of this game is just a dust town sadly.			"

The combat is very lackluster and all of its zest is lost after a couple hours.  I know that the game was popular years ago but by today's standards, this game is not as fun as you would think.  There are so many F2P MMOS out there that are better in gameplay and graphic wise.  All in all, unless you want a nostalgic road trip avoid this game.			"

												I try hard to look for the good qualities in life and in games. Unfortunately, after trying for over an hour to accept and move through the tutorial quests I quit the game in frustration. I can see why SEO is trying to redeem themselves. I can truthfully say I would not pay to play this game. The User Interface is messy, the graphics are not applying, and the tutorial is less than helpful. Truthfully I find it easier and more fun to play the Original Guild Wars than I do to try to play the original EverQuest. There are other SOE games that have better graphics, User Interfaces and drastically improved character movement. I would recommend the other SEO games before recommending this one. If I cannot get out of the tutorial area in less than half an hour there is seriously something wrong.			"

												okay I understand the players like the game now....maybe... but for F***'s sake please fix the UI so the game is playable. There was a huge surge when players first saw the progression server was up and even new players would have played, but your UI all over was just junk. That and the game's framework could be massively upgraded to do the same things this game does- with prob like 2-3GB less on the HDD AT LEAST.I recommend this game for anyone who wants to play a true MMO but not to anyone who wants to play their *first* true mmo.

												Played this game since Quellious server first launched in 98/99, back when Verant was who owned it and the game was simply amazing. I have logged more hours in this game than ALL my others game I have ever played combined.... easily, that being said: It was what started all the present day MMORPGs. I will always love this game and will always have amazing memories of playing with my brother and many friends, some now passed away.I cannot reccomend this game the way it currently is now-a-days. The game is a faded shadow of its former glory. To call this a ""free to play"" game is laughable. I have 3 accounts, maxxed out characters slots, nearly all lvl 100. Back when this game was a game that you HAD to pay for, it was simply great! Now with the ""free to play"" BS that this crappy new company uses, its basically ""pay to play or you get penalized"". What I mean by this is simple: If you do not pay the monthly fee, then all that hard earned equipment you are wearing will no longer take affect on you and be basically just a visual item you are wearing. Its pretty damn sad. Spend hours and hours and hours getting the equipment you have, the game ""Free to Play"", but you are penalized if you try to play the game like this. ""Free to play"" my @$$. This is NOT NOT NOT NOT a free to play game. Calling it such is a straight out lie. I want to reccomend this game, VERY badly. It has so many wonderful memories from the past... but in the current state, there is just no way in hell I can, and still sleep at night.Graphics are datedSounds are datedUI is datedControls are datedMore expansions than I have fingers and toesYou should look elsewhere for a ""free"" MMORPG.

												Love the game.But the company that owns the game is complete garbage.  I started EQ up back in 1999 and it was much different over the years of course the game has changed sadly not for the better.The community of the game has gone to complete ♥♥♥♥ and the company has changed their rules to make it okay for other players to basically harass you.  Kill stealing is a thing because whoever does the most damage gets the exp and loot.  Training (The act of grabbing a bunch of monsters and leading them onto another player with the intent to kill them) is extreamly prevalent on their new progression server.  Do not go into the game alone most people box more than one character and go out of their way to screw you.I cannot recommend the live version of Everquest anymore.  World of Warcraft has a better community now.			"

												First of all i would like to add that i have played this game for alot longer than on the reccord for steam.Estimating about 4000Hours played. And this saying I would not recommend this game for new players currently. ( hopefully they fix some things )Everquest was an amazing game, magnificant large worlds, facinating creatures and entrapping stories and quests. Everquest would catch you from the begining to see where would you end up next and what would you be doing, the possibilities were endless. Here is the kicker, Everquest WAS an amazing game, nothing can even come close to the detail of the story but they fail at catching and keeping new players. The MAJOR problems with everquest is the graphics, UI (default), complicated nature of the game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ TUTORIAL (who wants to start an epic journey in a smelly cavern with outdated looking everything? And to top it all to deal with the complicated nature of the game they just add these very annoying pop ups and the UI is overlapping so before you can do anything you are bombarded by a ugly UI), and very very loud menu music.... All of this turns away so many new players and causing an un even population of veterain players on many servers. So you want to get started in an epic journey with a party and your alone youre in the largest world you can immagine and its just empty. They need to Update the UI and make it friendly to new players, update the tutorial to make it not a depressing hole in the ground, and update the graphics to get people to not feel like they are playng something that has been outdated.

Like it had a black market auction house where people would trade rare items for hundreds of dollars. Today, almost every MMORPG has an ingame store. Or in Blizzard's case, a legalized auction house where they take a cut of the profits.You gotta love innovation. One step forward, two steps back.			"

												The ONLY reason I even dared to download this to start with is to be able to list my old review of it here, since I actually did play this a few years ago. Heah! I don't have the foggiest idea what was worse to play back then...This or Eternal Lands...Gee, it's to bad I can't rant about Eternal Lands here on Steam! Anyway, here goes: I found this game when I was looking for game images of scarecrows online and saw a good scarecrow game image on Everquest. This in addition to the multitude of Classes and content available, which the game apparently has to offer made me want to play it. To bad it didn't turn out to be the great game I expected it to be. Here's why...1: Download takes to long on slower computers. Period.2: Leveling up takes way to long! Even when following an online guide I found, it was just taking to long.3: Dying is to risky and even though you don't lose items when you die (At least I don't think), you do lose experience, so this means you have to do even more grinding. And if you have certain abilities active while running past (Would be) friendly NPC's, they WILL attack you! They'll probably kill you in one strike as well.4: Tutorial does very little to help you. It does not teach you enough about the game (Like how to change the camera views, adjust sound and music volumes, how to quickly gain experience, etc...) and what little it does teach you does not offer you very good rewards for completing it.5: The Kobolds at the start of the game are among the dumbest-looking monsters I think I've ever seen! Also, the monsters tend to get in your face when you're fighting them. Plus, when you're fighting them, the animations look robotic and artificial. And speaking of which...6: The game is best played in 1st person perspective and if you don't like it, you CAN change the camera views, but all the other camera view points are even worse than the first person view point. And as for the first person view point, it looks like I'm playing as a gnome or a dwarf or some other short character race instead of a human (The race I was playing as).7: Some of the game controls are restricted to having to press certain keys. For example, every time you want to chat, you have to click in the box before typing your message!! So damn annoying! Furthermore, you have to press a certain Enter key. Yes, it does matter which enter button you press. And my keyboard of the time was missing one of its enter buttons so I had to use a pen cap to activate the key. Also, there is no way to change this as far as I can tell! And to make this even worse, you actually have to type things out to NPC's!8: Completing quests can be annoying cause you have to 'use' certain items on NPC's and worse yet, they do not accept stacked items, so you have to manually separate any stacked items you have before giving them to an NPC.9: Certain items cannot be dropped or traded and must be destroyed. And in order to destroy them, you have to click on the item and 'move' it to a VERY small destroy button on your inventory window.10: Is there pay-to-win content here? Oh, Hell yes! Just give them a certain amount of money, and you'll be rocketed all the way to Level 85! Gee, pa! They forgot to say 'halt'!Case in point, if you're new to this game, you'll be struggling to figure out a sound strategy to make the most of it at best or throwing your keyboard across the room in frustration at worst when you realize you don't stand a chance against most of those pug-fugly Kobolds anyway. My final score...2 stars-Inferior!			"

												This is honestly the worst game I have ever had the displeasure of playing. I played maybe five minutes after an hour or so of downloads and it was not worth the 8.6 gigabytes that it used on my computer. The fact that this game has 18 expansions and a sequel are astonishing to say the least. The hud is too intrusive and the controls are clunky and impossible to make comfortable, it seems like it was made in a weekend. The character customization is ridiculously limited with maybe five classes unlocked for the free basic game. ""The MMO that started it all"" is true in the sense that it seems like it was an alpha that no one had the time to play test. It had potential but the controls are embarassing and dysfunctional, I can see why it was a free to play game. I recommend no one ever play this game because it is not worth your time.			"

												quite a learning curve ...grapics are old and outdated in comparison to newer stuff. But that never mattered much to me. If you liked games like morrowind this is pretty close to it in my opinion. you can do the tutorial and get decent gear or if youre like me you'll just pick up your starter weapon and charge out naked and learn the hard way which feels so rewarding to me. I have played a lot but easily forget a lot of simple things and get lost but thats just part of the fun. There is a reason people keep coming back to this game and it has 20 something expansions. I see a lot of people complain about server crashes and its probably DDOS attacks by angry butthurt ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who hate Daybreak who are doing these server crashes in response to recent events that happened with the company. The game has changed since its launch and that is ineviable as with all things but it is still EverQuest and can still be enjoyed and explored by new and returning players.			"

												Play the game that started it all! The graphics may be old, but the game is still as fun as ever. The F2P model transition has been handled well, the limitations are resonable and non-restrictive (the biggest one is the limit of 2 chars per server, which makes sense to stop multibox bot trains), and players can't buy power, just a lot of cosmetic and convenience items. I've enjoyed looking like a Froglock Phantom since I came back.It's EQ, in it's best form, and if you didn't play back in the day, don't let the graphics turn you away. Norrath is massive. No other MMO has even come close to hitting the scope and scale of an online world as this game did 15 years ago. And, in those 15 years, Norrath's gotten a lot bigger. A lot.Bottom line: I haven't had this much fun in an MMO since Bill Clinton was President.			"

												Best MMORPG of all time, but if you haven't played it by now it is likely too late as the game might be hard to get into since it is so old now and has low population and old control mechanics that are hard to adapt to. They just don't make MMOs like this anymore. MMOs where the game was about exploring new locations, the lore, and slow steady progression. MMOs today are just hubs littered with thousands of mind numbing quests to level 1-Max in a month, grouping not required. MMOs today are about getting to end game and raiding endlessly. EQ had its fair share of raiding, but when I think of EverQuest that is not the part that I think of. My initial character that took a long time to level up (probably a year to get max level) and slowly progressed from zone to zone and the different people I met along the way that I grouped with is what I remember most. No other MMO has had a similar experience since because they just go by too fast and too easy to get people to the end game, and with instance queues (usually multi-server) there just isn't any sense of server community in current MMOs.At the end game EQ was similar to what we know today in MMOs, nothing that special, with the primary difference being competition over spawns since there were no instances. This was fun and not fun at the same time. It formed different guild rivalries if we stole a spawn or they did, but sometimes you would have to change plans due to not being at the right place at the right time. The more proactive your guild was in monitoring spawns and mobilizing quickly and efficiently the greater chance that your guild would be the strongest on the server. It was a different mechanic than current MMO raids, but ultimately that isn't where EverQuest shined to me.The EQ lore is what kept me playing. The locations and the story lines were there, but you had to find them, they weren't laid out for you with giant exclamation points. EQ has some of the best zones in any MMO I've played and I would recommend playing it today just to get a chance to experience certain zones and dungeons, but again this game will be hard to pick up at this point with its age.There are still people that play the game, but they're all at end game raiding. I would recommend this game still today as a single player experience to just experience some of the zones and game lore, but it would be hard to recommend it to play end game with all the catching up that would be required.A new EverQuest comes out in 2015 (probably) called EverQuest Next so be on the lookout for that one, it looks to be doing some really great things in the MMORPG genre.

												The first MMO I ever played and definitely still one of the best ones out there. Yea the graphics are out-dated but what do you want? This game is old enough to be in High School and it's still an amazing game and definitely worth playing. Looking at all of the features this game has it's just amazing that even over a decade ago this game was at the forefront of it's genre. ♥♥♥♥ it was the ONLY online game anyone played until WoW came along pretty much. And honestly I'd rather play EQ than WoW any day. Now that it's free (and not pay to win) I hope that more people get to enjoy this amazing game like I did for so many years - and will continue to enjoy for many more!			"

												This is the Game that set the standards for the MMO Genre. It has a very emersive Quest system and the Largest world I have seen in an MMO. The grahics could be better but what do you expect form a game that was released in 1999. The area where you get spells and Combat abilities is also your main hub town (The Plane of Knowledge) if your a free to play player then you will always start in the same city as your home city (Creasent Reach).The Magic system in this game is different as your character has Slots for spells like Pokemon Moves where you have to equip a spell to slot from your spell book and you can only hold as many moves as you have slots, you can hold all spells for your class in your spell book but but you have sit down and memorize the spell to equip them. The UI can be modded with UI skins by making a folder with the skin in it and typing /loadskin and selecting your skin. make sure to finish the tutorial first before leaving the main world so you can have a full set of armour to start with. The Thing with losing your gear when you die is no longer a problem but you still lose EXP after Level 6 when you die.			"

												Oh how I miss this game.  When I was a kid I played a Necro for years.  I had 1k AA and raided all the time, I know that doesn't seem like much now but when you were sitting around 1k in Planes of Power it was pretty impressive.  It's hard to suggest a game like this though to be honest, it's so old and there is really so much that has been missed for new players that I don't know how people can start now.  I do admit with as often as they seem to be putting out new things they would lower the price of some of the exp or something.  Seems like this game makes enough with different items from the store and card game that they could tone down the exp price or monthly sub cost.			"

												I started playing this a little late in 2003 I think.  Legends of Ykesha was the current expansion IIRC.  I can only echo what several other reviewers have said.  This game is the one that was the most rewarding.  Yeah, it punished you for error.  It took your time, took your money, took your loot and so on.  That's kind of like real life too, so it was relatable.  I was hooked.  In this game, you truly feel like you are that race, trained as that class you choose to play.  A warrior does not heal, like in other MMO's unless you cound bindwound (using bandaids) as healing.  A cleric does amazing heals and laughable damage, not topping dps meters because actual dps classes are slacking.  Want to be an Iksar necromancer?  Be prepared to be the most hated race and class in the game.  Not even your own faction likes you.  It is the only game that I think truly gives a unique relationship with each race and class that no MMO has touched since they've entered the scene.  Play this, make friends because you will need them to safely level and experience zones.  Nothing better.			"

												EQ is a hilariously trolly game that punishes you for the slightest mistake, but I love it. The combat is simple but pretty engaginig, especially as a spellcaster. What's awesome about EQ is that it makes your littlest decisions truly matter somehow. Just beware that EQ is not an MMO for the casually-inclined or lazy, because it WILL make you earn your stripes. But Everquest makes the journey to the top of the mountian is truly special. Highly recommended!			"

												Ah, the game that changed my life in so many ways. What can I say about EQ, except that over the 8000+ hours I put into the game during my active period (LoY through TSS expansions on the Vazaelle and Maelin Starpyre servers), I started with nothing, rose to worldwide top of raiding, made lifelong friends, loved, lost, and forever emblazoned in my memory unforgettable experiences which I remember with picture perfection almost a decade later. This game never ceases to invoke a special warm feeling in my heart, that I just can't really get from anything else.Perhaps the best things about EQ simply the player community, and the enormous world -- especially now that there are 20+ expansions for the game. There's always something awesome to see, whether for the first time or once more for old times' sake. Today's iteration features changes that allow you to revisit a lot of the old world, and new content, by yourself with the help of things like mercenary NPCs, so it's fairly painless to get back into the game, weather for nostalgia or just a change of pace from today's MMOs. You might even run into some people who started at launch in 1999 and are still playing to this day They sure don't make them like this game anymore.			"

												It's Everquest. There's a reason it's still getting content updates and expansions despite being released in 1999. If you've never played it, but have tried other MMOs that have come out since, you'll probably have difficult time with EQ. It's not exactly user friendly, but the various systems and game mechanics make this game feel closer to a tabletop RPG than an MMO in today's definition/expectation of the genre. The amount of content in this game is nothing short of staggering. So many raids, monsters, items, secrets, spells, skills, races, cities, towns, dungeons, lore and everything else you'd expect from a huge RPG like this. If you end up enjoying it, your patience with the game will go long before you ever even get close to seeing all that this game has to offer. In many people's opinions, this was/is the absolute pinnacle of the MMO genre.			"

The character models were upgraded years ago but many NPCs are still using older models that make them look even worse than many of the old models in this older game. If you are looking for nostalga for FREE then try this game again. For awhile, you will be entertained.			"

												This was the game that got me into mmo's way back in 2003, so i figured i would try it out again since it went ftp.  i logged onto my old toon and i gotta say, it shows it's age. everything is confusing after years of playing games with simpler, more intuitive design and better graphics. within an hour i'd had enough. still, though, it's a classic and one-time king of the multiplayer scene and may be well worth the nostalgia alone.

												I kindly suggest the developers of Everquest ® Free-To-Play. Your Way.™ change the title of their game, as it is highly misleading. When I read that it was free-to-play 'my way' I figured that this game was the offical Subway MMO I have been waiting for since its announcement in May of 2002. Upon installing the game and purchasing the DLC (Rain of Fear) I sadly found out that this game is not actually the Subway MMO, and not only did i waste $30, but it also ruined my day.			"

												Best MMORPG of all time, but if you haven't played it by now it is likely too late as the game might be hard to get into since it is so old now and has low population and old control mechanics that are hard to adapt to. They just don't make MMOs like this anymore. MMOs where the game was about exploring new locations, the lore, and slow steady progression. MMOs today are just hubs littered with thousands of mind numbing quests to level 1-Max in a month, grouping not required. MMOs today are about getting to end game and raiding endlessly. EQ had its fair share of raiding, but when I think of EverQuest that is not the part that I think of. My initial character that took a long time to level up (probably a year to get max level) and slowly progressed from zone to zone and the different people I met along the way that I grouped with is what I remember most. No other MMO has had a similar experience since because they just go by too fast and too easy to get people to the end game, and with instance queues (usually multi-server) there just isn't any sense of server community in current MMOs.At the end game EQ was similar to what we know today in MMOs, nothing that special, with the primary difference being competition over spawns since there were no instances. This was fun and not fun at the same time. It formed different guild rivalries if we stole a spawn or they did, but sometimes you would have to change plans due to not being at the right place at the right time. The more proactive your guild was in monitoring spawns and mobilizing quickly and efficiently the greater chance that your guild would be the strongest on the server. It was a different mechanic than current MMO raids, but ultimately that isn't where EverQuest shined to me.The EQ lore is what kept me playing. The locations and the story lines were there, but you had to find them, they weren't laid out for you with giant exclamation points. EQ has some of the best zones in any MMO I've played and I would recommend playing it today just to get a chance to experience certain zones and dungeons, but again this game will be hard to pick up at this point with its age.There are still people that play the game, but they're all at end game raiding. I would recommend this game still today as a single player experience to just experience some of the zones and game lore, but it would be hard to recommend it to play end game with all the catching up that would be required.A new EverQuest comes out in 2015 (probably) called EverQuest Next so be on the lookout for that one, it looks to be doing some really great things in the MMORPG genre.

												Everquest is a very fun game.... When your a high level. At first it is kind of boring and slow but, after level 85 or so it gets funner. Unfortunely it's one of those games when you need to pay monthly to get a membership, so i did and i would say, I've spent over $300 which was worth it for what i got but now i don't want to pay $15 a month to have fun... so It was a good game while it lasted just it costs to much to have fun! but I still recommend it!

												The first MMO I ever played and definitely still one of the best ones out there. Yea the graphics are out-dated but what do you want? This game is old enough to be in High School and it's still an amazing game and definitely worth playing. Looking at all of the features this game has it's just amazing that even over a decade ago this game was at the forefront of it's genre. ♥♥♥♥ it was the ONLY online game anyone played until WoW came along pretty much. And honestly I'd rather play EQ than WoW any day. Now that it's free (and not pay to win) I hope that more people get to enjoy this amazing game like I did for so many years - and will continue to enjoy for many more!			"

												I haven't played this game since they opened the last progression server.  But I am really enjoying the new changes and how they altered things to get leveling quicker and easier solo.  So far I have a 22 Beastlord, 12 Necro, 14 Berserker and a 12 Paladin.  Went through the Gloomingdeep Mines every time and got some great armor.  Then I went on to Crecent Reach and did all the quests I could get my hands on and am getting great armor as well.  Haven't had to buy much of anything.  I am wondering how well the leveling will hold out the higher I get though.  We shall see.  I have a old EQ card around here somewhere so I should sub for a month.  But may wait till I get to a point where I have to pay to play (AA I think are locked, or something...)			"

												With 19 expansions EverQuest really does live up to being a MASSIVELY multiplayer online RPG... some might just say it's bloated.The graphics may not be much chop these days but the gameplay is still challenging, although not as unforgiving as the original and the first couple of expansions. It requires a fair amount of 'dedication' to develop your characters making its successors in games like World of Warcraft seem like MMO easy-mode.I probably like this more for nostalgic fun reasons rather than it being cutting edge, but it's a good way to kill some time and it's 'free-to-play' afterall. The free-to-play version gives you two character slots and a limited range of races/classes.I have a char on the Povar-Quellious server - a druid called Seeate.Although for the authentic EQ experience, I'd recommend Project 1999, an exceptional EQ emulator.

												This is my favorite game of all time. I have played for over a decade and still have more passion for this game than any other MMORPG I have ever played. It isn't the easiest for beginners to get used to, but you can do it. With the new TLP servers, the game holds so much nostalgia for and will for people who played before. I have played many MMOs and this one is end-game heavy, but the grind is still fun and exploring Norrath will never get old. I loved Guild Wars, WoW, Final Fantasy Series, Elder Scrolls Online and previous offline games. I love MMORPG's and this one is my favorite.			"

												A friend of mine spent many years playing this game back when it was popular. I have given it a try and for an older game I find it is enjoyable.  I have played many MMORPGS and with all of the pretty graphics, I find they all lack something this game has. I keep going back to this and both loving and hating my friend for introducing me to the Everquest games a few years ago.  It has dated graphics and I am not sure about the population but for an older game it has a lot of servers. This game is fun and worth trying. I enjoyed it and still play it. As I said it has what most newer games are missing. I would love to see this one updated with some newer graphics as well as a few other things. It has what the more modern games lack. Challange, huge world, very fun classes. It is not for the type who want things handed to them and need their hand held the entire way through though. Like so many others.			"

												I needed something to do while I download this game for 800th time, so I figured, why not post a review.  A review?  Well, not really.  More a long the lines of... well, just read it.You see, EverQuest is the kind of game you can lose your life to and not care one bit.  I know, because I was practically raised in this world.  I started back in 1999, when I was 6 years old.  Watching my Father play, I was captivated the moment I saw it - When I wasn't play it on the computer, I was LARPing it with my Brothers.I maintain to this day, that I was not raised in Unnamed City, Canada, North America, World.  No, I was Born in Kelethin, Greater Faydark, Faydwer, Norrath.  I was raised and molded by this world, the experiences I had and the people I met.I haven't, REALLY played in some years, but I still have solid friendships, to this day, that were forged in the Norrathian environment.  I still pop on every now and again, just to catch up.Every time I do, it's like visiting an old friend.  You haven't seen eachother for a while.  You catch up.  Talk about what is new, get lost n your friendship and despite that you have both done some growing, it's like your friendsip has never changed.I still get giddy with I hear the loading music.This game is more than just a game.  It truely is a world in which you may lose yourself in.It may be dated and have a lot of content that serves no purpose, but, it is there.  Just waiting to be explored.If you don't mind soloing or have a few like-minded friends - Play this game.Do not play it for the race.  Do not race yourself through all 115 Level (Maybe there are more now.  There were only 70 when I left)Do not play it like most enter MMOs, a mad race to get to the top of the world, ASAP.The expression, ""Stop and smell the roses"" could not be more true, than in this game.  You will not regret it.  Explore this world.  Breath in it's lore.  Become an inhabitant of Norrath, not sure a player vieing for the best gear.			"

I can't say it offers anything in particular no other game does. and the community is a bit isolationist by nature.But, there are good people playing the game too. and it is basically a good game. plus it really does have alot of content.I DO NOT reccomend this game for someone who hasn't played it before. it's just going to be a rediculous learning curve for little reward.

It has the classic feel of the game with the quality of life improvements of future expansions.  Don't pay attention to my steam time as I just started playing this on steam.  I have been playing this game since 1999 and didnt stop till around 2007.

												I haven't played this game in YEARS. I just gave it another go, and all of my characters are still there. That was the good part. The part is that the epic, opening theme is gone! I'm not sure what they replaced it with, but it's just lame. The music within the game is still there, though -- even the MIDI ones in certain areas like Rivervale.Even though the opening music makes my heart stop in disgust, the game is still a classic. I can't vouch for all of those expansions that were released, but you'll never get bored in this game. There's always something to do.			"

												I lost a couple years to this game.  If they were to relaunch with up to date graphics and a return to the hardcore pre-POP sadistic torture of the playerbase, it could do well again.			"

												The ultimate rpg, the one and only mmorpg that spawned all other online world games. A Challenge for any to master.			"

												Old school fun. The game all modern MMOs are based on. The game's systems and interface are rough by todays standards. You will spend several hours wishing some things worked better. Also the game continues to have new zones added but older zones are left without a face lift. The character models were upgraded years ago but many NPCs are still using older models that make them look even worse than many of the old models in this older game. If you are looking for nostalga for FREE then try this game again. For awhile, you will be entertained.			"

												This is the Game that set the standards for the MMO Genre. It has a very emersive Quest system and the Largest world I have seen in an MMO. The grahics could be better but what do you expect form a game that was released in 1999. The area where you get spells and Combat abilities is also your main hub town (The Plane of Knowledge) if your a free to play player then you will always start in the same city as your home city (Creasent Reach).The Magic system in this game is different as your character has Slots for spells like Pokemon Moves where you have to equip a spell to slot from your spell book and you can only hold as many moves as you have slots, you can hold all spells for your class in your spell book but but you have sit down and memorize the spell to equip them. The UI can be modded with UI skins by making a folder with the skin in it and typing /loadskin and selecting your skin. make sure to finish the tutorial first before leaving the main world so you can have a full set of armour to start with. The Thing with losing your gear when you die is no longer a problem but you still lose EXP after Level 6 when you die.			"

												I used to be an occasional Free Realms player, but of course that game is dead now (sad face). I was looking to try an MMORPG type game, since I haven't really played any games of that genre. I found Everquest and realized it was also by Sony Online Entertainment, so I decided to give it a try. It ran nicely on my computer, but I just couldn't seem to get into the game. I don't know if I will actually ever get back to this game; I guess MMORPG's just aren't really my thing. However, if they are your thing, and you want a VERY established community (15 years), you should give this one a try.			"

												Everquest is a very fun game.... When your a high level. At first it is kind of boring and slow but, after level 85 or so it gets funner. Unfortunely it's one of those games when you need to pay monthly to get a membership, so i did and i would say, I've spent over $300 which was worth it for what i got but now i don't want to pay $15 a month to have fun... so It was a good game while it lasted just it costs to much to have fun! but I still recommend it!

												Played this game for 10 years. This game was fantastic when it was still ran by Verant Interactive. Once Sony bought them out it started to go down hill. However EQ2 was a very nice upgrade once the characters progressed to gain there original skills. Very interested in EQ Next!			"
