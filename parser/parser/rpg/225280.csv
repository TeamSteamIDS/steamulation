												Full Mojo Rampage is amazing, I've been playing it for a fair amount of hours and it keeps being fun. If you have finished everything you can team up with people and do a very hard mode to keep a challenge online. Even though dieing makes you start over you keep leveling up and adding stats. This really keeps it fun to play. Love the game. They keep working and updating the game frequently. The developers answer and read almost everything on the discussion which is great. Seriously Recommend this game to everyone.			"

												*Review edited for release... still nothing but good things to say about it!*There is tons more I could say about this game and how much I enjoy it than what is in this review, so free to message me on Steam if you have any questions. I highly recommend this game if you're looking for something new in your roguelike/dungeon-crawling experiences... it was *the* most polished Early Access Alpha I had ever played, and is even better now that it is released.GraphicsVery nice and consistently styled, even in the character screen. The choice in what a friend of mine put as ""playful yet macabre"" is spot-on, and a very nice change of pace from other roguelikes (not that those are bad, but FMR is a unique breath of fresh air).SoundEverything from the music to the effects is lovely and fitting to the visual theme. Moody, atmospheric, ethereal, magical, mysterious, spooky... that is what comes to mind while playing and it's a joy to listen to! Some of the tracks really remind me of the greatness that was the soundtrack for Psychonauts (my favorite game of all-time).ControlsSmooth and intuitive when using the keyboard+mouse (controls are customizeable as well, so you can play however you want). I don't play games this twitch-reliant with a controller, but feedback about it in general has been very positive.GameplayThe randomization, pin/item/relic/Loa/leveling ""build"" system works really well but isn't so random that you're screwed if you get bad drops. Since your core setup is however you want to do it (and very easy to experiment with), there is enough consistency to do theorycraft and gameplay mastery... a *very* nice change from the *completely* random roguelikes. I love randomization, but it's nice to have something to play that is a good mix of random and static.The variety in gameplay is great, giving a pleasurable dose of strategic fighting and completely chaotic shmup-style play. Because FMR has this kind of variety, you never really get sick of it. Just when you're tired of one style, you roll a level that's totally different. I'm over 125 hours into it as of this writing, and I'm still not even close to be tired of any of it.Progression is incredibly satisfying, but I'll speak more to that below.GenreWhile the game is most commonly categorized as a roguelike (or rogue-lite), I see it as a mix of roguelike, bullet-hell/shmup, and dungeon-crawler. It's a fantastic mix, and adds a ton to the scale and variety of traditional roguelikes.DifficultySome may find their intital play sessions to be too easy, but the difficulty curve is not even remotely a cakewalk later on. If you feel it's too easy, just keep playing...  later difficulties/quests are *much* harder and varied. You'll soon find yourself cursing (joyfully) at failed runs. Because of this, I do *not* consider this game a rogue-lite... if anything, it's just one that isn't ultra hardcore in the start and eases you into the insanity. A perfect game to introduce someone to the genre, but has enough hardcore craziness to keep even the most experienced of players happy.Difficulty in this game is where the real progression and satisfaction resides. Leveling/etc. is a nice way to ease the player into the various mechanics of the game, but the meat of it all is in the variety of difficulties you unlock. Don't expect to be carrot-and-sticked the entire time with pointless leveling and unlocks... instead, expect to get your satisfaction from mastering incredibly difficult situations that (in the later difficulties especially) require perfected playing skills.ContentLevel modifiers, difficulties, level palletes, mission objectives, mobs (and their variations), bosses, items, Loas, etc. all have a great amount of variety already, and further post-release patches are planned which is just icing on the already delicious cake. I was already very happy with the content amount in the early alpha, and that has far more than doubled between then and release. Because of the amount there is, and because of how it's sectioned out between the different quests, you always have a ton of choice depending on your mood and a helluva lot to experience, master, and be surprised by.A quick note: I am in the credits for the game for the QA work I was voluntarily doing (a nice surprise, so thank you devs!). I am not a developer or paid contractor for this game and have no bias in that regards... I just love testing, and the community was silent during a time when they really needed feedback so I stepped up. My review would be exactly the same even if I hadn't done testing for it.			"

												To sum it up, open world Isaac. You will like this if you also liked Isaac. But you may like this even if you did not, since it has some unique properties as well. But, it does not feel that complete yet, although it surely is fun. (the game is not an openworld game though, but comparing this to Isaac the feel is there)Features:- The world is less randomized than it is required to be a roguelike. Actually, only order of the subquests and enemy types changes each time. While the map is also randomly generated, it does not do anything to the gameplay.- Mojo Mixer is a well thought mechanism, really adds to strategic depth. And feel of shrines whether it is a risky choice or a gift is well done.- It has a story, and a mild sense of humor.- Gameplay-wise actually this is better than its counterparts.- Just tried two of the gods, felt really unique. This is how it should be.- There should be more achievements and rewards for completing each quest for different gods etc.- Daily quests is useful to continue to play. So is endless mode.- Even though the gametime is short, it is a hard game even at normal difficulty. And there is 4 more level. So it would have long gameplay.- Use of wands is too shallow, since there is not any seperate wands inventory. Found a good wand but killed the boss already? This is sad, since it wont be with you for long.- Persistence between lives is not overdone, so it does not feel like grinding.- Item designs are good. But there are a few to be considered a roguelike. In my current playtime (6 hours) I saw more than half of them.-i forgot one thing. optimization with this game just sucks. I am playing at 1280x720 resolution and medium level of graphics, and it barely is okay with my newly bought laptop. (I played better games with better settings) Since this is a roguelike, and roguelike players are not into graphics that much, this is not a big problem.-UPDATE(03.02.15): This game's last content update was in May 2014. If this attitude of developers continue, I may change my review into a negative one, since being a roguelike requires randomness, and randomness requires lots of content.			"

												I finally got around to playing this game despite having purchased it four months ago and was pleasantly surprised, considering its an early access game and still in alpha, by its excellent graphics and  game play.  It’s got a Torchlight/Rough Legacy feel to it, with   rpg elements to craft your character to your liking.  You’ll probably die trying to  survive the first 30 waves (to win the first stage),  which means starting over, but each time it’s slightly different because  you retain your XP that gives you added benefits due to the rpg elements,   plus missions and events change  as well as the dungeons being  procedurally generated,  meaning   something different every time you replay.  The design and character animations are  gorgeous, each enemy having a memorable skin. Learning attack patterns is pretty easy   (there’s a shed load  of them even in this early build). By the time    this game is  fully released it's going to be worth every  penny; though, no doubt  you’ll be able to get this  at a   good discount   very soon.  :)			"

Different Type of a Dungeon Crawler Pretty solid dungeon crawler game, play with your friends or alone it can be lot of fun. It has good music which fits overall theme of the game very well. Controls are pretty smooth and you have gamepad option as well. It's pretty solid indie title all around. I Wish tho developers would patch it more often.			"

												FMR is a must grab on Steams summer sale, and here is my review on why. Over the Top Games is the independent game development studio( w/5 game developers) behind the multi-award winning NyxQuest. Founded in 2008 and based in Madrid - Spain. FMR was released on May 8th, 2014. It has a Voodoo theme that works & characters are ""cute"". The game mechanics are solid and fluid. ( I used the 360 controller so can't give opinion on K & M ) I haven't had any crashes or lag issues at all. The development team is planning to release free content updates as well.  The music is a nice horror/fun mix from the talented composer Alistair Lindsay, for thosse that don't know the name he has done games such as ~ Prison Architect, LostWinds, Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, and even helped with the Rare classic Jet Force Gemini. The game itself doesn't really hold a story ~ but buying this game I wasnt really looking for one. It's tagged as a rogue-like game but I find it a lot more forgiving than most true rogue-likes, as others have called it and I agree it's more rogue-lite. Don't let that discourage you if like games such as Binding of Issac ~ Rogue Legacy ~ Risk of Rain you'll find easy to understand gameplay with a fair amount of depth to it. Character progression & customization that you keep even after death. Boss encounters provide a fun challenge. Loads of items to find while running around. FMR has solid 3D graphic style, lighting & shadow effects all seemed solid.My rating for Full Mojo Rampage ~ Graphics 5 of 5Music & sounds 4.5 of 5Multiplayer N/A ( but have heard good things.)Gameplay 4.7 of 5Overall score 4.7 and worth the buy! Thanks for taking the time to read my review, cheers! "

This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.Just wanted to point out first that my game time that has been recorded on Steam is incorrect. I have spent at least eight hours playing this game. Full Mojo Rampage is a rogue-like game that has similar traits to that of Binding of Isaac and another top-down game, Torchlight. The game was released in mid 2014. Although the game promotes co-op game play, the game's servers are pretty empty when trying to find a multiplayer game; with that being said, the game is still mega fun to play solo. You take control of a Voodoo master; game play is a top down shooter where you have a normal attack, and two special attacks which are different for each class. At the start of the game you have a very basic class but you are able to unlock extra classes as you progress by using medals which you collect throughout the game and by finishing quests. The gameplay is very simple, but extremely addictive. As you explore each of the randomly generated levels you run into plenty of enemies to test your voodoo magic on. The game is also very loot orientated too, you start out with an initial two equitable item slots; most of the items which you equip will be voodoo dolls, these will increase your stats. You also have three inventory slots which can hold items such as extra ability items (such as boost speed for a certain amount of time etc).The graphics are awesome. It has that childlike aesthetic but still very pleasing to look at. The cartoony stylized characters have some great models and animation on each of the characters/enemies are also very good. At times in the game I struggled with the difficulty; but then I remembered that it is a rogue-like, and you are meant to die. Thankfully dying  is not a massive issue in Major Rampage as you get to keep all of your money, experience and levels each time. This means you are able to build up your character to the point where it is very hard to die on the same bit over and over again. This also gives you the opportunity to fine tweak your character to exactly how you want to play it. Each of the levels appears to be randomly generated,  I can't remember seeing the same layout twice. In each of the levels there are also extra rooms around the map to go into which include shops to buy potions, or new voodoo dolls, hidden chests with coins and items in, or the feature which I really liked, the ability to combine two voodoo dolls into one, which then frees up another slot in your equipped-able items.A full playthrough of all the quests on one single character took me about five hours from start to finish. You also get the chance to replay the levels all over again on Brutal difficulty which gives you the chance to increase your characters level even further.  With the option of being able to unlock other characters the replay-ability factor in Full Mojo Rampage is very high. I really recommend Full Mojo Rampage to any fan of the dungeon crawling, rogue-like genre as the single player is very well done and will keep you wanting to progress further and further each time. Sadly I found it very difficult to find a game online, but being able to play with friends on co-op mode maybe another redeeming factor here. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up. You can also find more reviews over at http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/ "

												My first impressions. I love roguelike-inspired games such as Spelunky or Binding of Isaac but I'm not impressed with this one's gameplay so far. To its credit, its technical and artistic realization seems flawless. Haven't encountered a single bug yet, and the game's gorgeous.But before I get to the pros and cons, information time for people who are new to the genre. This is not a true roguelike. Those are turn-based, have true permadeath (no permanent progression) and typically have unidentified items with sometimes dangerous properties. They do share procedural generation and random item and monster apparition with Full Mojo Rampage and other ""roguelites"".Examples of true, very fun, free roguelikes:http://crawl.develz.orghttps://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/http://doom.chaosforge.org/This said roguelikes have inspired a lot of real-time games, starting with Diablo. From now on we'll just call this game a roguelike because it's just more handy.Cons:- The first level of the first mission, which you're gonna replay a lot of times, is boring with only two enemy types plus the occasional bigger version, healer or miniboss. You need to explore the whole thing to get all the chests and special locations, but it feels empty and uninteresting.****HERE'S A NOTE TO ROGUELIKE DESIGNERS: PUT MOST OF THE VARIETY IN THE EARLIER LEVELS, WE'RE GONNA PLAY THEM THE MOST****- Huge difficulty spike in the second level with the apparition of kamikazes and direct shooters, aggro a few too many monsters and you're completely overwhelmed. Then to have a chance to get used to it you must replay the first boring level.- Grindy. Because of the permanent leveling and permanently upgradeable unlocks, the aforementioned second level is gonna get easier, but only after you restart the game several times. But then, the first level is gonna be even more boring because it presents even less of a challenge. Contrast that to Spelunky and Binding of Isaac where you can never let your guard down even in early levels.****SECOND NOTE TO ROGUELIKE DESIGNERS: PERMANENT STATS PROGRESSION MAKES YOUR GAME GRINDY, STICK TO UNLOCKING NEW STUFF TO FIND WITHIN RUNS.****- Your max range is not well-defined, at its edge it can look like projectiles hit enemies but they don't. Thankfully there's always a sound for successful hits.- The items that change how you shoot are limited-use. That means you'll be shooting the same boring projectile most of the time. You can't even save them for when you really need them, as they instantly replace your default shot.- You get lots of items but they don't have the same impact as in Binding of Isaac or Spelunky, most give you either 5 to 10% passive buffs or one-use effects.- System for combining items sounds interesting at first, but it simply puts the characteristics of two items on one. So no Shin Megami Tensei demon combining here, it just means backtracking to free up an inventory slot: boring.- Enemies spawn as you move, and if you're moving towards the bottom of the screen, that means super close to you. Good luck if those are kamikazes. At least there's a sound to warn you of it, but I think the game would've been better with a Torchlight/Diablo-like enemy placement.Pros:+ Great music+ Good controls, I like the mouse-driven shooting+ Nice graphics and theme+ Classes (gods) play very differently+ Many items to find and unlock+ From an initial look, good variety of environments and bosses+ The effects of items can be creative and funny: giant chicken, disco ball and so on.+ Daily generated dungeon which you can try and then compare your score to the community.I'll revise my evaluation if I play it again and it feels more fun, but so far I don't feel like going back to it... bad sign.

												One of my favorite steam games. It has beautiful graphics and intuitive controls. There is a huuuuge variety of loot with amazing effects such as opening a blackhole in enemies or having enemies fight for you. You can even combine loot.There are many gods that you can unlock giving you special powers, you can find many shrines and make risky deals.There are various large level layouts with unique event levels (check out my screenshots) and shops and there are secrets. The game is hard and addictive. You will have to grind it a bit, but it's really fun. Love the passive staff bonuses and masks!			"

												It's times like this that make me wish our choices were ""yes,"" ""no,"" and ""maybe if it's on a really good sale because paying full-price for this game is like paying twenty dollars for a snack-sized bag of Doritos.""The setting is nifty, but nothing else really stands out.It's a roguelite that doesn't pick up after a few hours, and the actual gameplay is more like a twin-stick shooter with upgrades. Some people might compare it to Binding of Isaac, but I've put dozens of hours into Isaac and still enjoy it—I was bored of this one in less than five hours.			"

												This game is not perfect, is not unique and is not for everyone, but if you like the genre, you'll like this game.Why could you like it?Roguelite: It's hard, you start, you die, you ask god why, god doesn't answer so you start again.Death doeasn't reset everything, you can permanently power you up inbetween runs, this makes it grindy, and a little frustrating the first times when you can't accomplish much.Top-down twin-stick shooter: Finely crafted, but if you don't like that kind of gameplay you won't like this.Variety: Passive and active items and powerups for you characters, enemies, scenarios and so on. ""Challanges of the day""s add up to this!Coolness.Conclusions:This game is fun.

												As a roguelike game with gradual unlocks, I want to like this game.  That right there should make for an easy starting point for success.Unfortunately, I just can't quite seem to do it.The overall gameplay is all right, but not amazing.  Repetitively shoot stuff, pick up some temporary loot, repeat a bunch, eventually get to an exit.Repeat this several times, occasionally throwing in a large boss (same basic shooting, deals a lot more damage, you may or may not have gotten a chance to heal beforehand).  There's stuff to buy within the mission, but rarely does it feel like it matters.  You can unlock some new skill sets and costumers for your guy, but once again, it just doesn't feel that impactful.  And that right there is kind of the core flaw for Full Mojo Rampage... very little that you do ever feels like it matters.End result - unimpressive repeitive gameplay, coupled with little feeling of lasting progress.  Give it a pass.			"

												This charming game is very well developed rogue-like game. If you are a lover of Rogulike games, just buy it. This game is near ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ perfect.  As the game's title say Full Mojo Rampage is Rogue-like games with playable voodoo characters in Vodoo reality. There is 8 playable character and need medals to unlock them (10 medal each). Each voodoo character has their own special abilities. Also you can unlock pins while playing the game and then you can use them to get some special buffs to your health/damage etc. There are some blessing which is limited to use (one time only actually) and requires medals.  What I explained is our character and stats screen. You can change your character, select pins and blessings and one more thing that you can level up and upgrade your stats (health,speed,fire rate,damage etc). You can only return to your character screen when you died via Exit. Full Mojo Rampage is not really a friendly game but you used to play it - it becomes to get easier. Anyway, as i said it's not friendly at the first times, but after some time you collect gold, you got exp then die, then return to menu, upgrade - unlock something and clear the quest. There is only 4 quest and different modes Survival Unlimited / Daily Quest / Night Of The Dead Spirits. Main 4 quest are includes 4-5 levels and some side quests with Vendor and Shrine level. You can buy something ingame or upgrade your pins/blessings later. Also there is some relics which is wearable.  You can unlock different game difficulties when finished a quest. There is more than 5 different difficulty for game and they're type of tumor and if you think that game is easy on current normal mode, play them, they are zero percent friendly. Gameplay and goal is simple. You have wands, ranged. You can get different wands but they have charge. This game contains lot of enemy and boss types, it is good for a rogue-like game btw. Goals for clearing the level is basically like that ; There is two portal, destroy them or Find rums (hidden in the barrels)...  And at last I want to talk about graphics and level design. Good enough, nuff said.4 Quests, dozens type of levels, dozens of unlockables... Maybe a little short but worth the money. This game does have replayability value with different modes and difficulties, which means they are extends the game's length.81/100			"

												If you didn't think there was enough ""Gauntlet"" in ""Gauntlet"", you should probably invest in this. I will mention Gauntlet rather a lot in this ""review"", btw.The first point, and it's a reasonably large one, that this game scores over Gauntlet is that it has genuinely random (thus replayable ad inifinitum*) levels and a fairly expansive character customization section make this a far more worthwhile purchase. Gauntlet promised randomised, limitless levels and failed to deliver, preferring instead to rotate a level through 180degrees or make you do them ""the opposite way round"" (from start to finish in a 'death' level, for example). It's obvious, woeful and does nothing to hide the fact that you're always playing from a small group of levels that can easily be remembered, no matter what way round they are.There are also more ""world types"" than in Gauntlet. The player upgrade system is somewhat similar but, again, full mojo rampage has a better one. There's more to spend your ingame currency on and the prices of everything gets quite high so you need to take time to find cash. This isn't annoying, however. Also, found items can be sold in the shops ingame, which produces a lot of extra cash. Item drops are random and there are a LOT of different items that you can find. You can also mix together 2 items to get a single item with all the effects of the 2 individual ones. This is a fun way to make interesting ""charms"" to equip and also an interesting way to cause a sort of ""inventory game"" to arise, wherein the player must decide what stuff to keep/dump in favour of potentially more useful items. You can also expand your inventory, too, so it's possible to carry more. I liked this aspect of the game as, again, it adds another random dimension to things that makes each playthrough different. I've put a fair amount of time into the game and I still find it fun to go back and play more. Also, I have yet to complete all of the levels on ""hardcore"" difficulty, which requires a more levelled up character. I think, beyond that, there's ""nightmare"" or ""insane"", something like that, so there's plenty of reason to return and play more*. I will be trying to finish all the levels at all skills and will probably wind up doing so at some point. I see this definitely as a game I can return to in future as I've enjoyed it and it does a lot of things that I, personally, like in games.Some people have said this is tough but I think it's reasonably easy, it's far easier to solo than Gauntlet, for example, which is easy enough but you have to adhere to a plan/play style to get through. You have much more option to just ""muck around"" in full mojo rampage, as a result of the levels being more open and monsters spawning/wandering randomly instead of coming from ""summoning stones"" in closed rooms (another bad point about the new version of gauntlet).Finally, it's not really a roguelike, tbh. There's a lot of games called Roguelikes these days but I would say this has much more in common with something like Gauntlet or Alien Syndrome. Neither of which are roguelikes. Unless you count Gauntlet 4. People seldom do, despite it being by far the best version (genesis cart, have a look if you like Gauntlet). HOWEVER, I did play one game where I was transported to a random dungeon that was made of ascii and I had to fight various ""G"" and ""M"" symbols. This was excellent and I would probably play the whole game in this manner if the option existed. There are some nice little diversions like this in the game. As I've mentioned, you're never quite sure what's going to pop up and, for this reason and the others above, I rate this as a really good and fun game.The online works well, too.*If you enjoy the premise and play style of the game, of course.

												""While not quite as frantic as Super Smash TV, Full Mojo Rampage’s Roguelite features help prolong its expected gameplay length as there are only four quests to undertake. The most egregious issue however, is the general lack of an online community in a game that would have heavily benefited from it, made even worse by an incomplete local co-op option.

												Very fun.  Seems like a somehow mix of Burn Zombie Burn and Torchlight.  Each chapter takes your saved character (attack rate, health, speed and damage points) through each challenge with an empty backpack.  You have to see what magic tools you can find and if you can adapt to use them.  Each chapter has around 5 or 6 levels to pass.  You unlock pins and masks and stuff for your saved character.  The challenges are fun and a little silly, while the monsters are creative.  Just fun.			"

												This game pleasantly suprised me.It plays similarly to games like binding of issac or nuclear throne, being a top down shooter with a large inclusion of roguelike elements. The gameplay involves doing a variety of differing quests in order to complete levels, while collecting items to make yourself more powerful. Some examples inclide destroying the summon pillars, collect x amount of items, and destroying waves of enemies quickly to weaken a boss. Combat is that of a twinstick shooter, focusing on movement while attacking surrounding enemies. Each level is procedually generated, and the player progresses over a world map aiming to reach the end through beating each stage. Death in the game without special items requires the player to start over in the chapter. In online co-op the players have a shared pool of 3 lives, but if that pool runs out, then they lose.There are various classes in game which each have their own unique abilities and rampage effects. The beginning class has dodging, a sort of fire mortar, and the rampage involves summoning an ally to your aid. Later examples include the ability to summon stationary totems to deal damage, or sacrificing ones own health to deal damage. The inclusion of the class abilities gives a reliable way to deal with challenges without having to worry about your luck being down, and gives the player a fairer chance to survive without item drop luck being a trouble(compared to other games of the type)The game includes more customization then just class though, also including various unlockable and upgradable pins which modify starting stats, many unlockable masks (for visual difference only), and a levelling system which gives minor stats through leveling. (Though this same leveling also is required to unlock use of the pins). The leveling so far hasn't seemed to imbalance the game, as it has remained difficult throughout. As well, it includes a variety of difficulty levels which unlock as you beat each chapter. Each difficulty level seems to add more hazards, as the one right after the normal difficulty makes enemies harder, whlist adding a chance for enemies to drop bombs after death (and there are about 3-5 more difficulties after that).There are many items in FMR, with a variety of upgrades, weapons, and consumables. There are about 12 weapons, each weapon with a unique projectile. Each weapon not only has the base projectile type such as a beam or a boomerang style poison cloud, but also includes randomly chosen bonuses, including extra projectiles, bonue damage, and extra charges. Though each weapon has a certain amount of ammo before it runs out, each weapon can be stored in the inventory for later use. All relics and inventory items can be swapped out for others at any time for other ones, though as well the player is limited to a max of 5 relics and 5 inventory items after obtaining upgrades (the player starts with base 2 relics and base 3 inventory). Relics (also known as mojo's) are the primary items for upgrading your character. Their effects vary from the base mojo giving base stat upgrades such as health, damage, crit chance, or a percent chance of a homing missle, to the unique mojo's which give larger bonuses as well as unique effects, such as heal on critical hit, or enemies summoning a black hole on death. The inventory can hold weapons, relics (for later use) and usable/consumable items. Usable items are more often one use only, but others have a timed recharge. The inventory items have a large variety, with such items as a temporary spread shot potion, a disco ball that distracts enemies, a pipe which summons an allied cannon or kamakazee pack, and a passive knife which permanently buffs you once you land the killing blow on four elite enemies. There are also coins for shop items and pin upgrades, and tokens for unlocking classes and masks. A feature which does bother me a little is the fact that coins are continuous between games, meaning that players can purchase all of the items they want after upgrading all of their pins, and don't have to worry about money like in games such as issac. I'd rather prefer that coins be added up into an upgrade bank after each run, but have each run start off with no money.Enemy variety is fairly big. Though each stage only has a certain amount of differing enemies, there are many stages to choose from, such as swamps, lava pits, caves, dungeons, and pipe ridden distilleries, each with different enemies. Each stage also features background secrets which grant items, and each stage has their own different looking secret (though a little more variety in the secrets for each stage would be appreciated). Not only is there a variety of base levels, but as you go through each chapter, a larger variety of quests and areas are given, and though the first chapter may lack in some variety in quests at first, progressing certainly causes the game to open up. The game also features boss encounters which do seem to change in some encounters, but since I've played some chapters more then otherss, I don't know which have changing encounters. Nonetheless, the bosses were challenging and fun, and each one functioned differently.Aside from the main levels, there are also side areas accesible from the map, such as shops, mojo mixers, shrines, and challenges, all with very different ways of functioning. The shops are what you would expect, allowing one to buy and sell items. The mojo mixer is a unique area of incredible value, which allows the player to combine two mojos (upgrade relics) into one upgrade, saving precious upgrade slots, and allowing one to equip more relics. The shrines have a variety of effects, some being purely positive, while others end up being more risk/reward. The possible effects of the shrine depend on the class the player chooses, and in online co-op, all of the different players classes are chosen from for the possible shrine effects. As well, in online co-op, shrine reward items are distributed depending on how many players there are, so that other players don't get left out. The challenges are varied as well, ranging from destroying a mini boss in someones nightmare, to fighting off enemy skeletons to defend friendly zombies.Right now there are only base 4 chapters, a survival mode, unlimited survival, and a generated daily quest (similar to spelunky). Each chapter is procedually generated in both the selected map layout, and the individual stages, and though I haven't yet tried it, I would assume the survival would include some sort of random elements as well. Though 4 chapters doesn't seem like a lot, they have taken quite a bit of time to get through, plus  I haven't yet tried variety of other difficulties, or the survival mode. As well, if you enjoy the leaderboard focused daily challenges in something like spelunky, then the daily challenge will likely interest you.I haven't tried the local co-op, so I cannot speak for whether or not it is very different from the online co-op, but the online co-op is a blast, though some of the mechanics may put some off. Players have a shared 3 life pool, and once a single player dies after they are all lost, the the run is lost. As well, players must revive eachother when they fall. A player can obtain other ways of revival, but there is no way to regain shared lives to my knowledge. Players must share items they come across, including weapons, upgrades, items, and coins. I personally like this fact, as it ecourages a team sharing of items to help with other players builds, but there are a few downsides. The inventory and relic upgrade slots at the time of typing cannot be dropped, and players can accidentally pick them up, even if they have reached the maximum for that slot type. As well, coins are not shared, and cannot be dropped. Overall, it's a wonderful game in my opinion. I absolutely reccomend it.			"

												I am not trying to be harsh.  This game has a few good points but also there are some major flaws that I have experienced in my first half hour of playing.  I will first elucidate the good, and then the bad.Good:- Its a pretty game.  Fairly unique style of graphics.  -Seems fun enough. Its nice to collect things and it seems like there is a decent bit to unlock.-Has online multiplayer.Bad:-Erases game progress.  In my first play session I got to level 2.  My second play sessions I beat level 2 and unlocked a new item.  There is no way to equip items without first going to the main menu, so i quit (the game is supposed to auto save) equipped the item, and loaded my game back.  It put me back to level 1.  Keep in mind that moments before when I had loaded the game it had me on level 2, so this is not a case of the game simply not saving.  It ERASED the progress that I had made days previously.  This is a huge error that needs to be fixed before I will spend 1 more minute on this game.-Too similiar to other games.  The voodoo theme is kinda fresh but other than that the game just plays like a tired twin stick shooter.  The controls feel clunky and the special attacks have terrible accuracy so you are forced to rely on your pathetic normal firing mode.  Kinds feels like a diablo III with worse graphics, worse controls, and way less content.-like I mentioned above, the user interface is poor, forcing you to retreat to the main menu in order to equip a new item.  This is a bad system, or a terrible oversight in the game design.-Zero online community.  I waited 20 minutes to find one game, hit refresh several times and no games at all.  Thought it might be better with some co-op action.Overall:If the game erasing bug were fixed, if there was an online community, and if the controls were a tad tighter I might recommend this game.  Right now however, I feel that there are plenty of roguelikes to choose from that are better than this one.  Nothing is particularly wrong with this game (besides haivng progress erased) but there is also nothing that sets this one apart.  These are the reasons that I would not recommend this game.			"

												I recommend this game; I feel that it's a well made rogue-lite.How does it play?It plays like a twin stick shooter, you have something of a top-down view of the game world and control a little character with wasd by default and use the mouse to aim and shoot (when playing with a 360 pad it used the analog sticks just fine). You can use two magic spells (determined by which parent Loa you selected before starting your session) that work on a cooldown system; there is no mana management. There are randomized loot drops and randomized levels born from themed tile sets. The gameplay is real-time; the world will not pause when the player(s) stop moving. Online co-op supports up to 4 players. While death is assured, your little character will keep experience points that allow them to increase their stats upon leveling up. Gold is also kept, and is mainly used to upgrade your voodoo pins (think of them as traits you can select before each quest; these can include increased health, damage, starting off with an extra inventory space, etc.). Gold can also be used to buy things should you come across a shop while playing. You will become innately stronger as you continue playing, which means that progression is essentially repeating the quest until it becomes easy enough to complete. Don't mistake this for boring grind though, I feel that the randomization in stage layout and treasure drops works quite well in varying up each playthrough. Once a quest has been completed, you will unlock the next quest as well as an elevated difficulty version of the recently completed quest. There are multiple difficulties to beat; these arent just stat increases for the enemies, but also a variation in the types of enemies that spawn and unique modifiers such as enemies dropping bombs on death or having golden bullets that kill in one hit. I think there is plenty of replayability.The visuals are quite nice, as are the aesthetics for the different levels. The enemies look decent enough, but I feel they aren't as inspired as they could have been. Most of your time is spent fighting either zombies, skeletons, giant spiders, or evil shamans. Yes, they are fitting, this is a game themed around voodoo after all, but more imaginative enemies would have been fun to encounter. The mobs you'll be spending the most time with either run straight at you, or spit out projectiles in your general direction. There is a bit of enemy variation though, some hop around and send out a spiral of harmful bolts each time they land, and one is a train of common mobs that conga-line their way off walls like that old school dvd splash screen, but overall they're just 'eh'. Boss encounter are pretty much upsized trash mob encounters; they'll spit out projectiles for some bullet-hell type gameplay, bounce around the stage, or just move at you to hurt you.There is a wave survival gamemode of the endless or 30-round variety, and a pvp mode with deathmatch, team deathmatch, koth or ctf. There is also a watered-down local co-op mode. The 3 joining players will play as ghosts of the main character without the magic spells or inventories; they cannot equip their own loot.All in all, I think it's worth the money & time. It's fun and there's plenty of content, with the devs stating they're totally into adding more. Some parting advice for co-op though, play with people you know or organize a like-minded group. The loot drops aren't instanced for each player and, being the internet, one person could easily horde all the stuff.EDIT: A patch has added the option for gold & voodoo pin items to be instanced for each player.I dig this game, and if the info & opinions I've shared don't put you off, I think you would too.

												Actually a good game. My expectations were pretty low since I think I got it in an indie bundle and never heard about it before. Not as frustrating as a proper roguelike since you keep your levels and abilities. Randomly generated levels and a ton of items to both collect and unlock keep it interesting. Graphics and sound are great. There's also coop but I think people only play this game with friends.			"

												8.5/10.My reasons are: I have never enjoyed a game of this genre very much. Until this day. It is quite addictive, every death and failure you experience makes you want to beat the string of dungeons more. It has a great mini-shop theme to it, in most dungeons there are two shops. #1 is just a general store type thing, allowing you to buy a randomized four items. #2 is a place that allows you to merge two items together. That is a really nice touch and I love the idea! The stat system I found quite good. It included all of the basic information I believe a game in similar style needs, although I do wish the stat system would be more consistent and/or more dependent on stats. Sometimes you get low level to medium level items and other you get high level to godlike level items. It doesn't happen often, but when it does I would consider calling your character overpowered. But, it isn't that much of an issue. Onto the music, graphics and storyline; The music is spot-on. I have no criticisms there! The graphics were also well done, style and otherwise! Things like rain were a nice tough indeed. Now, storyline... It has a small part in the game, and is mostly apparent at the starting cinematic. Bits and pieces are glimpsed rarely in-game. There is a lot of un-used potential there. Possibly another game mode? From what the cinematic and in-game things you do see, I can see no flaws. Tallying up the scores!- Basic stat system (+1 | Could have gotten a +2.5)- Music (+2.5)- Graphics (+3)- Storyline (+2 | Could have gotten a +3.5)A grand total of 8.5 out of 10!(Did I miss anything? Leave a comment! I recommend this game, grab a copy definitely! Thanks for reading. Steam is only saying I have spent 5 hours in the last two weeks. Keep in mind I played this for 5 hours today.)~ Galen.			"

												I picked the game up when it still was in early access and I regret nothing. It's a fun rogue like in the style of binding of isaacs with lots of unlocks, mask and secrets to discover. It runs and looks great, provides online multiplayer support and is in general quite polished. The difficulty can be tough from time to time and each chapter can also be replayed with a harder difficulty setting. Your character progress throughout the game even if you die in a chapter and with the collected gold you can unlock new stuff you can start your next run with.

												I observed this game for a long time before buying it and after buying all i could think of, was the time lost waiting.This game is damn legit. It reminds of Alien swarm. Top view action rpgish, where you choose a character from a couple unique 1s (you gota unlock them by playing a bit with the basic one) and build him via items and equips. Its in this new genre, where you play untill you die so you can upgrade and start stronger. (rogue legacy, ftl, magicite, etc(its easier than those games)) You have only a few buttons to press but in no way do you feel lacking or without options. Its actually really well made. Characters are unique and eventhough upgrades and levels seem small (in fractions) they add up really fast, taking into account the style of play.Its original, lore wise (pretty cool and well researched voodoo background (though turned into something cheerful and funny lol)) Its well made, responsive and intense. Levels are interesting and fit accordingly with whats expected from the player.its a 8/10 for sure. Definetly a game worth its price and garanteed action. For those who enjoyed alien swarm, dungeon siege or other similar titles, this game is a must.			"

												Full Mojo Rampage is an excellent twin stick shooter - i.e. it has a similiar control structure, and top down view as Binding of Isaac but that's where the similiarities end.  actually even aiming on mouse is differant in both games and voodoo lets you do your shooting in more directionsWell, the game puts you in the heels of some crazy voodoo midget dude (with his own warddrobe of unlockable designer voodoo masks) and has you running for your life through differant chapters each consisting of a veriety of levels to explore, killing all in your path; while all the time collecting xp, gold,  consumables (such as potions and wands which give some great firepower like the exploding chicken nuggets wand) and the main loot items 'Mojo Badges', these orbs of voodoo bad-assness can increase your stats or give you cool crap like homing missiles & crowd control proccs, while others are re-usable and generally provide you with an awesome new spell, there's even ones that send you to little mini-missions that will give you a permannet buff after killing x number of elites and such - a lot of thought has gone into these badges to give the upgrades a fresh feel, ive seen them change them so many times during early access which was kinda kinder surprise fun cause they got cooler each time. You have 4-5 slots to carry all these lovely things around at the begining, but there's even drops that increase your item slots allowing you to carry more power. not to mention a mojo mixer altar where you can combine 2 Mojo Badges into 1 while keeping all the stats in a purple epic glowThe game has perma death (eek!) but the xp, gold and medals collected during the game last through your demise, allowing you to purchase more skill points - you also level up and get stronger the more you play, there is an afterlife for stats so its a rogue-liteThe developers have added veriety everywhere. Chapter are differant from each other each containing its own unique level bioms and missions (some are straight up kill everything, some involve finding items, theres a death labrynth maze level + more. the level layout is randomly generated), There's no ordinary class selection. In the voodoo world your 'class' is determined by which diety you choose to follow. Each of these dieties called 'Loa's' have ugly faces and award you with two unique active spells and one special passive skill. each deity also randomly spawns a unqiue consumable drop for you during play (some heal u, some do damage etc), and instead of skill trees you have upgradable voodoo pins; of which there are a lot, but you can only carry 2 at the begining, but you're able to carry more as you level up (i think i have 4 pin slots at lvl 11). you can mix and match your Loa skills with either healer pins or dps pins or cc pins to see which works for which play styleThere's also a good variety of enemies to kill, and loads of stuff to find, upgrade and loot! The controls are tight (I use a xbox pad, its excellent for this), the soundtrack is fitting and the gameplay is difficult enough so that youll need to level up and replay each chapter few times before being able to beat it. The game is also very polished - running smooth since alpha, so smooth i forgot it wasnt released yet. A multiplayer mode was also added close to release - which i still havent tried, was determined to finish the single player first. all-in-all a charming indie shooter that oozes its own fresh voodoo character. Awesome rogue lite action. good times^^ - a big wet and warm thumbs up for this game! one of my favourites			"

												I, for one, continue to welcome our Neo-Roguelike caretakers (ALL WILL BOW BEFORE THE MIGHT OF THE HEGONOMY OF DARK SOULS CLONES).First things first. Yes, Full Mojo Rampage *is* like that Binding Of Isaac game. In that same way that BoI is like Berserk; Improved upon in virtually every way. It's like if Blizzard decided to put their unique, super-effective pass of polish and gloss on a BoI game.- The Mojo/Relic/Inventory system is a nice 'tactical balance' constant decision spot for the player to get caught up in, as are shops at which you can buy AND sell, and the Mojo Mixer, which lets you meld 2 individual powerups into a dual (cannot be melded further).- All Character Classes can be unlocked just by expending 10 Medallions (used to purchase Masks/Classes/Playthrough Bonuses), which are reasonably easy to find (can easily find 10 in a decent run - not even a good run). The Classes themselves have a good amount of playstyles represented, with the exception of a melee (although there is a close range / melee-esque class).- There are Persistent Systems for Player Level (each level you can upgrade one Stat slightly) and Gold, which can be spent in shops, or spent on upgrading persistent ""Pins"", which provide bonuses to your character such as extra inventory slots, more health or damage or critical chance, faster spell cooldowns, a chance to poison or slow enemies, etc. (you can carry 1-5 pins with you (Player level dependent) of the 25 or so available). Pins drop randomly during gameplay (I have yet to find a duplicate, but I still have 4 or so to find).- The level layout is randomized, as is the order or appearance of levels in the 'overworld map', for an extra layer of difference in each playthrough. Different Acts (Quests) have a very different base layout (in particular, Exploration Time Before Boss Fight decreases as you advance through the Quests).- Uses the same Elite Monster paradigm as Isaac/Risk Of Rain (and you know, Diablo/ Titan Quest), but I'm into the 3rd Act, and there definitely are not as many unique Bosses/Sub-Bosses as in Isaac.- Already has native gamepad support and genuinely good graphics (although I actually prefer the mouse aiming to twinstick shooting).- Has 2 Player Local and 4 Player Online Co-Op play (I have not yet sampled these modes)The long and short of this is that Full Mojo Rampage gives me that 'Just one more game' feeling, as well as that pleasant surprise of getting that one item that saves your run, as well as that shock when your stupendously overpowered character dies miserably. Which brings me back around to just one more game.			"

												In short a game that shares mechanics with many popular rogue-likes like The binding of Isaac and Rogue Legacy whilst sport sweet 3D voodoo-esque graphics. Don't understand why it isn't more popular to be honest.Game sports radom-generated(ish) levels that differ in style so they don't bore quickly, every level has shops, crates, secrets and trade-off-items-gamble thingies. Also different mission per level and special event levels, together with a story-esque like mission style. Every level/mission has it's own sets of baddies and bosses which differ in strength.Dying makes you start right back at the start, without losing experience and some permanent items. Masks can be unlocked by finding codes, killing bosses and trading them for medals (which you find whilst playing the game)Starting skills can be unlocked by trading medals and offer differentiating playstyles.

												This is a game that doesn't seem to catch the eye at first. But when you actually play it, every doubt you have about it disappears. It's a lot like Binding of Issac only with an open world feel to it. There are challenges with every few steps you take.  Each storyline level gets harder everytime you beat it, you could call it borderline chaos. You level up your character to increase stats like health, damage, and attack rate to help you along your journey. Different weapons can be obtained, different helpers, and these amazing little gifts known as blessings. This is also a great game to play with friends because as the levels get harder, you're going to need all the help you can get. When you die you start over but you keep all the experience you gained which is a nice little feature. I give this a 9/10			"

												Rating 7.5/10Overview: Twin Stick Rogue-liteThe Good+ 8 characters to choose from each with their own passive and active abilities. Each one plays very differently from one another, encouraging you to try every one. + Multiple passive abilities that you can upgrade and add to your character, .ie. more health, damage, more critical etc. + 4 main scenarios that have their own quests. Each scenario has randomized levels+ 5 difficulty levels that change things dramatically+ Lots of items to collect. Each run is completely randomized in terms of which items you receive +Items include a description so you know how it helps/hurt you+ Survival mode - play against hordes of enemies The AverageTakes a long time to unlock and upgrade everything. The game seems to be designed around grinding. Nothing serious but you may have to grind out a few levels to unlock everything.The Bad-Despite  the randomness of the levels, the game feel very repetitive especially if you are playing single player. After completing the game a few times, there is really no incentive to go back to it. - Multiplayer is dead, this is a game that would seem more fun if you had a co-op partner to play withConclusionDespite its shortcomings, I had fun with my time with the game but I see little reason to go back to it. I would recommend the game only if you're a fan of the rogue genre. "

												More enthousiastic people have made lists of the positive bits so I'll focus on the negatives that stops me from recommending this game.Backpedalling and holding left-click gets old really fast.The game relies too much on chance.( on one occasion, I was given a buff that boosted my attack by 300% but reduced my attack speed. With a beam wand equipped, I pretty much vaporized a boss). On other occasions, you will only find garbage mojos(the standard equips in the game). This also goes with the boss fights because so far theyve been the similar spam-bouncy-attacks-in-a-small-room-and-jump/spin-all-over-the-place where a few rogue hits will finish you off if you didnt luck out and find potions on the way since not even the random shops can be relied on to get them because they often only sell wands and mojos.The monsters often spawn very close to you. In a game where a death means restarting at the beginning of the level and losing your accumulated mojos/buffs, having a suicide bomber appear and blow up in your face is simply silly.The multiplayer is a ghost town.

												Very good and beautiful game.The gameplay is slower (and easier) compared to similar titles like Nuclear Throne or Risk of Rain, but you can permanently upgrade your skills with gold and XP. There are a lot of objects, pins and masks to collect. So you find yourself playing and playing to improve your character build, unlock new skills and find new stuff.Maybe I would change the way the inventory and loot works, as you have all your inventory slots full pretty fast in each game and keep constantly receiving new items that you can't pick anymore and is a bit frustrating. Risk of Rain doesn't have item limit and feels better.The online works lika a charm and the multiplayer is fun, there are 4 quests with 3 levels of difficulty (that are designed to be completed in sequence), daily missions, pvp...I totally recommend the game.

												Ok, so I played a lot since yesterday and now I wanna tell you something about it. First off: The art style and the soundtrack are very good. It all fits together and creates a enjoyable world. You find litte jokes all over the game, which is a really nice touch.There are three things I noticed which are a bit bad:1. If there is a trap between you and an enemie and it activates (for example spikes all over the floor) all the enemies on the other side just stop to run into your direction even though you can still attack them. It's like they don't see you.2. The first boss I encountered was a bit boring. It lacks the randomness I am used to from Binding Of Isaac for example. It is very easy to find a pattern for that boss and overall it did not feel like the boss was heavier than a hord of zombies. 3. The levels itself seem a bit unbalanced. There are parts you rush through in seconds and other parts take a long time, because the miniboss has so much health (but doesn't deal any damage because it is so predictable, again, the litle creatures are far more challening then the bigger ones).But, overall, it makes a lot of fun. Over the time you get new needles, costumes and other stuff which is kind of the class system for the game. I had no chance to test the multiplayer part, but it is a big plus which makes up for the tiny flaws. Would I recommend it? Hell yeah, it is one of the best games since Binding Of Isaac (Non-roundbased action roguelike/lite). I guess this will be enough, got to play it now. :D10/10			"

												Very fun top-down action game. It's a rogue-lite, so it's forgiving when you die, since you unlock new power ups and stuff, as well as occasionally getting a level which will let you increase health, damage, move speed, or attack speed, with the option to respec using gold that you find while playing. There are items called Pins which you unlock by finding them in the game. You can then level them up using gold on the character select screen, which will add various bonuses and buffs  (Chance to slow enemies on hit, extra damage, etc.). Once you unlock a pin, it is permanent, but you can only have a few equipped at a time.You also unlock new Parent Moas, which act as a ""class"", using Medals, again found as you play the game. Each Parent Moa will give you 3 different abilities. One of them is based on a meter, which for some characters will give you an item once it fills, give you various bonuses as it fills, or can be consumed to make an attack stronger. The other 2 abitilities are Active ones, which have various purposes. Some are defensive, some are offensive, and some are supportive (Basically, only for co-op play, or else you're gonna have a bad time.)Along with those, there are one-time buffs which consume a combination of gold and medals. They will last for the entirety of a single quest line. So, basically until you die, quit the game, or beat the final boss of that mission.There are even different fetish masks which you can unlock. Some of them look dumb, some of them look awesome, all about personal preference. They don't give any special bonuses, all just for show. This game is very fun, and only $13. What kind of excuse do you have not to get it?There is just one thing I would love to see, but highly doubt it would be added, and that is some sort melee option, since every attack in the game is ranged.

												This is a real nice gem. It has pretty much all of the features I would enjoy from a game. Replayable levels with randomization, interesting and difficult challenges, character custmization and a bounty of lore. I love the environment in this game, the vodou, the Loa, the Veve's. Its pretty much something I really like. So far there is a good selection of the loa to choose from along with the pins and stats to customize my character. It's even better that some of the loa are designed to be better suited with co-op. I would absolutely love to see more loa  added in like Agaou, a loa which allows a more interesting and completely different gameplay style, with a tinge of adrenaline to keep alive.  I love the shrines. The interaction with actual loa is pretty neat. I would really like it to be a more intriguing conversation. For example denying the gift of loa might anger it and instead provide a debuff. Or maybe instead of simply saying 'yes' or 'no' having to answer some complex question. Its just my thoughts on this, I really enjoy it the way it is though. The way in which every loa I have encountered in a shrine is different in its perception of the player is pretty cool. Bosses are interesting and can be very hard depending on the items you have ran into. The story behind each each quest is minimal and enough for them really. I would not mind a small lore book just cause vodou is cool. The objectives, are also quite simple for the first 2 quests but with the 3rd quest things got a lot more interesting. All in all, I love how this game is turning out so far and would recommed it for both solo and co-op play. Seeing as this is still alpha, its pretty amazing.			"

												Highly recommended. Overall great for an early access game. I haven't tried pvp game modes yet, so this review doesn't pertain to that at all. The main gameplay in FMR is probably best described as a bullet hell style top down shooter, with random rogue-like and rpg elements. The solo and coop game modes are quest based, of which there are currently (as of Alpha 5) 3 quests and 1 survival quest. The quests themselves are randomly generated sequences of random dungeon-like levels and bosses, with other random surprises mixed in. When starting a quest, one starts on a fresh character, so all items and equipment (called relics in FMR) are only kept during this quest. If one dies in the quest, they cannot continue onward and lose all items / relics found during that run. However, players get experience towards level-ups which remain throughout all quest runs, and there are certain stat increasing items called pins that also remain. In this way, many have described it in terms of similar games as a mixture of The Binding of Isaac gameplay with Rogue Legacy style leveling. In my experience so far, I would say the items found during a run are far more important than stat collections from pins and leveling up, so it leans a bit towards the rogue-like side. I'd say it has a nice balance. As for game performance, I have had zero issues in single player; the graphics look great and I have had no frame drops. There was slight lag in online multiplayer coop gameplay, but I think dedicated multiplayer servers are likely in store for a future FMR build, so that may improve. That being the only negative aspect I've yet to encounter, I give this game a thumbs up.Finally I should note the game development team is very active in the game forums, which is a plus.Overall, it is quite a lot of fun in its current state and will probably continue seeing great improvements during its development.

												Writting review isn't my thing, but the word definitly is worth spreading about this little gem.- A very well executed twin stick shooter with rogue-like (-lite ?) elements.- Unique settings with visuals/soundtrack worth of praise.- Wide variety of content at every level (combinations when setting up, items, random events, bosses, ...)On the cons side:- Media coverage, I don't know what happened at release but the total lack of it is why so few play it right now.- Public games are a bit hard to find.TL;DR: This is voodoooo! Get it!			"

												This game is a really good arcade style game with the inluring land of new orleans. you get different masks wich ovbiously makes you look like a complete boss. then theres the voodoo pins and different gods, i prefer agou because you start out with 3 health and battle your way to full. it is fast paced and challenging. so i reccomend it for your soul.

												First of all, I like rogue-likes. i love the idea of roaming thru places to get loots and enhance my character. however most rogue-likes are punishing for me because im not a good gamer. I die a lot. and every death means that you have to go back from the start with no regards on what you've done in the previous playthru.I feel that Full Mojo Rampage was made for me.If you're a gamer who like to play casually, this game is for you. It's true that when you die, you'll go back from the start. But, you also keep the medal and gold you collected from the previous game, as well as XP.Imagine Bindings of Isaac with Torchlight graphic.I love the music, i love the ambience, i love the gameplay that involves you roaming around collecting mojos that will power up your character (and yeah they let you switch mojos anytime as long as you have it in your inventory), finding secrets, and collecting masks which is fun. Also, every playthru will be different with randomly generated map.In the beginning you will select one of the Parent Loa(s) that will grant you passive and active skills. Each of them are different, and there are 8 of them.Definitely gonna recommend this game to everyone!			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Roguelike game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are some resolution sizes.You can play in fullscreen or windowed mode.There is COLOR blind mode.There is a music volume slidebar.There is a sound volume slidebar.You can play with a controller. (recommended)There is Controller vibration. :DYou are able to customize your controls on the keyboard. Not on the controller!You can play online with your friends. No Port-forwarding required.About the game.You can choose different voodoo persons and each has their own abilities, powers and effects.You can have different masks, different pins to become better at something.  You play with a voodoo guy in a level, searching for loot and completing other quests. The game is topview and you fight against some mini-bosses. Killing enemies will grant you some experience, gold and maybe they drop an item. You are able to fuse an item together if you have 2 pieces of an item at least. (Doesn't matter if they are different). That will make it stronger and it will save you a slot. When playing with someone else, the lives are shared. The music and graphics are very good.Game could be difficult and you may die quickly.The game is very enjoyable.There are a higher difficulty settings on that chapter that you have completed.There are a couple of chapters.Mini-map at the toprightYou can play the game Local Co-opYou are able to reset your stats or even delete your savegame.Other things.Alot of fun, and i truly recommend this. I have played the game with my ex gf before and we both really enjoyed it. We have played the game for a couple of months.-------------------I Give this game a 8/10			"

												If you could mix Torchlight style ""ranged action RPG"" gameplay/graphics with the roguelike style of Binding of Isaac, you might end up with Full Mojo Rampage.  I've had nothing but a fun time playing this game so far.You start out on a world map akin to super mario games, you select an area to go to and after/if you beat that one the paths leading to the next area(s) are unlocked.I played using xbox one/360 controller but I see it has native support for PS3 controllers and mouse/keyboard gameplay.  It is a twin-stick game where you move with the left stick and aim your attacks with the right stick.The world map is semi-randomized in that the 'story' levels are laid out in the same order but the paths and branching rooms/events are randomized each playthrough.   The levels themselves are also randomized so the game is never the same twice.It has the mechanics where your character starts out weak, but as you collect experience points and coin/medal drops from slain enemies, these carry over to your next playthrough when you inevitably die.   You get to choose to increase health/damage/movementspeed/attackspeed each time you level up from experience points.   You spend gold upgrading ""permanent"" items you find in the world, of which you get to choose to use a limited selection of on each playthrough.You start out playing only one style of character (your ""Loa"" (voodoo god?)) determines the ability set that you use during that playthrough.   As you kill enemies, find secrets, open treasure chests you get items called 'Mojos' which add (for that playthrough only) various bonuses to your character (such as a % chance to fire a homing missile out of your wand, or +% bonus healing, or +health on kill, etc).  You start out with a few slots to put these items in, as you play you unlock or gain extra slots through various means.  You can also combine these Mojos together if you get lucky and find a room that allows you to do so, which adds the two items' bonuses together in one item, allowing you to add more Mojos to a now empty slot.Each 'world map' leads to a boss fight, where if you complete it you go on to the next section.  Each level seems a bit tougher, so you don't get very far at first.   I've played the game for several hours now and it looks like I have a looooong way to go yet.  There is a daily quest to do to compare yourself to others and see how well you do.Very fun game, hard to put down, recommended for sure!			"

												I'm the first to admit that my patience with action games has severely declined the last few years. The older I get, the less I want to play them. But when I see a beautiful game like Full Mojo Rampage out there, I'm compelled to try it. Sometimes I find something I like.Sometimes I find a game like Full Mojo Rampage that I can't wait to uninstall.Full Mojo looks cute but looks are deceiving. I simply found this way too hard (or the controls aren't explained well enough). Started game, first room...dead. Respawn...dead. Respawn...dead. Respawn....dead. Respawn...dead. Yeah, this is fun. Not. Uninstalled.I know it's trendy to make games hard nowadays. But there's no reason for anyone to create a game where the player dies repeatedly in the tutorial or the first area. It's simply not an enjoyable experience. It's unnecessarily frustrating. This isn't supposed to be Dark Souls.I truly love the art style (or what I saw of it). Whomever is the artist really deserves some praise. But I'm sorry devs, you need to do a MUCH better job of creating a tutorial and an area where players can learn how to play your game. This happens occasonally with indie type developers - they get so used to playing their own creation they don't realize that the balance is incredibly off for other gamers and frankly your offering isn't compelling enough to make me want to deal with trying to figure it out. In short, you may have created a good game but it sucks because you don't give new players any idea how to play it.			"

												I've played this game for about 2 hours now and I can say that I freaking love it, the art style is amazing, brings the game out in a way no other developer could, next we have the pickups ( items ), I laughed so hard when I picked up a wand that shot exploding chicken nuggets, now leading on to the Character customization, you have about 20 masks to choose from, each of which has a good ability in game, the pins you can pick are pretty nice, they give you that small boost that you might just need, and if you're actually looking for a challenging game on Steam, I prefer this one, you can die pretty easily so it's kinda rewarding to get to the end of that level and keep rolling, As for the Loa's, these things are your best friends when you're playing, you have to keep killing and killing though, it takes a lot of killing in game to summon a Loa, so make sure you have your damage and rate of fire spells equipped if that's your primary objective. Now let's talk about the level randomization, it's 100% perfection, especially if you're going to play online with a person that has just bought the game, you'll experience that same feeling the person feels, excitement. Now heading on to the Shrines, here's the more that I think you should improve on, the Shrines can be REALLY rewarding at some times, but some of their spells are either too much or too little, like when you sacrifice -50% max health for more speed, I honestly think you could tone the speed down just a little bit, just my opinion, now let's move on to the gameplay itself, it has a few flaws but I see great potential in modes like Multiplayer, these flaws consist of only one thing that I've seen happen, I do not know if this is supposed to be a part of the game or not, but I will try to cast the fire bomb spell with the rmb and instead of the way my cursor is facing, it will shoot in the direction of what my Shaman is facing. So there's that. Overall I think this game should be a lot more popular on Steam, not to many games see my attention in the way that this game has, I would recommend this to anyone who plays The Binding Of Isaac to this game, it kinda has the same mechanic, die and you start over, but the way this game is built just makes it take a step foward infront of all the others, I honestly think that you should add Local Co-Op to this game though, seeing as that the Steam Machine is coming out, this would probably be the best couch co-op on Steam when the machine comes out. So bringing this review to a close, you like Voodoo, kicking ♥♥♥ in spooky graveyards, summoning a Loa that could ravage the countryside, and randomly generated maps for a new way to repeat that before said process? Get this game, it's damn well worth 15$			"

												Truthfully, this is a good game. A topdown-shooter Rouge-like that allows multiplayer that doesn't take away from the expirence (and truthfully, it makes the game better in a few ways at least), and you need to play through the game (regardless of death or not) a few times to get stronger and more powerful so you can get farther along in the game. There are a few things about it that make it a little weird, like the fact your inventory will only upgrade to 6 slots max, no matter how many pack pick-ups you collect. As others have said, it is a little high in price, but on sale, it's a good buy.			"

												Much fun and frustration will be had in this addicting voodoo inspired rogue-like rpg.Gameplay and mechanics are much like binding of Isaac with an RPG twist.  The difficulty is also on par, if not greater than BoI.  In most cases, you will die in 3-4 hits on regular difficulty level.The artstyle and humor are both unique and quaint.  The music is okay but gets repetitive at times.Unfortunatley the grinding stories are true - you will spend at least 2 hours gaining levels and unlocking pins so that you're strong enough to finally beat the first stage.There's also a limited online playerbase(for now) so you will be soloing most of this game unless you grab some friends.Overall - 8/10			"

I rushed endgame with glasscannon build, and the endboss cannot be beaten without significant regen or a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of potion.Also the game UI is broken. If you go downwards you are boned completly.

												7/10.An entertaining Rogue-like random loot generator, which rewards finesse and punishes losing concentration.Best when played with friends. [ + ]  The rogue-like nature of this game is satisfying, and the item drops are gratifying. The developers really honed in on players' psychological desire to collect MORE SHINY LOOOT! Each time you started a new quest, or restarted that quest, your inventory was wiped completely clean, so you had the pleasure of putting together another collection of items and powerups. There were enough character customisation options before you even started search for the loot. Good variety of enemies and mechanics. [ - ]  Getting strong gear was too important, in order to win. Too dependent on drops Pre-dungeon load out was inadequate in overcoming bad luck on item drops. Lack of control Campaign is not long enough. (After 10+ hours theres nothing to do but survival waves) For a game that bases its appeal around getting cool loot, it would have been much more satisfying to get to keep some of that loot.I'm told that this is no longer being updated, but my recommendation to the developers would be make this game a more solid playing experience; by reducing the item dependency. I would suggest to drop the item stats by around 30%, and make it so that you can take 1 or 2 relics with you on to the next quest. It's so hard to part with my shiny loot, especially when I know that I could go two maps without finding anything in the next quest "

												Full Mojo RampageFull Mojo Rampage is an odd little game. I say “little” but it is in fact quite vast. It’s still an in-development title, but what is present already would make for a full game in its own right very easily. Early access games usually give me a little bit of pause, but I took a chance on this one based on the art and gameplay style and thus far I have certainly not come away disappointed. Let’s jump right in shall we?To begin with, I’ll cover the art style. It’s dark, it’s adorable, and quite frankly it fits with the overall game exceedingly well. It has an eerie way of feeling cheerful yet depressing at the same time. It’s quite a feat to have pulled off. There’s not much else to be said other than that it is beautiful and makes the game that much more enjoyable to play.Now to the meats of the game! The delicious Voodoo filled meats. Full Mojo Rampage is a loot-filled monster crushing extravaganza. It’s a roguelike at heart and doesn’t apologize for that very often. It does make a few concessions here and there but it does little to detract from the overall difficulty level in the grand scheme of things. You play as a little Voodoo avatar with one of several Gods chosen that determines your power set. Differences between them are fairly substantial with some focusing on a support role while others bring out the damage dealing mage archetype in you. The game is designed to be played cooperatively with up to four people, so the variety and tactical options are very intriguing.At its heart, Full Mojo Rampage is an isometric dungeon runner. You accept a quest, the game randomly generates the world it takes place in, and you go about your merry way, Voodooing anything and everything standing in your path. Along the way you will collect one-shot items as well a gold that may be used for permanent items to boost your statistics. It’s a tried and true formula that holds up very well in the setting, with a couple of tweaks along the way. The first is that death is permanent. When you die, you are tossed back to the main menu and required to start anew. However, you do not have to start from scratch. Instead you retain your gold and experience and can use those to upgrade yourself or unlock a new God to attempt the quest with. It adds a considerable amount of replay value to the game. It may still be in early access, but the amount of content is still substantial and it will only get better as development continues.So is it worth your time and money? That’s a decision that’s on you, as always. If you have friends to play with or don’t mind random games on the internet, and you happen to enjoy the action-oriented gameplay, it’s easily worth the current asking price. However, if you intend to play it alone or you’re not into Diablo-like games, this one may be something to pass up. It’s possible single player, but not designed to be played in that fashion and may discourage you. Take a look, do some research on top of this review, and decide for yourself! Just keep the difficulty in mind and don’t be disappointed. "

												This game is fantastic! I love the art style, the graphics are beautiful, Its not too hard but not too easy either, lots of upgrading, leveling up, quick choices you have to make sacrificing health for more speed, just simply briliant.  I am so happy I found this game, I have no idea why it's not a more well known game yet.  Keep up the great work and i cant wait for more updates! love it!			"

												I love the look and the mood of this game.  The gameplay is great, too -- many different elements (different locations, pins, mojos and consumables for loot, different rooms with various functionalities to visit, etc).  At first glance I loved the look and the music, and all the goofy/awesome looking masks, but the more I played with a friend, the more I appreciated the flow and the fun of the co-op play.  It's a very relaxing game, but not without a challenge, and it can get very hard on the higher difficulty.There's not much I don't like about this game, but if I were to change something, I'd change the cards (gods) -- they're a bit random, and there's too few of them (8 or so).  If there were like twenty more cards, that'd be so nice and would open up tons of new playstyles.  I think the idea of them is really good, just need more options since some of them are a bit lackluster.  Seeing how random some of them are, I don't see how you couldn't just add some more random ones, just for the choice of it (see if it suits some).To me, the replay value is pleasantly high, but I can see why people would think it can get a bit repetitive.  For the price though, it's more than worth it: the design, the unlockables, the gameplay -- it's all great for me.  I'm really happy this game was made, and is in my library for when I want to play with my friend.			"

Review written after 35+ hours gameplayFull Mojo Rampage (FMR) is marketed as a rougelike game, but it is not. It lacks turnbased gameplay and permadeath. However, I would recommend FMR to anyone who likes a game with a challenge, random playthroughs and online gameplay (coop and PVP). Pros: FMR resembles a twin stick shooter (controller and mouse+keyboard input) with RPG elements, dungeon crawling and unlockables after playthroughs. Your character can level up and you can choose different classes through Deities cards for different gamestyles or synergizing a coop team (max 4 players).The game offers 4 quests up to this date, a survival mode and a daily quest. The graphics and ingame sounds and music are really nice and the game still gets updated from time to time (I never experienced a bug ever). Cons: Not a lot of people play online, so better to buy the game and recommend it to your friends and have them buy it as well if you want to play online...			"

												Good game, reminiscent of Binding of Isaac, with online multiplayer.✔ Nice graphics, impressive lighting effects and colours✔ Interesting loot and items, like in Binding of Isaac for example ✔ Randomly generated levels✔ Online multiplayer seems to be appealing (have not tested)✘ It seems to be locked to online sessions, even when playing solo. This is a bad practice. No connection to the internet?

												Welcome to the most never heard of game of 2013. I only noticed this because it went on sale on the Humble Bundle store, then realized it was on sale on Steam with the weeklong deals thingythingy. So as seen as it was 50% off I thought I'd buy the game, why the hell not. It was a very good decision. This game is extremely fun. The controls are very smooth, the art style is satisfying and the gameplay is that of Binding of Isaac, mixed with a little Spiral Knights for good measure. A little low on content, however it's Early Access, what do you expect? Everytime I see that title, it gives games like these a bad name. As good as it is now, I can only sit here and wait excitingly and anxiously for new patches and updates to make this game even more enjoyable.Also has multiplayer. Come and play with me.			"

Ive tried both KB+M and a 360 Controller and find both to be very viable and well executed. The rogue-like elements are very well done and you always feel a sense of progression each time you meet your end, something difficult to achieve correctly in my opinion. Can certainly see my investing a lot of time into this over its lifetime. Very impressed and looking forward to seeing where they take it!			"

Even in the current build, it is evident that Over the Top Games knows what they're doing and where they want to go, and you'd be a foolish little grumpkin not to let them take you along for the ride. Full Mojo Rampage is what modern roguelikes--whether they know it or not--aspire to be.			"

												An incredibly well-done rogue-lite title that is difficult yet doesn't feel like it's totally beating you up and taking your lunch money.The reason I call it a rogue-lite is because of a few features in the game that affect your stats: - Leveling up; this allows you to assign points towards Health, Damage, Attack Rate and Movement Speed. These upgrades count towards all future runs. This is only really counted for the earlier stages when you're in the normal difficulties and you're making your full run through the game. - Pins; these also change your stats in some way, except it can effect things like Spell Damage, Cooldown Reduction, Gold Find, Slow On Hit, Increasing the amount of relics you can carry to start off with, etc. - Gold; the gold you accumulate throughout your runs is not lost when you die, and is used to upgrade your pins, purchase Blessings, and even throughout the run, you're able to spend the gold to buy relics and items.These features does not mean it's a bad title (in fact, even though it's not purely rogue-like, these features add a huge sense of replayability without having you start from scratch every single time). The game itself is extraordinaryily perfect. At the time of writing, the game will be releasing in the next few days, and it's gone through very good Alpha and Beta stages. It can be very easily compared with Binding of Isaac, in both gameplay and variety of content, which is extremely impressive. The game presents a fairly difficult experience, but it doesn't feel like the game is being unfair. The game, at its core, is just downright enjoyable to play.I won't pick apart the game piece by piece in this review, however I recommend checking out Sickboy's review here, whom was the person who allowed me to discover and research this title. I definitely recommend this game, one of the greatest I've played in quite a while.			"

												I bought this expecting a rogue-like. In that sense, I was disappointed. Although it has stiff penalties for death and levels are randomly generated, you keep your stats between replays and can continue your next game on the same quest. The random level generation adds some variety but does not make each replay significantly different (think Diablo, not Brogue). So don't buy this expecing a wildly random experience like Binding of Isaac or FTL.So it fails as a rogue-like... but it succeeds as an action RPG. The actual combat plays like a twin-stick shooter and the outcome is determined as much by aim and dodging as by stats. The graphics are great, filled with comedic voodoo iconography. Most of the abilities have excessively long cooldowns so you'll find yourself using the basic attack most of the time. This isn't so bad since the basic attack is satisfying enough.The two-player co-op is fun and the networking code works very well.I do have a few quibbles, though:- Some of the dialog boxes have timers which arbitrarily prevent you from closing them immediately to proceed with the game.  Fortunately, they're not very common.- When playing multiplayer, your group is disbanded after each quest and you must re-form the group to continue.- The lack of variety will likely hurt the game's long-term replayability.On the whole, this is a fun, polished, and bug-free experience, but don't expect it to hold your interest for more than 10 hours.

												Very fun game. At first it would appear to be a quick game. But it is actualy a rather long game with lots of lvl's and can be quite hard at times. The multiplayer is solid and promotes good co-op play. It will most likley take you multiple attemps to finish just the first quest with 4 players, but is a lot of fun!			"

												While Full Mojo Rampage is a fun rogue like to play with friends, it is rather grind heavy. To be able to stand a chance on the next quest (""level"") you will have to replay levels several times. With each run you can unlock further items to help you on further quests. Thus, if you do not like a grind heavy rogue like I would recommend you stay away from this game. Other than that it is a lot of fun, plus each quest can take 45 - 120 minutes, so there is a lot of play time in the game.			"

												Incredibly laggy, even though I can run most games on Ultra/High settings... The developers need to add an advanced graphics option menu in-game; players shoudn't be forced to tediously edit a config file just to remove some of the particle effects or bloom.The game runs okay on low settings, but it'd be nice to be able to tweak the individual settings, rather than just having a general low/medium/high setting (oh, and VSync, which is nice).The game itself is okay; it's a top-down shooter, but with abilities and specials that can be picked up/used along the way, from summons to powerful projectiles and potions.I can't recommend this game, as there's nothing too special about it, and the options are lacking.

												This is a game one would ponder about whether to buy or not.On first look the design and gameplay are quite smooth and the concept is very interesting.It is rouge-like therefore dying will make you restart the game all over, except you have a level thing which makes you able to level up your character stats to what you deem is useful.However, this can be seen as one of the flaws as one would need to keep repeatedly play through to try to gain level so you can start off easier. And trust me when I say, I got bored after 3 runs in single player.The multiplayer aspect is a nice touch but it seems to be rather dead now, it would be even better if there is some form of communication in multiplayer( mic enabled maybe? ), currently I have not explored enough as I have trouble finding a lobby to join.Lastly, people like to compare rouge-like to a gem namely Binding of Isaac. I would say if you have that game, there is no need for this game.In conclusion, this game is still worth getting if it is on sale.			"

												Curse this 2-score system. I want to vote ""neither recommend nor avoid"". The game works, has a quite decent theme going on and is fun to play. It has loot drops, plenty of unlockables, customization...everything you want, right?Well...the main thing is that this game made me realise how much I miss a tutorial because it isn't there. Not ""tutorial"" in the form of training wheel levels, but something to gradually gets you into the game. This game has everything straight from the gate (at least: I think so). Here are some items. Here's some gold. Here's a menu structure that currently holds more locks than choices. Here are some bars which may show your experience but may show something else. And so on.I feel lazy for typing this, but I never could be bothered to check where, how and on what you spend money on (okay, there are some in-level shops. But is that it?). I have no idea if I'm gaining a level. And either the game doesn't save your progress or the overall map is borked, but I swear everytime I start the game (I do small gaming sessions) I have to start from ""level 2"" anew. This also goes when you die...which may put you back more than a few levels. The game certainly holds potential, but as it stands it really doesn't shine. I certainly don't play dungeon crawlers for their story, but absolutely nothing is pretty weird. Even weirder when that baron Samedi apparently is our friend. Or ally. Or God, or something.I know, I know: all in all, this is nitpicking. The big ""but!!!"" is mainly that it taps into the same vein Diablo and Torchlight 2  plays, but is up to par with these games at best, and usually worse. Visuals: up to par. Audio: a bit worse. Fights: a bit worse. Enemy variety: worse. Music: okay-ish. And so on.If this game was in a vacuum, I'd thumb up this game. But why would you play this game if torchlight 2 is hardly more expensive (okay: twice the price) for way more of what you get?			"

												While certain successes like Binding of Issac, Spelunky and Rogue Legacy have proved that the rouge sub-genre of gaming is alive and well I’ve started to find much like rpg it tends to be a very minor element that gets slapped on every title possible to attract more buyers.Thankfully Full Mojo Rampage brought to you by Over the Top Games is not one of these titles; baring a striking resemblance to what one would imagine if Binding of Isaac fell into a cauldron and fused together with Torchlight 2 visuals, some co op elements and some bayou magic.Full Mojo Rampage is a twin stick shooter that follows the tale of a handful of voodoo apprentices as they go about fixing the voodoo world by closing portals, defeating bosses and apparently getting some booze for Baron Samedi helps too. Story is borderline non-existent but doesn’t hurt the overall game which servers mainly as a faced paced co op procedurally generated dungeon crawler, when starting up players will notice that instead of your typical class selection and slight customer customization instead players choose from several Loa’s (Voodoo deity’s) each with their own passive and abilities, a choice of visually cosmetic mask and several upgradable voodoo pins that work as perks.From there you (and you band of merry voodoers if online) go about finishing each randomly generated level by completing their objectives which while there are a bunch of different tasks they tend to blend into the same rather generically similar formula which are destroy all X and find all Y although there are the occasional events that add some change up like defending friendly zombies from skeletons or one of the Loa’s granting you x10 your max health but forgoing the ability to heal ever again in that chapter.During levels you mainly spend your time fighting off the large amount of spawns whilst searching for loot which will help or hinder your run, ranging from wands, items and mojos. Mojos are the main game changers as they provide random unique stat boosts like extra attack speed or damage, max health increases or even creating black holes upon killing an enemy, mojos and items can be switch out between the 3 equip and 3 inventory slots (which can be increased) allowing you to fully utilize your combo but without hogging all the mojos like in Risk of Rain or becoming completely overpowered like you could in Binding of Isaac.Much like the infamous Dark Souls you should be prepared to die, but Full Mojo Rampage is a bit more lenient with your death where you carry all currency and exp gained which allow you to purchase pins, level your stats and unlock/change your choice of Loa in order to hopefully succeed where you once failed. However even though of course the idea of a rogue-like is to set you back to try again, I found especially once I started the 2nd chapter or played on harder modes that the games tend to last a bit too long to justifying the vast amount of progression you need to catch up on once again especially playing alone though granted I feel this more due to how long it takes to find someone to play with online.What little of multiplayer I got to try out was indeed fun, similar to Risk of Rain, multiplayer offers a plethora of chaos and enjoyment as you scramble for loot and try not to be the guy who lost the 3 shared lives per quest.Thankfully FMR offers a round robin mode which gives each player a better chance at sharing mojos around instead of being left in the dirt; however my biggest gripe with FMR is in fact the local Co Op.While I’m one to passionately love couch Co Oping and love it every time a developer remembers that not everyone has developed a fear of playing a video game when physically near someone, FMR provides a very broken local multiplayer option.Sadly unlike Risk of Rain where each player could choose their class and could collect their own items, in Full Mojo Rampage the 2nd player can do neither; yep, player 2 is reduced to nothing more than a severely gimped ghost version of player 1 who can’t even pick up or use items (they can pick up coins and key objects). For me this really hurt the local co op feature the game provides as it really feels tacked on seeing as it’s incredibly dull very quickly for your buddy and honestly I would’ve preferred they just didn’t implement it in its current state.Sadly the lack of a multiplayer base is really all that there is to complain about Full Mojo Rampage, much like it’s fellow rogue-likes FMR has a very addictive formula that promotes replay ability (including daily challenges) but it does feel too stretched between the genres. FMR feels too simple compared to other dungeon crawlers like Torchlight or of course Diablo, and isn’t nearly as fast paced nor as challenging as the rogues like Binding of Isaac or Risk of Rain. That being said FMR is a very enjoyable co op dungeon crawler that for those who enjoyed Risk of Rain and enjoy some random pick up and play gameplay is a good choice to consider which will probably land you at least 10 hours if you manage to get a solid amount of friends to play with.Pros: 		Nice visuals,Lots of items to change gameplay, Promotes replayability, Solid gameplay online.Cons: 	Gimped local co op,Slightly repetitive,Somewhat small multiplayer base hurts online gameplay,Written by,WhistlerEnjoy the review?Be sure to come check out my other reviews @ http://morbidplay.com/.

												Game is no bad, you can see the effort put on this game. But i dont find a good reason to recommend this game to my friends. Killing enemies is not satisfactory, exploring doesn't give you good surprises, i don't like the art style of the game... looks a little... uhm... silly... Enemy patterns are to similar... tedious boss battles, they have easy patterns but they usually are very tanky so requieres a lot of time to kill if your stats are low.  Leveling up your character is kinda entertaining, but the effort to do it is not worthy. Not memorable sound track. I liked some events like shopping, some weapons or mixing artifacts, but after 2 hours i decided to unistall and waste my time with other game.			"

												How the hell a game with permanent stat progression can be considered a ""rogue-like""?And what's up with all those pseudo-twin-stick rogue-like games making you shoot small round blobs of goo as a primary attack? There's no feeling of impact, no sense of power, and the sound starts to drive you crazy really fast.Ok, sure, the game has a unique theme, decent ideas and a nice aesthetic, but it's not really a good sign when the core gameplay gets boring after a mere hour. The fact that the game expects you to die only to raise your stats a little bit and start anew makes the whole experience tedious and grindy. Not to mention, all the weapons you find have (very) limited uses, and most items only give you passive upgrades, rarely any new cool ability. And even when you find new items you most likely won't have any inventory space left to pick them up, which even further limits your character and adds unnecessary item management to the mix.Kind of a pitty, actually, because there was potential here. As it is though, it's just tedious and repetitive.			"

												The art and soundtrack are charming, but the gameplay suffers from being forced to repeat earlier missions over and over to improve your global character level. Otherwise, you'll find yourself being one-shot by an enemy who looks like a normal critter, on the second campaign level. Even the multiplayer couldn't save it with its ""anything is fun with friends"" factor. The leveling system also means that if somebody has played more or less hours than another, the parity between player's powers becomes a serious problem.Just not what I was looking for, and I can't recommend it to anyone who is expecting a more traditional rough-lick.

												While fun for a short time, this game features unimaginative, highly repetitive gameplay. The game is played top-down, and features shooting everything you see and wandering until you find an exit to the zone so that you can repeat the process in another one. The game has all the variation of Gauntlet circa 1985.While I normally devote more to my reviews, there really isn't more to say - this game is a modern Gauntlet clone with a voodoo theme.			"

												   I'm pretty sure I would have liked this game if every aspect of the gameplay wasn't saying ""die and die again, just because I'm a roguelike"".  The mechanics are all made for you to enter a stage, die millions of times 'til you can finally upgrade, go to next stage and repeat everything. I know it is part of what a roguelike is made of, but, again, only PART. For example: the only two skills you have at the beginning have such a long cooldown that most of my ingame time was spent wandering away form monsters, completely helpless, 'til I could try to hit them again.    Maybe this is your thing and if all I'm saying sounds to you like ""diablo + dark souls... I love it"" Go for it! But I wouldn't recommend it myself.   It's a shame. I really liked the voodoo theme and I thought of giving it a longer try to see if the gameplay improves. But there's a very short time for asking for refunds, so, that's it for me			"

												If you're here because of the rogue-like tag, look else where. This is not it.A good alternative to this is Nuclear Throne. While this game sucks, Nuclear Throne does not.Here's why:- This game is mute. Lack of appropriate sound effects. The only thing you'll be hearing in this game is your wand goes pew pew pew, SOME (not all) explosions and zombies dying. Music is okay. Playing this game feels like playing any other game but you turn down the volume because you don't want your parent caught you playing video game in the middle of the night because you have school in the morning.- Lack of custom video setting option. Low graphic setting won't turn off the bloom, you're gonna need to change it manually by editing the setting file in my document.- Boring. This game is boring. Mobs of enemies running at you. You run, circling them while spamming LMB. Rinse and repeat. Plus the game is mute, this game just lack immersion. If Full Mojo Rampage is a drink, it taste like tap water, but tap water is free but this game cost some money.This game is a rogue-lite. The boring kind of rogue-lite that you want to avoid. Good thing it have multiplayer.			"

												This game had potential and can be enjoyable with a friend, but ulitmately is frustrating and the experience suffers from poor design choices.The gameplay is a mix of Risk of Rain style acumulation of items until a boss battle, but plays slightly like Diablo. You are expected to replay levels futily several times before completing them and making progress, because there is persistent leveling, but at a far slower pace than the content demands.Combat is floaty, tedious and unsatisfying, and the breaks in the monotony you receive from certain random item drops are too sparse and short lived for the game's own good.

												At first it seems like a fun game. There are staffs, relics, rampage, specific abilities, multiple different characters, pins, masks, random levels with different goals, random side places you can do things in, secrets, and hidden entrances that go to different rooms. Then I started to see the grinding. You die in like 2 seconds and health can be hard to come by. If you die you lose all of your progress. To do anything like get new guys, or masks, you need gold and medals. Medals take FOREVER to get. In the first 3 hours, I prolly got 15- 20, so enough for 1 to two guys. But theres so much grinding. Then you see blessings costs 10 medals. What they don't tell you is its not permanent. I spent 10 medals, or over and hour of time, and if you die you lose all of that. They should stay forever or cost like 2 medals, very stupid. Pins cost a ton of money too. Upgrading 1 fully takes about 1-1.5 hours of gameplay worth of gold, and each single one doesn't do THAT much. Then there are the guys. Some of the guys, like the one that can run faster or decrease his own damage, is worthless. I spent 10 medals and he just sucked. The game would be much more fun with friends, but of course there is no local co-op and NOBODY is playing it online, so hope you like single player. I hate rogue-like games but this didn't bother me too much at first because although I would lose it dangled so many options and unlockables like the carrot on the stick, like COD, and I was transfixed. Then I realized how much grinding and inflated gameplay it encouraged. But what finally got me was the randomness/unfairness, mixed with poor boss fight. It is completely random what you get. One game I got 2 revives and a bunch of health. Then when I finally gave up on the last realm, I played for 3 hours and didnt get ONE single revive. I got more health can I could carry early on, but then I get to the final boss fight, and there are 2 crates containing coins but no potions. I had no potions and you can't go back to any stores on levels to stock up. Pretty stupid to make a game where you lose all progress, but you can’t buy potions or prepare for a boss fight where you could lose it all, just hope you get lucky and there are potions or a revive in the crates (why????). I would have been able to carry potions but of course with randomness again I didn’t get a SINGLE inventory slot upgrade from any of the 5 realms in the secrets, only all relics and potions. Other times I have maxed out both and kept getting inventory upgrades I can’t use, but this time I couldn’t get 1. So the randomness keeps it from being fair or proportionate. So I get to this boss, and he is super stupid. After 45 minute work of this time, and prolly 2 hours on the realm, I make it to him. There are spikes in each of the four corners. Then this boss shoots out like 10 giant red balls that bounce off walls and flood the screen. Then he moves around towards you attacking. So you are supposed to dodge 10 bouncing red balls continuously flying all over the screen, as well as him, and not be able to maneuver around because of the spikes. You clearly cannot avoid all the projectiles and him while trying to hurt him. Then add to it each of the red balls does like 1/3 your health, and I had about 1/3 increased health and no potions or revives. Well due to the unfair fight you basically can’t win alone on normal, I lost all 50 minutes of progress, because a fight I had no control over. No thanks crap rogue-like, try to make things do-able next time or more balanced. It was clear they wanted to use the rogue-like to force you to die and keep retrying to inflate game length because theres only like 4 missions. 4.5/10.			"

												The top down shooter is a genre I'm fond of and I was genuinely excited when I first saw Full Mojo Rampage. It's not a terrible game, but the core gameplay suffers from some problems.Firstly, you get a fairly limited view of what's going on around you. Particularly when moving south I felt blind as to what I was walking into. Enemies with missile/charge attacks generally have a range of around half a screen, which sometimes means you are being attacked from offscreen, or you don't get to see the enemy telegraphing their charge so when it comes at you there's no time left to dodge.The levels are initially empty - you trigger enemy spawns as you explore. Most of them will run straight at you after their spawn animation, and except for the kamikaze types you can outrun them (by default; presumably if you put enough points in speed you can outrun kamikazes too).You can choose from a bunch of characters which have a variety of spells, but all have the same peashooter basic attack. You can't take many hits either, and all of this combines to encourage a conservative strategy:1. Tiptoe around level until enemies spawn2. Run away from enemies while shooting at them3. Remain in the already explored area of the level until they're all dead (to avoid spawning more enemies)4. Rinse and repeatUnfortunately none of this is very hard, or engaging. Nor could I find any other viable strategy; the limited dps means you need to progress through the level fairly slowly to manage enemies as they spawn, and your limited health pool means you need to keep your distance as you can't afford to take risks.It's a shame, because if it wasn't for these core issues it would be a lot of fun.

												This game has a lot of flaws.  First, customize of your character is a joke.  After ""choosing"" the only quest you can, you get to pick one of just four masks, two of which are barely distinguishable at the distance you'll be viewing it from during gameplay.  That's it.  You have start wtih only one parent god, and zero voodoo pins.Still, none of those flaws breaks the game but there is one that does.  You cannot resize or customize the HUD.  While you can change the screen resolution to make the HUD take up more little more of the screen.  However, that doesn’t fix the main problem.  Your health bar is still too small to be useful during combat.Your greatest enemy should never be part of the game interface.			"

												This game is a ton of fun. It does have some roguelike elements in that death is permanent, and your pickups such as mojo, potions, and wands will be random. You do get permanent power ups that persist through death, by leveling up and collecting pins. If you ever played old school games like Gauntllet, you may be reminded of that as well. It also has a bit of a shoot em up feel to it. I haven't progressed terribly far in the game yet, but I'm already hooked. I'm sure I'll love the multiplayer element but I have yet to try it out.

												Excellent multiplayer game!  Until you gain a few levels movement is slow and you end up hurting your wrists a bit if you are using the keyboard, but after a few speed attribute increases it gets ""better"".  Though movement is not as fluid as other games even after speed boosts and it's super easy to think you are someone else.			"

												A really great action style Rogue-like, that is especially fun co-op with friends. Also challenging and there is a six difficulty’s that you can unlock for each mission and they not just like ""more hp"" and ""they hit harder"" for monster, but they change the dynamic or game itself - like a monster leave behind a bomb that explode or they do not drop healing orbs anymore and that changes things more that you think at first. So you can repeat 5 or 6 missions multiple times for difficulties unlocks also there is survival mode and no matter how many times you repeat a single mission there will never the same result as before, since maps are generated. Well worth the money if you ask me, when you consider amount of content you get and amount of hours you can get from this game.			"

												Amazing rogue-light, great art-style, to be more specific -> the whole audio-visual-presentation is topnotch (adin lot's of love for detail).The gameplay is tight, which is important for a ""twin-stick""-shooter (alas, it's no bullet-hell-game for that matter).You always feel in control of your toon, more so when things get hectic (and they will).There's a great sense of propgression due the fact you keep your overall level and gold (which buys permanent upgrades).You will still feel like achivieng something, even when you die and got to restart. There are lot's of build-options:a) you level (is persitant) and develop you chars like in any other arpgb) you can equip diffrent upgrades (pins) which over a whole bunch of diffrent options and some can be upgraded by goldc) you can choose diffrent skill-setupsthat's just before you actualy start your rogue-like-run. When you start the actual dungeoncrawling you will find everything passive upgrades, active new weapons, usable items, etc. all randomized.All in all this is  a 9/10 for me and you will get lots and lots of entertainment for a realy fair and cheap price ->must by if you liek arpgs, rogue-likes or mp-actions games.

												Good things about this game:+Smooth movement and shooting+Randomized levels+Has nice easter eggs from other games(Minecraft,BoI,Meatboy etc.)+Story is good+Gets really hard laterBad things:-You cannot combine everything-Enemies are not randomized-Cannot combine wands and active items-Enemy damage is too high. You can only take 1-3 hits (depends on the enemy and difficulty)Overall it's really good and I suggest you to buy it if you enjoy Rogue-Like games like Risk of Rain, The Binding of Isaac and Rogue Legacy. I might edit this review, since the game was only released a week or so ago.			"

												The Art design in this game is Reminiscent of the Torchlight Series, Music somewhat like Danny Elfman's work for Burton, and game play similar to Binding of Isaac, Zelda, DeathSpank, Robotron, and super smash tv. I am really enjoying collecting medals, gold, masks, Pins, and new luas who change up my play patterns. Each run is different, and items you get allow you much freedom in how to play the game, and I can see myself more interested in mastering the intricacies and synergies than I was with Binding of Isaac, and I am a big fan of that game as well. The local multiplayer will be similar with those who are familiar with deathspank, where the second player is an assistant, with no sub items affecting their play; in a way, this is a good thing, as it frees them up to not have to think about inventory management, etc. Controls are rock solid, as is the multiplayer, There are ambushes, and you have a feeling of being overwhelmed by surprise attacks, entertainingly so, but it never feels unfair when you die, you simply learn from your failure, and apply it to the next run. When you do die, there isn't a feeling of loss, except if you got really good drops and you die early, because the medals and gold, exp, and new pins you pick up stay with you. this can lead to death being seen as a new beginning, as you have a chance to level up, upgrade and change your pins, and get new masks and luas. It would be great if the masks had more of an effect on game play (perhaps they do, I haven't seen one) The bosses are similar fare to what you would see in Zelda, and BoI. The Daily mission is a single instance across all players, this equality allows individual players to see how much better they are than the competition quite fairly, accounting for the odd stroke of luck that could give players an advantage. By giving everyone the same result from the RNG, the daily mission is an objective way of seeing how you stack up to the best. I readily await DLC or an expansion pack for this game, and I could see myself playing this for many years to come.This is the game Binding of Isaac Wishes it could be.			"

												What a surprisingly fun game this is. If you're a fan of Binding of Isaac, trial and error, or rogue-like games in general thenthis is the game for you. The voodoo theme and the characters within this game have a very nice flavor and I can see myself adding many more hours to Full Mojo Rampage.  What makes this game more interesting is that there's a bit of an RPG element when it comes to building the character you'replaying as. Every now-and-then you'll get pins which you can upgrade (whether it be faster casting speed, more power, etc.) that you find through the maps you complete.It's worth the grab and it's worth your time.

												If you ever played a snes game called ""Zombies ate my neighbours"" then buy this game! you will not be disappointed. despite the Cutesy Tim Burton-esque Horror theme this game has it is not an easy game but this game does everything right, it's challenging and yet you will wanna keep playing even if that means starting over. there are some variation in tactics with the different ""Loa's"" (which is essentially the voodoo god or saint you align yourself with.) and alot of stat buffs through totems and pins collected along the way. the game is really well balanced, plays well and looks adorable. I cannot recommend this game enough. its essentially a (top down) isometric shooter with some area of effect attacks and a few other things that are hard to explain. Its Voodoo use your Imagination. every Loa is different but you will need to unlock access to each loa as you progress. with the industry as it is of late its good to see that there are developers out there that are focusing on what matters most of all in a game...Fun.

												Wow. I was expecting myself to be disappointed when I bought this game but I was WRONG. This game is one of my new favorite rogue-like games. If you're not sure what the game is like, picture it as a 3D binding of Isaac with multiplayer. The game is both casual and a little difficult in some ways. Just like any rogue-like game, you have to start from a beginning level and progress through multiple different other levels to reach the final stage. Each level has its own unique design and is filled with enemies and bosses. You can find items and upgrades to improve the stats of your character as you progress, making you more stronger. These kind of games are just amazingly addictive and fun.If you like binding of isaac, you will definately love this.			"

												This game isn't your normal rouge-like topdown shooter, Ranging from how you level up to how critical evasion can be at times this game can and will make you rage quit quite a lot. But other then that it's plays wounderfully with the range and skills, mojos, and wands it isn't hard to match the power of some mobs quickly. It looks great it plays great and the music is wounderful, also the way to unlock the speical masks was quite creative.

												Plays much like Binding of Isaac and it is just as friendly.. until it isn't. Cute, easy to learn, unforgiving. Musically, early on at least, there isn't a lot of diversity but the Elfman-meets-Hillbilly hybrid style is cleanly executed so serves as a good backup to the gameplay. Thematically, to compare it to BoI's flagrant blasphemy, the game feels like a carefully made yet still accessible love letter to Vodou. Also, I stumbled across the insertion of some lyrics from an obscure Toadies song that I so adore. Bonus points.Very easy purchase if anyone is looking for another top-down-ish, arpg style rogue-like.			"

												A surprisingly pleasant twin stick shooter with a variety of character types but repetitive and somewhat unneccessary leveling/exp system. PROS:-Good variety of genuinely different characters to pick-Clean controls-NON-level based unlocks and persistent power-ups (by spending gold you get via playing) are well done, good variety. The gold sink is borderline grindy, but the prices are mostly reasonable. This is a ""fair"" way to add a small replay value by means of grind to the game (unlike the level system, see below)NEUTRAL:-Graphics are nice but not amazing. Art style is cool, but I feel more could have been done with the world. It is somewhat bland.-Higher difficulties add additional modifiers that make game more skill-based difficult, but also introduce an artificial skill-wall by means of character levels. WHY?!CONS:-There is no point to the leveling system but to add an artificial skill-wall and repetition to gameplay. Annoying, grindy, and unneccesary in what is otherwise a relatively skill-based game. NOTE: There is a relatively low level cap (15) so this isn't a huge issue.-No multiplayer base. I don't know anyone who has it so I've been unable to try coop, but ""online"" games are a ghost town.			"

												Full Mojo Rampage is a charming little indie title that blends twin-stick-style shooting with Roguelike map, enemy and item generation. Though character progression persists between runs, dying ends a given run and it may take you several attempts to complete each quest. All is not well in the land of the dead and you, as an aspiring voodoo practictioner, have been chosen to perform a series of challenging tasks by the loa. From sealing portals Baron Samedi left open after a night of drunken revelry, to helping Maman Bridgitte brew a magic potion to following a cryptic vision from Damballa, your dimutive bokor must slog his way through graveyards, swamps and volcanic seas in pursuit of magical glory. Combat is very hectic and staying on the move and aiming quickly is necessary to survive. Though the success of a run is can largely depend on the random number gods and favorable item drops, persistence will be rewarded. At the beginning of a run you can choose a patron loa which essentially governs your character's class, determining your starting spells and passives, and you can equip one or more pins that provide passive bonuses.  The overall feel of the game is excellent, with a lighthearted presentation, excellent music and a surprising degree of accuracy to voodoo lore, including faithful replications of the various sigils. Local coop is possible but the second player is limited to a phantom duplicate of the first player and cannot collect powerups. The game's boss fights are excellent and suitably epic in presentation. Overall, an excellent and challenging, but ultimately forgiving roguelike.			"

												In this game you play as some voodoo youngster doing his quests. Each quest has multiple levels, all of them randomly generated. There are multiple types of levels, like dungeon and cemetery. Goal of the level can be like to destroy some portals or just escape or something. The whole game has a leveling system too. When you level up, you can choose a stat to increase. There are also pins that you unlock which give minor (or major, depends on the pin) boosts. The quests are rogue-like a bit, because when you die on like the third level of the quest, you must start over from the first level, losing the items and stat changes you've gained. The items gained during levels give different perks, like enemies exploding on death or getting 1% HP on kill. You can't wear a lot of them at once, so that means you must choose.The game style is great and gameplay amazing. It has humour here and there, you can see it even from the masks you can wear. So yeah, quite a great game.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												This is undoubtedly a fine game. It looks amazing, the gameplay is solid, and the progression is noticeable enough to really feel satisfying even when your progress through a level is reset due to death. Pros:Really polished graphicsSolid top-down roguelite twinstick shooter gameplayInvolved developersWell developed between life progression, a standard of the roguelite genre,A fairly solid theme that is present throughout the visuals and soundtrackA competent set of options and resolutions.Cons:The local co-op gameplay is more than slightly lacking, although as the game is still under slight development that may change. Due to the small development team, developments are slow and the inherent problems of the game are going to take some time to fix, as right now the devs are working on porting the game to PS4 and Xbone.All in all, I'd definetely reccomend this game, but know what you're getting into before you buy the game. If you want a fantastic co-op dungeon crawler, I'd reccomend this, but know what the inherent problems of this game are before you buy it. Definetely a good investment, as big improvements are coming to this game. If you really want this game, buy it at full price. If you think this game is interesting but think it's too expensive, wait until it's on sale. Either way it's worth it. "

												The graphics are outstanding and controls are very fluid. There are a lot of different maps and some special maps aswell. The story has 4 parts and there will be a lot of different opponents. If you get bored with the story there are 3 more mods (multiplayer. survival and daily quest). You will have 5-10 hours of just playing the story and it's pretty fun to play the story. The problems are after you pass the story it gets boring after a while and there is a difficulty changer (hardcore, annoying, etc.) but the enemies are actually insane to pass. Also multiplayer is dead, no one plays it and developer stoped updating the game (there is a reason why http://steamcommunity.com/app/225280/discussions/0/613940477699048998/ ). So to conclude this review would recommend this game but only if it's on sale because I think 12 eur is a lot for 5-10 hours of story and currently dead mutiplayer. Game is very nice and when the developer starts updating again the game will be much better.			"

												Although it seems for a few hours like one of the most enjoyable dungeon crawlers ever, this game gets very repetitive if you don't enjoy grinding mobs and levels for a while. Aspects of RPG and dungeon crawlers are implemented into this game, even with a few mob types similar to those in The Binding of Issac. This game's world and items, 112 current in use get isolated very quickly, I mean by this that they get very recognized and some being more useful than others. Overall review of this game is good, I would say it's an investment to buy it if it goes on sale, but 14$ is a little too pricey at it's current gameplay status. It seems like it won't be updated so if it does go on sale it'd be a definite buy.			"

												Cleverly designed and charmingly presented. Having a persistent character offers plenty of replayability and a real sense of progression, even when you fail. The inability to save during a quest is a bit of an annoyance; you'll need to set aside time to get through it in one go. Aside from that one little caveat, this is well worth playing.Edit - that caveat is now no longer an issue, as the devs have patched in the ability to save between missions. Great to see devs who listen to their fans!			"

												Never heard of this game before but being a big dungeon crawler fan, decided to play it.I love the art style. Its simple and cartoony, has an almost Tim Burton feel. But at the same time, looks like it would run great on my LG G3.The gameplay is simple and repetitive, so that might be annoying to some gamers. I personally like it.

The art style, simple but still challenging gameplay paired with the back story and unlockables makes for a highly enjoyable game.

												It took a while for me to have Full Mojo Rampage sink in, but when it did I was completely sold. It's a rogue-light, or whatever you want to call it, playable in co-op. You're a voodoo priest in diapers and a silly mask ... why? Well, I can't explain the diapers, but TF2 has Hats™ so I guess masks is next big thing(?). There are no saves, but the quests you play can be completed in under an hour. Everything you pick up during that quest is gone if you die or when you've completed the quest. Your character progression and permenant buffs however are saved.So it's a isometric ARPG by mechanics, where you play levels where you usually have to complete a couple of objectives and then get out. A quest is made up of several levels. After you've completed the objective(s) you can also walk around and explore the place, but of course there's the risk of you... you know... dying. You'll find mojos (temporary buffs for that quest), temporary weapons (when the ammo is gone your back to your default) and you might find a god. Gods live in caves and offer you buffs, but sometimes (and this is one of the parts I love about FMR) they want something in return. So they can offer you double damage, but you'll have to give away a quarter of your max health. That's a painful decision to make.For me, personally, this game is at its' best in co-op, even though there's actually no direct use for it in the game mechanics, but it's always more fun to play a game in co-op than single player IMHO. It's a fun and challenging (oh yes it is!) rogue-light ARPG with cool music and funky graphics. If that's how you want your voodoo doll to hang then this is a game for you... go get collecting 'em masks!			"

												A really great action style Rogue-like, that is especially fun co-op with friends. Also challenging and there is a six difficulty’s that you can unlock for each mission and they not just like ""more hp"" and ""they hit harder"" for monster, but they change the dynamic or game itself - like a monster leave behind a bomb that explode or they do not drop healing orbs anymore and that changes things more that you think at first. So you can repeat 5 or 6 missions multiple times for difficulties unlocks also there is survival mode and no matter how many times you repeat a single mission there will never the same result as before, since maps are generated. Well worth the money if you ask me, when you consider amount of content you get and amount of hours you can get from this game.			"

												If you ever played a snes game called ""Zombies ate my neighbours"" then buy this game! you will not be disappointed. despite the Cutesy Tim Burton-esque Horror theme this game has it is not an easy game but this game does everything right, it's challenging and yet you will wanna keep playing even if that means starting over. there are some variation in tactics with the different ""Loa's"" (which is essentially the voodoo god or saint you align yourself with.) and alot of stat buffs through totems and pins collected along the way. the game is really well balanced, plays well and looks adorable. I cannot recommend this game enough. its essentially a (top down) isometric shooter with some area of effect attacks and a few other things that are hard to explain. Its Voodoo use your Imagination. every Loa is different but you will need to unlock access to each loa as you progress. with the industry as it is of late its good to see that there are developers out there that are focusing on what matters most of all in a game...Fun.

												Wow. I was expecting myself to be disappointed when I bought this game but I was WRONG. This game is one of my new favorite rogue-like games. If you're not sure what the game is like, picture it as a 3D binding of Isaac with multiplayer. The game is both casual and a little difficult in some ways. Just like any rogue-like game, you have to start from a beginning level and progress through multiple different other levels to reach the final stage. Each level has its own unique design and is filled with enemies and bosses. You can find items and upgrades to improve the stats of your character as you progress, making you more stronger. These kind of games are just amazingly addictive and fun.If you like binding of isaac, you will definately love this.			"

												This game isn't your normal rouge-like topdown shooter, Ranging from how you level up to how critical evasion can be at times this game can and will make you rage quit quite a lot. But other then that it's plays wounderfully with the range and skills, mojos, and wands it isn't hard to match the power of some mobs quickly. It looks great it plays great and the music is wounderful, also the way to unlock the speical masks was quite creative.  I would recomend this game to anyone who loves rouge-likes, top down shooters, or both. Thou with how hecktic some areas can be muilitplayer would be hell even on normal.			"

												In this game you play as some voodoo youngster doing his quests. Each quest has multiple levels, all of them randomly generated. There are multiple types of levels, like dungeon and cemetery. Goal of the level can be like to destroy some portals or just escape or something. The whole game has a leveling system too. When you level up, you can choose a stat to increase. There are also pins that you unlock which give minor (or major, depends on the pin) boosts. The quests are rogue-like a bit, because when you die on like the third level of the quest, you must start over from the first level, losing the items and stat changes you've gained. The items gained during levels give different perks, like enemies exploding on death or getting 1% HP on kill. You can't wear a lot of them at once, so that means you must choose.The game style is great and gameplay amazing. It has humour here and there, you can see it even from the masks you can wear. So yeah, quite a great game.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												Never have I been a fan of top down. But this Roguelike game has plenty of replay value and entertaining gameplay and unlockables. Full Mojo however, with time can get a bit repetitive but at an on sale value it is worthy to pick up for sure, it holds a decent back bone of gameplay value alongside of competitors in this particular genre of games. It also offers some decent challenges to overcome and another plus is the game runs smoothly, I have never ran into an issue. Rampage commense.			"

												So.. In my humble opinion, this is the best indie game i've recently played. I love the smooth and nice graphics, aswell as soundtrack; co-op; huge arsenal of pins, collectibles, secrets etc. etc.  Also, i liked the remaking of the map. Some items makes me feel invincible, but then comes boss (""pfft, 2easy4me"") and i get killed as fast as i came in (""wow""). Totally recommend, both single player and co-op			"

												Great game! Didn't expect it to be that good. It's mixing of mojo's is really done neatly and you can combine so many things to get different stuff to help you out. This game isn't meant to be Graphic God, not meant to be realistic shiz, it is what it's expected to be, really good dungeon crawler. I like it very much 9/10 (Note: I am giving my mark on the base of how I liked game, not regarding other games out there)			"

												Although it seems for a few hours like one of the most enjoyable dungeon crawlers ever, this game gets very repetitive if you don't enjoy grinding mobs and levels for a while. Aspects of RPG and dungeon crawlers are implemented into this game, even with a few mob types similar to those in The Binding of Issac. This game's world and items, 112 current in use get isolated very quickly, I mean by this that they get very recognized and some being more useful than others. Overall review of this game is good, I would say it's an investment to buy it if it goes on sale, but 14$ is a little too pricey at it's current gameplay status. It seems like it won't be updated so if it does go on sale it'd be a definite buy.			"

												It's not a bad game, but it needs some more work before it's a 'truly' good game. While the aspects of randomly-generated dungeons, and (sometimes) unforgiving gameplay make it both entertaining and challenging, the game still feels a bit empty after a few hours in. The concept of using voodoo pins, and voodoo Gods as a means of making your little character stronger is great, but especially the latter could use a lot more variety and additions to make it even more rewarding/tactical. I'm going to press the recommend button just because it's a funny and challenging experience playing co-op with a friend (or more) but I do hope more stuff will be added.			"

												Cleverly designed and charmingly presented. Having a persistent character offers plenty of replayability and a real sense of progression, even when you fail. The inability to save during a quest is a bit of an annoyance; you'll need to set aside time to get through it in one go. Aside from that one little caveat, this is well worth playing.Edit - that caveat is now no longer an issue, as the devs have patched in the ability to save between missions. Great to see devs who listen to their fans!			"

												Full Mojo is a roguelike with a marraige between many popular games of the genre, adding together to be something completely unique. Offering multiple campaigns to challenge as well as various collectables and roguelite qualities that cater a huge amount to fans of the genre. This combined with some tongue in cheek humor and lore that sticks very close to its origins adds together to make a most exceptional game, though not without its share of flaws.Mechanically it is most closely resembling that of Binding of Isaac, with shooting in various directions from a topdown view, but the gameplay more closely resembles that of area shooters like Serious Sam, as you will often be backpedaling away from hordes of enemies, hoping not to get yourself into a corner. This is one of my largest complaints about this game. Since the areas are so large, and the lowliest enemies so quick and devastating to your health, you are almost always relying on luck moreso than skill or patience, and regardless of how high your level and hp, you'll always be backpedalling. This quickly takes away from the fun, as a run can come to a swift and brutal end as your own skill can only take you so far. A cautious approach is reccomended for the earlier levels, as most of the enemies are rather simple, but the farther you go, the trickier they become, and if you trigger too many spawn points, you will easily be overwhelmed by a veritable congaline of enemies. This is by no means a bad thing, as it demands some forethought, but sometimes after you beat a particularly brutal boss, your day can be ruined by some cheaply spawned exploding enemies, and you'll have to start alllllllllllllllllllll over again.Thankfully, all coins and experience carry over, so you're not completely bankrupt, but this is a twitchy game, and if you aren't one for twitch gameplay, steer clear, for you don't have many other options. Otherwise, this gem in the rough is definitely worth your attention.			"

												It's a very underrated game.  It's graphics aren't super good, and it has somewhat of a almost clunky movement system.  But it's enjoyable.  You can unlock the characters in a very small amount of time.  You can do survival, which is an absolute blast for me.  Just a good game with some roguelite elements thrown in for some good measure.I'd strongly suggest.			"

												This game reminds me of the Gauntlet series. If you've played the newest one or the ones released for N64 and Playstation then you'll have a bit of a feel for this game. Only downside to it I found really was the lack of options to decrease video options further than a basic graphics quality reduction option and V-sync on/off.The game itself looks great and the sound is fairly good. Has a bit of the rogue-like in there where ya run as long as ya can and get as much as you can to eventually die to stronger than you can handle monsters only to start over with all the money stuffs you have collected to fuel your next run.

Luckily, the XP and gold you earn are saved to your profile so your character will get better and stronger the more games you play.  I picked it up for buck during a Humble Bundle sale and don't regret the purchase.

												If you ever played a snes game called ""Zombies ate my neighbours"" then buy this game! you will not be disappointed. despite the Cutesy Tim Burton-esque Horror theme this game has it is not an easy game but this game does everything right, it's challenging and yet you will wanna keep playing even if that means starting over. there are some variation in tactics with the different ""Loa's"" (which is essentially the voodoo god or saint you align yourself with.) and alot of stat buffs through totems and pins collected along the way. the game is really well balanced, plays well and looks adorable. I cannot recommend this game enough. its essentially a (top down) isometric shooter with some area of effect attacks and a few other things that are hard to explain. Its Voodoo use your Imagination. every Loa is different but you will need to unlock access to each loa as you progress. with the industry as it is of late its good to see that there are developers out there that are focusing on what matters most of all in a game...Fun.

												The graphics are outstanding and controls are very fluid. There are a lot of different maps and some special maps aswell. The story has 4 parts and there will be a lot of different opponents. If you get bored with the story there are 3 more mods (multiplayer. survival and daily quest). You will have 5-10 hours of just playing the story and it's pretty fun to play the story. The problems are after you pass the story it gets boring after a while and there is a difficulty changer (hardcore, annoying, etc.) but the enemies are actually insane to pass. Also multiplayer is dead, no one plays it and developer stoped updating the game (there is a reason why http://steamcommunity.com/app/225280/discussions/0/613940477699048998/ ). So to conclude this review would recommend this game but only if it's on sale because I think 12 eur is a lot for 5-10 hours of story and currently dead mutiplayer. Game is very nice and when the developer starts updating again the game will be much better.			"

												This is undoubtedly a fine game. It looks amazing, the gameplay is solid, and the progression is noticeable enough to really feel satisfying even when your progress through a level is reset due to death. Pros:Really polished graphicsSolid top-down roguelite twinstick shooter gameplayInvolved developersWell developed between life progression, a standard of the roguelite genre,A fairly solid theme that is present throughout the visuals and soundtrackA competent set of options and resolutions.Cons:The local co-op gameplay is more than slightly lacking, although as the game is still under slight development that may change. Due to the small development team, developments are slow and the inherent problems of the game are going to take some time to fix, as right now the devs are working on porting the game to PS4 and Xbone.All in all, I'd definetely reccomend this game, but know what you're getting into before you buy the game. If you want a fantastic co-op dungeon crawler, I'd reccomend this, but know what the inherent problems of this game are before you buy it. Definetely a good investment, as big improvements are coming to this game. If you really want this game, buy it at full price. If you think this game is interesting but think it's too expensive, wait until it's on sale. Either way it's worth it. "

												I find it funny, but its better if you are Co-op.It's a bit like Binding isaac, because you run around and if you die you die and start the game over. but if you are Co-op you get more lives to use. (i think it makes sense why)			"

												a very good but overlooked rougelike, this game needs to get bought by more people because it deservse it. the only complain that i have so far is some issue with the multiplayer, but ain't giving a ♥♥♥♥ about that cause i keep comming back to single player anyway.			"

												Really difficult but very fun. You die a lot but get coins and medals to spend on pins (increase your skills) and different attacks and stuff. Not saving is a big part of the game. Kind of like Binding of Isaac with bigger levels. Unfortunately, after some Windows updates maybe, the game crashed on my computer and my 20+ hours of play was completely lost. Oh well. Still a really fun game. I play with a controller. The soundtrack is really good too. Even though I lost my progress, I still love the game.Ok so I wrote the above review about 15 minutes ago and now the game is so laggy and crashy that I can't play it anymore. The game doesn't always crash. It just slows down and makes like, broken computer noises. I still like the game but maybe my computer can't handle it anymore....			"

												I truly enjoy this game.  For those of us who play rogue-likes with more enthusiasm than skill, Full Mojo Rampage is the perfect blend of both.  The earlier levels are not too brutal, and the unlocks and abilities are pretty easy to acquire at a steady rate to keep the sense of pogression going.  The gameplay itself is quite good.  As you acquire more pins and upgrade them, you can end up with quite a variety of builds spread across an equally good variety of masters.  Each play differently, and joining up with a friend can produce some fun gameplay and strategies as you work together.I love the art direction of the game as well.  It is very moody and atmospheric, yet captures the drunken madness of voodoo and it's practitioners.  For those willing to spend a little time and effort to get the unlocks flowing, this game provides many many hours of fun.I Strongly Recommend this outstanding game!			"

												A little unique type of dungeon crawler that anyone can pick up easily and enjoy for a while. Better with friends like everything but if you're alone sadly multiplayer is dead so you'll have to stick to single player.			"

												Entertaining, well made shoot'em up where you start little and weak and you end kicking ♥♥♥, with some rpg factors like skill leveling and ability power ups.Good balance and progression, simple but challenging gameplay. Good replay value for score freaks and for unlockers.Leaves nothing to be desired.			"

												This game reminds me of the Gauntlet series. If you've played the newest one or the ones released for N64 and Playstation then you'll have a bit of a feel for this game. Only downside to it I found really was the lack of options to decrease video options further than a basic graphics quality reduction option and V-sync on/off.The game itself looks great and the sound is fairly good. Has a bit of the rogue-like in there where ya run as long as ya can and get as much as you can to eventually die to stronger than you can handle monsters only to start over with all the money stuffs you have collected to fuel your next run.

												I thoroughly enjoyed FMR. This captures what we love about games like Diablo and Gauntlet, and produces a very simple, well balanced game. The game mechanics flow seamlessly, and the multiplayer support is fantastic. I love seeing a theme like VooDoo beautifully executed with the creativity seen in this one. I strongly recommend to anyone.			"

												this game is cool. simple gameplay and fun.but easily gets bored if you are playing alone. at least, for me it is (grinding the same stage.. and die and restarting the whole level again and grinding again and die, ALONE)maybe playing online would be better.. but uhh..no one is ever online?

												A rogue lite with mutiplayer and fluid gameplay. I definitely think some enemies seemed to hit for a lot of damage, but it never seemed unfair, I just felt really bad at the game, which is probably true. I have only tried it briefly, but I enjoyed the time I spent playing and after my campaign to at least try every steam game in my library I will come back and try to experience everything this game has to offer. Easily one of the best games I picked up this steam sale.			"

												Overall: Pretty goodLikes:- Has some RPG elements (e.g., stat points on level up; unlock pins to add bonuses to your character)- Has a decent amount of characters (classes) and pins to unlock, and a good amount of items to discover- Has daily challengesDislikes:- Gameplay is monotonous; kind of grind-y- The levels all feel very similar (despite the levels being procedurally generated, and despite there being several different types of levels).  Not enough variety.- Combat and movement are a little floaty			"
