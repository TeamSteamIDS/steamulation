												I think Magicka is probably the best mage-game out there. With its amazing sense of satirical humor, Magicka really does bring out out the laughs very often. The game also has an amazing blend of gameplay, music (which I must say is very good for most Paradox games), and graphics, which really is great for the environment, but especially for the Magicks. I think the only con for this game is the optimization, which makes the game run dreadfully on potatoes. And majorly, the bugs, probably the biggest downside to this game, makes some areas almost unplayable. However, the support from Paradox is very good and really puts the game up-the scale.			"

												When you start Magicka you don't know what you're up to. Cast your first spell, destroy something, kill yourself, burn down a house, melt cheese or just grill some sausages. This big adventure will require skills to learn to cast spells as fast as you can. This is only way to survive sometimes. On top of that you'd rather be smart to find the weak points of many different foes who will come across your journey. Having  troubles passing through an area? Just call some friends and they will help you in a fight or just cast the wrong spell on you :p. Well Magicka is a unique game without vampires ;-).I recommend that you also read the e-book : The Ninth Element. It is well written and fully in sync with the humour of the game.Some DLCs will give you a very hard time to defeat the bosses but that's where you should call your friends for online adventure.

												At first glance Magicka will look like a fun button mashing experience to have with your friends. If you look further you will see that there is more enjoyment to experience from Magicka than you could ever see from the trailers and screenshots. Magicka has created something that no game had ever done before (at least not well). From just a combination of buttons you can create powerful spells that bare strategy behind them. Of course there are a number of downsides and bugs to this game that when overlooked barely interfere with the gameplay at all and will usually result in a laugh. Make no mistakes, this game is for pure fun and joy.If you are looking for a game to play with your friends then look no further because this game is precisely what you need. You are getting a lot more fun out of this game than the price would intend you to believe. At such a low price you get hours of gameplay excluding all of the tremendous amount of downloadable content. Magicka is a co-op game that brings out the evil inside you and your friends. You can be on your way to defeating the infamous Grimnir when out beaming behind you is a beam of arcane from your companion aiming directly for you. Magicka really brings out the troll in most people and with countless of opportunities to kill you your friends will never get bored killing you and reviving you, killing and reviving you, killing and... yeah.For the serious competitors that don't like the limitations that Magicka: Wizard Wars gives you but are still interested in the humor and game mechanics of Magicka then the pvp or challenge modes will prove to be very effective gamemodes. As stated before Magicka has a very diverse field of strategy. For example someone will be coming at you with some fire so you have to quickly decide to cast a fire shield onto yourself to become immune to fire and then come at them with the most unexpected attacks in order to win a player versus player match. Challenge mode also includes some strategy and competition. Once you die in challenge you're done for and must start from square one. This means you can compete against your friends and see who is the greater wizard.Now I bring you the bugs, glitches and problems this game faces. The bugs in this game are usually hilarious to see happen to someone you are playing with and usually funny to watch when they happen to you. These are the small bugs that don't affect you in a huge way when playing Magicka but through your playthrough it is not unlikely to come across a big glitch that will require you to restart the game and have you go back to the last checkpoint. Another thing that could be considered a problem in this game is it's massive amount of downloadable content which could possibly be a deal breaker for you if you just hate paying just a bit extra for a full package. What I must reassure you with is the fact that none of the extra content is required to feel whole although it is a bit depressing when you look at your robes and see a horde of robes unable to play with. When it comes to actual level and gameplay dlc Paradox have done something I must praise them for. When playing online only the host needs the downloadable content in order to play it so essentially you could play every dlc level without ever paying a cent.This was the first game I had in my library and it's what got me interested in steam. So as someone who has had their lives changed (or ruined from the access to almost every modern pc game developed) I say buy this game whenever you get the chance. If you're interested in humour, magick, wizards, co-op, being a troll, strategic moves, unstrategic fails, using powerful combos that wipes everything off the screen causing you all to go back to the start of the game, competition or vampires that think no one knows that they are vampires then I highly recommend to try this game out regardless if you're a loner and can't find anyone to play it with.

												Updated Review.One of the most fun spellcasting systems I have ever seen! Knowing what to cast in what situation has never been more satisfying. The concept itself of combining elements to make spells had me sold, and the game itself managed to value that potential. The freedom of doing whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want whenever you want is amazing. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mana bars. No crappy skill trees. No cooldowns. Pure, unaltered, raw power, scaled with your skill level. Some DBZ style ♥♥♥♥ here.There are downsides though:- arrowhead did one of the crappiest netcodes in existence. Crashes happen. Connections don't. Hosting doesn't work most of the time. Multiplayer is such an amazing experience, be it Adventure, Challenge or Versus and crap like this stands in the way. If you can overlook that, this game is easily a 88/100, but with the crappy 1998 multiplayer, the score is rightfully dragged down to 74.- latency in this game is on steroids for some reasons, probably bad optimization- too few people play, and because of the crappy matchmaking system you need to know people's numbers and have friends that play- they pump out a ton of DLCs, something that I hate on principle- the devs aren't really fixing much. They're adding more stuff and grabbing lodsemoneh- limited to a max of 4 players per game (and I think having way more would've been so much fun; game is not made for this)The PROS:- the combinations you can do with those 8 elements is mindblowing- so much fun in all 3 modes: Adventure, Challenge and especially Versus if you are at a high skill level and monsters are too weak- skill level can be INSANE. One guy can take out 100 other wizards and 1000 mobs, without getting a scratch.- single player is a lot of fun: comedic story, fun missions, DLCs aren't bad, they're just short- various robes you can put on, with various abilities- at high levels of play, the PVP aspect is balanced, but at low-med levels, you can spam a few spells and always win since people don't know how to counter them- Versus mode is LODSA fun at high skill levels- huge skill roof- great physics and offense-defense mechanics- intuitive effects of your spellsI recommend it a lot, especially if it's on sale. About the DLCs? I'm not sure. Having the base game is enough imo, the DLCs are really worth it for the extra robes that you can have fun with.GET YER ROBES ON			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Magicka Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: RPG; Action; Innovative; Lighthearted; Fantasy My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 9-20 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers REVIEWMagicka is a very enjoyable game. Fun, funny, and challenging... it makes for a very amusing experience. The standard campaign is relatively brief, but there is a lot of DLC content. Some of it is cosmetic and can be ignored, but much of it provides actual content and you will likely want to pick it up to get the full experience. Magicka also makes for unique and enjoyable multiplayer gameplay, if you find some people to play with. As I alluded to, the innovation inherent in the main gameplay mechanics is the primary reason that Magicka is something worthy of being in your library. There isn’t much else quite like it, and absolutely nothing of the same caliber.  You have to rapidly press certain button combinations to cast various spells while simultaneously controlling your character and aiming in an isometric view. It is pretty unique and intense. I personally found it more comfortable with a controller, but it also works well with a standard keyboard and mouse set up.And while the exciting gameplay is definitely the soul of the game, it is also quite funny and charming too. The art style is very fitting to the mood of the game; and although the graphics aren’t the best, they feel appropriate. With the addition of the mumble language, silly plot, and hyperbole of blood/gore, the jovial nature of Magicka becomes clear. This lighthearted atmosphere synergizes well with the unique gameplay to create an experience that is incontestably fun.The key feature of the game being the innovative gameplay mechanics, I recommend anyone looking for some variety check it out if they haven’t already. I highly recommend playing with other people though; it’s much more fun and much less frustrating (since you can revive each other).Also the Versus and Survival modes are pretty fun, especially since the game supports local-coop (as in sitting on a couch with your friends, as it was in the old days).Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												This is one of my favorite games ever. Having said that, the learning curve is steep, but the game is flexible enough that everyone tends to develop their own style. It has a very simple magic system that lends itself to plenty of emergent complexity. The campaign is full of cultural references as is all of the DLC, making for a quirky and entertaining overall bundle. The challenges are hard enough that I still haven't beaten all of them on my own, so the game has content for all skill levels.			"

												This game is just simply awesome. Dialogs are just hilarious, just try to ask every NPCs a thing, you won't regret it. There is a lot of sci-fi/fantasy references in all the game. The story is really funny too.The solo mod is fun, if you wanna talk to every NPCs and try to follow the story but i prefer to warn you, if you try to play with friends, it's nearly impossible to stay alive. And that's the fun of the multi, you have the friendly fire so you can cast spells to push your friends on the ennemies, or in the gaps. But don't worry, they can use resurrection's spells on you ;)The mechanics of the games are awesome too, you have 8 elements of magick and you can combine them into an infinite possibility of spells.I highly recommend it, even if you can only play in solo.11/10			"

												How I've managed to go so long without finishing Magicka is beyond me. This is a truely amazing indie title that is still top notch even after all these years. To begin with the controls are fiddly but once you start to memerize your combos for spells it becomes second nature. While the game is very fun playing solo, it's meant to be played with your buddies, you can blow each other up, electricute, all sorts. There is hours upon hours of fun to be had here. The story mode is a good length, twelve chapters and each one consisting of 3 or 4 different levels with each of them having their own boss at the end.I would be surprised if 99% of Steam user's don't already own Magicka, but for that 1%, go out and buy it. This is a joy to behold.			"

												Fun action isometric game, where you can joyfully/accidentally kill each other or yourself in up to 4-players co-op.If you are looking at Magicka 2, try this one (if you missed it).Good+ Fun / Humor (most critical part of game, which makes it really good)+ Local and 'Remote' Co-Op (not so many games with real Co-Op these days)+ Good story (not much of a 'story', but you will not be bored)+ Unique approach to spell casting (you should mix elements yourself to find ultimate weapon)+ Challenges and PVP arena (nice addition to overall picture)Good? Bad? Who knows?+/- A lot of DLC (while DLCs are good, they are not free :( )Bad- Bugs / Crashes (especially in DLCs during multiplayer)- No SteamPlay support (Windows only)Bottom line: get it during sale with all DLCs pack (base game worth full price for sure)			"

There are a lot of levels and spells to discover , secret rooms and easter eggs , staffs , guns and achivements. Its a decent game , the only bad thing is the amount of DLCs on the storepage.

												Magicka is one of my favorite games, and one of the few that does a good job making you feel like a wizard.The Good:The crown jewel of Magicka's design is its spell creation system.  It was not the first video game to allow you to design spells by selecting the path, area of effect, effects, and intensities.  The Elder Scrolls: Arena had that in 1994, and there may be earlier examples I don't know about.  It may be the first to allow you to create spells on the fly.  It is also noteworthy for having no limits based on a mana pool or cooldowns.  Instead, the main balancing forces are enemy resistances and the destructive power of your own spells.  It's very easy to make a mistake and kill yourself or your allies.Magicka is also well known and loved for its voice acting.  Everyone speaks a mix of broken Swedish and jibberish.  Vlad is an over the top Romanian vampire in denial.  Death and Fafnir also sound great.  I would love to know what sort of processing they performed on their voices.Magicka has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.  It's bombastic, complex, and memorable.  Unfortunately it may be hard to appreciate with it often being drowned out by the sounds of the chaos around you.The Bad:Magicka is very buggy, even by modern PC gaming standards.  Crashes and hangs are common.  Weapons and staves, which may be unique, frequently clip through the map and disappear into the void forever.  Players lose connection in online games often.  The DLC is even worse.  The Stars Are Left has an unpatched bug on the last level, where if you don't pass through the doors in the order the developers expected you to, not only does it crash, but it corrupts your save so you have to start that DLC over.  The fact that is still unpatched is shameful, by the way.Difficulty does not scale based on the number of players.  The main game isn't that difficult to get through solo, but some of the DLC is very hard without a full party.  I found the final fights in Dungeons and Daemons and The Stars Are Left to be impossible to solo.			"

												The 76 metascore is the result of what Magicka was when it came out: A hidden gem executed okey-ishly and with some bugs. But that's way too far from the game Magicka is today...Which is one of the best Local-Multiplayer/Co-Op/Versus games in all of Steam. I was a late buyer so I got to skip all the supposed bug-fest, but let me tell you this: Right now, Magicka is a blast to play with friends. Be it local or online multiplayer, co-op campaign or versus or survival, with keyboards or with controllers or any mix of all of the above. Aside from the super-robust level of multiplayer options, the game's campaigns (main and all of the DLCs) are amazing. The main campaign is filled with easter eggs, little details everywhere and stupendous and magnificent narrative comedy. I'll be frank and admit I haven't finished most DLCs yet (as I wait until all my buds can get together to finish them in one sitting), but I can tell you that The Stars Are Left, The Other Side of the Coin and Dungeons And Daemons are worth every penny.The quality for your money also applies for multiplayer-oriented DLC, which is cheap and adds lots of cool themes, robes with different stats and abilities and weapons that range from The Doctor's Screwdriver to Ak-47s and of course a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of staffs.The gameplay is a bit hard to explain as there are truly no games like Magicka: Top down isometric spell casting & mixing shmup with always-on friendly fire is the shortest way to put it. The long one is: You see your wizard from a top-down-with-an-angle perspective, you can cast 8 elements: Fire, Life, Electricity, Water, Cold, Earth, Arcana/Death, and ""shield"" which gives any combination of elements a defensive use of sorts. All this elements are on their own very weak but once you combine them you can get deadly creative. From mini-volcanoes that light enemies on fire and explode when touched to steam-compressed mines that send foes (and friends) flying away Team Rocket-style to Death-electric beams that freeze to freaking Meteor Showers to casting Death Itself (whom kills someone on-screen at random).Now remember that the game has always-on friendly fire. Yup, it's a madhouse.If Mario Party destroys friendships, Magicka will obliterate blood-related family ties. But in the nicest, funniest and best ways.As a lover of couch co-oping, well-executed games, friendship, and... well, games in general, I urge you, TRY MAGICKA. It's very unlikely you'lle ever regret it.Unless you have no friends, of course. Being burned/electrocuted/bombed-away/exploded into tiny pieces accidentally on purpose is not as much fun when a complete stranger does it.			"

												I don't think I've ever been so in love with a video game before...It's buggy, horribly optimized, and suffers from such bad models and animations that they make a joke of it (traveling through landscapes that showcase herds of sheep-facades propped up in the pastures, or riding upon noble steeds who seem to be from the finest wooden toy horse stock), and you won't give a damn about any of it.  The multiplayer is nearly impossible to set up and laggy almost to the point of unplayability once you do, but it's such vibrant, stupid and chaotic fun that you'll ignore such minor negatives in favor of the grander scheme of bumbling wizards.The innovative magic system is profoundly complex and joyously destructive to experiment with, and there's a very scientific glee involved with working out your trademark spell(s) or finding the coolest combinations to solve a particular problem.You'll also learn to develop a newfound respect for such veterans of the wizardry craft as Gandalf or Dumbledore...  When you recognize just how much obscenely destructive force you have at your unwitting fingertips, it's always impressive when you DON'T manage to disintegrate/melt yourself and everyone in a 4-mile radius when attempting to do something.While the game is fun enough on its own and the writing is of absolutely stellar class, with actually funny wit and some really quite unexpectedly subtle jokes and twists, this game excels at multiplayer.  Yes, the horribly-irritating-to-get-started multiplayer.My deepest recommendation is to play this game with 3 friends, preferably with none of you knowing your wizard staves from your rump bristles.  Idiocy and a vast array of destructive weaponry often lead to the best of times, and ignorance of your own strength is the perfect excuse for ""accidentally"" slaughtering everyone on your team.The game starts you off with a resurrection spell, and as with all spells and magic in this game there is neither a mana cost nor a cooldown of any sort...  And you'll be very happy that it is this way, as roughly 98% of player deaths are either self-induced or from friendly fire.  Or some wonderfully flashy combination of the two.Indeed, the greatest danger you face is not the foe in front of you, but rather your overeagerness to simultaneously shock, burn, freeze and meltingly explode the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into his primary colors.  Positively philsophical, really.I have never for a moment regretted purchasing this game.  Indeed, my saddest moment was when it finally ended...  for the second or third time.  Along with all the DLC missions.			"

												There are not many games out there, that make a great wizardry game. They include basic spells with no creativity, no humor, and those ANNOYING magic bars! But, There is one game though, that is very different. Magicka offers fantastic creativity with your spells, as you have 8 elements to choose from: Water, Fire, Earth, Cold, Arcane, Lightning, Shield, and Life. And out of all those elements you can do 5 elements at a time to do spells at people, offering great creativity in the game. For example, you can combine Earth 3 times, and then you can do 2 fire, or Water and Cold and Water and Cold/Ice,Ice,  or Arcane And Water. Some elements don't mix like Lightning and Earth, but can combine 2 for 1, such as Water+Fire=Steam. The game also allows you to combine different spells together in order to make... ""Magicks."" Magicks are combinations of spells to make ""Different"" that are bigger and better, such as... ""Summon Death, Meteor Shower, Summon Thunder, Teleport and more!"" The game is full of humor in cutscenes and gameplay about violence, logic, references and silly stuff that happen all the time! Finally, the game has NO MAGIC BARS!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY!!!!!!!!!!! Finally a mage game that doesn't have magic bars! Screw swords and hammers used all the time! Spam Meteor balls, Chain lightning Goblins, use Force Powers on Evil vampires, and EVEN MORE WITHOUT LIMIT!!!!!! The game has fun single player and multiplayer, offering co-op and fun at the same time. But the game is sometimes full of bugs such as going out of the map, character glitching, and others. The game is fun and I recommend it to people who like to push the limit with magic, have comedy and epic wizardy at the same time. So now guys i got to g- OH SHOOT!  You fell into a hole!

												This game really can't be taken seiously, with all of its references to other movies and games, and dry comedy  THIS IS SPARTA!!!! .  Just got an Assualt Rifle in a fantasy game, somehow.  Comedic story-telling aside, Magicka's elemental magic system ironically has a facinating science behind it, with many combinations of the 8 different types of Magic (Lightning, Water, Life, Arcane, Cold, Fire, Earth, and Shield). The game allows you to mix together different spells to form more potent and lethal spells (Water+Fire=Steam, Water+Cold=Ice), as well as enchant your weapon, cast upon yourself, or create an area of effect. With a ""Magicks"" spellbook, the game allows you to increase your speed, confuse an enemy, or summon a thunderstorm, and many others. The game also rewards and punishes you for different enemies, as you can electrocute enemies doused in water or wearing metal armor, or freeze wet enemies, or burn tree spirit golem things.I enjoy playing this game, and would definitely recomend or even buy Magicka for a friend.TL;DR, mix spells and burn things to the ground. Ice+Ice+Ice+Ice+Earth = ONE HIT K.O.  "

												I once thought about being a wizard, then I bought MAgicka and killed all my friends over and over because that's how Magicka defines teamwork. The game consists of combining things like rocks and fire and stuff to make magic attacks that you kill enemies with, but killing your friends is more likely because friends are usually dumb and get in the way of your attacks so they deserve it. buttmunches. You get 8 elements because any less would make you a subpar wizard. you can buttonmash up to 5 of them together, then either cast on yourself, cast in front of you, or just cast everywhere because aiming is for casuals and tryhards. In addition to this, you pick up books because this is like a library sort of, in that you pick up books. The books have element combinations in them that can be used to make spells that do different things than usual. for example. you combine earth, ""arcane"" element and fire and shoot a fancy meteor fire rock bomb with death magic attached. Then you type those three elements again and cast them with space instead of shooting them, and it turns into the ""haste"" spell and makes you all fast like that gonzales mouse on looney toons. Then there are lots of things and it turns out vlad's lying don't believe him he really is a vampire.Also the game is funny because they make references to everything like Zelda and 300 and everything else you could make a reference too.

												This is an amazing game! Finally a game where you can use your imagination to create different spells to suite different situations whether to freeze your opponents or set them on fire, why not combine ice and fire into steam and boil them to death!It has funny dialogues and an interesting story line. However, the only draw back is the amount of bugs present. It is not well polished even after all the patches it is still buggy and crashes alot. I wish the developers would have fixed the game instead of abandoning it to create a sequel! But when you get over the tremendous amount of bugs and crashes you will find a very fun game.			"

												Magicka, follows in the tradition of a really cool top-down RPG. As a D&D RPG it does not disappoint, and the graphics are crisp, detailed and very well done. I thought going into this game it would be more cartoonish; Thankfully, I was completely wrong. The dialogue is what you would expect of a quality RPG, the learning curve is designed to make the game accessible to gamers of all stripes, and the story is interesting. All in all a value bundle. My only real con for this game, is the sheer amount micro-transaction DLC, such as; Individual sets of armor. Is this really necessary. The developers made a quality game, does it need to be micro-transactioned all to hell too? Other than that, pick it up if you like RPG's, you should have a good time with it.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.This game is a surprisingly good and addictive game.It comes down to that you're basically a wizard character with an arsenal of 6 elemental spells you can use at any time.But that's just the tip.the spell casting system in this game is unbelievably clever. Allowing you to combine different types of elements to create new spells - the manual totes that there are thousands of possibilitiesThe game does seem kind of difficult to start and may be frustrating, but once you get the mechanic down, it is just plain fun worth the time & It has an online co-op where you can battle with up to 4 friends and even combine spells with themMagicka is at its best when you an at least one buddy are prepared to go on a satirical journey through a mock RPG land and laugh.This game is not designed to be overly challenging or serious, colors but fun. And it succeeds with colors.			"

												While writing I realised I made a rather large review, for the short version check my conclusion at the end.This without a doubt is the best wizard game i have ever played, sort of unfortunatly. I have always wanted a wizard game where you feel powerful, being able to destroy hundreds of enemies with unparraled power, but the problem i have always encountered is mana bars, a system I have always despised for reasons I wont go into here, or in the case of some games (Lichdom battlemage) being aimed for challenge.Here is where Magicka comes with no mana and is aimed for fun and funny moments. It uses its element systam allowing you to make your own spells, while also allowing more designed Magickas like Storms or summoning Zombies. Its all I could have asked for, and is great fun and is actually funny.Here comes the problems, it is designed for co-op with 2 to 4 players and enemy encounters dont change in anyway between the two, this means that riding solo is insanly difficult, also it is really easy to die due to its chaotic nature, its balanced in multiplayer with players being able to infinitly instanly revive buddies with no real reprocussions, single player you get one revive between checkpoints which are stretched out between many large enemy encounters. This leads to you needing to use overpowered robes (Sort of like choosing a new build) or cheesing the game solo, especially the final boss who is tanky, gives you little room to move, and has a insta kill black hole attack which sucks you in. But I still went on to complete the game by myself because it is that good.If you have any interest in a wizard game buy it, and try to get your friends to play since that is the superior experience, but even with all its flaws in single player it is still worth getting.

												If you want a game that takes itself seriously, this isn't for you.If you want a game that you can enjoy to the fullest on your own, this isn't for you either.Granted, while I usually do prefer playing games with friends, Magicka was really far from what my expectations of it were, and more often than not feels like a bit of a wasted potential for something that could've been really interesting in several ways. That said, I suppose it might just have been better that they didn't try to make this serious.Nevertheless, with my complaints aside, Magicka manages to make any group of friends have loads of fun for as long as the story lasts, and the whole element combination system is really, really amusing to use, moreover with other people to do it with. I can't praise the comic relief ""plot"" or the presentation much, but for what it's worth, I don't really regret buying it!			"

												I've only played the game for a little over 25 hours but so far the game has been a blast. The voice-overs are hilarious and the combat system is pretty cool because part of succeeding in this game requires you to mix elements properly. A few observations...Pro:- combat system is unique- the game has humor- the various dlc offer adequate content at an affordable price (thanks to bundles/sales)- killing your friends (accident or not) is always fun- lots of references hidden within the gameCon:- one achievement was broken (now removed - that's a good thing)- minor issues with connectivity			"

												I played both Magicka 1 and Magicka 2, and I'd simply recommend this game better. This is good for players with a good muscle memory. Magicka 2 is more noob friendly, and its watered down a lot. In this game you must know how to spam. Really you can't just spam whatever you must know exactly how to spam or else you'd be healing enemies. I like combining Steam and Lightning or Ice and Lightning in this game. You cannot do that in Magicka 2.This game requires a good strategy after a certain chapter! You can't just go and spam spells anymore. Some enemies appear having a weakness agains one or two elements and you really need to use it. In magicka 2 you just use Death + Fire aoe to win. No brainer.Humour is great, you're op, you can die of your op-ness, story is better than in M2 etc.The only cons I FIND annoying are-Multiplayer laggy as hell in versus(or in general)-Spell icon appearing/conjuring feels a bit unintuitive, but this is fixed if you know what you cast actually.-Graphics feel a bit outdated ( But really who the hell cares?)-It feels better done than magicka 2..

												DO YOU LIKE MAGIC? DO YOU LIKE GAMES? ARE YOU BORED OF ALL THIS ""REALISM"" AND ""MANA"" AND ""COOLDOWNS""? THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!The point of Magicka is that you're a massively over powered wrecking machine in disguise. Well, its fairly obvious actually but that doesn't stop the more rowdy enhabitants of this typically generic fantasy world trying to ruin your day. Its quite litterally YOU Vs THE WORLD and for once its not you who's totally screwed. Magicka utterly refuses to take it's self seriously. Any hint of seriosity was burnt, stamped on and fired out the window at high velocity. This game is jampacked full of refrences, jokes and randomised hillarity.Overall rating: *****			"

												Lots of games punish you hard for being a wizard. At the start of the game, you get your one or two spells, and then you have to pretend you're a fighter or run away useless.This is not one of those games. In this game, you actually feel like a wizard. The only consequences for letting off as many of your most overpowered spells as you can is that maybe one of your friends gets caught in the blast. But you're a mother effing wizard, so resurrect the poor sucker and keep going.There is a story, but the game doesn't really expect you to pay attention to it. You're a murder hobo on a quest to save the world by killing whatever happens to be in your way. But that's not the point of the game.The point of the game is the magic system. It's by far the most unique way of handling magic I've ever seen. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you get the hang of it it is supremely satisfying to let of a huge string of different spells in quick succession, subtlety tweaking your spells to suit the situation.Or you could just spam QFASA over and over, if that's your thing.Final note: the game is really designed to be played in co-op. You can play single player, but you're missing out on the full experience.			"

												Where to start, where to start...The insanely intricate magic system that offers a crazy amount of different spell combinations? The quirky humour that is cram-packed with references to popular culture and everything geek? The endearing colourful graphics that turn every second of looking at this game into pure joy? Or maybe the never-ending challenges, be it through several great DLCs or the long list of fun achievements? Because yes, this game, unlike so many, offers achievements that are actually that, real achievements that are either painfully challenging or simply extremely fun to get.Yet of course, while Magicka offers all that, it only truly unfolds its full potential when played with others. Personally I enjoy co-op most (accidental, yet sometimes not so unintentional, killing of your friends guaranteed thanks to friendly fire), but versus mode as well offers a good deal of entertainment.There is literally no excuse not to get and enjoy Magicka if you like video games and most certainly a bunch of good laughs.

												Magicka is a game were you play as a wizard, but not like every other magic game. Instead of having a few set spells. You are in control of eight elements. Using these eight elements Water, Lightning, Life, Arcane, Shield and Earth. You can blow enemies to bits.That’s not even scratching the surface of what you can do.I definitely had a blast playing this game with my friends. Even though we spent most of the timeshocking each other. I would recommend this game any day!   "

The casting mechanic is 10/10 combining elements has never been this fun even when you killed yourself 'cause you were wet and shocked yourself to death in a rush of panic.Despite all tho it has a few downsides, like the loading screens in multiplayer, the random non appearing book at the start, and the horribly made dlcs.Still i enjoyed every hour i spent playing, i do recommend this title to everyone that may find it interesting enough, give it a shot lads, you'll have great fun.

												This game was the biggest pain in my butt. I couldn't log into Steam without being attacked with constant ""Magicka today!"" ""Saturday, 10 o'clock, Magicka!"" or ""Achievements for Vietnam!"" or ""Today without dying on hard!"" and so on. I couldn't sleep nor eat knowing that I have still few achievements left to earn and a friend overeager to get them all.It was a pleasure to play scenario. This game has a brilliant plot, is extremally funny, filled with lots of references to movies, games, books, voice acting is a masterpiece. One of the best parts of gameplay are spells mechanics - there are 8 elements from which you can craft spells, some of them combined can make new elements, others can't be connected, enemies are resistant for ones and can be easily killed with others.Player has decent amount of useful Magicks available and plenty of ways to kill himself and his friends.

Can provide you good 15 to 20 hours of gameplay to finish the adventure mode story (minus times you die over and over)Cons: No inventory system, you can only have one wand/weapon at a time Can be buggy Dropped wands/weapons can clip through the map and be gone forever, even unique ones A lot more challenging if played soloOverall Rating:7/10			"

												Don't be fooled by the underwhelming screenshots shown on the store page. This game is high paced, action packed, and incredibly fluid. Adventure with your friends for maximum enjoyment.The game utilizes eight elements which you can combine to create an enormous number of effects. You and your friends can ""cross the beams"" and have mega powered attacks, massive explosions, and any number of other crazy effects.The story is a bit quirky but it's actually quite entertaining. There are ""twists,"" drama, humor, and even the occasional moment of somber seriousness. The game can get quite difficult, and every battle leaves you feeling like an action movie hero.It's a great game on it's own, but it's an unbeatable experience with your friends.			"

												Spoiler alert, Vlad is a vampire. you can pick up your jaw from the floor now.Now in all seriousness, magicka is a very rare gem. No level ups, no inventories of partners, and no seriousness. Several game and meme refferences that will make you laugh aloud, cringe or facepalm (or a combination of all 3), you'll obliterate your enemies AND your allies-friends included- combining a variety of elements to make spells. Your only method of attacking efficiently is using the spells, and the combinations are very straight fowoard. Examples include earth and shield to make a barrier of rocks, or fire and water to cause vapor. you'll die a lot (mostly from accidently blowing yourself up or walking off into death pits), but you'll enjoy your adventure all the way through a gorgeous fun game with a great soundtrack.

												This little gem throws you into the robes of a wizard and sets you on a noble quest to save the world of Midgård from destruction. As a wizard, you are given power over 8 different elements, from which you may cast a vast array of spells by combining them in different ways. This mechanic is very well thought out, with elemental opposites that may or may not result in death if you're not careful, as well as radically different effects for different combinations providing plenty of depth in your spell casting. There are, however, some spell combinations which are obviously more powerful than others, oftentimes leaving no reason to use the others. Despite this, alternate spells do come in handy every once in a while, so don't be afraid to experiment with them.In regards to the story I'm not going to say much so that you can experience it all for yourself, but suffice it to say that it's very much an adventure of epic proportions and theres lots of content to enjoy. Every location and every boss feels unique and is fun to battle. While the adventure is generally supposed to be pretty serious, it's delivered in a silly and lighthearted manner, including humorous narration and funny NPC dialogue. Furthermore, the soundtrack fits in at every moment of the game - it's reminiscent of Lord of the Rings and it's certainly no worse for wear because of it. Booming and powerful when an action scene calls for it, quaint and quiet when it's calm, and with several other tracks to fill in moments of the game that don't quite fit into either category.Finally, there are several modes you can play with your friends and accidentally (read: not really on accident) kill your friends with a spell gone awry or something else. Always great fun to gib your buddies late on a friday night - and yes, if it's not your thing there are settings that change the gore. The game allows you to play the story mode in co-op, and there is also a ""versus"" mode, but I've yet to try the latter.In short, a great game to play on your own, fantastic with friends.Now hurry up and get it! Before they run out of cheese!			"

												Magicka is crazy, fun, messy, stupid, wacky, funny, and sometimes hard enough to push you to be creative.The story is good enough to make you want to finish it.The multiplayer is incredibly fun. You'll enjoy killing your friends the foes with your friends by elaborating machiavelic elaborated plans to blow them up in creative ways.And if you, accidentally kill a friend or yourself, because sometimes it really is an accident, that's ok ! Dying is part of the Magicka gameplay, just use resurect and voilà, let's go make a mess again.			"

												Amazing game when it came out. But terrible DLC policy. DLC is never on sale but they keep adding more and they keep placing the package on sale. You always get screwed over for buying the DLC sooner than later. No respect for customer loyalty. Missing 6 of the 17 DLC? Still costs more for that 6 than the whole bundle on sale. But you won't get a second key to give to a friend. Always nickle and dimming you.			"

The computer uses a unique system for attacks:You have 5 element slots and what you put in those 5 spots determines what goes on, like:Water+Frost=Ice boltsArcane+Defence=Landminesetc.It is a fantastic way to spend your time and a recomend it.

												Magicka is hardly a game to reccomend. It's full of good ideas and awesome humor, but also full of bugs and technical issues. Can be a lot of fun sometimes, and a lot of frustration other times.Friendly fire is what makes this game interesting, its chaos is its strenght and weakness, that can lead either to laugh or cry.Overall, it's an original game, you won't find anything else like it for now, consider it only for a really low price, like a bundle or something; and remember that if you don't have friends to play with, it will be a total waste.Be aware that this game often runs poorly even with a good machine, and random bugs of literally any kind can easily ruin the experience.

												[+8] Clever element-combination system. You use various elements to make a composite spell. For example; use rock and arcane to make an arcane bomb, then add fire to make an incendiary arcane bomb. Combine water with cold to make ice shards, throw in lightning to make electric ice shards.[+4] Slapstick humour. Casting spells is the very definition of spray-and-pay, and since it's designed for co-op, you will likely have lots of fun setting your friends on fire.[+2] Also a funny story. Silly, enjoyable medieval romp, a bit like Discworld with less subtlety.[-2] Problems. While it's obvious why the funny bugs (like bouncing weapons) were kept in, it crashes a little more frequently than the average game. Also organising co-op matches can be a pain sometimes.[-2] Bit of an eyesore. Environments bland, models and animations a bit sloppy. No real distinct art style.OVERALL SCORE: +10			"

												I can't recommend it enough, it doesn't take itself seriously, but who cares, i have player a ton of time in it (look at my play time) and i didn't got bored even for a sec! In singleplayer it is fun, but where it shines REAAAAALLLY!!! is co-op, the fact that friendly fire is on, and you can kill your friend anytime you want to take revenge because he set you on fire accidentially, you can! And it wont cause any problem cause you can just revive him anytime (well if you want to).Game is buggy, true, but there isn't that big or critical bug left, only small ones. 99% of the bugs and glitches are hilarious and not rage-enducing or something like that. I VERY, VERY, VERY!!! much recommend you to get this game, get a friend with you and play it, there is so much content in it for such low price, and dlc-s doesn't cost that much either, they have realistic prices (unlike payday2 dlc prices..) TL;DR Single player is 8/10 co-op is 10+/10 game isn't serious, but VERY hilarious, and funny, you will just cry of laugh almost everytime if you play with someone else.

												Magicka is a lot of fun, the spell system is brilliant and dynamic, letting you combine Earth, Wind, Water, Shield, Fire, Ice, Lightning and Healing in any combination you like. In COOP the game really shines, as you combine each other's spells and wipe out hordes of enemies. The humour and presentation is great too! Not many RPG-esque games let your wizard wear a Warhammer 40K armour suit and wield an M16 afterall! Get it!			"

												Although I admire the novel control system in Magicka, I didn't enjoy playing this game. It feels too much like work. And... I kind of suck at it.I think I'd be more efficient and struggle less with a few more levels of play, but I don't feel compelled to keep trying. The gameplay is uncreative ARPG, and I find the humor too juvenile to entertain. The warmed-over ""Swedish Chef"" mock-language is painful and unfunny.I do think Magicka has a good pricing model. The base game is cheap ($10, and on sale for practically free all the time), and the DLC is affordable. You can keep paying for more content at your own pace until you get bored. This works for me. Good system. It's also a decent ""beer and pretzels"" co-op game; a way to kill a couple hours with friends.So... given the low price point, if you are looking for a co-op game, I would recommend Magicka with these reservations. It wasn't my cup of tea, but for a few bucks, it's hard to pass up.			"

												Loads of fun. This game is packed to the brim with replayability, from the many insane and wacky robes to don to the online Co-op with friends; all it takes is one badly aimed rock to start an all-out war amongst yourselves. There's loads of Great DLC aswell, adding new adventures and items to the table.The Graphics can sometimes look a bit dated, but that's on rare occasions. the rest of the game has that isometric hack'n'slash feel of games like Diablo or fallout. Plus, you can mix and match your different spell types to create amazing combos, like lightning that burns people, or a flaming ball of death, or even land mines.I give this game an 8/10, would Wizard again.

Magicka Left ArmI believe most gamers know what ""Nintendo Thumb"" is. For those who don't, it is when you've been been using the D-pad or Gamepad for such a long time that blisters and swellings started to appear on your thumbs or other fingers. Well, having mentioned ""Nintendo Thumb"", may I introduce a new term to you - the ""Magicka Left Arm"". This ""Magicka Left Arm"" is the situation where you've been playing Magicka for such a long time that, when you wake up the very next day, your left arm started to become sore and numb and, in extreme situations such as mine, you cannot move your left arm for the whole day. Yes, this has happened and I shall tell you why.First of all, allow me to begin by describing the game mechanism. It is not wrong to say that this game is based on the concept of conventional Diablo-like RPG. You control a character, nameless and hooded, and you roam around the top-down world by pointing and clicking at locations with your mouse. You are free to run around and whack enemies using your melee weapon, though it is not recommended to do so as you will die like a popcorn. What you can, and should, do is to cast Spells and Magick. Notice how Magick is spelt? It is, of course, different from your typical Diablo-type Magic. In Magicka, Spells and Magicks do not require mana. They are formed and casted based upon 8 different basic elements: Water, Life, Shield, Cold, Lightling, Arcane, Earth and Fire. Each of these elements are bonded to they keys ""Q, W, E, R, A, S, D, F"" respectively. (There are two advanced elements: Steam and Ice, formed by combining Water + Fire and Water + Ice respectively) You can cast Spells, such as the ""Super Steam Lightling Beam"" by first pressing the combination ""Q, F, Q, F, Q, F, A, S"" and then followed by right clicking. In that manner, a strong beam will shoot towards the direction your mouse is pointing towards. There are many others, and you can experiment more with them once you are in game, though I believe this will give you a general concept on spell casting.As for Magicks, they are special magics that can be casted by forming a specific elemental combination and then pressing <space>. For example, if I want to summon an elemental, I will have to press ""S, E, D, Q, F, S, <space>"". However, one single elemental is too weak and it will be annihilated with in a matter of seconds. So, what did I do? More elementals, of course! After starting the game for a while, I can be seen pressing this elemental summoning sequence repeatedly. I'll be trying to cast 20 or so elementals in a couple of seconds, watch them fight to their deaths while hiding in a shield (opps), and repeat the process. And that, my dear reader, is where I got my ""Magicka Left Arm"" after 6 hours of game play straight. Don't get me wrong. I am not saying that you have to spam elementals like me. I personally like to take the easy way out, and watching a bunch of kamikaze comandos fight for me can be quite entertaining. There are many other ways to complete the game, and I will give you the liberity to figure it out for yourself. But then and again, you can be quite certain that your left hand will be quite busy throughout the game. This the fun part of the game, and this experience is what make this game worthwhile. The graphics is not much of a looker (look at the screenshots) and the jokes, though initially creative and great, can get quite cheesy in the long run. Great game if you want to enjoy something light and humourous, though watch out for the ""Magicka Left Arm"". You've been warned - spell casting can be extremely addictive.			"

												Magicka is an action-adventure game,  where you play as a magician who still needs to learn how to use  spell combinations. The real objective of the game is: that you need to defeat the evil with your mighty spells and side-arm.In my opinion the game looks like Runescape (in a positive way). Magicka starts with eight spells at the beginning and you’ll get a staff and a sword to wield, there are also another powerful weapons which the creatures could drop or hidden somewhere over the map.In the game there are evil creatures that were made by a powerful wizard, Grimnir. The wizard wanted to spread eternal peace to the world but the order expelled him because of his ambitions. Grimnir was imprisoned at the World’s End. My first time I’ve played Magicka I needed to go into a room below me, but I was just stupid enough that I didn’t read what they asked me to do. So I’ve spent like four minutes of my live to find the damn room. The reason: there was a party that was made for me so I was in a hurry because some guys wanted to eat all the cheese there were all by themselves. I aren’t a great fan of cheese so I didn’t care if they ate it. My impressions I’ve made so far.The game is made with sarcastic jokes, which I didn’t found funny (except one tip: drink not when you drive, is that a tip for a game that has no cars)? I’ve played the game alone until chapter four and I died like eight times, with a few rages. I was proud of myself that I could beat the first chapter. Got pain in my hand, because of spamming casting the spells upon the enemy.The Pros and Cons of the game.Pros:-	The game is fun to play with friends or with people all around the world-	The graphics are admirable -	The game got trading cards -	The developers tried his best to make some jokes, but it didn’t work out somehow-	The game got some nice background soundsCons: -	The game is hard to play, when you play the game all by yourselves-	The voice of the people sounds like they are drunk all the time-	Sometimes the screen turns black when you start the game, but you can find an easy fix that will prevent it from  hapening on youtubeI’d say give this game a chance and buy it only if you play the game online with friends or with people all around the world.

												Ehhh I'm in the middle. The gameplay is kind of repetitive and boring but on the other hand there are a lot of cheeky references to many different things LOTR and Steam itself included, but it reaches out further than that. The humor is pretty tongue and cheek too which is nice I guess. Hilarity ensues when playing with friends who would much rather kill you for the items you possess than actually defeating enemies. I suppose I had fun with it but I have a hard time convincing myself to play it more. Despite this I cannot give the game a negative review. I think this is one of those things where if you think you'd like it you probably will, but if you think it is not your thing you most likely wouldn't enjoy it.			"

												Magicka was quite the entertaining game that I didn't expect it to be. I expected a short 5 hourish game that would be fun for like the first 2 hours. I was very wrong. I ended up playing through the whole adventure mode of Magicka with a friend, so in co-op, and it was quite a bit of fun.To start, Magicka has great graphics and spell effects and animations. Everything about the game looks good. Another thing that makes Magicka so good is that there are so many different orb combinations to make different spells, effects, and Magicka. When I mean there are so many different combinations, I mean that there are legit possibly over 100 differnt unique and tiered spells and Magicka you can cast. Not only that, but each spell combination often features its own unique graphical effect and animation. Couple this with some other weather and terrain, the game has a really a super in depth spell casting system.Magicka has a pretty random story, but it is pretty funny in places. The gameplay is pretty entertaining and the difficulty level increases perfectly for the most part. Although some times there are some abnormally easy bosses while some of the mob fights were annoyingly hard. Overall, Magicka does a very good job with checkpoints too so you do not feel super punished when you screw around and die. As I mentioned before, I played this game with a friend. I strongly recommend that you play Magicka with a friend or two or three because there are so many little things that make playing with more people more fun. For one, the revive is a clutch coop spell and there are so many more spells that can be comboed.Overall a good and fun game that you should play with your friends. I really did not find any flaws to this game apart from the occasional crash.Rating: 8.8/10Recommend Price: $5 or under			"

												A game of hilarious drunken wizards on a quest for glory. The spell casting system is one of the coolest things ever, and the combinations go on and on. I highly recommend using keyboard and mouse, as I played local co-op with a friend on controller, and my spell casting was much faster. One of the best wizard games I have played!			"

Magicka! Oh how I hate your countless glitches, and yet I still continue to play.I love this game. From its outrageous stories all the way to its own language. Great character design along with a rather humorous story.  (I loved the characters so much I created my own Magicka Wizard's Robe custom to me from my own bed sheets http://imgur.com/NS4Iv0e ) As I mentioned before, Magicka has its glitches, bugs and unbarable lag at times. I suppose if you are me stationed in New England with garbage wifi playing with an Estonian and someone in Britain, you are bound to run into issues. WATCH OUT THOUGH!  If you find any fridges in a cave, be careful opening the door. ;POne thing I learned from this game, Wizards like to eat Cheese and Sausage. Who would of known?Not one of those overpriced games you see in the showcase at Gamestop, so give it a try. If you enjoy it I urge you to purchase the DLC's!			"

												This game is madness and doesn't try to hide it. As often as not you blow your teammates into tiny bits but all the while it is a really fun experience and you even get ♥♥♥♥ done if you take the time and think strategically. The magic system takes a little getting used to but if you've mastered some useful combos and spells nothing can stand in your way, well except *spoiler alert* Yetis, which bite your head off.This game is best played together with other people so get some friends(up to three players + you) and show them that there is still some magic in this world. (...by roasting, toasting, burning, piercing, impaling, drowning, [insert violent means of death here] them :D)PS: And remember: Vlad is no vampire!			"

												My best friend gifted me this game after she said I'd enjoy this. At first glance I watched gameplay and thought ''Huh, this seems pretty good.'' She gifted me this and I say that she's made me love this game.Pros: +Humorous dialogue that is sure to make you have a giggle or laugh.+Pretty good story line.+Some of the best jokes I've seen in a video game+Lovely music with the graphics+Pretty fun and interesting spell mechinacsCons:-This game has framerate issuses up the wall, which can effect some users. It's not an issuse to me entirely but to others. -Some spell combos are pretty over powered. But the same time can kill you if you're not careful.-Its sometimes hard to see what effects you have applied to you and sometimes it can get you killed.-Controls take some time to get used to.I've yet to play Multiplayer so I will add this in later~			"

This is a super great co-killing/op game that makes a nice blend of difficulty and chaos mixed with rediculous puns and humor.

												Pros:-There are no Cons!!!This game is brilliant on how it handles simplistic ideas and amazing references and creates an incredibly unique and fun game. This game makes you create plans and adapt to what kind aof fighter you want to be, ie what spells your want to use. But the thing is its very hard to do that becasue you want to use them all. This game is brilliant for how it makes the player think. There are hundreds of combinations of spells and enchantments, it makes you experiment and train yourself for combat with your new discoveries. And after every little skirmish you will fell satisfied, because you taught yourself new techniques that make you stronger in battle. It also teaches you to be more precise with your inputs as the enemies play more aggressive, which would be bad in other games but not this one, the dragon shout of a right click allows you to blast back any foe that gets to close to a comfortable distance where you can quickly recuperate and put in the inputs you want in order to defeat it. No matter what, enjoyment will be had. Whether it is from the story humor, the classic video game reference humor, or the satisfaction of walking away from the battlezone as the victor and getting excited for when the next challenge approaches.Gandalf/10			"

												Magicka is a fun little game where either you or your buddies play as wizards!There are just so many combination of spells and easter eggs from across entertainment such as Star Wars and 300.The game is more fun if you play with your friends, but be warned there is no friendly fire turn off button so be careful in what spells you are casting and where you aim it at. But hey it's actually entertaining when you and your buddies are outnumbered and one of your guys accidently casts a fireball spell and takes out the wrong people.The only downside to this game is the random lag when casting a combo spell or just about any spells that requires a lot of 'tuning up' and ALSO no ""auto lock"" you have to trust your keen eyes to help you figure out if the range is right or not. Particuarly during boss fights. There is plenty of more things to do with Magicka such as the expansions, challenges, arena, the F2P game. All and all despite it's clunky ""combat"" which in time you will get better. Magicka is a fantastic game.I recommend it.			"

This is another very long review. If you just want a summary of my reasons for why I recommend this game skip to Results and read from there.Magicka by Arrowhead Game Studios is an interesting game that really keeps you on your toes. I use the word interesting because this game has some great concepts although I could easily see them as potential weaknesses to some people. Magicka requires you to use physics and chemistry to create spells and solve puzzles. These include such concepts as freezing rivers, powering generators, and combining elements to create powerful spells. The Campaign:You play as one of four wizards who are a part of the Order of Magick. You start their adventure in Castle Alderheim where you are given a quest to save the world. The game includes twelve chapters, which pull you through time and space. You are led by your guide Vlad, possibly a vampire, who continuously points you in the right direction. The campaign requires you to fight many bosses who require different tactics to beat: Jormungandr, Jotunn, The Warlock, Khan, Grimnir, The Aristocrats, Vlad, Death, Fafnir, Grimnir, and Assatur. There are many DLC packs which allow you to play many campaigns and experience a full new game. The campaign has funny dialogue which speaks between English and gibberish. The campaign is rather cut and dry. Each level is essentially the same concept, basically fight the enemies and beat the level. Yet again, this is how most games that fit into this genre seem to be. There are many funny jokes, references, and characters which make this game a blast to play through. In fact one of the Wizards you can select is a Space Marine from the 40k series (plus there are all these game references in the campaign). Gameplay:The enemies tend to repeat themselves and throughout the campaign you typically be using the same spells over again. What most people don’t seem to mention is the difficulty of this game. This game is not easy in any sense of the word, in fact even if you play with more people the game just gets harder. With latency issues and friendly fire can result in a very tough campaign where you will kill your friends more than your enemies. If you play the game solo it can be very difficult and with the patches and updates is even harder now than it was before. There is no mana, no leveling up, and pretty much no real loot. You may find a few weapons throughout the campaign, but they are not going to make a huge difference to how you play the campaign. I personally played the whole game with the M60, but other than that all the weapons seemed to be just as effective as the ones I start with. Useful Advice:Magicka REQUIRES a good keyboard. This keyboard preferably should be a gaming keyboard and should not be wireless (unless it’s a wireless gaming keyboard). In order to preform spells and move at the same time Magicka sometimes requires you to use more keys than you have fingers. If your keyboard cannot handle multiple key-presses then you will not be able to play this game. I would recommend playing this game with a macro-enabled keyboard/mouse in order to fully enjoy the actual campaign. In fact the game can be so difficult that even with macros you will more than likely not succeed in a mission on your first attempt. There are many spell combinations with some of them being very hard to figure out. Results:If you like bird’s eye view co-op action adventures then this could be a good choice for you. Make sure you are well equipped, ready for a hard challenge, and have some friends. This is a fun campaign, with witty dialogue, and amazing spell casting. If you have a great memory for up to eight letter combinations then you’ll be very good at this game. If I were you I’d play the game with macros, essentially that’s like putting the game from “Insane” down to “Hard Difficulty”.Pros:+Spell combinations are almost endless+Funny dialogue, hilarious references, and a great story.+Many items you can find in the game (with different bonuses and special spells)+Lots of wizards to select from with different weapons and base attributes+Offers four player co-op experience+Nice graphics and smooth visuals+Interesting boss fights which require a variety of different strategies+Puzzles and mysteries to solve within each level+Lots of DLC with new story and characters abound+Rather long campaign+NO GRINDINGCons:-Insanely difficult (especially if you solo or co-op without experts).-Spell combinations can be rather cumbersome (not a game for people who are not good with memorizing eight letter combinations).-If you are not an expert at memory you typically end up using the same spell through the entire game (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock). -I sometimes had issue with random lag in the main menu screen (nothing game-breaking, but could get infuriating sometimes).

												You are a mage that can cast spells using the various elements.  The elements can stack together to enhance your spells, and some combinations can be learned to cause special abilities, such as slow time, increase movement speed, revive a fallen teammate, summon a tornado, etc.  You can cast your magicks onto your weapon to give your weapon increased damage, cast in a circle around you to affect all characters nearby, or simply cast in front of you.Each element has something that will counter it, so not all combinations are possible.  Further, if you try to use one of these when you have an opposites status effect applied (like trying to use lightning when wet), you'll cause damage to yourself!  As an added bonus, all of your spells can also hurt your other party members, so you need to be careful not to kill your friends.I absolutely enjoyed this game.  The enemies are varied throughout each chapter and each has their own weaknesses you need to discover.  The game keeps you on your toes while allowing you to constantly learn new ways to summon magicks.  The only negative I can say about this game is that it has a terribly steep learning curve.  I played co-op with someone who had played once before and it took me several chapters before I finally understood how all the magicks worked together and could actually contribute effectively to the combat.  I enjoyed these early chapters just as much as the later chapters despite not really knowing what I was doing.Another negative about this game (that can be completely ignored) is that the gamepad controls are absolutely terrible.  Literally any other control setup would have been better than the set gamepad controls.  I prefer gamepad, but I had to play with keyboard and mouse.			"

												In Magicka, you're a wizard. You've got eight elements that you can stack up, mix, multiply, and unleash. You can cast them at goblins, cast them at anything next to you, cast them at your specially blunted sword, cast them at your own face.Singleplayer mode is a light comic fantasy, narrated by your dodgy mentor, Vlad. The black-clad Romanian wizard keeps pointing out that he's not a vampire, and making bad puns about sinking his teeth into things. It's a mix of satire and pop culture references that'll have you smirking dangerously throughout. Lots of care has gone into the way the elements combine and contort in your spells. Combinations shape the form (Missile? Beam? Cone? Wall?) and function (Healing? Burning? Shielding? Exploding? Freezing? Drenching? Zapping?) of each glorious experiment. There's enough variety for every wizard to have his or her own favourite attack style. Mine is a steamy lightning beam that scalds you before dealing bonus lightning damage from the water element in steam.Concocting these spells is a little confusing at first, as you're commanding eight elements across eight keys, but you're rarely faced with enemies that can't be killed by particular elements. Button mashing will get you far, and a mistake might just surprise you. The environments are top-down, linear jaunts through bright and breezy fantasy tropes: forests full of goblins, orcish trenches, swamps, mines, the land of the dead. Wander off the beaten path, and you can find powerful equipment and new magic spell recipes that reach beyond the scope of your regular elemental concoctions - spells such as Revive and Teleport.Singleplayer will soon wear thin, sadly. It's not that you can't beat it with the right spells and an awful lot of goes – it's that if you make a mistake and burst like a sticky water balloon, you get chucked back to the last checkpoint you reached. In once case, that involves fighting three big groups of face-pounding orcs and one-hit-smash-to-deathing ogres, in a row, before you hit another checkpoint. If you quit before you complete that level (perhaps out of, ooh, say, frustration), you'll have to start it all over again when you boot up the game again. Ultimately, you'll hit this annoying boss or that overpowered yeti thing or this boring underworld level and you'll just give up on singleplayer. Then you'll turn to multiplayer. And multiplayer is good, when it works. If you've got a few networked computers and three eager friends with Magicka on their Steam accounts, you can enjoy the splendour of four death lasers combining neatly into a super-beam that bursts ogres in seconds. You can have tactics and gambits and laugh as they end with one wizard left, deciding if he wants your gear before he resurrects you.The bulk of us, however, will be butting our heads against the brick wall of online multiplayer. At the time of writing, developers Arrowhead have been releasing patches every 24 hours, and they're gradually improving on the terrible connectivity issues. Despite their efforts, you no sooner host a game than Steam Chat dies, Skype calls drop, and flatmates start inspecting the router for flashing lights. For a game so reliant on multiplayer to be fun, there are lots of missed opportunities. There's no chapter select function, no joining mid-session for latecomers or disconnected players, no voice chat, no dedicated servers, and tons of lengthy, wordy cutscenes that only the host can skip. Get it working, and it's great. For £8, you'll get your money's worth before everyone forgets about it. But it could have been game of the year material! Silly wizards.THE VERDICT 69/100MAGICKAConfused and buggy, but very entertaining under the right circumstances. Bring friends.			"

												Imbued with humour and incredibly fun, Magicka is one of the best co-op games I played, despite its occasional random crashes and bugs. The best thing about it is its spell-casting system that allows players to create spells on the fly and encourages them to experiment. While there are a couple of dozen predefined spells (""magicks"") in the form of spellbooks that need to be discovered throughout the game to be used, most of the time players will be using spells of their own design, creating them by combining any of the 8 different elements (water, life, shield, frost, lightning, arcane, earth and fire). Some elements cancel each other out, while other can be combined to make new elements (water + fire makes steam, for example, which can be combined with lightning to increase damage as lightning will do more damage to enemies that are made wet by steam). There is no mana or similar system in Magicka so there are no limitations to how many spells can be cast in a row, and the combat is fast paced. If you play with friends  you'll probably occasionally kill them or get killed by them. Their earth projectile will accidentally bounce off your head or you'll lock beams and explode or you'll be struck by a wayward lightning bolt while your friend is off to the side pretending that he wasn't casting anything and that he's not right now ransacking your bloodied corpse to steal your gear.... It is all part of the game, and half of the time it's what makes Magicka so much fun to play with friends. Just remember: W+A is Revive but you cannot cast it while wet because you'll die. Like I did. (Many times.)In addition to the hilariousness of the random self- or friend-inflicted deaths, there's also a lot of humour in the story. The NPCs speak a sort of gibberish version of Swedish which sounds comically silly (even more so if you speak Swedish, I'm told) and the story is riddled with pop-cultural references. Theme-wise, it's standard RPG fare: you are a wizard trying to save the world, fighting goblins, orcs, dragons, even Death. If it weren't for the fact that it is also frequently buggy, Magicka would be outstanding. Unfortunately, the game has a tendency to randomly crash in loading screens or during cut-scenes, it occasionally bugs out so that you can't move during a boss fight, and match-making can be iffy. In addition, the game does not allow to skip through all cut-scenes, which can get tedious if you are repeatedly redoing a boss fight, and I was personally annoyed by some design choices – specifically the fact that ""examining"" a statue prevents you from casting anything for a few seconds while the dialogue plays out, but several huge statues with huge 'hitboxes' were placed in an area littered with enemies and hazards, as a result of which I was getting killed because simply going near the statues would trigger the ""examine"" action and I could not do anything to avoid damage.These minor frustrations mar what is otherwise a great game, but Magicka is nevertheless an incredibly fun co-op experience.

												I enjoyed it. I'm not very fond of this type of gameplay (you move the character with the mouse), but I can see how using WASD for movement would be impractical with all the spells that you have to cast and combine.

Great game for anybody who likes magic, strategy, silliness, and chaos.    The comedy is great and the difficulty is perfect, so that the game is challenging but also easy, in that you can run into battle with a flaming sword or throw massive boulders to squash anyone in your path, or you can put together complex spells and chain them together, Ex. Creating rain clouds to soak your enemies then fry them with lightning.   The game is without a doubt best played multiplayer. The game features great multiplayer, and I have experienced little to no lag at all. There are a lot of game modes, from pvp to vietnam, and each is really fun.   The game's story is linear and gets boring after a few runs, but all dialog and most cutscenes can be skipped and get you right into the action.    The graphics are simple and can be run on even the worst computers, given you just lower the resolution, But the game still looks beautiful and creates a captivating world.   And of course the game and all DLC are super cheap (and worth it).Also, if you are still not sure, you should check out The Yogscast and TotalBiscuit's series on this game, which is only a fraction of the fun this game can offer.

												Magicka is an extremely fresh take on a very tired genre. The top-down Action RPG. It replaces the standard combat with one of the most innovative spell casting system I've ever seen in a game. Eight different elements that can be combined and used in a myriad of logical and easy to understand ways. Firing lightning at your enemies is more effective if you dose them with water first, combining cold and water makes you shoot ice shards and so on. It is easy to learn and easy to use even if some of the higher tier spells require a bit of practice.The graphics are simple but functional and the sound is somewhat lacking, the characters speaking some perverted form of Finnish mixed in with a good deal of gibberish.The storyline and characters are as random as it gets and the entire game is filled to the rim with old pop culture references. A little fun but not much, this is a game that should be played for the gameplay and nothing else.A great buy, especially with friends.			"

												Decent amount of story content, fun versus and survival modes, and you can co-op through the whole story without any problems. You can even kill your allies in hilarious ways. Or play normally and help them. Look, it's fun. You combine elements into spells on the fly, and unlock various ""specially activated"" spells as well as you go which allow for interesting effects that the combinations alone might not do (such as making a rain of fire come crashing down only to desperately throw up a dome shield around you to survive).

												A very funny and charming game that’s fun to play in both coop and solo. The game is much harder solo because of the amount of enemies they throw at you and i was not able to beat the game without looking up what the best spells were. They balance the difficulty in coop by having friendly fire so you will be accidently killing your friends constantly when experimenting with different spells.

												I would like to give this game a good review because it can be a lot of fun.  Unfortunately there are far too many problems with this game for me to recommend a purchase.  The multiplayer is very strange.  There are often connection issues, and glitches during multiplayer.  I had to start at least half of the the levels over due to glithes.  This wouldn't be such a big problem if the game was balanced for singe player, but the game doesn't seem to scale in difficulty whether you are playing with one or four players.  I found some sections of the game almost unplayable because I couldn't connect with a friend in multiplayer and the enemies were so numerous the only way I could win was by cheesing the enemies and trying to glitch out their AI. The second problem is that the game is horribly balanced.  I can go through a level and kill everything no problem and then get to a group of regular enemies that one shot me no matter what.  Then I'll get to the boss and kill him in like 2 hits.  It's very strange.  The levels don't seem to get harder other then just throwing more enemies at you.  The third problem I had is that the game runs very choppily even on high end machines.  The graphics are not very good, but my computer and all of my friends comptuers will run this game very very slowly at times.  Even if the framrate is quite high, it will take quite a while for the game to catch up to my input.  The game is quite interesting, and the spells work great and look cool.  I really liked some of the time I spent playing this game, but frustration with the glitches and performance and balancing issues made this game almost unplayable.  I will be looking at magicka 2 to see if these issues were addressed, because the idea is there, the technical side just needs to catch up.			"

												Magicka is an action adventure, fantasy game which takes place in a Norse mythology based world. The player plays as a wizard from a sacred order where you have to defeat an evil sorcerer who has thrown the world into chaos. The game features a very unique combat system and a storyline full of puns and refrences that cant help but make you smile. I thought that the game was very entertaining and is one of the best games for ""accidently"" blowing up your friends in the multiplayer modes. Unfortunatly, it is very easy to get fustrated with a particular level due to the game restarting the level, or from the few and far between checkpoints every time you die. The controls of the game are also something to get used too.All in all, i thought the game was very good and would recomend it to everyone that would like it.			"

												This game is actually some of the most fun I've ever had, logical spell system with tons of versatility and combinations, you combine elements and can then cast them on yourself, as an AOE or directly, you can also store the ""spell"" in your weapon which will then be activated next time you use it to strike. This game is fun with friends and alone, especially given how easy it is to hit your friends with a bit of ""friendly"" fire... and or accidentally kill yourself. There are also a few special spells that can be learned via items found, these spells require the combination and are then executed with a button press. Such as reviving one of your friends who you probably just blew up a moment ago...I think it's got lots of replay value, the story is cute and funny with tons of references to the genre. The game is in and of itself a bit of a parody. I personally don't have any issues or criticisms of the game, it's not perfect, but the quirks are all part of its charm.  I would recommend it to anyone that has a sense of humour, especially if you have some knowledge about other games in similar genres. It's especially fun with a group of friends (up to 4) but is still very entertaining on your own. I personally found it pretty additive.  "

												This game is my favourite representation of a magic system. In a lot of movies and games the characters mention that magic is ""dangerous"" and can be harmful to yourself and others. This is THE GAME that represents the dangers of magic. The amount of times I've killed myself using lightning while being wet or summoning a boulder to crush me where I stand are numerous. The balance of simplicity of no levelling, only slight spell unlocks or item pickups and the complexity of having to mix and remember each spell is great. This game is most fun playing in coop which is also a lot easier than trying to overcome the bosses alone. Also great for LANs!			"

												This game is lovely, has a suprising amount of good humor, and is quite fun to play as single player. Unfortunately, the multiplayer is not quite as sound. There appears to be a glitch where a character will get stuck in place, as in the player can turn in circles but cannot move forward, nor cast magick.

												Pretty fast-paced game. Needs good dexterity and reflexes for quick keyboard combos (unless you have gaming kb). Challenge modes are pretty challenging, too. Check out the videoon the Magicka game page. It's pretty fun :DParadox is celebreating Magicka's 2 year Anniversary this weekend. As such, it's a Free-to-Play weekend (Jan. 18 - 20, 2012). Try it out and enjoy the free DLC that Paradox has included (Paradox says they will continue supporting Magicka through all of 2013, so no worries there).			"

												this is a fun game. i am far from beating it but also my pc seems to have trouble running this some times. this was found out when my friend and i tried multiplayer. i won't lie there might be issues but you also need to know this game no longer gets any dev support. so you might wonder why i would still recommend it to people. well the reason is was it was still entertaining to me and i've seen how interesting multiplayer can be. i did manage to get a game with my friend and sure we killed each other a lot but it was fun when it worked. so yes its worth it if you can get it to work. if you might be worried about the possible issues read up and see if its worth it to you or just refund it if you fit the guidelines.

												This game will change the way your friends think of you. If you have a friend that is serious about playing this game, and you are NOT like-minded, s/he will hate you forever. One of the best magicks in the game(in my opinion), thunder bolt, is prone to freak accidents. Example, you and your friend are traveling and see an orge. Naturally, you cast thunder bolt, but instead of hitting the ogre, it hits your friend. This will happen over and over and over. So, this game can, has, and WILL ruin some friendships. But overall the gameplay is smooth, it's challenging, and more fun with more people.                                                                                    You've been warned.P.S.

												So the Magicka,magnificent game about wizards. I fell in love with the game long time ago,seriously I have no idea why I didn't complete it yet. Game itself is really fun but challenging while you play alone. On the other hand when you play with friends it may end up being a free-for-all deathmatch instead of doing storymode in co-op.The amount of possibilites this game gives you is incredible,all that spells and weapon enchants you are going to make, not even talking about the hidden stashes. Story is not the best, but it ain't Far Cry it's Magicka it's all about the comedy and full of action co-op. The fact that on almost every loading screen you can see a sausage and the amount and kind of achievements you can get is heartwarming. The environment this game puts you and the atmosphere it creates is indeed unique.TL:DR - Game is fun just do it.Pros:+Lots of possibilites+The amount of references to TV shows or different games+One of the best co-op I've played+2GB means you download it fast and play for loooongCons:-Amount of ways to kill your friends may distract you from the actual game			"

												This game is actually some of the most fun I've ever had, logical spell system with tons of versatility and combinations, you combine elements and can then cast them on yourself, as an AOE or directly, you can also store the ""spell"" in your weapon which will then be activated next time you use it to strike. This game is fun with friends and alone, especially given how easy it is to hit your friends with a bit of ""friendly"" fire... and or accidentally kill yourself. There are also a few special spells that can be learned via items found, these spells require the combination and are then executed with a button press. Such as reviving one of your friends who you probably just blew up a moment ago...I think it's got lots of replay value, the story is cute and funny with tons of references to the genre. The game is in and of itself a bit of a parody. I personally don't have any issues or criticisms of the game, it's not perfect, but the quirks are all part of its charm.  I would recommend it to anyone that has a sense of humour, especially if you have some knowledge about other games in similar genres. It's especially fun with a group of friends (up to 4) but is still very entertaining on your own. I personally found it pretty additive.  "

												This game is my favourite representation of a magic system. In a lot of movies and games the characters mention that magic is ""dangerous"" and can be harmful to yourself and others. This is THE GAME that represents the dangers of magic. The amount of times I've killed myself using lightning while being wet or summoning a boulder to crush me where I stand are numerous. The balance of simplicity of no levelling, only slight spell unlocks or item pickups and the complexity of having to mix and remember each spell is great. This game is most fun playing in coop which is also a lot easier than trying to overcome the bosses alone. Also great for LANs!			"

												An innovative and refreshing Fantasy RPG that does not take itself seriously.Magicka is an RPG in the spirit of Gauntlet, except there is only one class: Wizard.In this reality, Wizards possess infinite power and do not run out of Mana - you only need to worry about running out of Health.It can be played solo or with up to four players.Multitudes of Robes with different abilties to choose from for everyone's own preferred playstyle.Each character possesses a Staff and a Side Weapon (Knife, Sword, Gun).Being a Wizard on the up-and-up, you are still learning, so you must explore to collect Tomes which contain different Magicks.These Magicks contain the necessary element combinations to perform incredible conjurings of powerful efficaciousness.It will take practice, it will take skill. You will die...alot. You will kill your friends...alot.The journey ahead is filled with foes big and small, ferocious and...world conquering. But the journey ahead is also an enigma - you must write your own destiny...rise above the challenges and become the most powerful Wizard in all The Land!11/10			"

												Magicka is a game where you are a wizard, trying to conjure spells using elements. The catch is that multiple combinations yield multiple spells, most of which will severely injure yourself and your teammates. The goodYou are given from start, after a quick tutorial on the basics, all the elements. This allows you to beat the game with anything.Combining elements is the key factor of the game, where you can cast a stone armor to protect yourself and lay healing mines for your teammate who crushes enemies using a steam-electric-arcane beam. Without a mana or cooldown system.there are some hidden goodies to look for, some only for the sake of it, like the mooses, or magicks, a spell that has to be entered in the right order.Magicks are unlockable combinations that are far more powerful and/or unique than your normal spells. From slowing time to freezing the entire screen, or as simple as a teleport of flammable oil. They serve the purpose of progression, and one is even a plot point of the game.The game is also a living pile of references, ranging to movies to games. If you like to see that kind of stuff, it's plenty in this game.The badThe plot is simple: Your goal is to defeat the main wizard baddie. No heavy plot twists or anything.The game is also filled with bugs, bust most of them are fixed within seconds. Gamebreaking bugs can be fixed with an easy restart, which will take you a few screens back. The netcode tend to be laggy for the clients, even with low ping.Most player characters are DLC, but most of them are simple reskins with no unbalanced stats. Some extra content are also DLC-only. The ugly  Sometimes the physics are wonky, with the knockback being powerful enough to knock your wizard several meters in the air. You can even reach spots you weren't meant to this way.Friendly-fire is also a key factor in the game, which can get problematic in certain situations, such as in tight spaces or a miscast. Hilarity can ensue if the wonky physics kick in.There may or may not be some plot holes around. Not that relevant, since the plot is already an excuse to cast stuff around.Some bosses can be one-shotted. While some can provide a worthwhile fight, some can be downed in seconds. However, one-shotting a boss requires some skill (and luck), and can be satisfying if you did it right.NutshellGrab this game if you got the coin and friends to play with. I still haven't played through all the chapters and DLC-content, but the fun-factor I had playing with my friend is undeniable. Yes, there will be rage over that single miscast, yes, there will be random deathmatches when someone's ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and yes, there will be fooling around whenever there's the chance to. And bugs. And that's it's charm. There's no problem with those, since players can be revived in a matter of seconds. The fun from this game came from laughing about failures of each other and the good times you spent with them, and when seriousness kicks in when a horde of NPCS appear and you enter a tactical approach to them. If you just care about goofing with your friends in a co-op game, Magicka is there.			"

												This game is GREAT. The campaign is big enough to pleasure you (i still havent completed it after about 5 hours). There are a lot of twists to the story and its also pretty funny to hear a vampire talking gibberish :P.There is also COOP (through the whole story) and there is PVP however i rarely ever find the people for it. The very few matches i have played in the multiplayer were amazing though...if only more people would be interested in the PVP section of this game it would have been a much better experience. The casting system is great and its something fresh and unique compared to other games. You can enchant your weapon , create walls, create a magickal barrier around you, create an armor for your body with the power of earth or just use the same combinations with a few changes to simply send massive fiery earth rocks to your opponents (thats my fav). If you get tired of the campaign or you finish it and want more...there are loads of dlcs you can buy :)			"

												Every gamer should try it.One of the best games ever created, so much fun and joy.Awesome and epic adventure with friends. I fell in love with this game in very first minutes of play.An atmospheric world with interesting characters and storyline.No character development system, just staff & weapon for your customizable powerful Wizard. There are huge amount combinations of elements (for spells) in Magicka — the game awakes your imagination and creativity. Experiment and have fun!			"

												Magicka is worth it solely for it's amazingly hilarious storyline. It's about as pants-down smarmy as you can get, and the 4 co-op four player turns into a celebration of how team-killing can be a silly side effect of it's so-simple-it's-complex casting system. The mini-missions are just icing on the cake and I'm always excited when there's new DLC to play through with friends.			"

												This is, hands down, the single most hilarious multiplayer experience you will ever have in your life. You can murder your friends horribly (whether you want to or not)! You can help your friends (you will still murder them horribly whether you want to or not)!You have access to 8 magic elements and combine them, on the fly, into various combinations and then let your spells fly... this usually has unpredictable and horrible results. On top of the various combinations of 8 elements you can then cast the spell on yourself, as an AOE, or on others... ya know, just because there wasn't enough variety to begin with. You'll quickly find a handful that work and, as you play more and more, grow comfortable and branch out to become more skilled in your ability to accidentally screw your friends over utterly. Lucky for you it's consequence free and revive takes mere seconds so it's all taken in stride and good humor.If you're looking for a ridiculous, over the top, ""accidentally massacre everyone you hold dear"" gaming experience then I'd highly recommend it. Don't forget, the safeword is BANANA!			"

												One of the most hilarious and long-lasting coop experiences I've encountered. Incredibly satisfying once you and your fellow wizards each settle into your individual styles of magic and work tactically to overcome a particularly tough battle.A gently complex and surprisingly deep combat system really helps you feel like you are casting spells, rather than just pressing a button, and can lead to some frantic moments in the heat of battle!Overall I would recommend this quirky, charming game to anyone looking for a light-hearted adventure with friends.

												You are a wizard, a damn powerful, idiotic wizard whose given the command of eight elements to combine in any order of your imagination. It will most likely work, but like an idiot's imagination, it will hurt and kill you. This game is simply amazing, it's more than worth the ""I may aswell try it"" that can be thrown at a lot of games. Starting off with a small/short tutorial to unlock your magic or 'elements' (of which you can skip if you wish), you'll be thrown into the harsh and dangerous world filled with carboard cutouts of sheep, non-vampires and ever-trusting villagers in order to... Well, save it. (No spoilers!)But gameplay wise, it is diffcult to get used to. The vast combinations of spells pared with the movement and aiming could be the only thing to put someone off. Then again, give it time and you may find yourself loving the ongoing humor behind every unlocked door, the music which helps set the atmosphere like any great fantasy game and the endless comical refferences that just adds to the ""Ha! I know that one"" that reels you in.Multiplayer wise, because you CAN play with 3 other people within the storymode, versus and challenge mode. Yes, you may have connection issuse or lag issues, that's a downside. But! If you should find yourself with your (soon to be ex)friends starting off a story... It may take you longer than you think. This may be the only game that gets harder the more people you have, soley because you end up killing each other on purpose. Truth be told, you can have a lot of laughs without commiting to actually completing this game, to which it only makes it more exciting if you choose to.For anyone whose played a classic console game and thought ""Wow, I wished they made games like this again."" Then Magicka is for you. The elements of a classic are certainly there. For me personaly, it's just a game I feel I want to come back to time and time again 'just because'.			"

												A game that will test the deepest limits of your patience, this tale, in no way similar to any sci-fi classic, gives an old concept a new face. Combine the powers of the elemets to create deadly spells and watch your enemies explode in a bloody mess. The so classic ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments"" that this game has (a lot of them, a whole lot) makes it so it depends more on your patience than your skill to survive.All in all, after a few rage quits, you will learn how to master the best spells and you will have a lotta fun, specially if you're playing with friends.Good indie game, I give it a 3.5/5.

												Very, very fun!Took my sister and I about 8 hours to finish the campaign, though we were taking our time and ended up restarting a lot when one of us lost our favorite weapon.Best part of this game is that you can have up to 4 players playing on ONE computer! Of course, you need 4 joysticks/keyboards+mice for each player.It has a lot of spell diversification, and an online co-op and survival gametypes. The one thing that could make it better would be either a Versus multiplayer game mode, or an unlimited wave survival game mode (right now, there's only 20 waves of enemies).			"

You can even kill your allies in hilarious ways. Or play normally and help them. Look, it's fun. You combine elements into spells on the fly, and unlock various ""specially activated"" spells as well as you go which allow for interesting effects that the combinations alone might not do (such as making a rain of fire come crashing down only to desperately throw up a dome shield around you to survive).Buy it.

												Magicka is a mostly cooperative (friendly fire is on) game about combining elements to create magic spells. It supports up to 4 player multiplayer with a adventure, challenge, and versus mode. The way the magic spells work is you have 6 slots to put elements in, and whatever combination you put in is mixed to create a unique spell. There are literally unlimited spell combinations, so there's tons of diversity. There's also books scattered around where you can find these things called Magicks, these are pre-set spells that do special things (some notable ones are summons, vortex, rain/thunderstorm/blizzard, ect). There are also many robes you can select aswell, they have special perks and downsides that make them unique from eachother (like immunity/weakness to some elements). The campaign could last you a good 4-5 hours with added DLC campaigns as well to add on to it. There are A LOT of DLC for this game, mostly PVP maps and robes, these are NOT needed and you should only get them if you feel like you would like those robes/maps or want to support the developer but the campaign DLCs are a must have in my opinion. People say this game is a buggy mess, and it is, but the glitches you may encounter are actually entertaining. The developer have worked hard and patched out most of the game ruining ones, so there's not much to worry about. Get this game, it's worth your money if you have friends to play it with.			"

Intro: This is a game that really benefited from having a demo. I enjoyed it so much while trying it out that I stopped and purchased it.The game can be fun alone, but I highly really recommend multiplayer for this one. Host your own room and play through the story while people drop in and out. If you have a few gamepads and friends you can also play locally on the same PC. Its a ton of fun either way.Gameplay: Magicka's gameplay is pretty entertaining. It has a neat magic system with lots of possibilities and a bunch of weapons you can come across. Loads of different characters. A bunch of game modes. A few different campaigns, some mini-campaigns, pvp arenas, and survival maps. Every mode is great fun to play and there's really a ton of content here. Just playing random multiplayer games can be a blast.Music & Visuals: The music was fitting, but nothing too memorial. The production was good nonetheless. I liked the artstyle. It was pretty and you can turn the gore off if that bothers you or if someone younger is going to play with you. Looks pretty nice overall.Story: The story was solid. Each campaign has its own. Its not really anything special, but its something there and gives you a goal.PC Version: Game runs pretty fine for the most part.I remember extremely high pings would cause multiplayer to crash. This may have been fixed as it was many years back, but as long as everyone was under 200ms then I didn't run into problems. Gamepads work fine with the game, though kb+m is a bit easier.One thing that some may not like - Magicka is one of those games with way too much DLC, but there's still a lot in the default game. Your best bet is buying the full bundle though during a large discount in a sale. I know some people can't stand loads of DLC, but it actually adds quite a lot without being too pricey.Conclusion: Overall its a fun game to play and has a lot of replay value. Go for it, especially if you have some friends to play with. My hours on the game are somewhat low, but its definitely something I'd play again if any of my friends were ever interested.			"

												This game lets you play as a wizard and combine elements to create spells! There are dozens of possible combinations and maybe 3 good ones that you're going to spam throughout the whole game. The writing is also spectacular, including classic internet jokes that stopped being funny years before the game's release.			"

												Excellent gameplay, funny story, awesome spells and stupid NPCs. Magicka is awesome in a lot of ways.Good+GameplayCombat - Strong mechanics, you mix elements to create a spell(Very similar to 'Invoker' of DOTA).Spells/MovesWide variety of spells.Interesting and funny spell names. Something like, 'Crash to desktop', I never thought that I'd really crash to my desktop.+Visuals - The graphics isn't particularly good, but it fits well into the game.+StoryHumorous characters. See an NPC suck someones blood then he tells you he's not a vampire.Good and funny story.Side quests!+DLC - Never thought I'd give a plus for a DLC.Costumes - Great costumes. I recommend the 'Tentacle Robe'!Campaigns+MultiplayerReceive a huge chunk of rock to the face from your friend.Receive a 9999 thunder damage from a friendReceive pretty much every fatal spell in the game and still have fun.Bad-Latency issues-Multiplayer Camera - You will all share a single camera and you'll die if you are left behind.

												I really wanted to like this game, and I have spent several hours with it, but it was not a good game at all. Sure, spells are fun to cast here and there, but using the keyboard in such a manner, trying to remember what it seems hundreds of spells in the blink of an eye, is no where possible, which means you end up using a few spells that you can remember over and over again.This ruins the intent of the spells, because you can't type ""FQFQAAS"" or ""DQDQDQRUPYOURRSE"" when the game is constantly spamming you with foe. ""Good players"" will tell you to change your tactic, but doing some missions over and over again just to face another death one second close to victory, just takes away your mood entirely. Some missions you can't even complete without buying a better robe. So, the tactic here is: ""Buy an upgrade"" to advance. Real smooth.There is only one difficult setting which is ""hard"" or ""insane"", whatever you prefer, and the real challenge is starting over and over again without throwing your keyboard out the window.This is clearly not a single player game, but finding matches and people to play with is just a hassle and didn't work for me.+ The humor.+ The graphics.- The whole spellcasting system.- The unbalanced gameplay.- One difficulty setting.- The hidden ""BTW"" - agenda.

												While teamwork may take a backseat in magicka, it's where the gameplay really shines. Just try to work with your friends, try to get four players with massive area affecting spells to keep from killing one another. With the list of different elements to combine, you've got virtually limitless potential to make your own spells, many weapons throughout the world, and even multiple robes that affect your gameplay statistics.

The single player is pretty fun, but the multiplayer is an absolute dream for local co-op.  So many combinations of spells, 4 players at once, lots of maps, items, robes...this is exactly what local co-op should be.			"

												Magicka does really begin to shine when it is played cooperatively. Though SP works, it does not hold a candle to the sheer mayhem and anarchic fun of the multipalyer experience. Even though the campaign is solely linear, the gameplay itself is based on the principle of complete freedom. The experimentation with the different spells and elements is what turns it into a unique sandbox game, which really comes into its own, once friends join the fun. Highly recommended, especially if one is looking for a game to just have a bit of fun with, between more serious affairs like Bioshock or Skyrim ;-)			"

												Ever wanted to be a wizard? Agreed, lets become wizards. But for now let me tell you about this game about wizards. In Magicka you play a wizard. You can play with up to but not including 4 of your friends, who will also be wizards whilst you are a wizard. This is because the game only allows a total of 4 wizards on the screen at any point. This programming restriction is one of the least serious flaws this with game, and that's saying something. Wizard. The game suffers from a lack of control, gratiuitous amounts of bugs, and non-wizard characters. The problem is that Magicka plays like a weak beat-em up. Wizards run around and beat up non-player non-wizard non-characters, eg: wizard. but instead of fast pased action filled wizard baised action baised fast pased wizard wizard combat, we get something less. The fast placed action does not suit well to the 'plan carefully your wizard rainbow beam +1' style of gameplay. In a word, Not my tea of cup. Wizard.			"

												Fun for all! Let's you be creative with all the vast magic combo's and the subtle geek culture references are a blast!  I do have to add that only buy this game if it's on sale for like $4.99 for the base game, not including the DLC.  Not that it isn't worth it, but the game is EXTREMELY buggy.  Me and my friend have had this gave for almost a year and haven't beat the DLC yet, simply because of the bugs.  The base campaign is relatively short, though satisfying, but it took us forever because it's a hassel connecting with a friend to play co-op, and for unexplained reasons the game crashes.  One of these days when we have the mental fortitude to deal with the bugs, we'll finish the DLC, but for now, we have plenty of non buggy games to complete.			"

												If you and your other (up to 4) geek buddies have been wanting to get a fun game to to play together then get this game NOW!!!!!!! Magicka is probably the only game that iv'e ever played that has made me feel like a true and rightly powerful wizard, which really is everything you could ever want in a game right? ;) The controls take a little bit to get used to but you will quickly find your fingers casting different elements for your own custom spells and magicks as if they have minds of their own.  (Actually a scientific study suggests that they do, so be careful)  Meanwhile, trying to cooperate with your buddies while accidentally blowing them off the face of the planet with a lightning bolt, is possibly some of the most fun I have ever had.Be warned though this game is by no means easy, unless you and your friend are actually pychologically linked you will have trouble in some parts of the game.  And even if you are for some strange reason linked in the mind with your buddy you will still have to deal with the decent amount of bugs that present themselves throughout the game.If you have not already been convinced,         BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!        and then make your friend buy it.10 out a 10.       would blast my friend's body into oblivion again.

												Ah, Majicka, thou art a cruel ♥♥♥♥♥, to give us such powerful spells that can turn a goblin into a greasy smear, set him ablaze, charbroil him with gouts of boiling steam, or preform crude x-ray procedures with gratuitous amounts of electricity (all whilst we  scream 'unlimited powah!'); and yet you make sure that friendly fire is always on, and we can't turn it off.Then you make the uber powerful spells impossible to aim.But you do care, oh sweet Majicka, for you make death as a slap on the wrist, you soothe our pain, and you lavish us with a powerful ressurection spell easy to cast and use within the first five minutes of gameplay. Oh this brave Macjika world, that has such goblins in it...Okay, enough with the waxing lyrical. Majicka is a game desinged for four players, all of which are extremely squishy wizards with godlike powers, to play online or through Lan. Of course it isn't designed for nothing BUT online play, as Majicka does allow for single player, and in many cases it may be easier by yourself as you can unleash the full fury of your wizardly prowress without worrying about making that red wizard you just met five minutes ago dissapear in a flash of light, a thunderclap, and massive damage.Majicka is, of course, about magic, and magic is surprisingly easy to use, and hard to master. You are given eight elements to mix and match, some of which do cancel each other out, I should mention, and depending on how you use these elements depends on what happens. Cast the Lighting spell by pressing q f a s a to prepeare the elements, then spacebar to use these elements to complete a recipie that allows you to rain down death on anyone stupid enought to anger you, stand in front of you, or stand slightly to the left or right of you (seriously, you can't aim that spell for ♥♥♥♥). Or just press and hold the right mouse button to unleash a beam of death. Or... you could press shift, then right click to send it out in a destructive wave attack. Or hold ctrl and enchant your sword with the elements to create a onetime power melee attack.These are just some ways you can create amazing spells, including armour, landmines (with a variety of interesting attributes including fire, arcane energies, lightning, or healing), create a rocky barrier to shield yourself from attacks, create a force bubble to protect yourself for a long time, encase yourself in stone armour, or ice spikes, or stone armour and ice spikes, create walls of flame, summon a ring of miniature volcanoes to roast everything, crack the earth, make it rain, force magma to spout from the ground, force ice spikes bigger than you to erupt form the ground, raise zombies, create gouts of fire, steam, and/or water, shoot lighting from your hands (unlimited powah!), and more!THe game is full of snide humour, and a silly, half made up language that makes everything funnier. This game is smart enought to know that refrences are not the same as humour, and as such simply makes the refrences clever instead of rubbing your face in it and expecting you to laugh.Of course, it does have a few bugs. Mulitplayer is an ungodly mess, and some enemies seem almost impossible to defeat. Frustration is sure to come if you rely on one spell, and only one spell, and multiplayer cna get frustrating fast when someone lears a new spell called ""crash to desktop"" (an actual spell) and casts it just to see what it does.But all frustration aside, this is a smart, clever game that is sure to make you laugh, have fun, and want to turn your 'friends' into charcoal and ashes.And rerember... the safe word is: banarner.

												Hillarious game (in particular if you are from Sweden). It offers a decent amount of gameplay hours which you will enjoy. Magicka is full of references to other franchises and though these can be really funny, they brake immersion (not that immersion is really the point of the game). Sadly, the game also has a lot of bugs that might even force you to redo something.			"

												Welcome to the Wacky and epic world of Magicka, All I have to say is, how could any kid who grew up in the eighties or around DnD,monty python, and various other comedy and nerd references not love this freaking game...you have nutty mages to control, it says local coop with split/shared screen, just noticed that gonna check that out with my kiddo for sure.Keep in mind I've logged several hours into this title offline so my online record does not reflect actual time spent. Pros--Awesome spell conjuration system ""Mix and match, power up and merge many spells for devastating hybrid power and buffs beyond buffs""-Great graphics ""they really have a solid feel-Great controls ""keep note I have only ever used a mouse and keyboard they can be somewhat confusing at first""Cons-Game may be too challenging at points due to the time in which you have to react with mixing a spell together with your controller or qwerty configuration.-No actual dialog in english, I am assuming they are speaking in an eastern european langauge like finny-Some of the robes just plain suck.

												Ahh.. Magicka. Where do I start with all your great co-op shenanigans? I know! How about roasting your (soon-to-be-ex)friend alive with a fire spell? Or what about freezing them solid and pushing them of a cliff This-is-Sparta style? So many spell posibilities, so many ways of killing. Finding the right spell combo is vital to kill your friends faster.Pros:-+Great Co-op+Different spell types for different playstyles+Freedom of doing whatever the hell you want+So many DLC to enjoy (At the expense of cash!)+SausagesCons:--Weird level designs makes you fall of the map especially the part where you have to fight Grimnir for the firt time with the moving platforms-Insta-kill water (Mages can't swim, doofus!) which is pretty annoying, you have to constantly cast ice over the water.-SausagesOverall, this game is one of the few gems that pops up once in a while and implements a gameplay feature (Magicks) that actually works brilliantly.I give it a 9/10			"

												I really like this game. I'm not sure if it's because it brings back memories of Loom, or if it's because it's broken into a genre without piggy-backing on an existing IP, or if it's just because it's a not-so-mindless fun. There's one major issue I have though: the multiplayer stinks. It's near impossible to set up games and latency issues will plague the bonding experience you'll try to share with friends. Other than that though, fantastic game.			"

												A clever game, and one the likes of which I've not seen before, despite the concept being something every fantasy fan has thought up at one point or another. The execution, however, is not without flaw. There are places in which game breaking bugs well, break your game. IT's also notorious for giving people with even newer laptops issues simply for being run on a laptop, and often won't work entirely on systems with on-board graphics. Occasionally they will patch and fix some of these bugs, but not before relasing another 20 bucks worth of redundant, basically reskinned, dlc first.			"

Quite by accident, I discovered E cast, A-S-E cast - a shield followed by 3 or 4 proximity mines in front of the field. Or F-E cast - shield of fire.I definitely recommend a try. "

I do have to add that only buy this game if it's on sale for like $4.99 for the base game, not including the DLC.  Not that it isn't worth it, but the game is EXTREMELY buggy.  Me and my friend have had this gave for almost a year and haven't beat the DLC yet, simply because of the bugs.  The base campaign is relatively short, though satisfying, but it took us forever because it's a hassel connecting with a friend to play co-op, and for unexplained reasons the game crashes.  One of these days when we have the mental fortitude to deal with the bugs, we'll finish the DLC, but for now, we have plenty of non buggy games to complete.			"

It gets better with friends.You can spray water that not only forces people back, but then have a friend toss in lightening which is enhanced by the water and bouncing from person to person.Or you cast a random lighting bolt that insta-kills another friend. Or toss a boulder that flies hard enough and fast enough to not only kill the intended target, but fly off and kill a civilian. It's really hilarious. I genuinely can't stop laughing and crying. It is such a simple, simple game, but brilliant, addictive, and hilarious. I can't get over how such a simple game is just, mindblowingly engaging.			"

												 Magicka is a really cool game about experimenting magical combos , you control  8 elements , fire,water,ice,arcane,life,lightning,shield and earth.Can make thunderstorms happen, burn enemy hordes with one spell , shoot people with a m16 (really!), kill your friends over and over.The characters in this game are few but they are very memorable with their funny dialogues , but playing alone can be boring and hard at the later levels , very hard.If you want a few hours of spellcasting spree fun then this is the game for you.

												An intense isometric action game built for (un)cooperative play that can be somewhat mechanically demanding to play well (fast fingers and keyboard skills are highly useful, in other words), but, after practice with its unique spell system, can easily be one of the most fun yet challenging and deeply rewarding action-adventure games that you've ever played. It is hardly perfect, as there are some of what you might call ""cheap tactics"" to be discovered, and the game's engine has very poor performance  despite it's ""average"" visual fidelity and bad framerates can periodically cause incomplete or unintentional spellcasts. With that said, though, I absolutely recommend it for those out there that enjoy a game that encourages a balance of creativity, quick thinking and fast reflexes but want to avoid any excessively steep learning curves and/or extreme demand for pure twitch skill that can come with trying to enjoy similarly difficult and fast-paced action games.

												If you and your other (up to 4) geek buddies have been wanting to get a fun game to to play together then get this game NOW!!!!!!! Magicka is probably the only game that iv'e ever played that has made me feel like a true and rightly powerful wizard, which really is everything you could ever want in a game right? ;) The controls take a little bit to get used to but you will quickly find your fingers casting different elements for your own custom spells and magicks as if they have minds of their own.  (Actually a scientific study suggests that they do, so be careful)  Meanwhile, trying to cooperate with your buddies while accidentally blowing them off the face of the planet with a lightning bolt, is possibly some of the most fun I have ever had.Be warned though this game is by no means easy, unless you and your friend are actually pychologically linked you will have trouble in some parts of the game.  And even if you are for some strange reason linked in the mind with your buddy you will still have to deal with the decent amount of bugs that present themselves throughout the game.If you have not already been convinced,         BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!        and then make your friend buy it.10 out a 10.       would blast my friend's body into oblivion again.

												Ridiculously fun! Granted, you'll spend at least half your time killing your teammates and/or hapless villagers, but that is not a bad thing :D The game controls are fairly simple, but the real beauty of the gameplay lies in the creative combinations of elements, rewarding players who take the time to experiment (preferably on a teammate XP). The story is snarky with lots of geek humor and references to everything from Star Wars to Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and the graphics are enjoyable coming from someone who plays a lot of Minecraft. I have yet to play through the game solo, however, and so am not sure how the gameplay holds up in the single-player mode. All in all, though, an excellent buy, especially if you plan to play with friends (Like me!)			"

												This game is fantastic. I will list the pros and cons:Pros: Great spell crafting system. On a keyboard, it's easy to use, and very very fun.Great adventure story.Great difficulty. Some battles require you to think outside the box with what spells you use. I play exclusively two player coop, so it's important to remain dry so that you can res your fellows. Being able to heal quickly and efficiently is a must, as is the courage to spam four or five random element down on the table, and cast it in your immediate vicinity. Hilarious.Cons: Controller controls not great, especially for spell casting.Hand starts to cramp on the mouse after about ten minutes of none stop battling.A little gory for my taste, even with Blood And Gore turned off.The orcs try to eat your head.Dungeons And Gargoyles, and Dungeons and Demons DLCs have no ability to save, so you have to finish the dungeon in one long sitting.Overall, 9/10, best RPG I've ever played, a must buy for anyone who likes playing a game with a lot of FIRE, or any other element they like. Arcane Bombs? Check. Fireballs? Check! Arcane Fireball! CHECK! Icicle Explosion? Tricky, but check. Giant swirling vortex of doom! Yep! Walking Trees? Yep! Instakill Lightning bolts? Oh, yeah! Ultimate Firestorm? Of course! Death sewing pillars of firey lightning? Naturally. It's all there.			"

												A fun and silly story about mages adventuring worlds and fight against many different creatures. There are also some combat arenas to kill your friends in. The game has a simple combat system, but it can also be complex if you want to learn better spells, and there are over hundred different spells you can learn! A fun game to play with friends. You can either fight with them in the story, or against them in an arena. You will probably kill your friends whichever one you choose X)			"

												I really like this game. I'm not sure if it's because it brings back memories of Loom, or if it's because it's broken into a genre without piggy-backing on an existing IP, or if it's just because it's a not-so-mindless fun. There's one major issue I have though: the multiplayer stinks. It's near impossible to set up games and latency issues will plague the bonding experience you'll try to share with friends. Other than that though, fantastic game.			"

Gather up your friends with a four pack and try to not brutally slaughter eachother by misstake or unless that is what you want in an insane PvP match of the ultimate Wizardy. This game is enjoyable with a lot of comical aspects with twists, humor and a storyline which refers to a lot of great stories.

												A clever game, and one the likes of which I've not seen before, despite the concept being something every fantasy fan has thought up at one point or another. The execution, however, is not without flaw. There are places in which game breaking bugs well, break your game. IT's also notorious for giving people with even newer laptops issues simply for being run on a laptop, and often won't work entirely on systems with on-board graphics. Occasionally they will patch and fix some of these bugs, but not before relasing another 20 bucks worth of redundant, basically reskinned, dlc first.			"

After that, it's fun with friends, engaging campaign with humor.The many spell combinations can be a little frustrating, but experiment and you'll find something that works for you, and the enemy you are fighting. Quite by accident, I discovered E cast, A-S-E cast - a shield followed by 3 or 4 proximity mines in front of the field. Or F-E cast - shield of fire.I definitely recommend a try. "

												Run around with your fellow wizard friends in a land that speaks a funny langauge. Focus on killing your enemies whilst killing your friends at the same time. Choose from a variety of wizards each with their own special and unique abilities.  Various game modes such as pvp and other game modes. The DLC is worth it and you don't really get the full experience with out it. With many mages to choose from there is replay value in this game because you can either change chracters or start over with other mages. With a price tag of $10 you'll have alot of fun but you should really get the full game with all it's DLC for $40. I've seen this game by itself go for $2.50 and if it's on sale you can get it with all it's DLC for $10 on sale.  There are also other game modes and side stories with the DLC.

Granted, you'll spend at least half your time killing your teammates and/or hapless villagers, but that is not a bad thing :D The game controls are fairly simple, but the real beauty of the gameplay lies in the creative combinations of elements, rewarding players who take the time to experiment (preferably on a teammate XP). The story is snarky with lots of geek humor and references to everything from Star Wars to Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and the graphics are enjoyable coming from someone who plays a lot of Minecraft. I have yet to play through the game solo, however, and so am not sure how the gameplay holds up in the single-player mode.

You don't just click spells in this game, you create them.  Get too used to a nifty spell, and you may find the game difficult.  Create spells adaptive to the situation and you will succeed.Countless parodies of other genres and famous lines from various movies are littered throughout the campaign.  Every time I play the campaign I find a new one.However it is ESSENTIAL that you find a friend to play this with.  And make sure you both have mics!  Up to four players can play for near lethal laughs.			"

												This is a fun game to play in one go, but it's really hard to come back to. Once you've de-momorized those spells it's brutal to try to fire this game up again and expect to hold your own in the MP community (which is pretty much dead, probably for that reason) or to try to get those last few achievements done. Not to mention that it's largely just trying to plug its 4 or 5 DLC campaigns and a bunch of other DLC that's not worth what it costs, so I think I'm done with this game.			"

												A really fun action-adventure game, either playing solo or (even better) with friends on a versus game or co-op. The adventure story is well elaborated, humorous, with lots of games/movies references, such as star wars, 300, macgyver, tomb raider, diablo, grim fandango, zelda and many more. The characters speak some sort of mixed languages (swedish, english and some gibberish) which makes it even funnier.The magicks (skills) are combinations you can make with the 8 elements given, and even mix these to make other elements. It's possible to create various different magicks as long as the elemental orbs combine. This feature makes the combat style very versatile and unique, besides, in this real-time combat the wizards have infinite mana, use lasers, swords and even guns. And although the wizards have infinite mana, they have other limitations like taking the time to type the combo you want, being slowed by summoning many elemental orbs, the skills duration, and taking care about opposite elements.All in all, it's a very entertaining game, cheap, and completely vampire free.""I put on my robe and my wizard hat.""10/10			"

												An intense isometric action game built for (un)cooperative play that can be somewhat mechanically demanding to play well (fast fingers and keyboard skills are highly useful, in other words), but, after practice with its unique spell system, can easily be one of the most fun yet challenging and deeply rewarding action-adventure games that you've ever played. It is hardly perfect, as there are some of what you might call ""cheap tactics"" to be discovered, and the game's engine has very poor performance  despite it's ""average"" visual fidelity and bad framerates can periodically cause incomplete or unintentional spellcasts. With that said, though, I absolutely recommend it for those out there that enjoy a game that encourages a balance of creativity, quick thinking and fast reflexes but want to avoid any excessively steep learning curves and/or extreme demand for pure twitch skill that can come with trying to enjoy similarly difficult and fast-paced action games.

												Put simply, magicka is a game that is greater then the sum of its parts. When you mix in humorous references from all kinds of other video games with intricate/numerous button inputs that allow for practically a wide array of actions of any game i've played create for a chaotic and memorable experience. Never does the game feel dull or repetitive. As you progress I've noticed that my approach to fighting enemies evolved: from throwing an all rock projectile, to arcane mines, to eventually my bread and butter:electrofied glacial explosions. Additionally, the monsters and enemies were excellent challenges: I'll never forget the elemental skeletons which throw off your built in methods of killing, and those fast ♥♥♥ trolls.I feel guilty that i payed so little, but got back so much more. It was a game where i genuinely had a fun time and rofled hard not because of some racist joke said over xbla but the antics that were happening in the game.

You need only look at the screenshots above to see how pretty this game is. And thanks to the somewhat unorthodox spell combination system, you can play the game however you want, and be whatever kind of mage you want to be! Magicka knows exactly what kind of game it wants to be and it delivers that without a hiccup. The dialogue is ridiculous but constantly amusing and the storyline is constantly making fun of it's genre- the entire game is like a spoof, and it really is fun when playing with friends.I just wish there was more of it!

												A very witty game that parodies mmany different movies, games, and shows. It also has a unique and well thought out combat structure. From the start of the game you are given access to all 8 elements (water, life, shield, cold, fire, earth, arcane, and lighting) which can be combined for various effects. Each element affects the area differently depending on the form and combination. if you use it in its direct form (some are spray, earth is projectile, and others are beam) it is mainly a attack. if  you use say, earth + shield, on yourself it creates a body armor. If you use the same combination directly it surrounds you with a rock wall. If you use it as an Area of Effect it causes a small earthquake around your character. And if you enchant your melee weapon with it the weapon will also vary the effect.			"

												Wow, if you are familiar with any sort of nerd culture references (from startrek to 300) then this game will leave you laughing your ♥♥♥ off. Multiplayer is also quite entertaining. Expect to die a lot, but resurrection is so easy to cast for your buddies you might not even notice. Single player is regretfully quite difficult, but not impossible if you get a strong grasp of the magic abilities. Raising the dead or summoning elementals is also quite handy.			"

												If you have a bunch of friends to play with and you like the concept of the game go ahead, stop reading the reviews and buy it. But you should know that there are some minor bugs but they don't destroy the experience.			"

												Ein geniales Spiel. Lustig und spannend. In dem Spiel werden so einige andere Spiele richtig gut parodiert und auch Filme bleiben nicht verschont. Die zahlreichen DLC´s bringen noch mehr Abwechslung in das Spiel, so das einem auch nicht so schnell langweilig wird. Alleine ist das Spiel teilweise ziemlich schwer aber Magicka lässt sich ja auch über Internet in einer Gruppe spielen. Ein richtig tolles Spiel das man eigentlich nur empfehlen kann.			"

												Some very silly and referential humour makes this game what it is- which is a good thing, because it can be quite frustrating gameplay-wise. Still a little buggy after what I hear was a bugtastic release, the spell combos can be hard to get right, especially in the heat of combat when you're trying not to get punted off a cliff or keep an eye on which debuffs your wizard has, indicated only by graphical effects on his person, and it's far too easy to get stuck in chat mode and realise, after several frantic attempts, that you're just typing AFAFAFACSCSWWWW into the chat bar.Still, like I said, the humour is fantastic, and if you can get the hang of the spell-casting then there's a world of depth awaiting you. I'm enjoying it, albeit not for long sessions!			"
