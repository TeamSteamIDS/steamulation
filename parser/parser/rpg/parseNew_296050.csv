												It's often that I wish there was a third button, one that pats the devs in the back and says: ""A for effort, now on to making something better"".There's little actually wrong with this little turn based hack&slash game. It's partially procedurally generated, you can collect some (not superbly interesting) loot, do ""kill all orcs"" and ""clear the dungeon"" types of quests, level up some basic stats, push some levers in dungeons, and teleport back to the base village to sell or stash your stuff. The price for it is right, it isn't badly made, I don't hate the graphics and I actually enjoyed the music and sound design. But there is little really interesting or novel here, and the gameplay is frankly eh... dull.So yuh, I don't feel like these devs did enough wrong to deserve a downvote. But in a world where you can regularly pick up Torchlight and even Torchlight II for the same price tag, I just don't see why you'd choose this game instead.			"

												It plays like a roguelike, but it's basically just a generic loot-driven RPG. It has really inconsistent balance (scenarios 1 and 2 are really easy, and then scenario 3 killed me a whole lot, for instance) and a bunch of mind-bogglingly bad design decisions, too, like the Halls of Challenge not giving any XP at all.In the end this is a game I can't really recommend to anyone! Go play a good loot-driven RPG (see: Titan Quest, Torchlight 2, Diablo 3, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing), a good turn-based RPG (Avadon or Avernum), or a good roguelike (ADOM, Tales of Maj'Eyal) depending on what made you look at this game.(EDIT: Version 1.7 added the ability to get XP in the Anti Babatula area of the Halls of Challenge, and quite a lot of it. This makes hitting level 35 much more reasonably possible by running through the Anti Goblin Cave a few times, if you're really determined to do that.It still doesn't fix most of my problems with the game, but it was worth pointing out.)

												I got this game as a bundle and really cheap so I didn't start with very high hope for this game.Well I was right! Don't put very high hope for this game.On Steam review I can only choose Yes to recommend and No to not Recommend. But sometime like this game i would love to have an option ""Neither"". This is not a terrible game but it's just too simple. It's simpler than the old Windows 3.2 Game Castle in the Winds. Which i played over 20 years ago. The graphic is decent for indie, The Combat is very simple and there are not much choice for spells and ability.Basic you build up your character and use ability to cover the short coming in order to get though tough fights.You had to save and exit many times to level up and get items to win the tough fights. I have just played 1 game of hardcore to get achievements and 22 hours later, right after I get the last achievement that require me to play hardcore I died on the last floor of Brutal challenge room. This means i have to start over. But since i already achieved over 60% achievements and all the rest ones are just more grinding of exact same content over i don't think i will play this game for a second time.Over all I would rate this piece 5/10. If you can get this game cheap and there are no other game for you to play... Give this piece a try.			"

												The looting is fun for a while, but later on the level designer says ""Screw it, I'm just going to place all the toughest monsters here, and hope the player won an RNG roll and got some kind of game breaking weapon"". Which would be fine if the game were engaging enough to warrant grinding. But it's not.It's on sale for under a dollar often enough. Buy it then, if you need a time killer in your library.			"

												This game is a very fun, fast turn-based arpg. It reminds me alot of diablo (I think the background music in the town of Babatula is intentionally similar to the in-town music in diablo), but is a deeper game with its own unique style and character. There is a lot of loot and great variety of ways to build your character, Rick. I like the 2d, almost cartoonish character graphics and the art in general. This is some of the best turn-based hack and slash you can get for 5 bucks. I also bought this game on Xbox Live in 2012- btw, shame on xbox for their shoddy support for indie games - I owned my xbox 360 for 5 years before I even realized there were indie games available. Xbox does nothing to promote indie games despite the large number of quality games, frequently available for just a dollar.			"

												The trailer for this game is exactly what you get, so if you enjoyed it, you will enjoy this game. It is a combat-based action RPG in the style of an older Diablo game with a focus on straightforwardness, simplicity, and an absurd, lovable, and cartoonish style. The main character, Rick, is a melee fighter that you can augment by choosing different stats and items to wear.Like Diablo, the fun of the game is in beating things up and finding items.  Rick accomplishes both of these by slamming his knife into enemies until they die in Rogue-like fashion. The strategy comes how you plan ahead by choosing what to wear, what to carry, where to stand, etc. rather than the actual combat, which is mostly just your stats comparing with the monsters and deciding how to use your consumable items. You also have a special meter that can be used to give yourself a boost for a short time. It's easy to understand and enjoyable.Once you finish the game, you can try again with a different character and a stat focus. There are 9 or 10 special abilities you can pick as you level, some of which are passive. You can have up to 4, but some of them won't be relevant for the way you're playing. For example, I wouldn't choose a power like Flash (which uses your special meter to teleport you) on a character focused on Strength and Speed because I would never have enough Willpower to use it consistently. Or similiarly, I wouldn't choose Eagle Eye (which raises your attack rating and critical hit rate) on a character with a high Dexterity because I would already be hitting everything accurately and it would be redundant. You can choose a special ability to focus on one path, use in an emergency, or to balance out a weakness. There are enough different combinations and achievements to play through the game several times if you want.If the store page appeals to you and you're looking for a light, enjoyable game, I recommend this. It's exactly what it looks like and it has enough depth for me to enjoy 90+ hours.			"

												In short: it's turn-based casual simplified Diablo.No,really, quests that are ""kill them all"", respawning monsters/loot, suffix-prefix loot system, magic drop boosts, two-three meaningful parameters (DPS, attack/defence (chance to hit/be hit), three resistances). And that's all.If you are fond of err... flash-like rogie-lite games, it can be your game. Otherwise - too cheap and simply. Worth to spend one-two coffee-breaks in my opinion, but no more. 60/100.

												While it isn't terrible, Battlepaths plays like a game that should be free on Kongregate.  There are no options to speak of other than turning fullscreen off and on.  Which means you can't rebind the awful keyboard layout (you actually have to use Esc for more than just bringing up the game menu!) and you can't adjust any audio setting besides turning off the music.For a rogue lite, it has a shockingly low challenge level.  The death penalty (yeah, you can come back to life!) just subtracts a small amount of experience and gold and sets you at the entrance to the map you were on, leaving all the monsters in their current state.It ends up just being really boring and annoying to play.  Buy when it's 80-90% off if you're curious, otherwise stay away.  Go play Dungeons of Dredmor instead.			"

												Battlepaths tries for a Diablo feel, with its hack-n-slash style of gameplay and nice loot system, and town start music that I assume deliberately evokes Blizzard's classic. The gameplay is more simplistic than Diablo, however, with precious little in the way of special attacks and skills. Loot doesn't appear as randomised as it could be - there seem to be a lot of dupe weapons and armour. And my biggest grievance is the movement system - you can only move up, down, left and right, not diagonally. At first it's not an issue, but becomes a big pain when you're trying to kill a bunch of those #*&%@ ranged attackers. And I haven't come across any ranged weapons myself, which would have greatly appreciated. Battlepaths is still fun and rates a purchase, especially when it's on sale or as part of a bundle - just know what you're getting. NB. it's probably not massively replayable either.PROS:- fun, simple and addictive slashing and looting- nice and clean art style and some good music- loot is always great in any gameCONS- loot system could afford to be deeper/more randomised- very simplistic combat system may put off some- control annoyances - can't move diagonally- no ranged combat?

												BATTLEPATHS is a turnbased RPG that claims to be a roguelike. It has the traditional roguelike gameplay but nothing besides the loot drops is randomised. The game looks promising but falls flat at the gameplay. It has the turnbased movement but that doesn't exclude the randomised gamplay. The combat is really bland. You have 4 spells. Only 4 spells! Most turnbased roguelikes have over 50 spells and those 50 spells have more variety than a big bag of jellybeans. I often find myself hammering one button over and over again to kill a monster. 60% of the time I get to kill the monter. It just feels boring. The game claims to have variety in the loot drops but there is none. I found the same armor 5000 times and the same weapon 5000 times. Battlepaths said that it would let you build your own individual character. If you think this game had classes or something that would change your playstyle you're wrong. There is none of this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I went into this game hoping for an awesome rogulike experience but I got a poorly made bland turnbased RPG that couldn't make me smile once.STAY AWAY FROM THIS TITLE			"

												Battlepaths is a 2-D, Dungeon Crawler game with RPG and Turn-Based Strategy elements.Let's go straight to what makes this game unique: whenever you encounter a monster, you will enter a turn based mode, where every move or attack any of you make consumes Movement Cost. Also, each time you attack, a Special bar will refill of a tiny bit of it length; when the bar is full you will be able to use a special attack.These are the main features of this game, there is no more depth than this, and what will keep you playing for hours, will be decided by how much you like this simplistic gameplay. Other than this, it's the classic Dungeon Crawler, comprehensive of the usual Hardcore mode (where if you die the character you made is gone for good, and you have to start over), its need for a better gear, +%Magic Find builds or +%Special Ability builds or +%Physical Damage builds... Clean the dungeon, slay the boss, get the drops and repeat!For a better and more detailed overview of Battlepaths' gameplay, I recommend you taking a look to this guide, written by a developer, will help you to know anything you may wish to know about Battlepaths' characteristics.While it may look like I'm linking this guide out of laziness, I find it an easier way to inform you only about what you want to know, keeping the review short for a fast reading while enclosing anything you may want to know about the game.You can find the aforementioned guide here:


Battlepaths Basics 
A Guide for Battlepaths
By: Quaid

			Battlepaths is a  turn-based  RPG with a sophisticated attribute and skill system. This guide will tell you the most important aspects of the game.		


The game plays quite well, being balanced enough to let you reach the end of it without much struggle, given that you'll be carrying few dozens of good health potions with you along the way. However, I did find the game excessively grindy, especially when it comes to get more gold to buy more potions to explore the harder levels, and even more grindy when it comes to reach the top level or the maximum skill level for the weapon you're using. It literally takes dozens of hours of grinding, and I found this obnoxious, therefore why I'm not going to recommend this game.Regardless of its bland graphic and the mediocre sound department, this game doesn't stand out among the dozens of dungeon crawlers out there. Buy it only if you struggle to find new Dungeon Crawlers to brun some time.Graphic: 6/10Sound: 6/10Longevity: 7/10Gameplay: 7/10Overall: 6/10			"

												A pretty simple turn-based rpg, Very simple.You'll start by choosing one of the five sets of attributes and the first realm, but if you complete the previous you'll unlock the next, for a total of 4 available realms.You start moving around the map, get quests, explore other areas, fight monsters and complete the quests. Pretty few skills and thus pretty few mechanics if not normal attacks.Surely not worth to buy, since it has been free a while ago from the writing of this review, but surely nice to give it a casual try.

Oh and the loot is always armor, boots, helmet, amulet or one handed melee weapon, that's it, you don't even have shields in this game.""addictive 2D-RPG""It was playable for 2-3 hours at most, but that's becouse I haven't played any simple RPGs(which I love) in a while. It can hardly be called even a simple RPG as there is only warrior class, you can't even rename your hero(he's always called Ralph or something, it's probably dev's name) and you don't have any skills(aside from ""specials"" that you activate to get+movement speed for few turns for example, which would do but you can have 4 max and I only had 2 on the level 17).""excellent loot system""Basicly anything that rolled without +damage is nearly useless, most of what you'll find is complete trash.""The battle begins in Babatula, the first of three big realms to explore.""It's tiny, especially non-story dungeons, they are like one room, i'm not kidding, you enter something called the viper cave and it's just one room. And those bigger dungeons are annoying to explore becouse there is no map.""You can choose to play in different realms that each have their own landscape and their own set of creatures""The most boring, typical fantasy landscapes you'll ever see in your life and reskins of the same of creatures - mages, archers(basicly mages but without resists), strong melee fighters, quick melee fighters and weak enemies that can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥to you. That's basicly it.""The character customization allows you to create a unique hero with its own strengths and weaknesses. You can build a heavy, damage dealing tank, a deadly ninja that utilizes high speed and agility to attack his victims from out of nowhere, a true master of mind who crushes his foes with powerful combinations of special abilities, or something in between. ""Regardless of your ""build"" all you'll ever do is press attack to whack enemy with your melee weapon, and sometimes use healing potions on yourself and throw damage/sleep potion, maybe throw a summon potion so that enemies can unfocus you for one turn. That's it, there are no potions of poison, weakness(even though there is poison and weakness status effects in the game) or anything, at least not in the first and second realms that i've played, all the atack/summon/heal potions were the same♥♥♥♥♥♥as in the very beginning but stronger.Only your character has movement and attack animation, overall this games looks like an amatuer tileset for  a roguelike while having zero content in comparison.This is a game that should've been free, devs are still bugfixing it, but should've just abandoned it long ago and focus on making something better.

			Mr Windblade plays Battlepaths, demonstrating a total lack of skill in the game. It's a bit of a wreck. Battlepaths is available on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/296050/		

30 minutes of Battlepaths footage.Not much to say - the game hits all the right marks, but still somehow feels underwhelming.  This game is for hardcore fans of the genre who have simply run out of everything else to play.  This game doesn't hold a candle to genre staples like Tales of Maj'Eyal or ADOM, both of which have superior gameplay, interfaces, and characters.It's a competent game, and is priced reasonably, but so much of the game's core mechanics have been done better elsewhere.

												Battlepaths is the best Jon Arbuckle game on steam where you whack and smack people and monsters on their face. In fact, it's the only Jon Arbuckle game where you whack and smack, it would make Garfield puke its guts out.The game as a rogue-lite sometimes adoringly looks similar to the pen and paper version of Dungeons and Dragons, where you meet your friends, play with basic card cutouts of heroes and villains and battle maps, and in general have a grand ol' time. Other times though, Battlepaths' simplicity of combat and looting serves to a fault filled with frustration and eyes rolling.Graphics are simple and funnily-cartoonish 2D fare that looks okay and functional overall, with enough color and variety, Animation however, is almost non-existent. You move like a cardboard cutout (meaning you don't move at all, you just spawn to the next spot) and only move a hand up and down in the air, which represents either an attempt to fight or a fist-shaking at the game creators for giving everyone no animations whatsoever, As for the story, there is none: You play as Jon Arbuckle which for some reason in this game calls himself Rick, a would-be adventurer. You make a character, choose a level of difficulty, you start with the first zone, pick up the most generic quests possible, whack stuff that moves, you level up, and finally as you grow stronger, you unlock new area with more dangerous stuff that needs to be whacked some more.There is music and sound... which are completely unobtrusive and forgettable, that you'll soon turn a podcast and do some multitasking.The battle system, which is a bread and butter for all rogue-lite games, in Battlepaths is very simple where you have only one attack until you unlock up to four, very simplistic special combat moves and effects, either passive or active. Which is fine and even kind of a relaxing, until the game decides to put some effort to it, and introduce enemies with gazillion hit points, or ranged units that have a chance to hit you three or four times in a row per your move. Yes you read it right, you move one block at a time, while enemy ranged units stand from several blocks away, happily filling you with arrows and ice/fireballs while you can do squat. Meaning, in later part, the game uses cheap and annoying tricks to increase the difficulty.You can call upon beasts from the bottle to fight at you side, which is a cool idea, except they are weak and have next to zero intelligence. They are fine if you spawn them right next to your enemy, as they attack them, but if an enemy is a couple of blocks away, chances are your summoned beast is only going to give them a threatening glance as they refuse to move or attack.Looting system is a bit more complex, with enough variety to satisfy that inner crave to bogart everything. You can also upgrade loot with augmentation stones which give random benefits, as well as cancel upgrades or re-arange upgrades with appropriate magic stones.Overall, Battlepaths is a solid, if uninspired game that is going to offer you 5-10 hours of average fun. And for a price it's asking, you could do far worse.			"

												This game fels like  a flash game written by a four year old. im normally not one to badmouth games, but this one is simply no good... Do not, ever, spend money on this game. While some may talk about it being funny and other things like that (mostly fake people it seems) you can hardly get through the game to the funn ystuff. True this game runs, and actually doesnt glitch much, but the total lack of feeling, or any spirit, drove me away from this game. It truely feels like something slapped together in a matter of seconds, then had afive dollar price tag added. The only good part is that I got it for free.			"

Combat is easy.You can customize your character's attributes to your liking (Dex, Int, Str, Speed, Power, bla bla).You finish quests. There is a town. There is an evil force you must defeat. You level up.Basically a small 2D Diablo.Don't expect too much. It's a cute little game. (Is addicting for the first couple of hours.)			"

												Maybe there is a good game behind this ugly mask of atrocious artwork and interface design, i can't tell. Couldn't make myself play it.Update: Apparently, ugly graphics isn't enough to stop me from playing a game that gives me poorly drawn swords with marginally better numbers on them and then throws slightly stronger monsters at me and OH MY GOD! why am I still playing this game?It does scratch that ""kill mobs - grab loot - level up - kill more mobs"" itch and i have to confess the later parts of the game may be challenging if you're not careful with your build. Still I can't recommend buying this game at full price because production value is lower than in some free games.			"

tl;dr -> If you are running a potato that cannot support flash games or Diablo 1, I would STILL skip this game. Save your few dollars for some fast food.I traded for this game and was initially interested in the concept of the game, however, I came out with a very unsatisfying experience. I tried hard to give this game a chance, I really did, but there are just an endless amount of better alternatives out there. I've written a lot of reviews, and one thing I always try to focus on - especially after following YouTuber Totalbiscuit's videos for a while - is whether or not a game is worth your time and investment. Unfortunately, I sincerely believe that this game is not worth your time and resources. Play Diablo 1 or even some free flash games on gaming websites like Kongregate or Newgrounds. I will add that I most likely have a heavy bias in critiquing this game, as the game I have played the longest in my entire life was Diablo 2. I also have invested a considerable amount of time in Path of Exile. The action-RPG genre is one of my most favorite, and I have played many turn-based ones on websites like Kongregate, almost all of which have been more fleshed-out and polished than this. If you like casual gameplay, 2D turn-based combat, and light RPG elements, then you may end up liking this game. I would still advise you to consider other alternatives. The aesthetics are average - the detail and variety in the backgrounds and character models is decent. I understand this is an indie game, however, one thing that bothered me (I am a big aesthetics ♥♥♥♥♥) is how none of the equipment you use appears on your character. Instead, you will periodically upgrade how your character looks as you progress through the game (until you get the golden armor and sword). I have played basic flash games that have this aesthetic feature, so I think something that costs this much should at least have a few aesthetic features available.The sounds and music are nothing fancy, I muted everything within an hour of playing and used my own music. The story and quests are very bland and follow Diablo's basic formula of ""go here and kill x."" The variety of loot is very large, however, it again feels insignificant to me because of the lack of visual feedback.The controls are very simple and the learning curve is minimal. There is enough feedback given to make sure you do not get lost during your playthrough, and the levelling up system is very, very basic. When you die, you can respawn at the cost of a small percentage of your gold and experience. There are a number of realms you can travel to, each unlocked as you progress through the story.During gameplay, you move around in a grid-based world. When you encounter enemies, each time you move/do an action, all enemies will respond accordingly - completing one ""turn."" If you open your inventory and drink a health potion, for example, you will use up your turn, allowing enemies to move around. To attack, you just have to move your character in the direction of an enemy to attempt to hit them. Combat is very bland with basic combat animations and sound assets. Depending on the weapon you use, you will also gain weapon mastery experience, and each level grants you bonuses to damage and attack rating (chance to hit). You can not use magic in this game.Overall, the game offers a very mediocre experience, and I implore anyone interested in this kind of game to research alternatives, since there are a lot of better ones available (many of which are free). At the time of writing this review, the game is on a week long deal for $2.19 CAD, and I still think that is too much to spend on Battlepaths.Do not recommend.Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												This game is surprisingly fun and addictive! It feels like a simplified version of Dungeons of Dredmor, minus the crafting system. The graphics are on flash games level but that doesn't mean it's bad. The anmation is there, sufficient to say the least. The loot system is pretty neat as well (reminds me of Diablo). If you love loot-focused games, you should definitely check this out. I should mention that there is also a Hardcore mode included in the game, where permadeath comes in play. Excellent for the masochistic souls!Battlepaths comes highly recommended from me! I give it a personal 7/10			"

												Not good. Was expecting an ARPG or something like it. First off, you run around in blocked movement patterns set to the arrow keys first (yes in this day and age). Apparently the game was not made for computers, as it doesn't work at all. You don't use your mouse for basically anything. Movement, picking up, etc. For combat you stand next to someone and you each get a turn attacking in real time. You have to keep pressing the movement button that corresponds to where they are at for each attack. You miss a lot and it takes a while to kill someone. So yes this means hammering the movement button, which is annoying. The combat seems boring and not very intuitive. Then there is the items. Things drop but you can't pick them up by clicking or anything else. You have to first press your show items button to see what it is and if there is something for you to pick up, and then you still can't click on it. You have to get in the perfect position until the item is highlighted and then you have to press the use/interact key and it picks it up. Yes you have to do that for EVERY item, another poorly done thing. Then there are quests. you don't have a button that brings up quests. You have to press the inventory button and then press tab multiple times to go to quests, which you must do each time you want to see quests, yes as dumb as it sounds. Then there is the map. It is super broad and unhelpful, not specific to your territory. It also doesn't tell you where your quest destinations are or what is around. Many items you can't interact with. I walked into a cave and started getting auto hit from across the area by a bat somehow, as I couldn't dodge and there was nothing I could see coming at me or I could do. Then there is equipping items. I equipped a club and a knife still showed up on my character as what he was holding (how can you not even get this right?). I equipped a bandana and it didn't show up. Lets see a wonky poorly done real time turn based rpg that doesn't work for computer input, with poor weapon interaction and nothing shows up on you, with poorly described/indicated quests.......couldn't they get SOMETHING right? Oh and the spells are super boring and generic, basically buffs. You can't even allocate starting ability points, just choose from preset ones. No classes. Game starts windowed and you have to wait and be playing the game before you can change it from the pause menu. There are no graphical or resolution settings. Really seems like a high school programming class project titled ""my first game"". 4/10.			"

												I don't know if I would call this game 'lazy' per-say...The music and sound are pretty mediocre. Nothing really stands out or creates atmosphere but nothing ever screams 'terrible' either. It is as bland as a game console menu screen.The graphics are poor but again they do the job. A Spider looks like a spider, things in general look like what they are even if they are simple in looks and art direction.The gameplay? Well it's like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon or Digimon World 2 (US/Japan only). Basically when you move, everything moves with you so its a psudo real time feel while secretly being a turn based game.If the game sounds average and bland well, that is because it is as it really offers little to make itself stand out while remaining competent enough to not become the next Bad Rats. My fun with the game was small and fleeting because like Hyglide (NES) the amount of xp to next level grows stupendiously high and you really start to reel from the tedium if you were putting points in something that won't pay off till later, for example the speed stat. Slapping all my points into strength seemed to payoff really well early in the game and I recommend you take that route on your first playthrough as well because you will rapidly find yourself being swarmed early in the game and while this doesn't make the game harder (oddly enough) it does leave you wishing the game had more options for dealing wth crowds.I mean it does have options, but as well as having a special (think ""mana"") bar, abilities also have cooldowns on them. Personally I would rather they stuck with one system or the other, not both so the only other option is to throw gold at enemies by buying bombs but of course the gold you earn vs the gold you would spend to kill enemies would leave you out of pocket very quickly.However even with all that said, the game provides options and even if I don't think all the options are equally viable I do apprechiate the fact it has more options than Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. Speaking of options their is also an ironman mode as well which again is a nice little extra.Overall if you are a fan of these types of games you may enjoy battlepaths, I have certainly played worse on the Playstation (Digimon World 2!) but the game is not very exciting. It feels like painting by numbers and I felt more like I was going through the motions than engaging with the game.If you can get into it, you will have fun but for most other people you can easily avoid this game and you are not missing anything.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												I've decided to re-write my review for this game and review it based on achievements alone.The developers consider you to have completed the game at 100% achievements - here are my thoughts on each of the harder ones.===========================Weapon specialization achievements- Complete BS, forces you to play the game 4 times because only one can be unlocked per playthrough or characterSkill specialization achievements- Same thing, forces you to play through 3 times up to the level you unlock your second skill at.Touching obelisks achievement- Obelisks are supposed to give you buffs for battle, but in fact you almost always only get to use them AFTER the battle.Reaching level 35- Enjoy grinding the last few levels for many hours.Boss/challenge achievements- Good luck finding the right gear, you'll need to be opening quite a few chests, sell a lot of items and stock up on bunch of potions and other consumables before being able to take on them. 250K damage without dying- Because of very imbalanced fights at certain points in the game, good luck with this on your first or second attempt. Either you learn everything on your first playthrough and then get it while leveling up those last levels after everything is done, or you start another run for hardcore mode and get it from there... by finishing the game again and grinding a bit more so you take enough damage.Opening 150 treasure chests- Grinding for keys and then moving to few treasure chests to open them. YayCrafting a masterpiece- Hah, good luck with that. I found 3 small chance upgrade items for it (which means 3 attempts) in my 17 hours of play... didn't get it yet.===========================Edit: This is actually a rant on both game mechanics and the achievements that don't fit a game like this in my opinion.Achievements aside, the game is sort of enjoyable at first. It keeps you playing to see new monsters, items and skills, but disappoints you in the end.			"

												Battlepaths is a perfect example of cheap game with poor production values. A wet dream of a money-greedy indie developer who thought he invented roguelike genre again with his terrible art style combined with uninspirational gameplay. GJ. That's good job for fanboys (hope there isn't any). I'm sorry to inform you all that Dungeons of Dreadmor has already been made and it's like on this other planet, planet of awesome new iterations of old genres, and BattleBATHS was left in it's rotting, infested homeplanet of terrible excuses and incompetense. I would love this game if it was good.			"

												I normally don't let things like aesthetic get in the way of enjoying a game, but usually in those circumstances, the game has something going for it (typically gameplay).  This game was clearly made with MS Paint.  I'm genuinely not kidding either.As I said, I could forgive the aesthetic, as it does have that almost joking flash game look in it's art style (part of me died using the word art in that sentence), but the gameplay and interface feels like the dev wanted to inflict nothing short of misery upon the player.  The only thing I can imagine that would allow the design to become what it was, is if there was say a $100 budget for the programming, and the dev(s) spent $90 on beer.This game is bad.The kind of bad that makes you feel dirty for having spent more than 5 minutes with the game.And I'm not talking about bad as in you had a dirty thought that makes you feel bad outwardly, but deep down, your nipples actually got a little hard.  No, I'm talking about the kind of bad like that one time you were driving home from your parents house who live like 4 hours away, and despite the fact that you were dead tired, you decide to drive home anyway, because the bed in their guest room is all stiff and lumpy, not like your bed at home.  On the way, you could feel your eyes getting heavy and you even catch yourself dipping your head while doing 75 mph in a 65, which is what was happening whenOHMYGODITHINKIJUSTHITAHOMELESSDUDE.Instead of stopping though, you just keep driving.That kind of bad.Even if this game is on sale, it's not worth it.Don't run over homeless dudes.

												Not sure why all the negative reviews. Sure, this game becomes tedious trying to 100%, and the character graphics stay the same as you change your armor (slight graphic changes as you Level Up), but for the price, I think this game is great. It's all about upgrading and leveling up in order to progress and complete the game. This game has great controller support, decent top view graphics and a nice upgrade system. There are 3 Realms to fight through with different enemies in each, and a Hall of Challenges Mode. I'll give this game a good 7 out of 10, for the fact it plays well, has a lot of items, and a good difficulty level. It does get repetitive however trying to complete the Achievements. The Realms only take about 10 hours to complete, and another 20 for the other Achievements, and then much longer if you get into the Hardcore Achievements. Still recommend this for anyone with a gamepad, looking for Achievements & Cards and just something new for their Library.			"

												A pretty simple turn-based rpg, Very simple.You'll start by choosing one of the five sets of attributes and the first realm, but if you complete the previous you'll unlock the next, for a total of 4 available realms.You start moving around the map, get quests, explore other areas, fight monsters and complete the quests. Pretty few skills and thus pretty few mechanics if not normal attacks.Surely not worth to buy, since it has been free a while ago from the writing of this review, but surely nice to give it a casual try.

												Battlepaths is a roguelike dungeon crawler with a fantasy theme. You move around by using the arrow keys and you attack by 'walking' into enemies. There's an inventory screen, you can compare items and you can add magical abilities to items by finding the right type of loots. Special abilities can be activated by pressing tab. It looks a bit like Diablo but it plays like Dungeons of Dredmore.Unfortunately, it is also rather boring. I played on hardcore mode, died and then realised that because the map isn't randomised (only the loot is) I would have to do the exact same thing over and over. ""Hardcore"" mode is only fun when every challenge is different. I don't play ""normal"" mode when there's a hardcore mode available as I don't think dying and losing some experience in this game would in any way provide for a meaningful gaming experience. It'd just be a slow, boring and ugly grind while experiencing something that doesn't move me at all.I also gathered that you can obtain a game key for free, which makes every cent spent on it seem a poor investment.That being said: the game is solid. It does what it is supposed to but it just isn't a lot of fun.			"

(oh, there's this guy, oh, i killed him.)* It sharply becomes hard.* There isn't any animation. It looks like it was made with little or no effort.* You don't have a wide selection of building your character.It's very mediocre. But it's worth IF ONLY it's on 90% sale.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but I couldn't get over the controls. The controls alone leave me middle of the road with this game. They're all over the keyboard and at the moment, can't be remapped. The beta has key binding settings in the install folder, so maybe in a future release, these settings will be available in-game.Other than the controls, Battlepaths offers a nice, very basic, RPG. I couldn't bring myself to play beyond the first couple quests, so I can't say too much about the story.I'm not giving it a thumbs up in it's current state, but rather with hope that it gets better in the future.

												This game plays like a 2003 Flash RPG on Newgrounds, in the worst way possible.I'm pretty sure it's a game design student's first real game project that someone had the audacity to sell, put achievements on, and have trading cards for. Don't even bother getting this for trading cards. They're 4 cents apiece and I doubt people will be buying them.The plot is skeletal and hollow, the graphics look like a child drew them, all 5 different sound effects repeat endlessly, the music is... surprisingly alright (all three tracks, anyway), and the combat is atrocious for a game all about combat.There's no balance whatsoever: ranged enemies destroy everything, you've got endless money but nothing useful to spend it on, once you get rogue gear everything becomes trivial. Except for when it's not, then you're suddenly overwhelmed in a single turn and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. The difficulty goes from boring button mash fest to ""well, guess I'm dead again"".The only reason I played so long was to get those trading cards. I figured I also owed it to potential buyers to also give it an in-depth review.TL;DR - If this was a game made by my best friend with the intent to sell it, I'd smack them upside the head and send them to the corner of shame to rethink their decision.

												Wasted about 4 hours of my life playing something I could have programmed better in RPG Maker when I was 12.Graphics: 2/10, they look like they tossed out whatever crayon drawing they could make as fast as possible.Music: 6/10, pretty sure some of it was straight ripped from Diablo.Gameplay: 4/10, turn based, no actual skill involved. You literally just walk towards monsters and they die.Storyline: 1/10. There isn't one. In fact, half-way through when you're supposed to go to the next map area, they don't tell you HOW. You're just left standing there with no idea how to progress. The dev's don't really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥either.All in all, I'm happy I got it for free on Indiegala. The steam cards are worth more than the game would be at full price.EDIT: Also, the dev's are hilariously immature when responding to people's comments. Seriously dude, it's the internet. You made a bad game, and people will tell you why it's bad. Instead of insulting them personally, maybe you should spend some time making a better game.			"

Now the item should stick to the cursor3) Press TAB 4 times to switch between panels. There should be 2 items now, one in the inventory (A') and one on the cursor (A)4) Click A'.

After entangling with enemies until they could stand no more, or I died due to some strong enemy interupting, it just felt like the game was melting into the background as I played it. The penalty for death is negligible, as enemies are neither refreshed of health, or even replenished as a mob. It's more like a game of ""How much you can stand, before you get bored.""It probably wouldn't take much to finish this game; but I don't really feel like playing such a boring RPG. This game is far more simplistic than stuff I'd find on the NES, without much of a challenge to it either. Definitely not worth purchasing...

I find after ~3 hours of play (over about 3 days), the addition wears off. Nice game, developers did well. but then I wanted something more. I bit faster paced during the 'adventuring' time. Battles were fun, some were challenging. Character building was fun as well. Give it a go if you have the time. again, probably worth $5			"
