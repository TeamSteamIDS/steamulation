												[Original Review, dated Oct 18, 2014 @ 1:44am]♥♥♥♥ this game. Literally ♥♥♥♥ this game.Why? Because it is actually really REALLY FUN. And THAT is exactly the Problem!How so you ask? Simple! Because it is yet another free-to-play, pay-to-win game. It is a good game disguising a hideous marketing strategy. It is absolutely repulsive.Because you're gonna start playing this game and go ""Oh man! This game is really fun! I want to keep playing it!"" but then slowly the realization starts to seep in... YOU CAN'T. Why not? Well, lets see here... did you lose that last round? Bit of random bad luck and didn't quite make it? Want to try the round again? WELL TOO BAD!! Your heros are out of health now and won't be full again until THREE HOURS FROM NOW. Hey, did the game just give you a sweet new character as a reward for beating a stage? Great! Too bad you're out of spaces for new characters in your hero roster that you can only expand using the game's premium currency! Oh and by the way, your reward expires in five days and then you'll lose it forever, good luck trying to farm premium currency through the stages in game! Oh, I'm sure it won't take you very long if you've got a strong team of heros to keep plowing through with... Oh, what's that? They're all out of health again? Guess you're ♥♥♥♥ed! LOLS!! Seriously, this is the only game I've ever played that gives you rewards that you're never able to actually use.And it all just spirals on downhill from there. You want to get anywhere in this game? ""Give us your money!"" And not just some of your money... ALL OF YOUR MONEY! Because lets face it, it would be EASY to release a normal, playable version of this game for say $15... but they don't want just a little of your money. They want ALL OF YOUR MONEY. There is a never ending supply of money that this game can drain away from you. Because that's how it was designed. And it is a damned crying shame!Avoid this piece of garbage like the Plague. Or Ebola. Whatever horrifying desease floats your boat. XP-------------------[Revised Review, dated 3/24/2016]I'm not sure what drew me back to this game, other than that I still see a few people on my friends list playing it and that annoyed me... aaaand I was just bored enough one day to take a second look. So consider this an ""update"" on the previous review, because I decided to legitimately give the game a second chance and see how it has evolved since last I touched it and if it has improved it's terrible performance.To my surprise... it has.A lot of the inherient flaws I found in the game persist. You still need to pay for roster slots and you never quite seem to have enough for the number of ""cover"" rewards you're given. And as a player starting out (because the game did reset me to scratch for whatever reason, but all the better to review the updates), you will likely feel constantly overwhelmed in most challenges and leaderboards because a signficant portion of the playerbase is already way ahead of you.However, with a bit of proper management, selling off hero/covers you don't really want to use and spending your hero tokens entirely on roster slots, you can make it through the early stages fairly easier than I remembered them being. Additionally, the amount of time you have to claim your rewards has clearly been extended by a wide margin(my original review claims 5 days, the current build gives you 14 days), allowing you much more time to earn hero points through gameplay to unlock the roster slots you need to claim them. And those Hero Points seem to be a lot easier to come by than they were previously. Also, the very welcome addition of a set of 10 Full Heal items (that also restore back up to ten over time like hp bars do) makes grinding various activities a lot easier. Lastly, the removal of ""Environment Tiles"" and addition of ""Team-Up Tiles"" is an great update. You're able to earn Team Up cards through gameplay and from your ""Alliance""/clan, which are powerful one use hero powers that can completely turn the tides of a battle from ""I'm going to lose!"" to ""Holy crap, I just wasted those guys!""Overall, the experience is much improved. With a bit of dedication and smart team building... and, you know, LUCK... you can probably have a fun time with this game and not run into the massive frustrations I encountered in my original review. In a little over two weeks, I've built up a roster of 22 Heroes (from Star Rank 1 to 4), easily twice what I was originally able to obtain, without paying a cent and the next cover I care about making sure I get has 8 entire days left to go before I'd need to start worrying about whether I'd earn enough Hero Points to claim it or not. Unlike the first time I played, I actually feel like that's a goal I can achieve now. So... I have to give credit where credit is due. I've had fun with this, I think you could too.I do not retract my previous review statements. They are a reflection of the time and at that time things were much worse than they are now. And the inherient problems of a game built around microtransactions still exist, even if they have softened the impact they made at launch. Nonetheless, the game has proved itself to me enough that I am now willing to recommend it, so I will begrudingly perform that courtesy.			"

												This game was/is not much different then many other match 3 games except that you use characters to beat up other characters.It was quite fun and a way to waste a few hours just battling it out.  But then they did a few changes which made it so that if you wanted to progress you had to do whats called grinding (for those that don't know, thats when you have to spend 5 or 6 hours playing just to keep up with others playing).  This made things less fun.Now for the biggest change, if you have any characters that can heal the team during combat its called false healing.  Basically what happens is that while in a round, they will heal your characters, but soon as its done, any and all damage that was done to your character during a round gets applied to your characters, which means they will more then likely be instantly down and you have to wait somewhere between 3 and 14 hours for them to heal.So now instead of being able to play for a couple of hours, you're lucky if you get in a couple of rounds that can last about 5 to 10 minutes at most and then you need to wait till the next day (least for those of us with families, work and who require sleep) to play for another 10 minutes and then wait.They wanted to stop people from using their healing characters in story mode to heal their wounded characters and instead buy heath packs, which cost Hero Points which while they do come in game, they are very rare in game and they expect more people to buy Hero Points so they can buy health pack.  This has basically turned the game into pay 2 win game, well it was before but now its much worse.The majority of people who play F2P games will never actually put money into free 2 play games.  Once it gets to the point where they are spending more then a few hours playing and not being able to keep up with their friends, they loose interest and leave, and start bad mouthing the game, which causes people not to go play that game, which means the game looses lots of money.So for now I can not recommend this game.  Maybe if the devs wise up and actually listen to the community and things go back to how they were a couple of months ago, may I will start playing again and maybe even recommend this game, but lots of things have to change.

												After 280 hours played, I'm finally done with the game. But at the very least I should be able to give people a very thorough review of the game.At 280 hours played, the game can't be that bad, right? So why stop now?The core of the game is still really cool. You build up a roster of Marvel heroes and villians and level them up to build a stronger and stronger team. And the devs support the game relatively well with new events and new heroes so there is always something to do.Still, they just pushed it too far. This game isn't really a game, it's a second job. I see no way to play this game casually, either you are all in or you are out. Every two weeks there is a new hero, accompanied by a 10 day long PvE event that's a pure battle of attrition to defend a placement in the leaderboards high enough to get the new hero. If you don't? Without the new hero you'll have already lost in the next tournament. The new always gives a insurmountable advantage for the next. There is no way to escape this sweatshop.And the PvE events are less fun with each iteration. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rubber banding and level scaling makes PvE tournaments an exercise in frustration and disappointment. Have a maxed out Lv141 roster? Enjoy being beaten in placement by Level 50 teams, because their enemies get scaled to level 20 and take 1 minute each while you slog it out against Lv300 enemies with 10k HP each. And then the PvP tournaments... They used to be great. But then they changed the match making algorithm so that now every fight is a tired slog. And since there is now always an Alliance season running, you HAVE to do well in every single PvP tournament non stop or you are letting down your alliance. Alliances are another thing... they are great socially. But the pressure they put you under is enourmous. And again, it's all in or all out. Without being in a good alliance, you'll miss 30% of each tournament's reward! You might as well not bother if you aren't in an alliance.And the time commitment required to stay in the game is 2 hours EVERY SINGLE DAY. And even that is sometimes not enough, with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending times in the middle of the night for EU players which means all your effort is wasted thanks to rubber banding of US players near the end of the tournament while you are sleeping.Just do yourself a favor and don't get involved in this game. It's a bottomless black hole that you can't escape from. Why I quit now and not weeks ago? Season 1 just ended and I could finally leave without ♥♥♥♥ing over my alliance. They are great people and they didn't deserve being abandoned halfway through the season.			"

Game is f2p as ♥♥♥♥ and you'd better believe it'll let you purchase Marvel Funcoins which can powerlevel heroes HMM I WONDER IF THERE'S A TERM FOR THATalso as someone pointed out this dude has made a much better breakdown of the awful cash-grab nature of this game AND reveals that 'endgame' is PvP against other players! http://steamcommunity.com/app/234330/discussions/0/648813727931457773/ "

												This game fails on many levels: It doesn't introduce anything new, story is delivered dry and with little variation, graphics consist of a small handfull of stills per hero and poor to at most mediocre effects, user interface is confusing and very obviously trying to push microtransactions at every corner, and unless you want to spend a lot on taking shortcuts to increase your level and power, you're likely going to get stuck in replays of levels, grinding away for many hours per improvement.Free to play, sure. Pay to win, very much so. Overpriced? Most definitely.I guess another game to throw on the heap of ""let's ride the current hype with minimal effort"".			"

												It's a mobile game port. Mobile gaming is the bottom of the toilet of the gaming industry. Fun game but it is very expensive to get any real progress, which includes ""micro"" transactions up to $99 from what I hear. It also has health for your heroes that drains and you have to wait several hours before it refills before you can play the game again, or of course you can pay their premiums to play more. It's the same formula that 99.99% of ""free to play"" mobile gaming uses which as I said makes mobile gaming the bottom of the toilet of the gaming industry. By the time you've spent enough money on this game you've paid what you would've paid for a full priced new triple A game, or much, much more than that, which is pointless.If any game I've ever seen deserved to have quotes around ""free to play"", this one is it. Or literally any ""free to play"" mobile game that exists for that matter.			"

												When this first came out, I really wanted to like it.  Heck, when it first came out, I DID like it.  I'm going to go straight to my pros and cons.PROS:1) Classic Puzzle Quest gameplay - If you have enjoyed any of the other PQ games, the gameplay is back.  You get 3 characters on your team, who provide 1-3 abilities each.  It's still fun and addicting.  This is not my problem with the game at all.2) Big cast - There are 33 characters and counting in this game.  Each brings something new to the table.  Sure, several of the characters are different versions of the another character (there are 3 different Wolverines), but they usually play differently enough that you won't mind.CONS:1) Poorly timed updates - In a game like this, nerfs are a fact of life.  But nerfing a character in the middle of an event that focuses on that character is a jerk move.  Especially now that they are introducing...2) Tournaments with entrance fees - This might not be so bad if it had been there from the start, but as a new feature, it feels like the wrong direction for the game.  To make matters worse, you can't find out the available characters for use in the  tournament until AFTER paying the costs.3) Rising costs - There are several neat features that were introduced as crutches to help players with weaker rosters, like Shields to protect against attacks in PVP and Boosts (extra starting energy or damage) to give yourself an extra edge.  These started off being available at a decent price, but then skyrocketed without warning after everyone came to depend on them.4) Speed-run - I don't know about you, but I like to play games at my own pace, and you can in this game... for the Prologue.  After that, each chapter is available for a limited time and disappears at the end of that time.  I completely missed Chapter 1 because of this and if you are starting now, it might be too late for you to see Chapter 2 as well.  This is made worse by the fact that some of the fights in these chapters have opponents with levels over 200 (your characters are capped at 141 until you manage to level the very rarest characters) and the fact that some levels are UNPLAYABLE unless you have a specific character in your roster!  Missing part of the story because you couldn't get a 4* Invisible Woman (the rarest character) is unacceptable.5) Slow leveling - When I started playing, this was my biggest complaint, but I adapted to it.  I would have still recommended this if it were the only problem.  However, it is still a problem you should be aware of.  Characters require THREE forms of leveling.  First, you need covers acquire or level up your skills.  Second, there is a very rare form of currency called Hero Points that can replace the need for covers, but you will likely need it for other purposes, because it is very rare unless you pay to buy more of it with real currency.  Third, you need ISO, which is the experience of the game.  At first, you'll think you are getting a ton of it, because low level characters can get a level after a fight or two.  Once your characters start to get mid-level, you will need to win ~20 fights to level a single character by one level.  With 30+ characters that have a max level anywhere from 50 to 230, you will need a LOT of ISO and even buying it with cash won't help because it is crazy expensive.SUMMARYI love the gameplay and being able to play with Marvel superheroes.  I was willing to cope with the slow leveling until the developers started making a ton of poor decisions that favored those who are insanely high-leveled or spending cash.  I want to love this game, and if it had been released as a Single-Player game like all of the others, I probably would.  But the way it is, I just can't.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but the path chosen by the developers makes this one of the most frustrating experiences with a game I have ever had. The hours I have listed on this game are not technically accurate as I had it running in the background for days/weeks at a time. However I have easily put in 100's of hours into trying to like this game, hoping that the devs would fix the issues and it would improve. Ultimately I finally realized that there was near zero chance that would happen because the devs want the game to be this way.First the lets talk about the good - If you enjoy PuzzleQuest you will like the mechanics, the incorporation of the Marvel license is topnotch both with writing and character design. If you can be content with just playing the story missions and only a small subset of the available champions then go ahead. However if you are like me and want to play with the new champions when they are released and play the special events then you will pay. And if you pay realize that it is only a matter of time before that which you paid for is nerfed or sidelined or otherwise invalidated by whatever the newest cash grab from D3 is.Here is how it works, lets say you have a set of beginning characters (called 2 star for their rarity) and are having fun. You see that a new character is being released (omg Nick Furry?! I want to play that one too!). In order to get covers for that character you have to buy them with real money, oh except you can't really buy them straight you have to buy a ""pack"" and hope you get the covers you want (along with a bunch of stuff you don't want). If you aren't willing to go that route then you will have to jump through some very specific hoops, namely you will be ""competing"" with other players for a chance to win the cover. You do this by direct competition (through a very very broken PvP style contest that I am not even going to get into its so bad) or by grinding away at special missions, missions that are designed to be overpowering and that will wound or kill your characters (requiring you to ""rest"" or buy medpacks with money). I don't know if I can stress how grindy these missions will be if you actually want a shot at the new cover, we are talking hours of playtime, but what is even worse is D3 picks the times you need to play. This is ultimately why I had to stop, in order to be successful with the rubber-banding and the like you had to be playing near the finish of each sub-event and each main event. That means you can't even just grind it out on your own time you needed to be hardcore during specific hours (forgot real life commitments). What I finally realized was there is no end game. That process described above is it. It doesn't get easier just harder, and not from a skill level just from a time commitment and frustration level. D3's entire model is to reward low level players greater then high level players to make them think rewards are quick and easy. Once you are hooked however you will constantly lose you chance at the new covers to the next wave of new players getting their hooks set. No only do I not recommend this to anyone I would be very cautious about ever playing anything from D3. "

												I started this game as a fan of PuzzleQuest (old ones) and comics. I've been playing it for quite a long time and the only thing kept me playing was my hope that this game will become better. But it hasn't. 1. PVE of this game has totally invalid MMR which makes 100 level teams to be attacked by 450 levels (newly released 5* characters). It's very very very hard to earn anything because that P2W guys will make sure that you won't get even top 100 with all your crazy effort.2. PVP is ""grind like hell or get nothing"", even with 8 hour refresh interval.3. Tokens they give as a reward bring something useful like once in a month. And I'm talking about gold ones...4. They release new characters every week and even more often, but if you want to play next even you HAVE to get at least one cover of that character. Then you need to buy a new roster slot which cost more for every new one.  Now they have more 100 characters and you need to have 100 slots if you want to play it. This will cost ridiculous amount of HP (or real money).To gain something in this game you need to either play at min 10 hours per day or donate, DONATE a lot and then play 10 hours per day.... When you already have a good roster you can play some events just for fun, but don't expect getting much reward. But if someone just started... pity them...I give it 1 star from 10 just for bearing Marvel name on it. Playing this game complete waste of your time!			"

												There is NO need to buy ANY DLC of this F2P one. Just ignore the micro-transactions. Honestly, you can get unlimited Iso-8/Hero Points/whatever in-game currencies using Cheat Engine to make yourself happy. Collecting the awesome characters is fun, but the user experience is bad. High CPU usage, laggy during loading, and not-user-friendly UI. You can only draw one card at a time and cannot sell them all at once. You have to move and click your mouse frequently to get things done. And it's difficult to get a Legendary character (Invisible Woman), the possibility is about 1% I think. It's difficult to earn Hero Points as well. Versus system doesn't make any sense, you're still playing with AI. And the most important thing is, if you try to level up some of your favorite characters, it will cost you more than 100k of Iso-8 to the cap. I tried so hard to enjoy this Marvel-flavored Puzzle Quest, but I failed. This game shouldn't be called Puzzle Quest IMO.			"

												TL;DR - Avoid at all costs! I'm in too deep but it may not be too late for you.I've been playing the version on iOS since October last year and a lot has changed. The game deals in ISO and Hero Points. ISO is common but you'll need lots and Hero Points are uncommon but both are required. How much you'll enjoy this game will depend on how much money and time you'll be OK with sinking into this hole.You collect covers of characters. Each cover is arranged in a 1-4 star configuration. 1* = common, 4* = super rare. How you can get covers is by either winning tournaments or by earning standard or heroic tokens and lucking in to a cover you require. A standard token would typically give you 1* cover with a sprinking of 2* cover and the day you get a 3* cover go get a lotto ticket. Heroic tokens are hard to come across but you can get anywhere up to 19 Heroic Tokens (personal experience) before you get a 3* cover. Why covers of characters and not the characters themselves? Because you can have more than one cover of the same character! Yes! Lazy! For instance, there are 3 covers of Storm - a 1*, 2* and 3* cover. Wolverine has 3 covers - a 2*, 3* and 4*. Thor has 3 covers - 2*, 3* and 4*, etc.On top of that, most covers have 3 coloured moves and a maximum of 12 covers per chracter. Eg. Iron Man Model 40 (3*) - Unibeam (red), Ballistic Salvo (blue) and Recharge (yellow) (minus Bullseye (2*), Dr Doom (3*), Ragnarok (3*), Loki (3*) who all have 2 moves and a maximum of 10 covers). Meaning in order to max out your character, you need 12 covers and A LOT of ISO to level it up to full level. 1* covers level up to level 40, 2* = level 94, 3* = level 166 and 4* = level 270. Also, each cover takes up 1 roster slot. You can buy more with hero points! You can buy cover packs with hero points/real money. They come in 1, 10, 42 packs. The amount of REAL money for hero points in this game is highway robbery. There is 0 value. If you were to spend money on this game, it would be in hero points but the little hero points you get for your hard earnt money is not even close to worth it. When you purchase a pack (because the only other time you can earn a 10 pack is through the season rewards), it USED TO guarantee at least one 3* cover. But they took that away because screw consumers. They don't want people having all the good covers by simply getting a ""cheap"" (it's not cheap) 10 pack with at least one guaranteed 3* cover in it. No no, we want you to jump through hoops to earn that 3* cover! What it DOES guarantee is a higher chance of getting a particular cover! So instead of of chance being 0.8%, it's 5.6%! They are REAL stats pulled right from the game! So if you get a 10 pack, you still have a VERY HIGH CHANCE of getting NO 3* covers! And this game uses them as the highest currency! From the 7 seasons so far, I have had 3 x 10 packs with 0 x 3* covers. This is what we're all aiming for! 3 and 4* covers! You think your hero points cost you a lot? Yes sure, but what are they REALLY worth?!? They can only buy you CHANCES of getting covers! If you already have one colour and you want another, you CAN SPEND 1250 Hero Points per 3* cover.You have two types of game: PvE (Story) and PvP (tournaments). When you start the game, you can go through the prolog (PvE) which is one of the worst stories ever told. You know that episode of the Simpsons where Burns pulls out the piece of paper from the monkeys typewriter and he reads out, ""It was the best of times, it was the BLURST of times?!?"" well, that monkey seems more capable of writing a better story than what is present here. Quite honestly, I've stop reading all the ""story"" in this game months ago as it's merely a flimsy glue that holds this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game together.It's not really pay to win because you can win tournaments (PvP) with a bad roster. The only difference is how active you are in playing. It's a game that masquerades as a casual puzzle game in the vein of bejeweled but make no mistake - they is no puzzle aspect and it's purely a numbers game that forces you to grind and pray that you finish first. All it takes to win is enough time to persist. You can have a strong team and if the computer feels like you're winning too often, it can decide to drop matching gems in favour of the enemy team. I've lost to a team half my level because the tiles dropped in the enemies favour. If you're up against someone who is too hard, you can skip them until you get someone easy. When you lose a round, it really hurts you because you get 5 health packs on a timer - 36 minutes for each health pack. And if you have a limited roster, it shortens the amount of covers you can use in a tournament. Once you've used up all health packs and your covers, you have to wait OR you can buy more health packs. One method of winning is purchasing health packs with real money/hero points and just continue playing until you've earned a score which is hard to beat. Then spend MORE real money/hero points to secure your position with a sheild. You don't really face people in PvP. You face their roster and the computer uses their roster. So how does the computer know which covers to use from other people's roster? Dunno. You would think it would pull their strongest characters but it doesn't always. If you find yourself towards the top of the tournament, you become enemy #1 and your team has a high chance of ending up in other people's list to face. If you don't have a sheild, you can lose points when your team is defeated by others. The only benefit in having the 3 star characters is more people to use in the roster. When your team gets naturally stronger with more 3* characters, you face stronger enemies so your weaker 2* becomes more useless. Also, it is worth noting that some characters are USELESS such as Bagman Spiderman and Bullseye. Bagman Spiderman has 3 useless moves, each more usless than the next and Bullseye is a 2* with 2 moves which means his max level is 78. And while he can lay down defense tiles like crazy, he can't take a hit which makes him pretty useless. All your 1* covers are useless 99% of the time once you develop an even remotely strong team.Why it's not really pay to win as well is because this game has no end to it. The end is you have all the covers. And they continually release new characters so the end to this game is when they shut down the servers or stop releasing new characters. It also feels like they do very little testing with the new characters/covers they release. We see it often when a new character comes out. It's hard to get excited about it when we know the second a bunch of people flock to the new character, it means its overpowered and will be nerfed.Also, saving is a little♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you want to save your progress, it is only possible through Facebook connect on iOS. I didn't see any feature on PC and I don't know what Android saving is like.If you hate your life and after reading what I've had to say still want to go through with your  cult suicide decision to play the game, go join an alliance. They now cost nothing and the benefits are huge. Although you need to accept that your alliance will never be in the top 10 unless you have contacts and join one of the already established X-Men groups who are always in the top 10. Hell, it's hard to even place top 100 alliance without all 20 players being dedicated to winning.In over a year, I've had to step back from the game 3 times because it has made me that angry and upset. I now play on a very casual basis and I can only ever treat it like that otherwise you burn out. I loved Puzzle Quest 1, 2 and to a degree, galactrix. But this is just dead♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Once upon a time, this was a fun game to play.Hell, it's been some time since I've actually devoted this much time on a game.But, now... this 'game' has become - to paraphrase a forum post from developer's website -, a hybrid of a sick joke and a straigh fraud.Before we start, let me introducte two 'resource' types in this game. ISOs and HPs.ISOs are akin to experience points, which you get by playing. Sure, you can buy.  But technically you can just invest time into the game to overcome that.HPs are hard to come by on its own and to get any respectable quantity, you have to buy.Sounds bad, huh? But no, the beauty of this game was that you could potentially outwit opponents with far stronger characters by timely use of boosts and strategic thinking in organising your team.And do you know what the geniuses at d3p came up with for 'improving the game experience'?1) change the currency of key boost in-game from ISO to HP -> thereby turning game into dime-a-dozen pay2win variety.2) increase cost of other boosts by 100%3) introduce a pvp tournament only open to those who can pay with HP... -> again pay2win only4) ...then nerfing the key characters in mid-competition -> just breathetaking stupidity...and the funny thing?(1),(2) & (3) were given no notice of update what-so-ever.So, the end result is a bunch of guys and girls being shafted by what is (at best) a questionable practise from the developers.If anyone really wants to play Marvel related games, do look for something else.Don't waste time like an idiot as I did on this monumental piece of greedy♥♥♥♥♥♥up.

												Bait and switch microtransaction galore... you would expect a match-three game to be casual, but actually if you want to get anywhere in this game you must play at least an hour and a half every eight hours every day, every night - its a grindy borefest. The company doesnt care about playerbase, they just want to squeeze money from people before they eventually realize the game sucks and quit.			"

												This game has the potential to be a great match-3 type game.  I thouroughly enjoyed the original Puzzle Quest game so I thought I'd give this a try.  I was really enjoying it until I realized how much money will need to be dumped into the game to unlock things that are needed.  The microtransactions in this game are ridiculous!  I have no problem throwing a few bucks here and there at a dev that has a quality product, but the costs are so bad that it's not worth my time.  Reduce the cost of the microtransactions and I MIGHT play it again.			"

												""Well-known RPG with ""match 3 gems"" mechanic (Puzzle Quest) meets Marvel universe"". In ever-unfinished (ever-beta) grindy and money-squeezing flashy ""free-to-play"" rip-off.Okay, we have a usual for hundreds (thousands?) casual titles gameplay with ""match 3 gems in a row"". Plus we have Marvel heroes cards, with superpowers working when you'll collect enough gems of appropriate colour.And we (supposedly) have a story about some H.A.M.M.E.R. agency leading by badguy Osborn raging a war against S.H.I.E.L.D. agency and its Avengers. Well, in truth we have only a prologue set of missions where H.A.M.M.E.R. is bending S.H.I.E.L.D. over, against all logical assumptions, and some optional and not really story-related timed side missions. So, you'll not really get anything new or at least worthy-your-time from the lore aspect out of this game. Even if you're a superheroes fan.Marvel Puzzle Quest has a good-enough interface, and plenty of Marvel heroes cards to grind about. Alas, all that grind there is really for nothing, for there is nothing to do. PvP is lame and quite unbalanced, missions set is unacceptably short. Behind the brightly colored facade, there is emptyness. The game is not rewarding for a playtime. And, even with all money developers surely have, it's still crushes every couple of hours.So, I think I'm done with it. Mark 4/10. Original Puzzle Quest might be not an ideal game, but it's aeons ahead. And even in the cadaverous F2P field, there are more fair and challenging games, with more balanced, flexible and diverse mechanics. Like Gems of War, for example.			"

												A beautifully-crafted example of how to ruin a promising game with F2P baggage.[review rewritten to explain more features instead of focusing solely on IAP complaints]Here's the thing: MPQ is one of the (if not THE) best/most interesting match-3 games around. I've been a big fan of Puzzle Quest since the first game. The novelty of taking match-3 and building a battle system around it has never lost its appeal to me. MPQ takes that formula and makes it team-based, adding considerably more depth than the classic 1v1. If you happen to be interested in the Marvel universe, then there's some bonus appeal.Puzzle Quest (and by extension MPQ) is different from the majority of the other match-3 games on the market. In a lot of other games, you're tasked with reaching point quotas or ""painting"" every tile of the board with a match, etc. before you lock the board or run out of pre-budgeted moves or something. In Puzzle Quest, your goal is to deplete your enemies' health points, in classic turn-based RPG fashion.In MPQ, you build up a roster of Marvel heroes (and villains) and pick a team of 3 to take into each battle. This edition has 6 mana colors, and each character has 3 preferred colors and up to 3 special abilities to spend your mana on. There are about a hundred characters available as of this writing, so there are lots of combinations available. In addition to building a team with good color distribution, you must also weigh the characters' max health and what types of powers they have (raw damage, board effects, support abilities).Unfortunately, the microeconomy severely limits your roster. Characters are unlocked via comic book Covers. Receiving your first Cover for a given character will make that character playable (if you have room to keep them), but in an extrememly weak and limited capacity. In order to get the most out of a character, you have to collect at least 13 separate instances of that characer's Covers. The majority of your character Covers are acquired through blind-box pulls. You can also spend rare currency (about $3-4 worth per attempt) for a blind pull from any category that doesn't include any of the weakest characters. Even if you're willing to spend the money, there's absolutely no way to directly buy a character that you want. The best you can do is to buy microcurrency and keep spending it on blind boxes.A character's strength & utility are determined by two factors: experience level & stacks of Covers. Rarer characters have higher starting levels and higher level caps. You can increase a character's level by spending the common currency (ISO crystals). It makes no difference how much you use the character. It's technically possible to completely max out a character without ever using them in a mission.A new character can't level up without acquiring more Covers. Covers are the only way to raise the level cap. Not only that, but you have to find 3 different version of a Cover to get access to all of the character's powers.I'll use classic Storm as an example, because she's useful and popular and she has uncomplicated powers.(When you make a match, every tile you break goes into your mana pool so that you can spend it to cast your powers)Storm's Green power breaks a bunch of random tiles around the board. Each tile deals damage & gives you mana.Her Blue power will stun the target enemy for a set number of turns and also deal damage to the entire enemy team.Her Yellow power doesn't cost anything, but is an automatic counterattack whenever somebody on your team takes a certain amount of damage.Say you just got your first Storm Cover, and it's Green. Now you can add Storm to your team, but you can ONLY use her Green power. You won't be able to use her Blue or Yellow powers until you happen to receive those Covers. If you get ANOTHER Green Cover, you can stack it. This increases the effectiveness of the power (in this case, she breaks even more random tiles when you cast it, resulting in higher damage and more mana gained) and also increases that character's level cap. Each color can be stacked to a total of five, and you have to have 13 total applied to bring a character to maximum level.Because of how Covers & levels are so closely intertwined, you reach a point where newly-acquired characters are straight-up useless. If a lot of your roster is around, say, level 100, and you get a new ""Rare"" character who begins at level 40, you'll need to accumulate at least 5 or 6 extra covers (and spend currency to level up) before that character is strong enough (both in base stats and effectiveness of powers) to contribute to the fight. This is a real shame, because it takes away the possibility of experimenting with combinations and turns it into a meta-game of trying to decide who to pour your resources into until they're viable.The game's difficulty scales up based on the highest-level characters in your roster, so if you luck out and win somebody much stronger than your existing team, you will be punished for it with a difficulty increase even though that high-level character you just won is basically useless (due to not having any useable powers). You may end up having to sell the powerful new character just to make the game playable again.You begin the game with enough space to keep 4 characters. You'll need to spend rare currency to unlock additional slots, and the price goes up with every new slot. The price eventually caps out at roughly $10 per slot. It is possible to get rare currency without spending money. Unlike previous Puzzle Quest games, your team isn't healed after a battle. Damage heals over time, or it can be healed instantly using consumable Health Pack items. Health Packs can be bought (1 for 50 cents worth, or 5 for $2). They can also be handed out as mission rewards. In the original release, several characters were able to partially heal the entire team. These abilities were reworked so that this health  would wear off after the battle and you would still have to either wait or pay to heal back up. Characters like Wolverine who have self-only healing abilities get to keep their health after a fight. The ""Versus"" mode is not live head-to-head PVP. Instead, the game copies a ghost of your team and you battle AI-controlled versions of other players' ghost-teams. You gain points every time you defeat an enemy team, but you lose some points every time your own ghost team is defeated. This is a pretty reasonable premise, except that point losses don't just affect your leaderboard standing, but also your ability to earn milestone rewards. It's incredibly frustrating to be one battle away from earning some rare currency or a weighted recruitment token, only to find out after winning that you've been attacked by twelve other people during your battle and you've lost ten times the points that you just earned. The rub here is that you can spend rare currency (starting at 75 cents) to buy temporary immunity to point loss. If this game wasn't built around a pay-for-a-chance-to-win microeconomy, I would recommend it. Because so many decisions revolve around the microeconomy, the game suffers and the players suffer. It's very easy to complain about the pay models in F2P games, but the exchange rates are particularly disgusting here. It's easy to say ""well, if you normally pay $20-30 for a decent game, then just buy $20-30 worth of currency and call it fair"" except that much currency won't go very far.I love the Puzzle Quest series, and I wish that I could play this game without constantly feeling somebody's hand grasping for my wallet. If there was a version of this game that wasn't built around IAP & only required a one-time purchase, I would absolutely buy it. For now, they'll have to be content with not getting my money, and I hope they don't get yours either.			"

I strongly suggest not to join around this time, and in the future, do your research first. There are great forums here: http://www.d3pforums.com/viewforum.php?f=3.And by no means pay for this nonsense before you made absolutely sure it provides you more fun than pain.			"

												This used to be a fun game and it still could be.  Unfortunately, the unmitigated greed on the part of the publishers has surfaced fully and without reservation in a recent patch where team healing was nerfed.Healing used to be possible outside of PvE or PvP combat by going to the prologue and fighting a few battles with a healer and the damaged roster members.  Biff bam boom!  You're back to playing.  Now that healing is only temporary during that battle.  So, it's either wait 3+ hours for your team members to heal or pay for health packs.The AI also cheats heavily, but I consider that more of a challenge to overcome than a reason to stop playing.I already spent $40 (US) getting my roster space up to speed.  I refuse to spend more money on a game that is no longer fun for me.  This latest healing patch moved the game into the ""not fun"" category.If the patch notes and forum indicate the game has been fixed, I would be willing to pick the game back up.  Until then, I am done.			"

												I cannot in good concise reccomend this one, I played it quite a bit on mobile, over 20+ hours in fact, and while the interface and art has survived to the desktop, it is stretched and not as crisp on my big screen. Other than that it is a well crafted match three with a unique enough mechanic to stand on its own as a really good game. But it has been hampered with the atrocious freemium model, where you pay for time or give them hundreds of dollars for an experience that is not worh more than 39.99 outright. It is a shame and I avoid the model like the plague, remove this caveat and let the game stand on its own and as it is it would be one of this gerations shining match three examples. As is I say avoid unless you like paying WAY more for games than they will ever be worth and unless you are fond of letting Publishing companies tell you how valuable your personal time is.			"

												I enjoy the gameplay.  It could be a really awesome game......  I said COULD be.  But the DLC and the mecanics of the game that make it nearly a must buy totally ruin it.  I was in the top 50 in the opening competition and I have the Black Widow character to prove it.  I have not spent any money in DLC yet but I see the mechanics of the game that make it nearly impossible to play long term without doing so.  This is coming from someone who has spent a good deal of time playing this game.  I've also played previous games in the series like original Puzzle Quest and Puzzle Quest: Galactrix.In order to increase your roster size you have to pay coins, which are nearly impossible to get without paying real money.  If you don't add a character to your roster within 7 days the character goes bye bye.  That means you have to either delete a character that you've probably built up or spend real money.If you want to continue to play you have to keep your characters healed.  However, there's no way to get healing other than wait forever, which stops you from playing, or buy them, which requires real money again.  If you want to build your characters up any faster than a snails pace you have to spend real money again.  Around every corner of this game is a need to spend real money.Folks, there is a good way to do DLC and there is a bad way to do DLC.  This game is a shining example of the bad way to do DLC.  I would have much rather paid $20.00 for a great game then had options to buy non-gameplay breaking DLC such as special skins for the hero's, backgrounds, or gem skins.  As the game stands it deserves every single comment it receives about greedy developers.			"

												This is a stupid game.  The game itself is fine but the programming has destroyed it.  The adjustments have been so obviously tilted to make you spend more money, no one in their right mind will play this.  I love the game play but it has gotten so obvious that they are programming to help you if you spend a lot of money and not if you play the game.  You should just give them your credit card and let them suck all your cash out of your pocket while you sit with your thumb in your mouth.   The only thing these guys are doing is inspiring hate hate hate.  What are they thinking?  Listen, unless you spend a lot of money, the programming is designed to destroy your abilit to win.  The rewards for winning are just stupid.  Even with a decent set of characters, you absolutely should not lose challenges 9 times out of 10.  The only way this happens is if they assure that you will lose to inferior character sets according to how much money you have spent.  The rewards are irrational.  This is a joke.  You are a fool if you get started on this.  It is a collection game but the best way to collect anything is to buy it, not bother to play.  If you like paying $50 for a chance to get a virtual card, have a great time but this takes a good concept and destroys it.  Play the game.  You will love it.  Then you will hate those who are controlling the economic model.  If you start this game, you are throwing away your money.  Better to poke yourself in the eye with a pencil.   So, no, I don't recommend it at all.			"

												Honestly, after moving to my iPad and playing for over 8 months, I can tell you how good this game was and how bad this game is right now.To start with, the old Matchmaking system is fairly easy to adapt to. You get to see opponents based on the points you have earned. The old system is really harsh for new players to handle at first but you will be able to handle it without no trouble later. Before the recent health changes and the nerf to mulitple heroes, most of the new released heroes (Starting from Iron Fist onwards) are completely broken to the point that destroys the fun out of the entire game.After the Matchmaking changes, only new players can find easy and fair fights while transitioners and most of the players without full level roster could no longer climb up the rank. Some heroes were nerfed to a point which are uplayable. The developer promised a buff for Inivisible Woman a year ago and ended up nerfing her even harder.With all the recent disappointment, many veteran players are leaving MPQ. So if you are a new player and finding this game extremely easy, good luck, because you will find the game so hard to play with once you decide to level up your heroes. So, make sure when you play as a new player, keep all your hero unlevel for the rest of your life. I promise you, it will make your game, very enjoyable indeed. This review shall be my parting gift to the developer and ♥♥♥♥ YOU VERY MUCH!(never in my life have I written a game review with a foul word, this time, I use it glady in your face)			"

												I have played this game over 350 hours, and I have only put $1 into this game, which was when I first started playing. Personaly, I do not recommend that anyone put money into this game because a lot of people have already done that, so the outcome would be rather disapointing, but that is left to your discretion. This game has very interesting machanics for a puzzle game and the fact that it is Marvel is very cool. I also enjoy the animations for the character abilities. Additionally, the story content is usually humorous and fun to follow. The game has changed in a few ways over the last year. First, when I started playing this game it was almost imposible to win in PvP or random events because people that put lots of money into the game had better characters at much higher levels. However, I continued to play and found ways to deal with it. But there is better news for new players. The game has been switched so that players are paired with other players around thier average level. So basically add all your character levels and divide by the number of characters. This machanic also tries to push people away from the idea of getting one high level character because it would offset your team average and put you at a disadvantage in a higher tier. Originally, there were certain lower level characters with overpowered abilities, which have since been nerfed or changed to even out lower tiers because earning certain characters is a chance of luck and not everyone is lucky enough to get those characters early on.I think the game has overall changed for the better, eventhough there were a few changes I didn't like. As a new player it would be much advised to play through most of the STORY content in order to build a decent team and obtain COIN to purchase more character slots (I would advise that you use COIN ONLY to purchase character slots because you dont get a lot and it costs more and more for ever 3rd or 4th slot obtained).I hope this was insightful. If so please rate it as helpful. Thanks and enjoy!			"

												I'm mainly basing this on the iOS version, but I downloaded and launched this game just to write this. I'd love to tell you how the PC version is different, but it keeps crashing every time I try and launch it! I understand the pictures are bigger. Game is the same, thoughLet's start with the problems:- Characters are deliberately unbalanced with a star system where more *** means more powerful.- Higher-star characters are very difficult to unlock without spending money. Leveling them requires you to obtain them several times, so even if you get a rare character, good luck leveling it.- Even if you spend money, you don't get a choice of your characters. They're randomized packs. However, spending money gives you a shot at more powerful characters.- Even within a given star-rating balance is godawful. For example, Hawkeye and Black Widow are both 1-star characters. Hawkeye can do added damage, while Black Widow can stun an opposing character for 5 turns. I'll let you guess which regularly shows up on teams.- Leveling up a character's powers fully requires you to basically unlock that character 11 to 16 times. This is in addition to grinding to level. You don't even get the choice of what powers you're leveling. It's random. If you get a power you've already maxed out, ha ha, ♥♥♥♥ you, so it can take a lot more than 11-16 unlocks.- The single player campaign features huge jumps so that you have to grind in multiplayer to level up enough to progress, or... spend money. The grinding is not fun.- Regularly the game has ""tournaments"". Your competency in these tournaments will be determined by: character level, character star rating, luck, then skill, in about that order. You can earn characters ahead of other people if you're willing to be an obsessive grinding machine; only about the top 10 players actually get the new characters out of, well, thousands.- ""Multiplayer"" is basically just facing other people's characters controlled by the AI. There's no actual multiplayer. You can't pick which of your characters other folks face, either.- The AI is absymal and frequently makes terrible decisions for you to exploit (or for people to exploit against you). It can't even parse making certain advantageous matches (like on the corner of a column / row match).- Your characters heal on a cooldown. You can spend money to overcome this. You can get powerups that give you an advantage in matches, some of which are given free, but you can always spend money for power. You only have so many slots for characters, which you can unlock... slower than you earn characters... or spend money to gain them.- The graphics are sharp but the animations are terrible and barely worth noting. For example, Iron Man has three attacks and two animations.- The ""writing"" is done by noted comics hack Frank Tieri, and it's abysmal. Shut up about your stolen cars, Tony. It wasn't funny the first time. After the sixth time I believe a black hole of humor has been achieved. I liked the Dark Reign event, but this isn't quite that, and has characters nattering on about the terrible ""isotope"" concept used in the FTP Marvel games.On the upside!- Some of the match-3 superpowers are rather clever and thoughtful (if not at all balanced).- You can unlock Spider-Man with a bag on his head.In general: go up, scroll through the sample pics until you get to the secondmost pic from the right, the one that displays a roster. You will never see a screen like that. That screen represents perhaps over $120,000 dollars of investment in the game. That's the level of thought that went into this: showing a sample screenshot that no player will be insane enough to achieve.Unless of course, you have a hacked copy of the game. Did I mention people have already hacked it to have unlimited goodies and cheat their way to victory?Oh, and it doesn't say in the store, but it's a beta / development version of the game!♥♥♥♥in' avoid.

												Solid gameplay and theme, but utimately it is a cash grab designed around forcing the user to pay money to avoid grinding some missions for rare curriencies and items.You will be expected to play or grind for:- The ability to recruit new heros to play with. You'll start with 3 (Iron Man, Storm and Black Widow) and you'll have one empty slot for a hero. After that you'll need to scronge up their pay currency to add an empty space to recruit any heros (including ones you earn that will expire and disappear if you don't get an empty space! Not to mention you'll earn recruit tokens which allow you to get characters for free, but not the empty space for free. If you don't have an empty space, they are WORTHLESS.- Abilities and level ups. Character abilties are unlocked and leveled up after randomly earning comic book covers after missions. If you don't get the cover you need from a mission, you'll have to replay the SAME CONTENT to hope you earn it next time. And if you get 2 Hawkeye comics, but one is Classic Hawkeye and the other is Dark Avenger Hawkeye, those are two different characters and don't level up aside each other (not to mention they'll take up two character slots, which remember you're paying for!).From what I saw, you'll grind up the pay currency by playing the semi-PVP battles. Much like the Marvel Facebook game, you'll fight AI-controlled player teams to place on a leaderboard for the shot at rewards. This isn't as much PVP as it is PVE where someone in the world happened to choose that team. Since this game allows people to gain a lot of power by paying money, the top spaces in the leaderboards (read: where you need to be for prizes) will be filled with 'wallet warriors': people who have amazing teams simply because they paid money. If you want to play this game and fork out minimal to zero cash, expect frustration. There ARE prizes for simply playing the ""PVP"", but you will need to devote a LOT of time to get the good items. For example, winning a PVP match earns about 20-30 'Shield Points'. To get the pay currency for free, to unlock all the good stuff in the game without paying real money, you'll need to rack up ~1000 Shield Points. Enjoy the grind!All in all, the Puzzle Quest mechanics are still solid and the Marvel theme never disappoints, but it is a pay-to-win cashgrab unless you are a superfan of Puzzle Quest and don't mind the grind. In tempting players to fork out cash at every turn, Marvel Puzzle Quest undermines the fantasy of having a league of powerful superheros, which is really the core of the game. I don't recommend this game, but play the game for yourself if you are still curious after my review. It is free-to-play, afterall.			"

												P2W game with one if not the worse cash shop I have ever seen, dropped 20 bucks in the store and pretty much got told I had good cards but there useless in pvp unless I get 3 more copy of them! so it wants me to pay hundreds to even have viable cards! also the community in this game is horrible, vrty unhelpful players that will class you a noob unless you have stupid amounts of money worth of cards and openly insult you. Steer clear of this game like it was the plauge.			"

												The puzzle quest formula is ruined with the removal of gold and exp tiles, along with the addition of timed enemy attacks that can be removed simply by removing the tile within the amount of turns given. Pretty shameful downgrade from the past 3 puzzle quest games...			"

												One of the worst pay to win games there is in steam. Do not spend money to this game.PQ mechanics are nice, but if you dont dish tons of money to this, you cannot even complete the single player part of it.If you want to have fun couple of hours with it, only spend coins on roster slots. Dont buy cards (or covers as they are called in game) with coins.Fun game, typical mobile game p2w scam business model.			"

												This game is like Candy Crush, in that you _can_ get through everything for free if you wait long enough, but unlike Candy Crush, where you could keep playing if you passed a stage, Marvel Puzzle Quest forces you to wait, no matter how good you are. Your heroes have HP which persist over stages, and it takes time for the heroes to recover HP. There are some stages where you can possibly go through without losing any health, but you'll get to stages where you just can't prevent damage, so if you want to continue, you'd need to wait for HP to regenerate, and then move on. Paying money is just for 'cheats'; extra EXP, other heroes, instant heals, etc. This game is pretty much unplayable if you're playing it for free.			"

												this game is a free to play game based on marvel characters... well... no , this game is really pay to play! you can have new heroes grinding the pve events or the pvp events (in both cases you play against the AI) ,the problem is that you can have all the heroes like a free to play player, but... you can't use them because you have limited roster space! so you often have some good heroes but you have to sell them for very few resources because after 14 days the hero vanish... to buy a new roster space you need hero points, but after the first 25 spaces, the game became really greedy and you need 200,225,250,275,300 ,400,,500,700,1000 points to have only 1 more slot! you can get points grinding the events but you get only 100 points if you reach the first 10 position in an instance with 1000 players... or 50 if you reach the first 50 ,at day, plus 50 if you live in front of the monitor grinding like there is no tomorrow an 50 if you reach the first 50 position at the end of the event. Another big problem is the broken level of difficulty, this is based on your roster...so if you are really lucky and you get a level 250 hero, you have to sell it or you will face enemies that will kill your heroes with only one hit! when one of your heroes is defeated, you need to wait until he is healed, more high is the level, more time is needed,sometimes you have to wait 1 or 2 hours! in conclusion... avoid this game if you don't want to spent a lot of money !

												So, Puzzle Quest + Marvel sounds like a good idea on paper, doesn't it? Well it is, but not with this kind of execution. The short ammount of time I put into the game feels wasted, and here is why:The game tries to leech you out of your money where ever it can. You had a fight and your characters are injured? Too bad, that you have to wait until they are regenerated. Don't wanna wait? Better waste your money on some health packs so you can keep playing without downtime.This is the worst kind of F2P game you can get your hands on, because it actually punishes the player for attempting to play it. Don't waste your time with the download. Play Puzzle Quest and be happy, it's a much better game with less hassle for a small entrance fee.			"

												Freemium hell. The most frustrating match-3 game and the most egregious pay-to-win game I've ever played. 1. You get cards for new heroes faster than you get slots for them, so you're constantly throwing away heroes you don't have because there's no room. This seems really bad for a collectible game. 2. The designers seem to be adding more and more mechanics to boost the AI and make the game more laborious and frustrating to play. 2a. Healing goes away after each round, so it basically just helps the AI. 2b. Powers which hurt the enemy team and also your own team: These are poison for the player, but the AI can play them all day long 2c. The new specials seem to be free for the AI. Even easy matches can hurt your guys badly, which can't be healed away any more. 3. It seems like the developers are constantly nerfing useful powers, and not giving anything in return. 4. Quality of life issues never, ever get fixed4a. Replaying rounds gives out booby prizes before you've collected all the rewards4b. Can't see which enemy triggered a power4c. Friending is done through Facebook onlyThe game seems to get more and more tedious and grindy after each patch. This is a really, thoroughly terrible game at this point, and for some reason it's only getting worse. Not recommended. Very much don't recommend giving it any money.			"

												Game is decent at best. The advantages the computer has is ridiculous. Constantly color starving you, massive cascades, and extra turns. It happens very often, one turn and the match is over for you. You can do this as well, but no where near the extent it happens for the computer. If you haven't invested much into the game, it is not worth it. It is a free game heavily designed as pay to win. The game is tailored to have you spend money. Of course this is the main purpose of the game. Be it you spend money to try to get characters, to buy slots, to advance your characters to a point that you can compete, or just to heal so you can participate in events. The game is just not very fun, it is tedious and repetitive. If you are not a Marvel fan, it is probably best to avoid this game.			"

												It's an expensive and oridinary free-game of its genre. It has got most things you can expect, but not much of surprises.The theme of MARVEL heroes is presented through simple CGs and empty dialogues, which are so repeatitive that you eventually just skip them. As the last update arrives, the game gets even more expensive. The prices rise faster than oil. You can have fun without paying anything, but that only means the very essential part of the game, like demo. For the rest, the rivals are adjusted to a diffculty that you can almost only play with powered-up hero to win, which means more cash needed.			"

												If you are here because you saw Puzzle Quest, and don't have a burning interest in playing the next Marvel game, I suggest you turn back and play Puzzle Quest 1 or 2. If you are here for the Marvel Universe, and have no idea what puzzle quest is, then you COULD like it. This game is a match-3 type game, much in the same vein as Candy Crush, Bejewled, and like it's namesake, Puzzle Quest.It says it's a work in progress, so I'll give the dev's the benefit of the doubt, that they'll fix the game's problems. I have played Puzzle Quest 1, own it on 360, steam, ds, and the iOS. I own Puzzle Quest 2, and Galactrix for the DS. And now I have played this game, on steam. So I know what the games are like, and what they have done. I have also played Geomancer, the match-3 game from Square-Enix, but I have not touched Candy crush, because that game has no depth beyond ""HEY LOOK AT ME I GOT THIS SCORE AND MY E-PEEN IS HUGE"", much like bejeweled. I like my RPG's, thanks. I don't mind the direction they took this game in, where they add in an active attack each match. Previously, you would only attack the enemy when you would match attack gems. Otherwise, the other gems were resources to power your abilites. But where this gets confusing is when they do not make clear various aspects of the game, such as when the opponent goes. If you're attacking all the time, will your opponent just not get an attack, and just fill up their resource gems like in Geomancer? And what about attacking the enemy who has the strongest weapon? Will his ability get taken out, so that they can't use it? These are gameplay issues that should be addressed. When your user is CONFUSED on different aspects of your CORE gameplay in the beginning of the game, that doesn't bode well for them continuing to play it and 'experiment' to find out all the rules to the game.Micro-transactions are an okay model. I mean, after all, this IS a free game. I have not tested the viability of different heroes, nor the abilities that come with them, so I can't comment on how balanced it is. But based on what I have read in the other reviews, it seems that it's not looking too good. I would recommend doing research on it yourself. All in all, I expected the game to be way better, but it's medocore at best. A new direction for Puzzle Quest, not necessarily good, but not really bad either. This game didn't catch my interest beyond the novel idea that Marvel and PQ came together, so I got bored of it quickly, once that novelty wore off. In terms of Quality, I would rate the games like so:1) Puzzle Quest.2) Puzzle Quest 2.3) Geomancer / this game.4) Galactrix.			"

												This should have been good.Puzzle Quest is a solid concept, Marvel has a huge stable of interesting characters spanning decades of comics.But... this fails on both sides.Marvel sideThe game is divided into chapters, each of them involves chasing after a new random villain. There is an overarching story about the Green Goblin being the leader of a new organization that replaces Shield which COULD have been interesting... but several chapters in that still hasn't gone anywhere and is more a convenient framing device to wheel various heroes and villains on and off stage.In levels you're either picking your set of 3 heroes from your own stable or get backup from the fitting hero (e.g. Spiderman coming to your aid against Venom), but the selection of available heroes is limited in two ways.Firstly, you can have a total of FOUR heroes to start out and the only way to increase this limit is to spend premium premium hero tokens which are hard to acquire without paying money. It's reasonable that within a chapter or two you're up to six hero slots, maybe eight if you only buy the slots. This means you have a very limited roster of heroes at the ready to develop and to be called into action if you need to change up your tactics.The other problem is that the character roster seems very limited. You get the obvious main characters from recent Marvel films , the big-name mutants, the fantastic four and some random villains from what seems to be mostly the Dark Avengers. Ooh, Squirrel Girl too, which gives it some bonus points. However, there are plenty of characters that did not make the cut. I haven't seen Rogue or Phoenix yet, for example. Did we really need five different Storm, Black Widow, Iron Man and Thor variants instead of a more diverse roster? Don't get me wrong, I LIKE that I can pick which Storm I like best (both her look and skillset, though it would have been even better to pick these separately...), I'd just wished that there had been a few more lesser known characters.Combined with the absolutely secondary and forgettable story it's just a total waste of the Marvel license.Puzzle Quest sideAt least this side should be easy to get right, right? Puzzle Quest 'inspired' games are plentiful and it's clear by now what works in free to play titles and what doesn't... turns out it apparently wasn't that easy.The very core of the Puzzle Quest gameplay is still there. You take turns manipulating a match-3 square board in an attempt to gather resources and defeat the enemy. Puzzle Quest was strictly a one versus one system, but in this game each side can consist of up to 3 characters.Each character has up to three skills, each tied to a colour on the board, and an attack value for each colour that determines the damage it does to the targeted enemy when making a match with it. Fortunately there is no need to switch an 'active character' or anything to maximize your damage. So if you brought Lady Thor and Gamora and match yellow tiles then the game just looks up which character would deal the most damage (in this case Thor) and have that character attack. Which character attacks based on the various colours is also indicated on the stones in case this is relevant for any of the active skills in the battle (which rarely happens).This bit is solid. It suffers from some of the same randomness that plagues this type of game in almost every iteration, where the enemy just happens to luck into a huge combo that drops into place from the top of the screen as tiles get destroyed, but it's hard to fault this particular game for that.What it DOES do wrong is that there are way too many different colours on the board. There are SIX different colours of mana to gather and use for skills and a seventh block type with the team up tokens (that allow for one-shot special attacks that aren't as impressive as they sound). The original puzzle quest had 4 mana colours, damage tiles, experience tiles and coin tiles for a total of seven as well, so you'd think that'd be okay but it tends to fall flat. Going back to the Thor example (she was the rarest character I managed to get and is awesome), she has a cool skill that deals damage to the entire enemy team but it needs 12 yellow mana (or AP as the game calls it). The problem is that there are so many different colours that it's hard to specifically try to gather a single colour (or even two colours to focus on...). It seems more about just making matches than gathering specific mana types.The above would be an okay if imperfect implementation of the puzzle quest side of things... but of course we have to remember that this is a free to play game, so there have to be things in place to limit what you can do so that you either grind for it cough up some money.Prospective players will be happy to hear that there is no energy mechanic in this game... then immediately disappointed again when I explain that damage the heroes receive in a game is persistent and then needs time to heal (my Thor needed several hours after being knocked out). You can start games with injured heroes, but it obviously sets you at a disadvantage. Medkits can be used to instantly heal a hero (outside of battle), but they are in short supply. Beyond the 10 you start the game with I've found ONE from a one-time mission reward. Of course a solution is to just switch to other heroes until your preferred ones are healed, but as I mentioned above, you have very limited roster space available so the game really wants you to focus on single heroes.Which brings me to the next big point, which is hero progression. Remember how in Puzzle Quest you got experience points from fights like in an RPG? Well, this isn't like that at all. Winning a game gets your heroes nothing, but you as the player receive some ISO-8, a mutation drug that might have a justification for being there in the later part of the plot, it's just sort of explained and then dropped entirely at the start. The idea is that you spend this ISO-8 to power up your heroes, and it's easy to see this as a communal experience point pool... except that it doesn't get filled very often.Every mission you play gives you a few hundred ISO-8 for the first time you complete it and might also have another batch in its drop table of random one-time rewards, which means that the total amount of ISO-8 is LIMITED. Sure, you can buy more with real money or by selling off some of your spare heroes, but that kind of goes against the point.Using ISO-8 to level up your hero increases its life and the damage dealt by matching specific tiles, but only up to the hero's current level cap. This limit can be extended 12 times by sacrificing a duplicate card, or almost duplicate anyway. You see, each of the heroes you receive or buy will only have one of its three skills randomly assigned to it. So Thor can either hit the enemy with his hammer, gather a storm cloud (spawning a bunch of yellow tiles on the field) or call the lightning down (using up that yellow AP the previous skill got you), but only ONE of those things until you find another copy of that hero.And before you get your hopes up, there are no places to farm this stuff. You'll be stuck spending ISO-8 or hero tokens (you know, those hard-limited currencies I was complaining about earlier?) to get a random hero. A duplicate hero that has a skill you already have unlocked can be used to develop that skill, making it more effective and sometimes making it do slightly more things (e.g. more tiles when gathering storm clouds). Upgrading skills can also be done directly with hero tokens, getting new skills can not. To have a 'perfect' character you'll need 3 cards with 3 different skill slots and a ton of money OR 13 cards, divided in groups of 3-5 over the 3 skills.Which means that even if you pay, you'll need a ton of luck to get what you want which is just frustrating.Bad mechanics, poor story. Don't play			"

												I have to give this game a down thumb, even though I actually like the match-3 game they've built, because their business model is so bad that it is flat out costing them money by driving away players on the fence, including mine.Here's the money hook with this game: you build up your roster of Marvel characters by winning things called covers. Each new character cover requires a character slot. These slots cost Hero Points, this game's premium pay currency. Those points trickle out, if you don't pay, at a ridiculously insulting rate. I'm still at an early stage of the game where slots cost about 200 hero points (they rise as you go). Last night I put in over three hours of play and get handed 10 hero points as a ""reward"" for my time commitment. Do a little points vs. time math there and you can see we have a problem. It's genuinely insulting, and I cannot recommend carrying on with a game that so blatantly wants to force you into paying to play.It's a shame really. The match-3 game is fine, like a lot of them easy to get into, a little addictive. The Marvel branding is an easy hook, there's a great variety of powers and characters. I actually enjoy the game, and would like to keep playing. But the pay structure is just too punishing to be worthwhile and I refuse to support a developer blinded by greed to the point my wallet is the only legitimate method of advancing the game once a month or so, for eternity. There are basically two successful free to play models. The Dangling Carrot, where just enough reward to keep casuals interested is given, generating revenue. Or The Punishing Stick, where players are starved of neccessary rewards, generating revenue. This game is about 98% Punishing Stick, it has cost them my business, and I very much doubt I am alone. There are numerous ways this game could be somewhat more generous towards early game players trying it out, that might actually generate more long-term revenue by hooking more players. I genuinely think they are hurting their business by being cheap. Keep in mind, if you check my account, I have a shameful 970 hours in Star Trek Online. I have been to the free to play jungle. I have seen some things. I am not opposed to a free to play model, if it is laid out in a reasonable way. This game's model is not reasonable. More power to those of you willing to dump as much money into this as is needed, but it's a bridge too far for me.			"

YouTube™ Video: Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign - Gameplay/Review/First Impressions 

			Views: 6,736		

			Brbteabreak gives a First Look/Impression on Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign, a new game for PC, Android and IOS. Gameplay/Impressions are of time of recording and as this game is a work in progress...		

Microtransactions have been a thing of late when it comes to Mobile gaming and more recently Console gaming. PC gaming, while having microtransactions, has never really been a thing of concern, with a large amount of game options, many costing as much as some microtransactions, PC users have just been able to ignore them. Games which do promote microtransactions on PC have been either hit or miss, this does not exist on the Mobile Market.In the mobile market it's more likely to find a game with microtransactions over non-microtransactions and this is mainly because of the target audience. People on mobile devices usually come from a lower common denominator, and as such their standards are as low my pants while sitting on the toilet. They're casual gamers who don't want to spend the time to play the games they play, and rather skip through them to get ""the full experience"". This allows for ludicrous microtransactions.Over here at the PC Master Race, we don't accept content that was designed to be played while you're trying to get clingers to fall into your toilet. The PC market has matured enough to know when we see exploitation, especially in the F2P space, and as such the flaws in this game become instantly realised as soon as the tutorial begins.If for some reason you have a craving for some Marvel, I would actually still look elsewhere. The story is mediocre at best, lacks voice acting and there is no mention or Dormammu from what I can see.Fun Fact – The word “microtransaction” was used 7 times in this mini review.			"

												Supposedly this was a good game when launched. Since I've been playing, they have done nothing but made it worse. Characters that were depended on to heal (and therefor increase your playtime) had that ability taken away. Other characters were weakened as well - beware if you depend on anyone to long, that person will be nerfed without warning! Additions such as ""team ups"" were added with obviously no testing put into them - everyone I read online and in my alliance pointed out horrible problems with them day one. This was yet another addition that removes health from your characters, in a blatent attempt to extort more money out of their userbase.DO NOT think this is a ""free to play"" game. It is not a ""pay to win"" game, it is a ""pay to play"" game. The developers have ignored user feedback and implemented changes that constantly make it more difficult to play any session longer than half an hour. God help you if you are in Europe (with horrible ending times) or here on Steam (where you can't play when the developers want you to). To keep their older userbase they add the rarer characters every other week, but this means for the new user you'll have to pay cash up front for roster spots to have any chance to collect these. These rares are hard to find: it also means you'll have a year of playtime before you can compete with those who had their characters built up early on from a smaller character pool.			"

												Do not fall for it! Let me be clear: This game has great potential! It takes the formula of Puzzle Quest and improves on the combat and adds a lot of personality through the Marvel liscense! That being said, what it comes down to ultimately, is a very cynical cash-grab.The moneytization is tailor made to abuse the player in every way. Let me explain:There are two kinds of currency: Violet Iso (regular) Gold (premium) Both can be bought with real cash. Now, both drop after successful missions. But only once! Every reward is locked after one drow. Afterwards, doing missions (which can take up to half an hour) only reward 20 Iso (to give a comparison: a booster pack costs 500 Iso). So, you have to do a mission 25 times to get enough Iso to buy a booster.Now, why not stick with the heroes you get and level them up?Because the only way to level up heroes is by either spending premium currency directly OR getting more copies of the comics, the heroes originate from. And the latter can only be achieved by buying booster packs. Which only give a chance to obtain the right comic. Furthermore, there is only one rarity category that can be bought with Iso-currency. The lowest, of course. And while you do have a chance to get a rare card from this category, the game is very honest about the fact that your chance is slim.And don't forget that you need several copies of one comic to level your hero up.This is a very blatant cash grab, made worse by the artwork. Yes, sadly, the artwork is very lackluster. The artist went for a semi-realistic style with dynamic posing. Sadly, the borders of different colours are very visible, which makes characters look unclean and bloaty and he had issues with contrasts and forshortening, making people look very strange and their clothes feel dodgy. (Take a look at Black Widow or Thor and you should see what I mean)I repeat: Do not spend money on this game! It does not warrant it at all!			"

												I've been playing this game a lot. I have almost 4000 hours on record. Today I tried to play and found out it launched me into a game as if I were brand new. None of my roster shows up. This bug is the kind of thing that is a show-stopper for a game like this.			"

												A Match-Three game in the genre of Candy Crush or Bejeweled, only with Marvel characters and micro transactions. There's a small storyline in there, but nothing exciting.Once the novelty wore off, I uninstalled.If you like Match-Three and you like Marvel, this may be right up your alley. For anyone else, it's a temporary distraction that you'll soon forget about.6/10			"

												Very simplistic game that doesn't even remotely feature the number of many elements that could be found in the original Puzzle Quest. Easily-accessible PvP and tournaments seemed like a nice idea, but you are expected to grind a lot of levels for your super heroes team before you can be competitive, instead of just trying and enjoying it.Almost every additional feature requires you to pay money. Need more slots for heroes? Buy them. Need healing items? Better spend some money. Need to level up and get new skills? The fees are due! All of this can be paid with gold, which is the in-game currency, but you're gonna need a lot of it.Currently the game is a glorified shadow of Puzzle Quest with some Marvel heroes and a rather silly plot.

												The game was initially a lot of fun, especially for a free game on Steam.  But the game is constantly changing, and not for the better.  What was once a fun game has become a chore to play, mostly due to poor game design and decisions by the developers.			"

												First night, I was able to play 6 hours of the tutorial.Second night, my characters were injured after the first fight, and I had to wait 15 minutes. So I played BATMAN instead. (Opposing Franchise!)Third night, I bought a RANDOM character, and it was a RARE Psyloches. BUT I couldn't use it, cause the 25 coins needed for an additional slot were gone, having been spent on buying the random character. This character is going to be deleted in 13 days, if I don't spend $2 on this game!Fourth night, I could not earn 25 coins for the life of me!Fifth night, I sold my Hawkeye for unspent experience points since I could not EARN coins for whatever reason. I then put Psyloche in his place. She was level 40 and rank 3 star. She did a lot of damage, but was way less powerful than Iron Man, a rank one star.Sixth night, entire team died after second fight. I can't play again till they rest their wounds. All of the Hero Recruitment tokens are hidden. I can't use a hero recruitment token anyway, cause I have no coins.If you like seeing familiar faces flashed in front of you and beaten up for real cash, play this ♥♥♥♥♥ of a game!I loved puzzle quest!I love marvel!I HATED this game!!!Cons!1.My ENTIRE team was killed each round on night 5.2.It costs REAL money to revive EACH team member, unless you wait for 45 minutes. Lets be real, you are gonna play a different game instead of come back in 45 minutes.3.You are TOLD to spend heal tokens on your team EVERY ROUND!!! No matter if its 10 hp lost or 1000hp!4.In order to play the DAILY mission, you MUST have FULLY LEVELED CHARACTERS! You WILL be fighting level 70 characters with your level 1 rank 1 characters.5.AI is uncanny smart! They won't leave you room to breath!6.AI is rooting against you! If you have a random power, be sure to expect that you WILL get the WORST of your random power EVERY time you use it!7.AI actually selects where it's random powers are placed!8.Your Hero's hit points ARE PERSISTANT! YOU MUST HEAL ""EVERY CHARACTER'S HEALTH"" AFTER EVERY BATTLE! Thats spending money 3x each battle!9.You have to WAIT for your team to revive AND THEN heal!10. Makes you feel like your favorite team of XMEN are SORRY SONS OF ♥♥♥♥♥ES!Pros:NONE!!!I enjoyed the tutorial. But actual game play is ranked against you every grain of the way!

			Your character's health is persistent through fights. Your party will die unless you spend money. Here, I got to play 3 games before all my heroes were dead.		

Sure, I could have played better, but then I would have died in my fourth game. The first game/round I didn't record, cause it was just so basic.			"

												The writing for this game is just so bad. I mean, the game is subtitled Dark Reign, so one would think it would follow the story of the Dark Reign story ark, but the story is so distorted that it barely has anything to do with the Dark Reign. And there is no new content at all, events just repeat in a circle...			"

												It is a free to play match 3 game with a nice little Marvel  spin on things.However, once you've beaten the single player campaign you have a choice to make: stop playing or start paying. The grind becomes almost too painful to recommend due to roster space restriction, and the very slow speed by which you unlock Hero points (the currency that allows you to have a larger roster). I've yet to spend a dime, but it is clear the developers are definitely whale hunters. So, enjoy it until the grind starts to hurt. "

												Publishers continue to punish steam users by offering free in-game currency to users on mobile platform only.  I don't see how this isn't a violation of their contract with Steam.  Since a large portion of this game is competitive with players on those other platforms, I cannot recommend this game any longer.  Note my HUGE number of hours.			"

												This game is really fun when you first start playing it.  As you build your roster, you start to realize the only way to be competetive is to spend money.  This seems to be the game developers intention, as it has increasingly been focused on increasing their revenue rather than keeping and/or expanding their player base.  To illustrate my point just check out the DLC.  $100.47 for a supposedly free to play game.			"

												While I still play this game, and (kind of) enjoy it, I cannot recommend it at this point.  The degree to which the developer ignores their players is crazy.  Cheating is rampant and destroying the reward structure of the game. Cheaters are regularly reported, but action is extremely slow to come, if it ever does. (Literally months between initial reports of a player/alliance cheating and any action.)  Additionally, the developer doesn't seem to play test characters or changes to characters, or changes to the structures of their events, before implementing them.  It's like they don't really know what they want to do with the game, so just do things.  The game keeps getting imbalanced in new and frustrating ways.  I've spent around $40 on this free-to-play game, but likely won't spend another dime unless the developer makes substantial improvements in how they treat their players.  (IE- don't make it a cash grab, actually respect your customers.)			"

												Possibly one of the most brutal micro-transaction games I've ever encountered. Hero points are the real money to game currency that is required for everything from character space, leveling up your powers, entry into some game events, character boosts for individual battles, and having a better chance at new characters above a one star rating. Core game is great if you enjoyed Puzzle Quests games in the past. Enjoyment of the core game, however, will not overcome how terrible the dev team is for this game. In addition to microtransaction hell, content is frequently untested/broken. Characters are nerfed without warning and are almost never buffed. No refunds are given to your Hero Points/Iso-8 costs. You must sell them at a 50% loss or deal with it.   New content buffs NPCs to over level 200 which makes taking them down near impossible without purchasing major boosts to up your team's damage and action points.  I will also note that most of your team fully maxed out will have a level cap significantly under 200 unless you're willing to splurge tons of real cash on acquiring four star characters. Their dev teams also publically taunt their players and customers in their forums. Not in a reasonable and fun way (ie. Cloaker quotes in Payday 2) but rather telling players to go ahead and rate their game negatively and spread poor word of mouth. Signed, sealed and accepted mother ♥♥♥♥ers!			"

												The Game was great when it first started even after a year or so. It proved to be very friendly to new players and experienced players alike. They added new stuff along the way with loads of events to keep ya in the game including ones for the newbies so they can have a chance to win big as well. It was once a most brilliant game which encouraged you to play more and also gave ya plenty room to encourage you to purchase some roster slots aside from getting plenty of free ones through missions or getting lucky at that gold draw or even towards your allliance slots for new members untill they started changing things...alot of things. first started with just a no health gain which started quite a bit of commotion and also drastically decreased the amount of time people put into the game from hours to mere minutes decreasing its overall popularity. It seemed like a small thing being nothing big was changed after that cept new heroes with downgraded abilities of their older selves that were far weaker. Apparently they didn't stop there to roll in the cash and decrease amount of players and customers to their list. They took it much farther and it gets worse with each update they make. They then started taking away heroes abilities then went along to replacing them with weaker and less effective abilities including replacing alot of other heroes abilities that did quite well, but not over powered, to something entirely new that did little to nothing now. After all the excessive deep changes were made they caused alot of players to play less or even quit. They then decided in order to hopefully lure more people back or new ones into the game they released Deadpool and a huge event that gave ya a chance to enjoy Deadpool and get one of your own which kinda worked for a time but didn't last for long. They downgraded alot of abilities some more on some heroes especially focusing on the starter ones which were strong enough to help new players along the way towards better ones. They keep compensating it with more chances at new heroes that they release from time to time but was it enough? Apparently not being now its hardly worth working towards when most can't afford to keep in the game long enough to get them unless you pay your heart out for the luck at the draw which is rare you get anything different or better unless its towards the better draws which cost round $40-$50+ to get a slightly better chance which has proven to make little difference which even the normal draws are quite pricey if you don't get free ones from every day rewards. Sadly the game was reduced to nothing but rubble and another facebook game as most referr to it now as and even now stands little to impress new and old players to try or continue playing much or at all. If your looking for a good experience look the other way cuz this game has long lost it and the magic it brought to games that made it wildly popular when it started making itself more at home. The game no longer revolves around skill but more along of power, money, and luck and has no tactics that works like it used to so sad to say I conclude this thorough review saying that I would no longer reccomend this game to anyone unless they insisted on something to kill just a little of their time.

												A lot of people say this game is Pay to Win, but it's a bit misleading. Sure, if you're willing to drop trucktons of money into the game, you'll get access to stuff a lot faster than you would normally, but that holds true for nearly every single free to play game. I personally don't consider this a Pay to Win game.  I'm writing this review to shed some light on this. To do so, I'll go into some further depth of how the resources and the game works. Beware, as there will be a lot of things I touch upon here. I'll leave a short summary at the bottom.You have two main resources in this game - ISO-8 and Hero Points.   ISO-8 is primarily used to level up your characters and can be obtained easily and reguilarily, sometimes in very large quantities. Think of it as your common resource, you'll always need more and it is also the most available.Hero Points are much less common. Hero Points are used for a number of things, and could be compared to a premium resource, if you will. It is used to increase the maximum amount of characters you can have at any given time aswell as purchasing new characters and their powers. Hero Points can also be used to purchase additional Health Packs and to Shield yourself in PvP Events (more on both later).  It is available in limited supply from story missions - often enough to get you started - but the main source of Hero Points tend to be from the events that happen regularily. Events work similiar to the main storyline missions and the main PvP, except they have a set time limit. After the time is up for any event, you will receive rewards based on your placements in the rankings - Rewards consist of a combination of specific Covers (unlocks characters or upgrades their powers), Booster packs (contains random Covers), Hero Points and ISO-8. Apart from the rewards you get for your ranking, there are also progression rewards in most events that reward you at set intervals with ISO-8, Hero Points, Covers or Boosters.Next I'll go into health packs. Normally as your characters take damage in battle, they will slowly regenerate that health back (real-time) when they are not in battle. If a character is downed (in-game definition of a character running out of health) in battle, they also need a certain amount of time to recover from that on top of the time to regenerate their health. However, you can use Health Packs to instantly revive and fully heal any character. Health Packs naturally regenerate up to a stock of 5, but you can purchase additional health packs for Hero Points. You are also relatively regularily awarded Health Packs from missions, daily rewards and progression rewards.Next up we have Shields. Normally in PvP Events, you lose/gain points in the event whenever you are attacked by another player. Shields can be purchased with Hero Points to protect you from point loss due to other players attacking you for a limited time - I do not know if it also disables points gains from defensive victories. Attacking any player while a shield is active will prematurely end the effect.Last but not least are combat boosts. These are regularily and randomly dropped after any kind of combat, as mission drops aswell as progression rewards and come in different flavors. They are generally simple, providing small bonuses to specific areas - more damage or starting AP for powers (AP is generated by matching colored tiles), though there are much larger bonuses available that are far more rare (+150% damage vs specific kinds of enemies). You can purchase more of these bonuses for ISO-8 (and possibly Hero Points, I do not know since I haven't used any rare boosts).  Personally I very rarely use boosts, I have only been using a few in some of the more difficult PvE battles, and they are by no means necessary to stay competetive.Covers are generally what you are ultimately after. They unlock the character in question when you obtain your first one and either unlocks or increases levels of their powers with further ones. They come in four rarities shown by stars, from 1-star covers to 4-star covers. They are obtained regularily, most commonly from Boosters which in turned are awarded as mission rewards, progress rewards, event prizes and a few other sources. Your covers determine the strength of your characters' powers, but most importantly determine the maximum level you can level your character up to. The maximum level possible for a character is based on their rarity and actually leveling up characters uses ISO-8.  Boosters will give you a random cover, with a minimum rarity based on what kind of booster it is. There are two generic boosters that can give you pretty much any character in the game, but there are regularily ""specialized"" boosters available during events that contain one cover randomly chosen from a specific poll of characters, usually characters involved or powered up during the event. You can also purchase additional boosters in the in-game store for ISO-8 (only the basic booster) or Hero Points.  Events prizes and progress rewards will often grant you specific character covers. Event prizes tend to be covers ranging from 2- to 4-star covers, depending on your final rank (along with Hero Points and ISO-8), while progress rewards can reward you with anything from 1- to 4-star covers  (though 4-star cover progression rewards are usually practically impossible to reach within the timeframe of an event).In short, these resources are all either awarded regularily no matter what area of the game you play (Health Packs, Boosts and ISO-8) or regularily as rewards in event prizes and progression (Hero Points, ISO-8, Covers, Boosts and Boosters). The only exceptions are Shields, but they are not much of a resource to begin with.I have spent a lot of time on this game, and while I have paid some money to get more Hero Points (I regularily support Free to Play games that I like), I spent most of it up until now playing for free. From my own experience I can honestly tell you that you can easily stay competetive in the event rankings as a free player, provided you know what you're doing and are willing to sink some time into that particular event. Even with little effort you can generally get a decent ranking (enough for a 2-star cover, a 2-star booster) aswell as a reasonable amount of progression rewards. You never *need* Shields in PvP events to get a good placement, it just makes it easier.  You'll gradually get stronger as you play. At first you'll be using mainly 1-star covers, and as you gradually unlock 2-star covers you'll be switching over to mainly using them. In time you'll have enough 3-star covers to get them up to the level they need to be in order to be useful. 4-star covers are far more rare and are generally reserved as first place prizes for events and can also very rarely be obtained from boosters (I have one cover for each of the two existing 4-star characters, both obtained through boosters), but they shouldn't be your immediate goal to begin with. SummaryIn short, the bottom line is that this is a progression game where you'll gradually unlock new characters and level them up to be even stronger. Nothing a paying player can accomplish is unaccomplishable by any free player, a paying player can just get there faster and/or easier, which from my experience describes nearly all free to play games currently out there. I can say this though, it is a LONG progression you walk. You cannot expect to take the top spots in event rankings when you're fresh into the game, but eventually you'll be competing with the best.Finally, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. There is no doubt in my mind that this game will not appeal to most people, but if you seem to enjoy the premise of this game after giving it a try and can imagine spending a lot of time in it, it can be very enjoyable. Simply, I would very much recommend this game to the right people.			"

												Match 3, Marvel, but.... Microtransactions.The game's mechanics of a match-3 to initiate fights is far from new anymore - but its complicated by the need to ""heal"" injured combatants either by waiting or buying health packs.That's the first clue. The next is leveling up the characters. You do gain some of the upgrade materials and items from missions, certain ones earned at certain stages - but to make your team strong you need to further upgrade the skills, then upgrade the character, and repeat. There is a relative cap, but the distance from what the free to play model gives you and the time it would take to get there is absurd compared to just paying for it. It scales up the higher you go. Pay for more to get less and so on.Hence the microtransactions. Lots and lots of microtransactions.I wouldn't have an issue if it was possible to gain a decent team of your favorite heroes easily, just to enjoy the story, or possible to upgrade them relatively well without spending a fortune... but this game takes it to a whole new level.Be wary, this is a Pay to Win game, and boy you could pay in spades with the level of microtransactions here.Players beware. The lure to pay to win here is way too much for it to be worth it.Other than that, its a standard Marvel-oriented game following the mainstream stories on their own minor twist with the ISO-8 junk I first saw years ago with the Facebook varaint. The story is alright, the game itself is okay. The over-abundance of microtransactions to make you pay a fortune is not really making this game worth it.			"

												<<< Matching colors addict - Updated as of May 15, 2016 - Some new and cool changes in the last few months! (read near the bottom of the review for info on them)If you have been reading negative reviews in regards to P2W (pay 2 win) then they are biased. This game is free but real fans will spend money on it because they want to collect as many characters as they can and level them up fully. If you don't put effort into this game then you won't get too far and you will be discouraged. It takes patience and time to get anywhere. For fans and people who enjoy this type of build up with RPG elements this game is great! It gives you something to check everyday and play for a short while. Any fan of the Marvel Universe should get this game, especially since it is free. Players who pay will have an advantage in the sense that they can level up their character cards faster and buy more slots to recruit new characters, but once you get a bit further you can compete in daily competitions/leaderboards to win new characters and powers, crystals for levelling and gold coins for buying new character cards and extra slots. pros - A good chillin game, just need a mouse       - Made for fans of Marvel (obviously) and matching puzzle games with RPG elements       - Lots of super heroes and villians to collect ranging from one star* to four stars**** and now      with the new update new five star***** characters are available that can be levelled up to 450!       - A lot of strategy is required if you want to win difficult matches against higher level enemies.       - Collectable/usable power-ups and character power cards (usable once in a battle)!       - You can join or create an alliance and there are competition and leaderboards for your crew to compete in for prizes like new character cards, coins, crystal and 2-3 star cards from either the vault which is a random card generator that you stop yourself or a hero card that gives u a random 2-4 star character.       - Light on the PC       - Developers are active always updating the game, adding new characters periodically and creating new competitions and battles daily. cons - Addictive         - If you are color blind you might want to avoid this game        - Random character card received when purchasing new cards        - You will get many doubles which you can sell...but it can get annoying. Back to pros - UPDATE! - You can now max out your character level and pay an extra amount of crystal to make the maxed out character a legend. This allows you to use extra cards (that before would be useless and sold for crystal) to continue leveling up your character. One level per character card. Every level gives you a reward as well. like Command points, crystals, other character cards and coins.                - Command points are used to obtain **** 4 and ***** 5 star character cards. 20 for classic and 25 for modern. These command points are also used for upgrading characters if one can never find the one card they need for one of their characters.Overall score: 8.0/10Chance of becoming an addict (playing it daily) score: 7.0/10			"

												I'm going to start by saying I rarely write reviews but this game has such a bad rep due to people not really taking the time to play the game before posting a negative response. I wanted to try and fix this. If you look at the reviews for this game you will see hundreds of people saying ""pay to win; don't play."" This is what angers me, the game is actually pretty generous to free players. These bogus reviews are from people who launch the game, see the possibility for microtransactions, and post a bad review purely on that.I've been playing this game since its steam release and have never spent a cent. My first two days playing I was able to place in the top ten of a pvp event. Since then I've competed in many events and have never come away without atleast one 3-star or better.I was also able to complete the story within 2 week of downloading the game. It is true that the story rewards and pvp rewards are rather limited, but the amazing rewards for events make up for them.Also for those who thought about the ""pay to win strategy,"" you are wasting your money. It's HARD to get a significant advantage from paying! The amount of money each upgrade costs would require hundreds of dollars to be spent to make a significant difference. About $10 to level up a skill even though you can get the cover to do so by doing events for free.In summary the microtransaction option makes the game daunting to free to play people but if you are willing to put just a little time into the game(2-4 hours a day), you can do better than most paying players within a week. So please take it from someone who plays a lot of free to play games and has never spent a cent on any of them, this is one of the most generous free games you will ever find. Try it before you complain about microtransactions.Update: Marvel Puzzle Quest has changed a lot since I wrote this review. Mostly for the worse. While I do still enjoy playing the game it is largely because I already had a decent force before a lot of the changes were made. The company repeatedly ignores their fan base and makes changes that make the game increasingly hard to play without paying and really expensive if you do pay. I'm going to list the notable changes since this review was originally posted.The Good:1. The ever increasing roster size keeps collecting covers interesting and gives reason to come back to the game.2. PvP seasons: The company recently introduced PvP seasons. These are month long event that keep track of players as they partake in PvP events. The top rated players get fantastic rewards.The Bad:1. Shields: In Marvel Puzzle Quest PvP events run on a points system. At first glance it is simple and  fair. In fact it used to be fair but shields have all but ruined the accessability. For every round you win you gain points. If you lose a round you lose points. This is fine. Being that PvP is actually Player vs. AI player people must be able to challenge computer versions of other players. When a computer version of yourself wins or loses you also gain/lose points according. This has always been annoying but for the most part fair. However, shields allow a player to spend a decent sum of money in order to protect themselves from point loss. In otherwords free players quickly lose points from their AI losing but they can't make those who pay lose any points. This makes it very hard for free players especially when first starting off.2.Gold Characters: Gold characters are enhanced versions of other characters. This essentially means the developers got lazy and wanted to release a new character but didn't feel like designing new character powers. While that alone is annoying it is tolerable. What isn't tolerable is taking a character and nerfing him because he is ""overpowered"" and then release a stronger version of the character right after. For anyone who joined late and doesn't know this is exactly what they did with Thor.3. Boost Changes: Boosts were an easy way to allow free players to stand a fighting chance. A player could buy boosts with Iso(in game currency) in order to assist a strategy using what are otherwise weak characters. However, boosts have changed so that in order to buy the useful ones you must spend hero points(premium currency).4. Healing Changes: In Marvel Puzzle Quest you have always needed to wait for your characters to heal after battle. How long you have to wait varies depending on character level. You have also always been able to pay in order to heal instantly. While this has always given paying members an advantage, it wasn't outrageous because within a couple hours your characters would heal. However, the company has recently made it take longer for heroes to heal making the game even harder to play for free.The Ugly:1. Pay to Enter Tournaments: These are occasional tournaments that have an entry fee. The prizes to be won in said tournaments are outstanding. The winner gets one of every cover in the game. While I like the idea of large tournaments that have a little risk to them I don't like how these particular tournaments are set up. I'm fine with an entry fee but the fee should be in iso. I personally think there should be an entry fee somewhere along the lines of 5000-10000 iso. This is a decent amount of currency so there is a big risk for the players but it is entirely in-game currency so it is accessable to everyone if they are willing to save up for a while. Unfortunately the tournament entry fee is in hero points, so it once again favors those who pay fairly significantly.2. Alliances: Alliances, are this games version of a clan. All events have alliance rankings in addition to individual rankings. All members of the top ranked alliances get prizes. Alliances had the potential to be a great addition to the game. having a community to play with and talk to as well as getting additional prizes for doing so is fantastic. Where the game went wrong is in Alliance sizes. An Alliance starts with 5 player slots. However, the alliance leader has the option to buy additional slots up to 20. Of course to buy these slots you have to spend Hero points. So only the alliances who pay ever win events because they have a larger player base. Adding an additional slot to a guild isn't cheap either; additional slot cost as much expanding you roster size post 20 heroes.So would I recommend this game now? Maybe, it is really hard to say at this moment due to the fact that I started out so early. I do believe it is possible to do decently well while being a free player but I am rather biased because I already had a large army. Furthermore, at the rate which D3/Demiurge are ruining the game within a month it will likely be totally inaccessable to any new free players and possibly even veteran free players.			"

												Ok so Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign. A somewhat port from a IOS game. And it is notable. Few options, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI, some bad graphics and animations. Lacking even the basic options, like turning off combat animations. Which can become extremely repetetive after a short time, due to the fact that each hero can have a max of 3 skills. The gameplay combine the Puzzle Quest series with Marvel universe.  If you are a fan of the puzzle quest series or marvel universe, its worth giving a shot. The free to play model they use in this game is really weird and somewhat counterproductive. The worst part being that your heroes does not heal instantly after a match. Instead they heal over time. Having a lvl 50 Iron Mand die ---> wait 3hours.I guess the idea is to have people buy health packs to resurrect/heal the heroes. Summary+ addictive gameplay+ licensed superheroes from Marvel Universe+ loads of weekly/daily/hourly tournaments where you compete with other peoples heroes for prizes+ long and challenging campaign+ dont have to invest any money to be able to do well ingame- Bad UI, graphics, animation- Alot of our favourite Marvel superheroes is not in the game- Impending shadow of a poor free to play model- Weird gamechoices regarding leveling of powers, herolevel and healing- Bad AI (will use skills whenever they have enough resources, even tho it only hurts them)I still recommend the game to fans of puzzlequestish games, and fans of marvel. Game is very timeconsuming and I would totally play it on an IOS while taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just dont expect anything more.			"

												Game is entertaining, although it keeps you hooked with the idea that you will eventually get to use new and cool super heroes.  Although its possible to unlock new heroes, in order to get the ones you want and be capable of leveling up, you either need a lot of time or to simply pay money.			"

												Steam says I have more than 2000 hours in the game, but the truth is it is mostly running on the background. I'd say 500 hours is much closer to reality. Here is what you need to know about the game. It is a 3vs3 match where you bring a team of heroes/villains and try to win by making use of their abilities. You use them by spending the required resources (AP) which you get when you match tiles. The characters are divided in 4 tiers (1* - 4*) with only the 3* and very few of the 2* being useful at the moment. Most characters have 3 abilities, but there are some with only 2 because the developers have left them incomplete for months. The abilities can gain levels by buying or winning covers. The stats of the characters and the effectiveness of their abilities are increased as you level them with the use of ISO-8, an in-game currency used solely for leveling characters and buying boosts you can use in matches. The second currency is called HP (Hero Points) and is used to increase the size of your roster and to level abilities without the use of covers.The good: Fast game / doesn't require too much thinking which makes it ideal for short gaming bursts / you get to use your favorite heroes / very simple rules.The bad: Several incomplete characters with no plan to finish them in the near future / a turn from F2P to P2P since March 2014 / Inconvenient event end times for Europeans / success depends heavily on playing close the end of an event / several exploits are reported which allow cheaters to roam free in the game / market prices for in-game currency are the worst I have seen in a game.Advices:1. Use HP only to buy roster slots. At least until you have 30-35 slots. Never buy tokens (they give random covers). The % to get a specific 3* hero is less than 1% in most cases. You have better results if you level the abilities directly with HP. 2. Never use ISO-8 to buy 1* tokens. You will need it to level your heroes and it will always, ALWAYS be in short supply.3. Always take part in Lightning Rounds since they are the most efficient source of ISO. Try to get to 100 points. 4. Don't max a 3* hero unless you have a diverse roster with at least 3-4 more heroes with levels 85+. When you do, the levels of the teams you fight will also increase a lot.Epilogue: I will not tell how to spend your money, but you have to know that the game has made a turn into a more P2P model after March 2014. The changes in late June change how healing works in the game and restricts your ability to play since there is practically no way to heal heroes unless they have an innate regeneration ability. Heroes heal over time, but with most of them taking 2-4 hours to fully heal. healing packs are your only alternative and they cost HP which is relatively rare. The market prices are ridiculously unreasonable. To fully level a 3* hero you will need ~170k ISO which costs ~$300. The game is quite addictive so be warned. I would advice against letting young children play with it. I bet they can find better things to do and you should encourage them to spend their time doing something more creative. So do I recommend this game? After the changes in the last 2-3 months, I do not.			"

												This is a clever variation on match 3 puzzle games; you control a team of characters, and you beat up the other team by making matches. Each character does different amounts of damage from different colors, and every character has three unique abilities which mesh to create the gameplay.The problem is that this is a free to play game, and it is one of those free to play games which is constructed entirely around exploiting the darkest parts of the human psyche. It is all about addiction, trying to get you to keep playing to keep getting more slots for your heroes, and it is just a tremendously addictive exerience as you're always short of having enough slots for all your characters - and if you don't put your characters into a slot, you lose them.This is designed to compel you to keep playing, and manipulate you into playing far more than the game actually warrants.The core gameplay is decent enough, but if you have any addictive tendencies at all, this game will chew you up and spit you out.

												Update 11/11/16:  Yep, still negative. If you like games you can play in small bits and want an active player community, this delivers both. If you don't mind massive amounts of time and moeny being burned to progress, you'll do well.BUT if you insist on playing, DON'T play it on Steam. Play it on iOS or Android. The devs continue to offer better rewards to mobile players via in-game advertising and Facebook integration. They say Steam API will not support these features .... and offer NO compensation. If you play on Steam you will be one of a small minority, competing against an ocean of better-compensated mobile players.That's this year's disaster. See below for last year's ""high"" point.______________________Short version: Stay away.Longer version:Gameplay is fun but very, very shallow. Content, in the form of characters to burn resources chasing, is continually expanding, while new story content or gameplay expansion remian few and far between. It's extremely repetitive and grindy.This game launched in an anemic and hilariously unbalanced form, and has come a long way in 2 years. It's growing and being proted to consoles. Great.It does still have a fun tightknit community that can be accessed via the dev's forum. That's the best thing about the game, the other people playing it, not the game itself. Hmmm.It is probably the prettiest match-3 game around .... that isn't saying much. The game mechanics, after 2 years of bolt-ons, are held together by baling wire. Unintended results abound and are discovered the hard way by players.Play it casually for awhile and then move on. God help you if you allow it to become a habit. (See those hours logged? There but for the grace of the gods go you.)The worst is the dev's inept attempts at communication. Spectacularly bad. Here is a great example ... This week is the game's 2-year anniversary. It centers on a new event, a battle against Galactus. The blance of the event is laughably out of whack; the ONLY way to win is to make use of exploits (which the inept developer failed to catch ...). Other events running concurrently are suffering from various bugs, and the anniversary rewards have been found to be WORSE than the normal in-game rewards (Happy anniversary!)After the event runs for a day, and the online community is thoroughly hacked off, the producer posts the below. Judge it for yourself._____________________Hey all,Wanted to share a few things about how Galactus works and what we're expecting versus what we're seeing.To start, it seems like a lot of people are on a basic disconnect here, looking at the boss battle similar to how Ultron ran in terms of how things work. Meaning that Ultron should be going down pretty regularly. He's powerful, but his real power lies in the fact that killing his body doesn't stop him. You need to crush every one of his drones and main bodies to win. So winning rounds is a pretty regular occurrence. Game-wise, what this means is that players won fairly easily against Ultron and took their lumps against the drones. The stopping timer there was health packs based on when the drones finally wore you down. What this also meant is that the higher end Alliances would chew through the entire Event in about 12 hours and let it kinda sit for 3 days.Galactus is different. The ""minion"" fights against the villains are relatively simple. They're there as minor hazards but relatively easily winnable. Galactus on the other hand is a massive threat. He's not going to be stopped by gnats. Iron Fist punching him in the toe isn't very painful. So he gets bored and swats them away. In game terms, this means that players are going to be beaten. Winning a round against Galactus is an achievement. You're supposed to lose. Every time you do, you're still chipping away at his life. It's an exercise in damage in aggregate. Over the 3.5 days, hitting him over and over to finally bring down the big bad is somewhat slow, but certainly effective.Overall, most of the higher end Alliances are in Round 6 or knocking on the door to Round 7. Which is actually slightly faster than we were expecting people to get just based on the math. So everyone's doing pretty darned well in terms of progression. There are some teams rockin' the Winfinite, other teams that are pushing through with some interesting strategies (who woulda thought OBW would be a rock star against Galactus?). Not many Alliances are getting anywhere near full clears. Which is actually intended. You're supposed to lose your Health Packs on Galactus, rather than against the minions like on Ultron. It's also why we changed up the play method for this round too so that it's not just a flip flop between Ultron and minions till you win. There's a set number of times you can hit Galactus before you need to take a break to let minions refresh. That break means that you have plenty of times for Galactus drained Packs to refresh while you can go in and get some Black Vortex in. Or play Simulator (up soon). Or get your Devil Dino on when that starts up. It's a different design than the rush of Ultron where that was pretty much all players did while it was open.Long story short, you all are doing really well against Galactus. Yes, the gameplay is different. I'm sure most of you aren't used to going into a battle with the idea that you may well lose. But given that you're still pulling out wins with pretty strong regularity, I don't see any reason this wouldn't continue into Rounds 7 and 8, and on to Cyclops awesomeness.At the outset, going into the boss battle, you're looking at winning like normal. After all, it works elsewhere in the game, and it worked against Ultron. So suddenly getting rocked by Galactus is a shock. Keep at it. If things are really going to go poorly, we'll look at doing refresh timer changes and the like that we can do server-side as a quicker band aid style fix for run 1. After that, we'll figure out what we want to do for difficulty on run 2 (and any other runs that we do in the future, of course).			"

Because healing spells only last for the current battle, I can now only play 2-3 rounds at a time (if I'm lucky) before I either have to pay real money or wait several hours for my team to heal themselves. Such a shame, as I was really starting to enjoy it, and was considering throwing some money into the game simply to show my appreciation.  Now that it's kinda being forced on me, I can't bring myself to do it, and have been playing much less.			"

Needless to say why I've put so much time into it (although about 100-200 hours I accidentally afked in the game.)However with the recent changes the game is more like a facebook game then an actual puzzle quest game.  It's just a poor game now.  It's become completely Pay 2 Win and if you want to play the game you need to do a bunch of BS and jump through hoops to play for longer then 30 minutes a day.  Due to this I can't recommend the game to anyone anymore.Before it was a nitch game that I'm sure some people could love (certainly not all) despite the setbacks it has, but now I'd say everyone should just walk away.

No!A great and addicting game if you like puzzlequest style of match 3 and love the Marvel universe. Too bad the developpers of D3P try make you believe it is free to play. The most recent updates shift the gameplay strongly in favor of those who put in a lot of money, thus making it fairly impossible to compete for new characters. If you are willing to overlook this and are searching for a nice game to kill those few hours you don't want tot spent on 'real gaming', this still is a nice game to play. Too bad it is pay2win.			"

												I simply love this game and I think it gets undeserved reviews from many people saying you have to buy ingame money to achieve anything. That is not correct at all, it helps of course to buy some coins in the start, but you don`t have to since you will win ingame money by playing the game so you can open more slots for more heroes/villains. I have played this game for over 1 year now, almost every day, and I have used money on it as well, but I think it is worth to spend some money on a free game since that also encourage the developer to work more on the game, so I don`t have a problem spending money on a ""free"" game. As one other reviewer wrote, if you let the game make you become addicted, you will become addicted. This is so true, I really can`t go one day without playing it, but that is what makes a great game I think.But I also understand that this is not a game for everyone, you have to like these kind of puzzle games and you probably should also be a comic/marvel geek. Its great to learn a lot about the characters and you know who will be the new hero when a new hero film is in the horizon. For me this game is almost perfect so I give it 9/10.			"

												It's a pretty generic match-3 puzzle game, which I have no problem with - games like that can be (and often are) quite fun. The problem is that the entire game is clearly pay-to-win from the start and microtransactioned out the butt.Want to level up your hero? ...you can, eventually, if you get the right random drop... or you can pay to level them up. Your hero is injured? Well, you can go play something else for a few hours as you wait for him to eventually heal... or you can buy heals for any injured heroes. If you don't mind microtransactions... I still can't recommend it. There are plenty of games you could be spending your tiny bits of cash on that are way more fun than a simple match-3 game.			"

""Free to play"" is only there to get you in the door.  Healing isn't healing anymore.  That's an odd sentence.  This is a money grab game.  If you can heal your own characters without buying health packs, the game developers lose.  That sentence is even more odd.  A bit sickening really.  I will not play a game that fundamentally changes basic mechanics to promote purchasing of in game items to play a game for any more than short bursts at a time.Save your time.  Save your money.

												Take your average match 3, put some extra 'Marvel Superhero' powers on jewels...some of them triggering on matches, some of them on particular actions. Also there are heroes' own charging/passive abilities with more powerful powers. You can somehow control who is attacking and who is blocking from your own heroes while playing. There are some different game modes including story mode (actually they are partial events from past story arcs of marvel universe...nothing new) and a meh pvp mode&pvp events (you are just facing another player's defensive team, not really facing another player, which is actually ok) Nothing enjoyable for an experienced player of the genre but still kinda addictive.Good game if you like Marvel universe and you just want to pass some time without paying your full attention. BUT If you make a harsh technical criticism on this game it is a fail.I AM NOT RECOMMENDING IT BUT I WILL PLAY IT :)			"

												I am a huge fan of the Puzzle Quest series of games. Sadly this game falls way short of them. It is easy to say, ""Well it is free."" But I would think someone like Marvel, owned by Disney, would want to put out the best quality product in existence, This is not it. The game has little or no balance. It is clearly skewed towards desperation purchases as the continue to move forward in the you either trudge away for hours to maybe get to the next portion or you break down to get stronger characters to beat foes. I understand the in game purchase but when you pay the price at fun it makes the game overall worthless. There is a lot more that can be said but this is just not a good game, Neither of Marvel's free-to-play games are very good.			"

												How much are you willing to spend on a ""free"" game. If it's not a crap load, then don't download this. I'm kind of sad it uses the Puzzle Quest name, because this plays nothing like the other two. Which I find much more fun. So if you wanna play a match game with abilities, look into one of those.

												While the game can be initially addicting, it is ultimately unsatisfying.  It becomes a grind to acquire and develop new characters unless you want to spend actually money for in game currency to expedite the process.  If you are curious about the Marvel characters, then maybe give it a go, but keep expectations low as the game never achieves anything more than being a feasible time waster.			"

												Game is waste of time since July's update that forces you to buy healthpacks. Don't look at ""free to play"". You MUST buy health packs with real money to stay online and score any meaningful rank now. What was advertised as ""roster diversty"" actually shrinked diverse combination of teams to pretty much two choices: two tanks that everybody would ignore because they take too much time or two heavy-hitters that will either destroy or severely damage your team, so you'll be afraid because you can no longer heal. Healers simply disappeared from any team serious about winning.Authors also enjoy political censure. Colossus initially had hammer and sickle as his symbol - in line with his lore, art and pretty much every other Marvel game, including desktop games. Yet it was quickly removed as some nazi-pride clown complained about it.If you're interested in lore, you also forced to play obsessively or pay up, because that's the only way you will have ""essential"" character - i.e. character required to even start some battles and witness their dialogue. Those are usually top tier prizes from previous event. If you missed your first chance - too bad to be you. Next time this event is run, nodes will probably will have another requirement and original character dialogue will be completely removed, which happened on 2nd Sentry event run, where all the dialogue showing Daken as obidient Osborn's guard dog in charge of internal security was edited out. Of course that's not the single edit over time of game.			"

												I literally can't think of another game with more hooks to try to get you to spend money than MPQ.There are *multiple tiers* of in game currency that you can pay for.If you want more characters (""covers""), you have to buy them. If you want to reliably upgrade the abilities of characters you do have, you have to purchase the upgrades. If you want to level up those characters without a crazy grind, you have to pay. If you want more character slots, you have to pay. If your characters take too much damage and you want to keep on playing, you have to pay for a heal. If you want to compete in PVP you have to pay for boosts.Sure, *some* of those things you can grind for, but the results are often unpredictable. For example instead of an upgrade to an existing character you might get a new character cover. But if you don't have enough character slots you have to buy more. You can try to grind for enough currency to unlock more slots (prices for new slots increase depending on how many you already have), but you have a time limit on your covers, so if you can't unlock a new slot fast enough, the new character you earned just disappears. This is a deliberate time pressure to try to get you to just buy the slot.You spend a bunch of time and currency investing in a character just to find out he has a level cap because he is a lower-tier character, and if you actually want to progress in the game you need higher tier characters. You can try and grind for the (exceedingly rare) chance to get a rare cover to drop, or you can spend money to get one as a sure thing. Again, the game is trying to pressure you into buying♥♥♥♥♥♥You can try to unlock more rewards by competing in PVP and PVE events, but as soon as you get anywhere near the top bracket you'll find it is impossible to progress and get the real rewards without paying money because the other people at the top are paying for heals and boosts so if you aren't doing the same you can't possibly compete with them, so even the ""free"" rewards are effectively locked behind a paywall.There is absolutely no skill involved in this game, it's all about how much money you are willing to spend. It's probably the most disgusting example of pay to win mechanics and ""gambling"" hooks in something purporting to be a video game I have ever seen.			"

Is this game free to play : yes if you want to roll thay way IS THE GAME FUN AND ENTERTAINING ; DAMN RIGHT IT IS . and last but not least the developers are always trying to make the game better .Remember it was only going to be a match 3 game and it took off like wildfire they wernt ready for that and when they catch up look out this will be the best match 3 game there is.The mechanics of the game are awesome with each hero having different powers and passive skills. there is a wide range of people even though the villians are few. All in all a great F2P game as long as you don't get caught up in the politics on the forum and line chat.			"

												As someone who has played the game for a lot more te they should have, I highly recommend against this game. I'm a huge Marvel nerd. I play Avengers Alliance, Heroes, and Future fight. So why a I against this one? It's addictive, but not in a good. It isn't a game which is quite fun. It is a game which quickly turns into a job, of you trying to earn specific characters. The problem, is you can only get these characters by sheer luck, and that fact that they reworked both methods of recruiting them to be less enjoyable is even worse. I ultimately decided to abandoned the game.			"

I hate ""free-to-play"" games that are impossible to actually finish for free.  A good free-to-play should be beatable for free, but beatable faster with boosts purchased with microtransactions.... or microtransaction purchases are just for avatar purposes to help you have a more unique look.Bottom Line: unless you want to spend money to actually be able to play all the way through, don't bother.

												A boring story targeted to people who know the Marvel lore by heart (who usually aren't in the match-3 demo), and yet treating them like idiots with its pathetic writing (unless it was intended). This is usually solved by having great gameplay. Which isn't the case here. Not only is this entry clearly inferior to the other (not exactly great either) games in the PQ series, but it's also badly implemented. My PC runs The Witcher 3 at 60 fps, but can barely handle 30 fps of these bad 2D graphics. And the 'Tap to continue' prompt clearly shows it's a mobile game that was ported without an after-thought.The only good thing in here is the character model sheets. I'm sure you can download them off some dedicated wiki, I'm pretty sure, so who cares.Don't get me wrong, I like the Marvel universe, especially its TV shows, but I have no idea WHO this game is for. Certainly not for me.			"

												Gameplay is OK.  The fact that it takes over 1 hour to heal over 1000hp is garbage, though.  If you want to heal your team, run the Venom ""Kidnapping""; take a bunch of blues then stunlock Venom, healing at the end before finishing him.  Do this for every 2 characters.Anyway.  So you can pay to heal.  You can pay to level up.  You can pay to level your skills up.  You have to pay to expand your roster.  You [essentially] have to pay if you don't want to run the Venom level after every game.  You have to pay if you want to level up.  You have to pay if you don't want Iron Man, Black Widow, Storm, and the BrownEye (I jest.  Hawkeye.  But he's just horrible in this game.)The grind isn't all that fun.  The dialogue is okay if you only have to see it once or twice, but it's terribad to see the same thing every other battle.  Levelling up isn't even that exciting.  You get a bit more damage.  Some HP.  Levelling up your skills isn't very rewarding or game-changing.I encourage you to check out this game for maybe 3 hours.  At which time you'll start grinding and be rewarded with nothing.  Uninstall, write a review, then move on.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest easily recommended to anyone who enjoys the match 3 genre or simply wants a good 'zen' game.  The gameplay mechanics are fantastic and the game itself has taken HUGE strides to become more and more free to play friendly over time. Anyone who gets invested in this game might be surprised to learn that it has a healthy and welcome community attached to it through the forums and primarily through the LINE app.  This interaction with other players turns MPQ into more than just a game I pick up and play on occasion. As an extremely hardcore player of Marvel Puzzle Quest I can easily see a lot of the games flaws as they pertain to character balance issues, reliance on lucky cover draws, the feeling that your roster improves and yet you continually face more challenging content rather that 'get ahead', becoming overwhelmed by characters but not enough room to keep them all, and the fact that competitive play demands far too much time from the player.   Those negatives aside the game at it's core is still fantastic to play and well worth recommending. A solid 8/10 experience that can easily hook you if you let it.			"

												Downloading the Steam version, previously I've only played the Android version.The game is a good time-sink. For those calling it pay-to-win; certainly you can buy most of the meaningful resources in the game, but you're not getting good value for your money, and you're kind of missing the point of the game.  $10 will save you, eh, maybe 5 hours of in-game effort, and because of the way the game groups people for the in-game competition, you don't get any actual advantage; you have better characters, but so does the group you're competing with.Which does imply something of the issue: The whole game is a Red Queen's Race.  Enemies level up with your strongest three characters (as best as I can tell), so ""Easy"" missions will always be easy, and ""Difficult"" missions will always be difficult.  The RPG elements are mostly an illusion; mostly, because characters are separated out by their ""Star"" power, and each star-level has a power cap.  So once you develop a two-star roster, your one-star characters stop being useful (mostly); after you get a three-star roster, your two-star roster is less useful, and your one-star roster becomes, outside very specific situations, completely worthless.  If you're spending money to advance your characters, you're wasting your money.Because the point of the game isn't to ""win"" - there is no winning.  It's a time sink, and a well-designed one; you'll be tempted to spend money every now and then to increase the size of your roster (which can be done without spending money, but more slowly and deliberately), to avoid having to make a painful choice between selling a new powerful character, or selling an old favorite character to make room.  If opportunity cost is painful for you, you probably shouldn't play this game; you'll be spending a lot of money.  (Disclosure: I've personally spent $20.  Not because I couldn't not, but because I like the game and like supporting developers.)If, on the other hand, you're accustomed to trade-offs, this game could be a very satisfying way of spending free time.

Cons outweigh pros by FARToo many things about this game make it painfully frustrating and totally not worth playing.The worst thing is how often I'm forced to sit back and watch uncountable cascades or other nonsense because the tile drops are not random. The algorithm they use not only identifies the chosen characters in order to set tiles on the board but also identifies how many of which tiles are on the board before selecting which tiles to drop after a match. Watching which tiles drop a few times lets you quickly begin to predict which tiles are likely to drop next. Being able to predict should help your strategies but, as you quickly learn, it does not.Equivalently to this problem, you are forced to play on the developers terms:You must endlessly grind the same match to get 1/4 rewards.You must begin a fight just to view inventory of boosts AND you must manually de-select the boosts from a previous fight.When you gain hero tokens you must decide whether to open the token (for an incredibly rare chance to gain something you actually want) or keep the unopened token indefinitely. Once you open the token you must then choose whether to sell the hero for ISO, swap the hero for another hero already on your roster (if you don't have enough Hero Points to open a slot for them), or let the hero expire and receive nothing.On mobile devices, you're forced to endure 100+MB updates every other week. Which brings up another crucial point: almost every update adds a new character. Pretty cool, right? Keeps things dynamic by adding fresh meat. Well, aside from EVERY update causing new bugs (oh, crashes cause an infuriating problem I'll get to next), at the beginning, the first 4 slots to add new characters to your roster are free. However, as you keep adding characters, the cost of the slots keep going up. Here's what they cost after the first 4:  Roster Slot Hero Pts   5 25   10 200   24 300   29 400   37 500   45 600   53 700   61 800   69 900   77+ 1000 It's like the devs punish you for collecting a full roster. How does this make any sense? Meanwhile, if you're enough of a sucker to throw hundreds of dollars at these developers, you must still be able to work ... uhh play(?) on the game's schedule just to compete with anyone for the rewards you want... but if you've got that kind of time & money to throw at one single fremium game, what rewards do you need that you couldn't buy outright? Oh, that's right--you can't. There are only 2 things you can definitively buy (which are both outrageously priced): ISO and Hero Points. Game Crashes: Many poorly programmed games are prone to crashes and this one is no exception but D3 adds some twists to this back-alley gut-stabbing. The game may randomly crash while you are in the middle of a match and that's not the worst part. When the crash occurs, the game treats your sudden exit as if you have chosen to retreat which damages your team! Forget that retreat damage is asinine to begin with but now devs add 'injury' to insult by doing nothing about game crash damage. Want to re-initiate the game and try to replay the match with your ideally chosen team? Tough luck! They're either dead or half dead!There is a whole other side of this 'game' which allows players to 'fight' each other (you only play against A.I. on any part of the game) that I won't go into. I've played it only enough to realize how utterly futile it is. If you check out the D3Go forums you'll see the extent of frustration that people have for the multitude of flaws in 'versus' mode.Beyond all that, I see many people rate it high then say ""It's great BUT..."" or recommend it and say it's addicting as though being an addict is a good thing.If I could, I would only recommend this title to people I hate.

												I wouldn't recommend paying money for ANY puzzle quest game that involves leveling up characters. Especially when the gameplay itself is still on shaky grounds while requiring more updates and revisions than an Iron Man armor model.With that said... it's a match-3 puzzle game. What's not addicting about it? However, it is my opinion that when Demiurge begins tweaking this game, a lot of what made this game casual starts to fall apart. This is to waste time and have fun / Not to either grind or pay to win.

												Bottom line: Very slow and grindy from the get-go.Don't get me wrong I know exactly what I'm in for when I download something with the tag ""free to play"". I know that eventually I will come to point in the game where the progress slows down and I have to decide whether to commit my time or my money. I do not expect every f2p game to be PoE or DOTA2. But the thing that disappointed me with this game was how soon I got to that point.In my experience these sorts of free to play games, the good ones, tend to be pretty fast paced at first to get you hooked and learn the ropes. Then as the pace of progression gradually slows down you can start to really appreciate and understand what you can accomplish long term, either through play or through paying. But Marvel Puzzle quest sort of just gives you one semi-fast prologue chapter and then says ""now we grind"".I haven't even beaten the second prologue chapter yet and my best character (Iron-man) takes over an hour in real time to heal up to full health if he’s downed. The battles even against normal goons take a long time now. Even if the battle isn't hard they usually damage my heroes so much that I can't use them for a good while. And the reward for beating them are sometimes just these consumable boosts that do not progress your characters in any way which makes it feel like you won nothing for such a long battle.My most dominating thought is ""if it's this grindy in the prologue how bad will it be when I actually get to play the main PVE/PVP modes?"" I don't know, maybe it's admirable how upfront this game is about what it is (i.e. a typical f2p game) but it's a huge turnoff for me and I guess for others as well.I see the potential in this game, it has some pretty cool ideas and the Puzzle Quest match 3 battles are fun, but it got grindy way to fast. I enjoyed the previous puzzle quest games and hoped this could become my new ""play a quick session every once in a while game"". But it gives such a bad early impression that I’m pretty much done with the game, which is a shame honestly.			"

												Three months ago when I started this game, I loved playing it. I truly enjoy three-match puzzles and this also introduced me better to the Marvel universe. There are regular events with witty dialogue and the more I played, the more I felt rewarded.Then I had two characters leveled to 85 (the current max level at the time for Thor and Storm) and that's when hell was unleashed. Oh dear.Even though there is PVP in the game, you never play against an actual person. Instead their three characters are controlled by the computer. And since the computer is dreadful at this game, the only way the computer can win is by having victory magically handed to them. Every single day I see the exact same cheating tactics and that is what makes me angry about the gameplay. The opponents gets everything they need for their abilities magically apearing on the top row, they get deadly cascades of nodes dropping endlessly and I have seen them clear one row only to have it replaced completely with nodes of a color they need.I finally had enough of this game. I don't enjoy playing a game where victory is handed to the opponent, when there obviously was no nodes to ensure their victory when I ended my turn.2015 updateOne year after writing the review originally, I decided to see if things have changed for the better. Some things are better, while others have the exact problems as last year.Improvements- Many new heroes. Easier to collect some heroes that were concidered ""rare"" last time I was playing. - Updated abilities for older characters, making some of them better to use. - City nodes are replaced with team-up nodes. You have three team up cards (which can be given to you by your alliance and found randomly) that can be used with team up points. These are far better than the city nodes and have actually helped me win some games.- A daily quest which gives you a chance to get rare heroes or plenty of resources. Things that still are flawedOpponents still cheats horribly. Anytime I try to play anything that isn't 50 levels below me, the cheating AI will kill my team with no effort. They get cascades (nodes endlessly falling and matching), you move one node and they get a perfect 4 or 5 on their next turn and they color starve you, to force you to play ""bad"" while they get what they need through the toprow.Anytime you loose, the game gives you horrible advice how to win. Let's analyze why this doesn't work anymore:Put down protection nodes to decrease incoming damage. Reality: The AI's will clear your nodes within a few turns. The first time I put down Invisible Womans bubble that shields a character from all damage, it was cleared instantly by the computer getting a cascade.Keep your weakest characters in the back to shield them from damage. Reality: The game deliberately forces you to only move certain nodes, which forces your weakest characters to the front. Kill the strongest opponent firstReality: You have to kill whichever character has a cascading ability or the least amount of point to charge their ability. One of the most difficult opponents in the game is Juggernaut, because he combines both of these. His 2 abilities cost very little (6 points). One cascades, the other deals a little damage to himself and a lot to you. So he cascades, deals damage to you, cascades, deal damage to you. The sad thing is? Juggernaut is one of the weakest characters you can recruit on your team, being only a 1 star character. But for AI events, he is buffed up and kills you easily.Prevent the enemy from collecting colors their need.Reality: Either the AI are teamed up with another AI that gives them free points or they simply cascades and get the points they need from the toprow.Collect colors you need for your strongest abilitiesReality: The game forces you to only move certain nodes. Whenever 2-star Storm is on my team, I only need 11 blue nodes to charge her ability. There is very rarely a single blue node when she is on my team. Most of the time, you are only allowed to collect pink nodes, which is one of the weakest colors in the game. And then watch the AI get the colors they needed through the toprow. Other problems with gameplay- Enemy AI usually have few colors to collect, which makes it easy for them to make a lot of damage in little time. Ninjas and thugs usually have abilities that cost 4 mana, they get free mana because they aren't allowed to move nodes and the countdowns are just 2-3 times long. Unless you are really lucky, it's very difficult to clear those nodes in time. Because you rarely have anything to match them with. - The ""match node helper"" will regularly point out a bad move while ignoring a 4-5 match. - Because cascades happen so regularly, you need to waste health packs often. You never know if your character will survive with only half of their life.ConclusionThere's no strategy in this game. You win if you are lucky. Even though technically my characters are 50 levels above the other team and should massacre them.  I feel dumbed down when I play, because I always look for a good move and still loose because my characters can't match colors they need.			"

												You'll see plenty of reviews that tackle what the developers have done to absolutely bend over their once-loyal players. But, I'll still add my voice to that camp.The game starts out deceptively fair for a Free-to-Play. But I've spent money because I wanted to support it, I absolutely love match-3 puzzle games, and MPQ began very strong. I expected to get more out of my real money and time invested. But in the end, the microtransactions carry some of the most ludicrous price tags I've ever seen. Especially once you realize how shafted you are. If you max out a hero's level capacity (Each hero has a maximum level directly proportional to its rarity) you can spend ISO (a f2p resource earned from playing) to level them once the right number of 'covers' (item drops that level up 1 of 3 abilities a hero has) has been obtained.The developers are just NOT providing the level of return investment quality in their microtransactions. And they know it. You have to spend a STAGGERING amount of money or a nigh-impossible amount of game time to acquire competitive max-level high rarity heroes. Look at my total time played. I legitimately have 3 maxed out uncommon heroes and a handful of level 15-50 uncommon and rares. When I look at the amount of hours invested, I'm not upset. It's a great distraction at my relatively low-demanding job, but at the same time, I don't feel the devs have spent nearly as much time developing meaningful addons, GRAPHICAL IMPROVEMENTS (ffs this game is a goldmine) or a truly diverse lineup of Marvel originals.All in all, give it a try if you like puzzle games, but honestly, there are more rewarding ones out there. I'm turning my back on it and putting my disposable income on something else.			"

												The game concept is very fun and interesting. There are many events happening all the time. It would have a lot of potential if not for...- Money grab tactics to progress. Forced to spend Hero Points (hard to earn unless you spend money) just to buy slots to have +1 character. These slots get more expensive with each few slots you buy, until it gets out of hand expensive.- If you want to play for free and win some good characters and Hero Points, you need to schedule your life around the game's events starting and ending time. (EDIT: this seems to have been addressed.)- PvP system is implemented in a way that forces you spend to spend Hero Points to be competitive.- The game seems to progress nicely in the beginning until you hit several deadends which will tempt you to spend money.Try it out if you wish, DON'T spend money at all until you played for at least 2 or 3 months. You will regret it. It has potential, if you don't mind spending money on a game every week and have no real life commitments, this may be a game for you.			"

												Long story short:This was a viable puzzle game.  While it had some issues, these were not too severe.  Loosely based on the Marvel comic event Dark Reign, you did the usual match 3 gameplay to beat up the Dark Avengers ..... over and over again.  Before the most recent patch, this was probably the worst part of the game as there are only so many times you can defeat the same five characters repeatedly.Then the healing nerf hit.D3, in a fit of absolute greed and the worst show of judgement, decided to patch the game so that any and all healing buffs were now ""False healing"" in order to force the player to buy more healing packs in order to continue to play past two or three matches.  This nerf not only crippled the healing characters, it has made characters such as Sentry unplayable.  By eliminating the low-level hot dog stand healing, even people who are just starting out are affected negatively by this change.In the end, there are better Free-to-Play or even match-3 puzzle games to invest your time in than this misuse of the Marvel License.

												I wanted to like this game.  Puzzle Quest is one of my favorite time killers, and this borrows heavily from that game and adds a neat three on three dimension that I found cool.  But the leveling up system is stupidly complicated and based on a degree of luck that sucks all the fun out of it.  You're HP is not restored to full power after each match, which means you either have to wait around half the day for it to regenerate or you can purchase the in-game currency that will let you restore it immediately.  After getting frustrated as hell with MPQ: DR for a couple of weeks, I deleted it from my library.  Save yourself the trouble and don't bother trying it.  Go buy the sequel to Puzzle Quest instead, or maybe Galactrix.  Don't get sucked in just because it features Marvel superheroes.			"

												Been playing this for a very long time. Most of that time I spent spending no money on the thing only started spending money recently because of a job and because of all the hours I've put into it. Despite what people say, you can get very far in this game with no investment as far as money is concerned. Time isn't really a factor either due to the rather recent changes of the events. An hour or so a day will be enough to get you going. Join an alliance and ask what you should do.There is one problem that I have to address though. The steam version currently cannot link to your mobile version. You can still have alliances with Steam/Mobile users, but you will not be able to make progress on steam and transfer that progress onto your phone. If you have a phone that can run it well, pick it up on that instead.I don't think I really need to say much else. Just look at all those hours the majority of the not recommended have put into the thing.			"

												This is a great game completely ruined by the mobile phone game business model. Energy, timers, grinding leveling, this game has it all. It's basic concept is really fun, but overshadowed by what I just mentioned. It's basically a match 3 game mixed with a RPG type battles. This part of the game is actually really fun. I would give this game 10/10 had it been done outside of the f2p model and had instead charged like $20-30. You really can't play this game for more than 20 minutes as once all you're heroes are defeated you must wait for them to ""regain"" health. Which simply means waiting an hour or paying money to heal. Also leveling up on your own is ridiculously grinding. You will often find yourself stuck with no way to progress until you very slowly finally get enough points to finally level up enough to take on an enemy. Most insultingly sometimes you wont even get promised rewards for a victory, the game is just like f*ck you and moves on.HOW DOES ANY COMPANY THINK STEAM USERS ARE STUPID ENOUGH TO PAY FOR A $100 MICROTRANSACTION!!!!!!

												Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign ReviewA game titled Marvel Puzzle Quest has a lot to live to up to. Not for the Marvel part, but instead due to the deserved respect and love that Puzzle Quest received for successfully creating a hybrid RPG/Bejeweled-style match-three game. Marvel Puzzle Quest has taken the idea of a puzzle game with with a strategic/role-playing element overlay, and turned it into an intricately crafted, remarkably deep experience.In Marvel Puzzle Quest, you control three superheroes who fight against up to three other supervillains/heroes (or goons, in some of the plot missions). When matched, the six colors of gems on the board grant energy that can be used for special moves, like purple matches helping Hawkeye use “Take Aim,” a skill that ensures a critical hit. Every match also serves as an attack, but the amount of damage depends on individual characters' affinity with the color – which also gives combo attacks a nice superhero fight feel to them, where Iron Man lands a punch and then Black Widow jumps in. Meanwhile, skills that offer buffs to defense/strength, or do damage over time, manifest as changes to tiles on the board, which can be matched and eliminated. Thus, the board becomes amazingly tactical – there are up to half a dozen potential considerations beyond “best match” at any given point.Unfortunately the game ended up being a pay to win game with overpriced micro-transactions.

												Whenever i see someone call this a game i can't help but laugh for at least a minute because in reality it is just a shameless attempt of a money making scheme, with the most serious offence being the health logic.It has a health carry over after each fight, alongside a health pack limit of 5 and generating 1 every half hour (unless you have no value of money and can pay for more.) Meaning you have to stop playing after a few battles. Seriously, who in their right mind thought that limiting play time would be a good thing!Trying to level up the powers of rarer characters is pretty much out of the question if you're avoiding spending money on them, which is ridiculous...The story plummets after the first chapter (not that it was particularly interesting to begin with) and becomes a series of pointless fights with goons and soldiers.Downloading this game as a Puzzle Quest installment or a Marvel game will only lead to disappointment. And do not mistake this as a free to play as you will find this game increasingly impossible the further you go.  "

The ""Tournaments"" that you play in are just other player teams controlled by the AI, which tends to make them either total blowouts or impossible.

												I really can't recommend this game even though I am still playing it and have lots of hours invested.  It really is a solid match 3 game but the meta game is the problem.  If you do not invest money (probably lots), you will progress at a snails pace.  There are so many heroes, and for the most part you will get them at random meaning you will end up with lots and lots of poorly covered heroes.  The higher the rarity, the bigger the problem.  Also you will need roster spots to even recuit the heroes you have won.  These can only be bought with premium currency (which you do get from playing) which means you will often have to sell your hard earned covers or pay real money for roster spots.  This is especially bad early in your career.  Heroes are added every two weeks, so the problem is only getting worse with time, not better as you would hope.The biggest problem with the game though, is lack of new content.  I could live with the above problems if new, fun stuff was coming out, but I am playing almost the same game as I was almost 2 years ago.  Boss battles were added, but they are rare and alliance based (so not much fun if you aren't on a good alliance).  There have only been 2 or 3 stories added since I started (not counting rare, short events that are only seen once or twice a year).  That means 75% of the stories are against the Dark Avengers which means you are fighting the same villians over and over.  And to compete in these events?  You need to beat each pin (battle) 4-6 times.There is also PvP but that is against AI controlled player rosters.  As the heroes are not the most balanced in the world you tend to see certain teams and heroes a lot there.  And they almost always be of similar strength which makes it feel very grindy.  And both PvP and PvE are time based, there is no content that you can play at your own pace other than the short introductory stories that you can only play once.  So to get the good prizes you need to devote lots of time to them.  Whether a paying player or not.So bottom line, don't play this.  The match 3 is fun and can get some people hooked.  Do yourself a favor and don't let that happen.  At least until they address the problems above which isn't likely to happen.			"

												Wow, I admittedly downloaded this game because I was rather made eager by the Marvel and Free package, and whats more it seemed to not be like the crummy Marvel games of yore that make you pay to do anything more than hop.  But alas through my initial enjoyment of the game I realized when the AI takes over for other players, and better yet when you are playing only AI, the odds are drastically in the AI's favor that the select colors they need will drop.  This is okay, I thought, all it means is my time in this game will be a bit more challenging.  Then I saw changes as the game kept updating, the AI still was favored, but now things would happen like my entire team dropping dead on my turn (the first turn) when no match was made and no power fired.  I sent an email looking for an explanation, thinking maybe it was an accidental bug, I got a computer generated impersonel response that was not even pertinent to my query.  I decided to grin and bare it, it actually got better after the next update.  After some time though suddenly it started getting worse, the AI was using powers it had no way of using (no AP) and often dealing 2-3x the damage it should have been, the only improvement from before is I no longer watched my whole team die on turn one, now it was turn five.I finally decided to delete the game and send a carefully worded letter to the techs, this was and is the only Marvel game I ever actually liked, and even was pondering spending money on it.Edit: The email I was awaiting from the game people finally arrived, titled ""Our Friend"" and in German.  I never told them I spoke what little German I do, so this seems like another generic, ""we will make you happy"" attempt.			"

												When I saw the other user reviews I thought that their playtimes were ridiculous and that you can't jugde it based on 0.3 hours but when I tried it I found you can judge it on 0.3 hours, the ""tutorial"" doesn't tell you anything about all the numbers popping on screen, it doesn't bother eplaining them, fortunately it's kind of obvious what they mean. It gives off the impression that it's a basic match 3 game but NOPE it's not, it's got various mechanics that might have actually been cool. However they don't bother explaining these until you have already figured them out, with the exception of the powers they do tell you about those.   Speaking about the powers, the ones they start you off with at first seem cool with Iron Man's repulsor blast dealing like solid 63 damage but later on the enemies have so much health it begins to suck. Also the story, I can't say I payed much attention to it because it was dumb but the writing was horrible it was cheesy and boring, not even cheesy and funny just boring and and the beginning they start off with Iron Man, yeah fine whatever but then they throw in Storm, for no reason at all just because why not, lets throw in a completely unrelated character to team up with Iron Man to take down some lame♥♥♥♥♥bad guys and the enemies have unoriginal names, like soldier and sniper. There is probably a pay to win aspect but I couldn't play it long enough to notice, oh wait yes I could in the first 5 minutes they tried to force me to use some healing thing to heal my hero which wasn't even badly damaged, if you don't heal your heroes they can't fight no matter how much health they have, they could be only 5 hp short and you'd just have to wait for them to heal or use up one health pack if your lazy and eventually enemies deal enough damage to prevent you from playing for a minimum if 4 minutes if you don't use the health pack, how do you get more health packs? You either play missions which you can't do because your hero is injured or you buy them. Don't waste your time with this go play Bejeweled on your phone or something instead.			"

												This is an OK game, but the microtransactions put a ceiling in the game to an annnoying degree. I do like the play style, but it's a little infuriating to know that I have to grind for hours or pay out money to progress on the missions. Gameplay is fun, but the free-to-play structure here is really trying to milk the players. I'm not interested in the multiplayer as it's pretty obvious that the PvP results can best be predicted by putting an obsessive (read basement dwellling ) fixation of this game or throwing money at it. I suppose I'll play once in a while. It's sad because I was so excited to see a new PQ game. I'm only in it foor the casuall play.			"

												Honestly I've played the iOS version of the game, downloaded the PC version just to see whats it's like and I've gotta say... it's the same game. I'm not saying that it's a bad thing. I played the mobile version of the game for the last 2 months and I would recommend you to give it a try as it is a simple game to just turn on and play once in a while. My only gripe with the game is that there is no cloud syncing with the mobile version (even when cross platform play is available) as my roster of heroes are not available in the PC version.PS: Please bear in mind that this game is a mobile game in all aspects (from the countdown timer to the healing time). What I would recommend when playing on PC is that you pretend you're playing on a big tablet (if you don't like the idea of mobile games being ported to PC)			"

												In short, as of the latest patch and change to healing I would not recommend starting this game unless you are planning to be a whale. The change to healing a clear attempt at getting players to buy healing items for real money.I am still playing the game as I have established a fair roster, but I find myself like the game less and less.

												So I have very mixed feelings about this game.  I have to say, it's worth avoiding so-called ""Free to Play"" games, as they intentionally abuse game design and put it not in the service of telling a story or making a compelling experience or whatever, but rather in the service of getting microtransactions out of the player.  It don't think it's possible to avoid that, save for doing a shareware model where you're playing an extended demo for free.I assumed the above before playing any ""free to play"" games, and I'm more certain of it after sinking time in to quite a few over the past year or two.All that said, Marvel Puzzle Quest is the best of them I've yet seen, and there's a lot of fun to be had from it...but at the same time, it would be a better game were it designed like the mainline Puzzle Quest games that you just purchase and play.  There doesn't appear to ever be an endgame here...it's basically just repeating story elements that ultimately are trying to get you to pay money, but never really lead anywhere.  I've seen stories in this repeated a half dozen times now, sometimes slightly mixed up, sometimes the same storyline/quest has repeated literally twice in a row.And it's a shame, because a lot of what's here is actually great.  I played Puzzle Quest 2 while playing this, and I actually like the basic ""puzzle combat"" gameplay here better.  The art is generally fantastic too (and looks better and the screen layout is much better on PC than on iOS/Android).  This is the most fun I've ever had with the basic mechanics of a single screen action puzzle game.The adaptation of characters' powers to the gameplay is well thought out-they're clearly trying and mostly succeeding in making it work.  I won't lie, it's a lot of fun to collect and power up your favorite characters and have them beat down your opponent.  But it gets frustrating when you realize it’s really towards no end…there’s no endpoint, just that endless repetition of mostly identical story elements recycled again and again.  The most egregious way they try to get you to spend (a lot) of money on it is for slots to hold characters.  They give you a very small number at the start, and since both for gameplay reasons and because it’s cool to have them, you’ll quickly want/need vastly more slots than they give you.  You technically earn the resources to buy slots within the game, but that’s a VERY slow process that’s not very practical-I think since I started playing they’ve made that worse too.  You’re pretty much forced into paying real-world money to be able to have the slots you’d want and need to actually continue playing.So would I recommend this?  There’s so much fun in it, and it’s so well done in many ways…and yet at the same time, there’s no ending.  There’s no resolution to the story.  It’s just a fancy treadmill to get you to pay more, and it’s a shame that this same effort wasn’t put towards making this a “real” game.  Even an MMO model might make more sense for it (as it is actually an MMO in many respects).  I'm putting thumbs down because Steam forces me to thumb it up or down.  I'd rather just leave that blank, and I’d probably give it 3 Stars on the Netflix model because so much is fun and works, and yet so much doesn’t by the nature of what it is…  (And yes 3 stars is positive and thumbs down negative, but...I don't know, I couldn't quite give it 2 stars, were that an option, and yet I also don't feel like I can exactly recommend it...)

												I'm changing my review rating.I had this review as as a recommend with reluctance but at this point it's a no.The game has gone from sometimes unbalanced against the AI to extremely.  Doing away with the terrain tiles has just let the computer have an easier time beating me.And this isn't me being bad at the game.Blatant bugs that let the AI use moves they shouldn't, magical cascades that take out my entire party from full and just the fact that if you chose to use boosts you have no access to terrain powers.  That was one thing about the terrain I had liked, it was the same for both groups.I'm limited by the space I have to try and decide if I want to power my characters or hope I can get enough TU tiles to use one of the boosts I've gotten.I love the Marvel universe because of the movies and I will continue to play because of the time I've put into it, but if you've never played.Don't waste or time or money.

												A ""free-to-play"" puzzle quest with Marvel characters. If that's all it was, it might have been a fun game. There are a lot of issues working against it though. You're supposed to collect cards, but since you only have a very limited roster, you only want to keep the most powerful cards you can find or just stick with the main couple cards you start out with because they're the ones that level up. If you don't make room for them in your roster, new cards disappear. There's no way to measure your roster's progress on leveling up; when you do level a card up, you have to spend the crystals to actually increase the level. Most of the puzzle rounds have multiple rewards (I guess to push ""replayability"") but evidently the rewards are randomized so that you could play a single round dozens of times but never get all 4 rewards. I don't mind that the cards must ""heal"" when they take damage during a round, but the more powerful the enemies, the more damage, the longer time they have to heal. Eventually you can only play 2 or 3 rounds before your entire roster is down. So you have to grind for rewards but can't grind because your team's down. If this was a tablet game, it wouldn't be a big deal; on the PC, why play a game only as long as it takes to start it up? Of course, this is all not a problem if you're fine with paying lots of real money for the tokens.			"

												I would love to recommend this game, but at it's current state it's a mixed bag. The puzzle element is really solid and damn addictive, I will go more in to the flaws at the end of the review,but if you want to enjoy it(without spending money) there are some tips.1. Use most of the iso you get for training your heroes instead of buying covers, at least in the beginning, it is slow to grind with low level heroes on missions that you have already gathered all the iso from. Also focus on three heroes at the start, so you have at least one team that can defeat more difficult opponents. 2. Use the hero points for roster upgrades, the game limits how many heroes you can have and you very quickly fill all your slots.3. You can't really reset your progress, so a bad start can really destroy enjoyment.4. Start slow, you get some reward daily and they help you progress5. Take part in events, they are really difficult at the very beginning and often require heroes you might not have. but they offer nice rewards and are generally entertaining. More so when you've played the game for a little longer.What I hate about the game.1.Monetization, while not bad as a concept, this game has ridiculous prizes for it's currency, and as usual the more valuable resource is very limited ingame without paying. Events feature heroes that are powered up in them, and if you want to buy them quaranteed, it costs about 20 euros, hero slots start at about 1€ a spot but quickly double that. You get heroes at random, and if you want a copy of specific cover to level up power and also the level cap of the hero, you can spend money for that, 1 star hero is about 1€ per cover, 2 star is about 5€, 3 star cover is closer to 10€ and 4-star cover is about 25€.You also can't buy new select covers for heroes, the powers have to be unlocked via randomly acquired cover or event prize. And after the power is unlocked the power could be upgraded by paying.2.Difficulty on campaign ramps up pretty fast, creating a paywall of some level that feels that appears very early, more so if you had a bad start.3.Campaign length. You start with a tab Prologue, that has 5 maps, each with about 15 battles. the difficulty really ramps up at the 4th one. Then when you finally clear the prologue, the campaign at least so far is over. After that there are only the events and pvp against other player teams that are controlled by AI. so the game becames more of a gotta catch them all, with no other real goal and that is handicapped by monetization.4.LevelingThe whole leveling up system seems to have been designed with monetization in mind. You need iso to level up, the cost get higher and the rate at which you get it becomes slower when there are no new missions to play and old missions give almost negligible amounts. You hero's maximum level is capped by how many covers for him/her you have, and how rare the hero isSome random numbersGraphics 7. They are nice, not groundbreaking, but feel very fitting for this gameGameplay 9. Very addicting once you get the hang of it, AI is kind of stupid at times which i guess just happensWriting and sounds are decent but i mainly play on the background while doing something else so can't really rate them.Monetization 2. everything feels like it has very bad value and not much incentive to use the option. And it really hurts the gameOverall 4. The actual gameplay is great, but is dragged down by lack of content, goals after the short campaign and monetization centric design.			"

												A casual puzzle game with all kind of heroes from the Marvel universe. Takes a while to become a high(er) level player but with time and skill it's possible. In Marvel Puzzle Quest you get new heroes by spending recruit tokens. These tokens get you a random hero and the anticipation always excites me. The joy of getting a rare drop never gets old. Besides the game is free so if you don't like it, you can just drop it and nothing's lost.			"

The fault has developers of a nameless nullity which totally destroyed this gameplay. Only ones people who spend some money can again play. There is no innovation, the useless content with creating new inaccessible characters for 3 months (4 stars more numerous than 1 stars), the new players have no chance and the old as me are tired of redoing and of redoing always the same maps for nothing.

												Huge upside here.  I'm a huge fan of the previous Puzzle Quest games in the series and I'm a pretty big comic book/super hero fan so naturally I had to give this game a try.  It helps that it's free to play (even though there are plenty of in-game microtransactions, none of which are required to play).  If you like any of the other Puzzle Quest games then you're bound to enjoy this one.			"

												The best game of its type I have EVER played. This game should come with a warning label, ""May be addictive"". I cannot stop playing this little game (moreso on the phone than on the pc) and actually wake up thinking about it. If you enjoy Bejeweled and/or a comics fan you must play this. Being that its a freemium game, there's not reason not to. A novel take on the classic 'match 3' game with rpg trappings. Genius.			"

												Casual game, don't take this game as something you can play for hours, because it is not meant to be played for hours nonstop.  It came from mobile games and now is playable on PC.  Anyway, if you want to play a light game without much thought and time, then go ahead play this game, but if you are expecting this game to be hardcore with nonstop gameplay, then you are looking at the wrong game.  Anyway, the game is basically like bejewel with marvel mascots.  I enjoyed this game, and I usually play it on my free time for around 15 minutes.  Perfect for something relaxing and etc.			"

												I picked this up on a lark because of how much I enjoy match-3 type games (mindless, easy to play while watching T.V., etc).  Surprisingly, I've found this game to be really fun.  It's similar to Puzzle Quest in that there is added depth to the match-3 concept, and the PvP aspect as well as repeated Events keep me coming back.I'm editing this, as I see a ton of negative reviews due to the micro-transaction concept this game introduces.  It's a F2P game, the company has to make money so I don't see a problem with them charging to play more.  I've sank about $15 into this game and played for 30 hours, which is cheaper than most other forms of entertainment and quite a bit more I've gotten out of other games for similar price.  That being said, you don't need to pay a lot of cash.  Play smart, pick your fights, and you can pace yourself and naturally heal over time if that's your thing.			"

												It's a trap! All and all don't waste your money and time on this game, it's just too random.  Play for free or only use money to unlock roster slots.   Never ever pay to upgrade one star characters.The monetization of this game is frustrating.  Unlocking characters and powers are one and the same and come from a random event called recruiting.  You roll the dice to get a character power, if you don't already have that character, they are added to your roster. So even when you are lucky enough to grab a rare three star character  they are useless until  you unlock their other powers which is extremely improbable.   Also unlocking levels of abilities is over priced.  Unlocking a single ability level on a three star character can cost (1250 points) ~$10 per level.  To compete in multiplayer challenges you need rare characters who can exceed level 50.  With that said, I'm hooked, hundreds of hours.... I can't get out.			"

												I am a big fan of Marvel heroes, however this game is very tedious and monotonous. It is free to play, so the game steers you toward spending money in order to compete without spending hours on end grinding through the game, This game, overall, is bad.This is a puzzle quest game.  You start off with a few 1 star characters and either earn others by playing the game or buying a chance to get certain characters. Characters range from 1 to 4 stars. Simply match gems to attack, no skill involved. Matchs drag on and useless animations, that you cannot disable, draws out these matches needlessly.MPQ can get frustrating, and is very repetitive. When it is time for you to lose;  you will lose. The computer will cascade massive amounts of gem matches, continue to find extra turns, and color starve you until you lose. This happens often, how else would they get you to spend money to buy heals, a chance for characters, and levels.  I play on and off, but I would not recommend this game at all.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign has been out on iOS and Android for a few months now, and recently came out on Steam. While being free-to-play makes it harmless enough to check out, it is not one of the better games of this model out there. Tribes Ascend and Path of Exile are just a few examples of how this model can be applied to a game with great success. Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign gets 2 out of 5 stars. While most will get some passing enjoyment out of this puzzle game’s use of strategy and RPG elements, the sluggish UI and sub-par graphics, as well as the deluge of micro transactions, makes this one hard to recommend to even the most ardent of Marvel or Puzzle Quest fans.Full review at: http://www.hbhud.com/2013/12/09/review-of-marvel-puzzle-quest-dark-reign/ "

												5 Stars. (If you want a game that you can play for hours on end move along, if you want to play about an hour or two at a time, a couple times a day THIS IS THE PERFECT GAME FOR YOU.)Alright, after reading many of the posts here I felt the need to post my own review.This game is the type of game that you are supposed to progress over months. There is a fairly good pace of gaining characters/currency of either type in game. A MAJOR MISTAKE is wasting the in game Coin on trying to buy heroes. ONLY BUY hero slots. I have 35ish hero slights and haven't bought a single thing. In fact, I earn enough gold to buy more ever few days. The prologue has many events that give gold, if you place decently in a pvp or pve event gold.  THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT YOU SHOULD WORRY ABOUT.One major point I want to make is, while you can buy currency, it WILL NOT go far at all. This makes it even better for F2P players because they can always remain competitive. Overall, this is the type of game you play a few times a day, taking a few hour break inbetween to recharge lives. It is an amazing game, that people just need to learn how to EFFECTIVELY use there in game currency.ONE finally thing   D3go.com  is the site where you can find the forums, there are AMAZING GUIDES on farming iso, what heroes to focus leveling, good hero combos, etc.			"

The game was always had a lot of extras that you could pay for but it was still good very enjoyable as free to play game.

												My first review, cause I'm frustated. I've been playing this for a long while. Until yesterday it was fun and you didn't need to spend money and you could still enjoy the game. This changed completely after yesterdays update,  cause you can heal your characters only by spending real money or waiting 2-4hours for them to heal back to full health. So to enjoy this free to play game you need to spend actual money. Unless the healing update will be changed, I certainly don't recommend getting into this game. At least for the time being, the game is pretty broken, pay to play or wait to play.  "

												Steam users get no love.  The mobile platform can get many more in game resources than Steam users, and yet you have to compete against them.  You also can't link across platforms (play on both pc and mobile).  PVP is terrible (it's actually player vs. computer, but that's not the bad part.  matchmaking and scoring are much worse)Requires either a huge time sink or huge money to make any kind of real progression in this game.  That progress can be taken away with nerfs, with compensation coming in way less than half of what resources you've put into the character.  (we're talking nerfs after putting 1.5 years into a character.)  RNG on top of RNG to progress.  Devs don't listen to the majority of the playerbase (as represented on the forums), and just push out changes that look like money grab after money grab.I forgot about bugs!  Constantly introducing new bugs with each patch, and leaving old ones unfixed in favor of releasing new characters (for you to buy).  Even release broken game modes because they don't play-test their work, to the point where some events quickly become unplayable.I've sunk way too much time in this game, and it was fun for what it was.  But, terrible change after terrible change has me looking for somewhere else to spend my time.			"

												It's simply amazing how the good old bejeweld game can be converted into a 'story based' game with a huge cash grab.Lets start with the 'story based' theme... Your own a team of Marvel heroes that need to grow in their powers. This is all done around a pretty thin story with extremely boring dialogues. Even before I was through the tutorial I kinda clicked all the dialogues away that boring are they!And that brings me to the cash grab... To level your heroes you need Iso-8 AND LOTS OF IT! I was 'lucky' to recieve a legendary level 70 hero early in the game - he really made things extremely easy for me. Leveling up my other heroes I stumbled into the upcoming payment wall (cash grab). To level from level 20 to the next stage (it hops with quite a number of levels - around 4 or 5 at this point) I need over 3K Iso-8. That's either playing a lot (you get an average of 50 Iso-8 a game) or play with your creditcard and buy the 3K Iso-8 for around $5. And that's only at level 20. Remember that 'lukcy' drop I had of my level 70 hero..? I don't even want to know how many Iso-8 I need for that one!Will I play this game for hours a day to grind for the Iso-8 I need to keep playing it..? No thanks! There are a lot better Free2Play games out there that offer a bigger variety in gameplay and are more fun. Not to mention, I do have more to do on a day than play Marvel Puzzle Quest for hours...

On the beginning, if you are a new player, it's still good.Pro:- You have a good and enjoyable campaign- You have some pvp events playable on low levelsCont:- The PVE events are terrible. 1-2 months ago they were good, but now they are totally unbalanced, if you dont have strong heroes, you will eb unable to start these events + you will need a lot of heals and ressurection - pay for play.- The PVP events on higher lvl are about strong heroes - pay for win- There isnt a new campaign, idk why, this part of the game is totally abandoned /it was for free, so the developers just dont care about it/- a lot of bugsSuper cons, negatives, srsly, and thats smth new:-This month the developers added a lot of new stuff that makes the game easier for players who pay and unenjoyable for players who dont pay. BUT! /read the next part/- the price of things /in-game money, iso-crystals, boosts, heals/ is incredible, totally OP, unbelievable. For this money you can buy a WoW account for a year, 2-3 high quality video games, or anything else. Terrible prices, simply terrible prices.I hope it will be better.			"

												This may be a ""Free To Play"" game, but like most of the lame flash games you see on Facebook, this game heavily revovles around micro-transactions. If you're not familar with the abusive nature of micro-transaction dependent games, then read some of the more in-depth reviews (like the ones with 4+ paragraphs) to get more details. The only positive thing this game has over the flash games on Facebook is that:1) the game doesn't lag as much as the ones on FaceBook, 2) this game won't force you to spam all of your FaceBook friends, &3) it has characters from the Marvel franchise. As for the puzzle game itself, I find it infuriating! I am not merely saying this because I am a poor loser. I get my♥♥♥♥♥kicked all the time in MOBA & fighting games, but I can still enjoy those games. When I make a mistake in those games, I can usually see alternative moves that could have been made & understand how the consequences of the mistake could have been avoided. In this game, when you destroy blocks, new blocks will fall down to replace the destroyed blocks, sometimes the replacement blocks will just conveniently share the same color & coinciding create a chain reaction, doing massive damage. I am not talking about the pieces that are already on the board & merely fall down. I speaking of the new pieces that weren't on the board previously. Because of this, destroying block on the bottom half of the board is usually more advantageous then destroying the block near the top edge of the board.Unlike most puzzle games, such as ""Tetris"", there is no preview of the new incoming blocks that appear from the top of the game board, so there is no way to prepare for them, offensively or defensively. Many times, chain combos will just happen by accident & sometimes for massive damage; sometimes for you, sometimes against you. This can be a HUGE reward that is being giving out, not for any brilliant strategy or careful planning, but just by sheer randomness. Unless one team is heavily more over-powered than the other, without a preview of the next set of falling blocks, the outcome of the match relies too heavily on luck. You might as well be playing a slot machine. I'm still gonna play this game though, just because I'm as much of a sucker as those who do play slot machines.			"

												Mavel Puzzle quest, A new high in developer greed. Took away most of the characters in game away from us and locked them behind an extra level of rng just so they can try to force everyone to collect and level only the latest characters in a limited amount of time to try and force people into a resource crunch so they have to spend money to keep up.As far as I am concerned the game is dead.  Casuals are no longer welcome, only the people that want to spend lots of money. The people behind it are the worst kind of evil and greedy. Only install this game if you are looking for an outlet to throw away all your money to progress.	 "

												This game is the utter definition of pay 2 win. With cash roadblocks at new characters, new skills, skill level ups, and healing, expect to find yourself grinding the same missions over and over hoping to make enough funny money to have a chance at earning a character that is strong enough to beat the next stage and having to wait up to a hour(at least for 30 and under) real time for your characters to heal back to full health. Since you can't level up without having more skill levels, and leveling up lower level characters is pointless anyways since their skills do not scale with the levels of HP, you're forced into this loop until you get a lvl 30 character that breaks the game for a few hours, until they are too weak as well.  Stick with the first 3 games, because this is game is a great example of what the F2P greedy cashgrab can do to a series.			"

												""9.1 out of 10"" - IGNKeep in mind: This rating is not for the Steam / PC version - it has been done for the mobile version!!!That said, there is no way this game would ever recieve a rating over 9 compared to other PC games. Sure it is a fun mobile game and the mobile-version deserves a high rating (still debatable if a rating over 9 is deserved here), but the PC-Version is a really poorly executed port.If you want to play this i recommend to get it for your mobile device, no matter if smart-phone or tablet. Give it a shot! It feels smooth, the animations and visuals are crisp and beautiful and everything is tuned well.But the PC version...?They haven't even tried to make it right. It's just an effortless, poorly programmed port. They should be ashamed to feature it on the frontpage.1 out of 10.Don't waste your time on this! "

												Edit: I should have well over 300 hours in by it now. I am in a casual do-dailies-turn-up-for-events alliance. I am on day 521 of my Rewards. I have 30 champed 3-star heroes. And I still stand by my review below. Game is great, I like the devs, changes by and large make sense. But there is still no cross-play between PC and mobile. No thumbs up for you.=======I really enjoy this Match-3 game, between PC and Tablet I've put in well over 100 hours into it. Got every single reward from the tutorials, placed well in a few Story events (which are an interesting system of different timed thematical storyline events that spit out rewards every day or three) because I have pockets of time through the day which this fills nicely. Even dabbled a bit into the Versus system, where you fight other players' teams for rank and rewards, but the AI controls the opponent teams since Match-3 gameplay doesn't lend itself well to a realtime PvP system at all.My roster's not as developed as long-time players yet, I have a bunch of 2-star heroes, a number of 3-stars with 1 or 2 powers, and a couple 4-stars from event rewards that I lean heavily on. (Star basically = rarity/power rating, with 1 stars being the lowest and 4 being the highest with a 5 now just released in an update). Enemies in story fights seems to scale according to your overall roster level, which is neat, because it allowed even my newer PC account to jump right in to a story event and place high enough to get top tier rewards.The game is F2P with microtransactions, but the MT's are so RNG based that you don't really get to P2W very effectively unless you spend a ton, I think, and even then you can win loads of the same MT items just from several hours put into the story events, or by focusing your free time into an event that you think you can do well in.Yet I hesitate to give this game a positive recommendation. I like it, but one thing really irks me. As a microtransaction-based game, it's unforgivable in my eyes that the accounts from different platforms play together but people cannot access their mobile account on PC and vice versa. If you are making a microtransaction game, especially since I noticed the mobile version already has Google+ and Facebook integration, you have to have this basic functionality since the game's pricing model is based on constantly spending money.So while I like the game, I will not give it my recommendation until this is implemented as I feel that this is a necessary step for them to earn my thumbs up. They apparently have manually merged some accounts ""in the past"" but have since stopped doing so for everyone else.			"

												It's simply amazing how the good old bejeweld game can be converted into a 'story based' game with a huge cash grab.Lets start with the 'story based' theme... Your own a team of Marvel heroes that need to grow in their powers. This is all done around a pretty thin story with extremely boring dialogues. Even before I was through the tutorial I kinda clicked all the dialogues away that boring are they!And that brings me to the cash grab... To level your heroes you need Iso-8 AND LOTS OF IT! I was 'lucky' to recieve a legendary level 70 hero early in the game - he really made things extremely easy for me. Leveling up my other heroes I stumbled into the upcoming payment wall (cash grab). To level from level 20 to the next stage (it hops with quite a number of levels - around 4 or 5 at this point) I need over 3K Iso-8. That's either playing a lot (you get an average of 50 Iso-8 a game) or play with your creditcard and buy the 3K Iso-8 for around $5. And that's only at level 20. Remember that 'lukcy' drop I had of my level 70 hero..? I don't even want to know how many Iso-8 I need for that one!Will I play this game for hours a day to grind for the Iso-8 I need to keep playing it..? No thanks! There are a lot better Free2Play games out there that offer a bigger variety in gameplay and are more fun. Not to mention, I do have more to do on a day than play Marvel Puzzle Quest for hours...

												I got into this one thinking, ""Gee, if the mobile version is any indication, it would be wonderful to have a supplementary version I can switch to at will on my PC and play when I want a fullscreen experience."" While waiting for the download I scrolled down to the reviews and notice not a single recommend. After playing it for more than two minutes it's clear to me why.Having played on my Galaxy SIII prior to this, I assumed (incorrectly) that there would be some way to link my accounts and resume play on the desktop version, perhaps Facebook or Google+ or such. But nope. If you played the game on your smart device, you haven't played it on PC. No such option exists, and it sends you straight through the exact same tutorials I went through on the mobile version, albeit with a rather poorly designed interface (if you can really say there's one to speak of).The horrible design I can somewhat deal with (I expected a superior version to mobile), but upon learning that there was no way to sync between my smart device and this version, complete dealbreaker. I realize people bash the crap out of D3's decision to make the game pay to win, but I actually have put money into it prior, so seeing the branding not scale whatsoever between versions is a pitiful excuse at best. If they fix this (which is unlikely, given the game seems to think you're playing it on a tablet by design and is literally a direct port of the widescreen tablet version), I would possibly love the desktop version until the end of time. As it is, I'm sure not paying money all over again for the same content.			"

												Despite a lot of negative reviews criticizing this game for the microtransactions, I highly recommend it. The microtransactions are mainly for ""hero points,"" which is a rare currency in the game that is mainly used for increasing your roster size and letting you collect more heroes/villains. I have played for about 30 hours at the time of this review without a single penny spent and I've loved it. Now that we've covered the microtransactions, the real review.Marvel Puzzle Quest is a match three game, like Candy Crush Saga or Bejeweled. Each team has three heroes (or villains) per battle, and each match you make gives damage to the enemy team. You can earn more characters for your team by completing battles, winning PvP and campaign events, or buying them using Iso-8 (another currency which is much more common) and Hero Points. PvP Events are released frequently, which let you fight another player's team which is usually paired up with a hero from that event, like Deadpool or Wolverine. There's also a campaign mode where you fight game A.I. for Iso-8 and sometimes Hero Points.Overall, I'd say it's a really cool game and despite all the negative reviews, you should download it and check it out.

												The game is what it is. Complaining that it's freemium is silly, because you already knew that going in. The idea that you can't ""win"" without paying is also silly. There's no ""winning"" in an ongoing game. You might win or lose individual battles, but that has nothing to do with spending money. I invest little time in it on my mobile devices, and still manage to get in the top 100 in tournaments fairly regularly. If you want ALL of the covers and ALL of the characters, then yeah, you'll have to spend at some point. But it's perfectly playable with the random drops.The one thing that does peeve me a bit is that there's no way to link mobile to PC. If you can link across mobile devices, you should be able to link to the PC version. I suspect that's because it's on Steam, but still frustrating. Though, if you do want to play a ""new"" game, it's good for that.			"

												This is good attempt to make F2P from Puzzle Quest. There are only familiar PQ battles - no pets, no equip, no locks - only the battles. But they are quite good. And the upgrading Marvel heroes instead equip makes it interesting too. There is one problem though - the new heroes requires a new slots, and without slots you most probably will miss your special rewards. But game was quite generous to give me 7 slots from initial questing money, and later... well, I shell be able to manage it later. But if you want the many different heroes, fast, prepare to pay.As it's F2P, payment or grinding for battle wins expected, as usual. All your heroes lose life force during the battles, and it can be gained only with time - or with the health packs->donations. So if you want a long games, prepare to pay. For me and my half-hour sessions it's all right.The game have quite a big amount of NPC-grinding locations, but most challenges came from PvP battles in special events. Unfortunately, most of time (but not always) it means losing. For my non-buffed heroes one-two battles per day is manageable, but rarely more. But as rewards are much bigger than loses, nothing to complain for me. If I cannot kill today's enemies, I'll farm NPC instead.Bottom line: good PQ-like game for 20-30 minutes per day. Can be frustrating for longer.			"

												f2p which is too bad because it could have been a really good Puzzle Quest single player game.  A better attempt at a true sequel to the first puzzle quest than Space Quest or Puzzle Quest 2.  The micro transactions ruin it however.  I will mention that the saves are local though...so yeah.

												~100 hours for this game. Recent patches made it a disaster. When earlier it could be both casual and competitive at the same time, now its gone worse than pay2win, it made a severe turn for pay2play. In tournaments the rich get richer and new players get f***** up real good. Earlier the developers were co-operative with the community and the game was fun and even a newcomer could make a significant impact on the tournament standings and get some awesome rewards.Don't you worry! the game has microtransactions and you will NEED to spend money on this monstrosity in order to progress or get any rankings in the tournaments.Balancing has gone a rough way, the first big changes to characters came up from nowhere dimilishing their potential entirely. Once a overused always seen char went to plain common or even bad, changes just were too radical and unexpected. The most balancing issue was doubling the common booster prices and making the best boosts costing in-game currency which is nearly impossible to get without spending real money, so... want to fight with the best ways? Okay, go ahead and pay 50cents for each fight, doesnt sound bad? Yeah for the most part you will need at least 40 matches in a tournament to get to the good positions, thats like 20 bucks for simply trying to play the game! Character's skills can also be boosted! only 3-20$ for each cover which you need 15 in order to make one of your characters most useful, not mentioning the huge money drop (a ridicilous amount needed) for boosting it's levels.TL;DR Once a fun and an exciting game 5/5 went to greedy as ♥♥♥♥ microtransactions simply for playing the game, dont even consider supporting the developers. As a free to play -player you cant get anything done.			"

												This has major stability issues.  It's gotten somewhat better since it reached release edition, but I've been on Pyweek teams that wrote more complicated games in a week than this without stability issues.I very much want to recommend this game, and have enjoyed most of my 500 hours in it, but until the game stops crashing of its own volition or such crashes stop counting against the player, I can't do so.

												About 85 hours worth of entertainment and not 1 penny spent. I'd like to continue playing on a regular basis, but I have beaten 100% of the prologue and there is no more story. I managed to max out 2 characters, but because of the randomness of the covers you win, it's difficult to focus your efforts on any one character other than the beginning ones. I'll continue to check the weekly (or whatever) events, but even those I can only play so far into before it becomes impossibly difficult to continue (without spending copious amounts of money to upgrade). There are a lot of issues with the setup of the game, but for the most part, there are worse ways to kill time.			"

												The original Puzzle Quest games are good, but this version with all my favorite Marvel heroes had got to be one of the better ones I've played. Yes there are lots of people who write reviews saying that ""There's not many characters to play with"" or ""Only the people who want to spend money actually do good"". Well they're fairly full of it. Yes, I can agree that there aren't very many heroes to play as but this is because the game isn't fully completed yet, it's still an ""Early Access"" as Steam would call it, except that every feature is added into the game so Steam doesn't, but the game is constantly being updated with more and more heroes, at the time I'm posting this the game just added the characters Wolverine(Patch) and the God of War, Ares. So people who say there aren't many heroes should just be patient and wait. To those of you who wouldn't download this free game because only the pay to play win, don't worry! You start the game with a couple of heroes and it places you into other game matches with players ranked similarly to you so you won't have a level 6 Iron Man character against a level 141 Hulk, (Hulk wins hands down), and you still have a team of 3 heroes to work with so really, the pay to play win better heroes, but the free to play players can slowly fight players like themselves and get stronger starter heroes and eventually stronger better heroes, like the Hulk or Captain America (Personal Favorite). So the pay to play can get better heroes faster, but honestly spending all the money on a CHANCE to get better heroes faster isn't really worth it.Myself and a couple of friends play this game and we all stronly recommend it, and we all haven't spent a dime and already have powerful heroes and can easily beat the ""Pay to play powerhouses"". So don't fear and download this game for a wonderful take on the Marvel Universe!			"

Missions that are listed as ""easy"" or ""normal"" I'm losing repeatedly, because the oppositions ""powers"" are 1) way too cheap on AP 2) way to damaging for the cost 3) non-named opponents gain AP too quickly.

												This is a fun, free-to-play take on the Puzzle Quest paradigm set in the Marvel universe with most of its most popular characters.  It is designed for bite-size chunks, and offers a lot of progression both in building up individual characters and in building up your roster giving you new options and new combinations to try out.There is a lot of noise and anger within the community here on Steam involving a recent change to healing characters that now keeps people from endlessly grinding out events.  I am adding this review primarily to wholeheartedly disagree with their viewpoint.  Before the healing change, I was about ready to give up on the game.  I have played for a while, and my roster was filled out and developed pretty nicely for a mostly-free player (I have spent some real money to expand my roster size faster, but never to get new characters or develop them -- the characters and XP equivalent come pretty quickly as you play so I never felt the need to spend money to accelerate that).  Unfortunately, I could never devote 8 or more hours a day to an event, so I never had a chance to win.  Players would grind out an event with their #1 best team of 3 characters until their health was low, then grind out a PvE level to heal those characters back to max, and then go back to grinding out the event again.  The enemy teams were almost always the three same characters, the winners' total scores were ridiculously high, and I was about done with the game.Enter the healing change -- any healing during a battle is now temporary to that battle (with a couple of exceptions that can only heal a character back to about 50% of his health).  Now, event winners must play with various combinations of characters and be better at the game (take less damage) than others, rather than simply spend more time than others on the game.  In my mind, this is a significant improvement to the game's health and will make things work much better in the long run.A final word about a game being 'pay2win' -- For most people, when you think of pay2win games, this references some item that gives a player an advantage that can only be bought with real money, not earned by playing the game.  This game includes NOTHING that fits that category.  There is absolutely nothing in the game that you cannot earn directly by playing the game.  The only reason I spent money on it at all was to support the developers for my time spent and because as a collector I wanted to hold on to all the characters I earned in game (they put a 7-day limit on adding a character to your roster to push for money to be spent there, but even the couple of times I lost a character by not adding them during this limit I have always gotten that character again down the road).  In any event, I only play at most about 10 characters, and I have been placing near the top more and more since this healing change occurred.  For reference, you can get 10 character slots with the free real-money currency you earn within the first month or so of playing.tl;dr -- This is a fun, well designed game, and the developers are thinking about the long-term health of the game with their decisions.  As in many free-to-play games, you must spend either money or time to advance and succeed, but both are viable options.  Additionally, you will need to play well and be smart with both your match-3 tactics and your roster decision strategies to have the best chance to succeed in the game and its events.  Thanks to the recent controversial change that many others complain about, you no longer need to devote 8+ hours a day during an event to have a chance to succeed.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign Marvel Puzzle Quest is the newest game in the Puzzle Quest line of games. This series has seen a lot of iterations and copycats over the years, with none being nearly as successful as the original title. This latest is an officially licensed Marvel title with the Puzzle Quest formula. It has the added benefit of being entirely free-to-play. You may of course purchase bonuses like any other free title, but these purchases are not required to play the full game. Is this latest attempt at a Puzzle Quest success worth a look, or should you just let it speed by and fade into the distance? Keep reading, perhaps I can help you decide.  To begin with, the Marvel universe has been utilized pretty well here. You have a team of three characters, each with three possible powers to be used. Typically you begin with one of these powers and you must find comic covers of the character to unlock or upgrade said powers. This also allows you to level up your character a little bit more each time. It’s a system that constantly keeps you feeling like you’re making some kind of progress and it works very well. Winning battles and missions grants you rewards, randomized from a pool of up to four for each story mission, giving you reasons to play missions again and again until you’ve received every reward available. It’s structured remarkably well for any game, let alone a free-to-play title. It’s a nice change of pace to see a free game with a lot of effort put into it. The content level is more than a lot of full priced games have, and the developers deserve some credit for it.  The presentation is decent. Each character is represented by a comic book cover from any number of different Marvel universes, and has a full 3D model as well as a 2D comic profile. Everything is vibrant and colorful and stands out very well in a sea of photo-realistic browns and grays of more recent games. The music is a bit generic, but it’s suitable for a superhero game. There are lots of highs and thumping bass tracks to drive the combat forward. It can certainly get repetitive, but that’s what the volume slider in the options menu is for. Overall, it doesn’t detract from the experience any and fits in well enough that some may not really notice it. On to the meat of things; the gameplay! I’m pleased to say that the gameplay of Marvel Puzzle Quest is, well, fantastic to be perfectly honest with you. It is a very well implemented use of the Puzzle Quest formula with enough difference and excitement to stand well on its own feet. Each color is representative of one member of your team, and has an icon to indicate which member that is. Wolverine, for example, is represented by scratch marks across the gems, while Storm has lightning bolts. Each icon makes sense and stands out well, making it easy to determine who will be attacking. Collecting gems allows you to use character powers, which can drastically change the way a fight is going. More powerful abilities take more preparation time and cause severe damage, while less powerful abilities can be used more often but do less damage or have fewer utility effects attached. There is a story mode separated into four separate mission groups, which will last you a good number of hours to complete. There are also daily and weekly missions and a PVP mode to keep you playing as long as your interest remains. Each of these modes offers its own rewards and characters, and as a result each also adds a huge amount of content to the game.  As for the dreaded free-to-play purchased content that inevitably unbalances these games? Well…it is present, but it’s not nearly as bad as other games often are. You can purchase the two currencies present in the game in bulk quantities, and use those currencies to recruit more and rarer characters or power up your existing heroes. It does unbalance the multiplayer somewhat if you let it, but it’s not so bad that it ruins the game entirely in that department. In order to counter the unbalancing, you just have to search a bit harder for an opponent on the same level as you. It can definitely be a pain in the backside from time to time but it isn’t something that ruins the overall experience and shouldn’t keep you from giving the game a shot.Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign has far more content and playability than a free game should ever reasonably be expected to contain. If you let it, this game will suck you in and keep you playing into the wee hours of the morning without even realizing it. There are far worse ways you could be spending your free time. Don’t let the price tag fool you; this is one game that doesn’t skimp on the content just because it’s free of charge. Give it a shot and you might be pleasantly surprised. "

												I think the reviews for this game thus far have been a little harsh.  Yes, there are ample microtransactions, and at times you do feel like there's nothing to do if you want to recruit that rare hero card you just got, because there's no other way to expand your stable without spending coins bought with real money.However, its also not your average match 3 game.  The heroes have special attacks which use differing amounts of the gems you collect from matching them.  This means using more complicated gameplay than just matching tiles until one side emerges the victor.  Environment tiles add an additional layer of gameplay, but this game isn't the type you'll play all night, every night- and shouldn't be judged as such.  As a lover of marvel, I enjoy the variety of heroes they've incorporated so far and am looking forward to more.  I also think the artwork is nice, but do agree there is little feeling of story progression as you go from battle to battle.  All in all, I enjoy this game.  There are various improvements I could suggest, but instead I'll just log on from time to time, have a few fights and enjoy myself, level up my characters a bit with the currency I gain from my wins and then log back off and do something else.If you take offence at microtransactions then don't click the page with them on, but if you're a grown up and understand that the option is there but is by no means a neccessity, then by all means, give the game a try- it's worth a look if you're a fan of Marvel and match 3 games.

												I have been pretty addicted to this game, however I've been playing on my Android phone.  I wish I could link my progress with the PC version.  Anyhow, if you like match 3 games and Marvel, this is really a fun game.  It's rough at the start because you need to build up your characters, which you do by earning in-game currency.  Each character gets capped at a certain level until you essentially win another copy of that character.  You use those extra copies to boost their skills, which raises the level cap.  Once you get going, you can take part in global events that constantly pop in and drop out.  That's where you really earn some good loot.  It's a fun time-killer when you have five minutes to spare.  Check it out.			"

												Free to play, pay to win taken to the next level.-Pay money if you lose in a stage or wait until your characters recover, recovery time varies from minutes to HOURS!-To level up your characters and progress you need to pay money or be lucky with random drops-Unlocking hero skills can cost 110 Euros or take a lot of luckI was browsing through the f2p games for a bit and wanted a simple game to kill some time since i didn´t really felt like playing one of my games or wasting some time on the internet. That´s how i stumbled upon this seemingly innocent little puzzle game. I always liked superheroes and so i decided to give it a shot. But what was in store for me was actually just a really mean ways of grabbing money. Don´t get me wrong im more than willing to spend a few bucks on a f2p game if i get the feeling it´s a fun game and some real effort went into it. That´s also the reason i own some skins in League of Legends for example.But this here is just a tired puzzle game programmed to bring frustration. It´s hard to explain without having played it, but imagined that you feel cheated in many of the stages. Since there is no time limit you can and have to plan your moves and the basic concept of lining up 3 pieces of the same color can be expanded by planning where the remaining pieces will drop once you remove 3 of them. In some of the stages you are the only one directly moving pieces while the computer just adds pieces with certain effects that harm you, while in others the computer tries to remove pieces aswell. Now i put some planning into my moves trying to maximize the outcome and even chaining pieces and so on, but no matter what sometimes the computer just decides to drop the right pieces for your opponent deliberately. I know this might sound a little like a sore loser, but imagine you spend a few minutes thinking and you make a move that removes a lot of pieces via chains and then the computer just drops 5 pieces of the same color in his turn, dealing even more damage than you did.Ok, ok you might say this is where the difficulty comes from, but it´s just my subjective point of view that it feels incredibly cheap. Also this isn´t the real problem of the game, remember i said somthing about greed and pay to win. When you loose in a stage your heroes faint and will need time to recover after the battle. How long you might ask? How about 2 FU***** hours? Go do your laundry, plant a tree or beat up a hobo, because you will wait or pay. As you level up your heroes they gain more hitpoints but also if they die/faint in a battle it takes forever until you can use them again, unless you pay money... Wow this is farmville standard bulls*** and pretty much what totally kills the game for me.Of course you can own more heroes in case your team gets defeated but the number of heroes you can own/use is limited, how can you own more heroes? Find ingame currency after certain bossbattles or pay money. This ain´t so bad right? After i acquire a hero i´m all set, right? Nope. All the heroes need to level up before they are actually useful in a stage, they all start with low hitpoints and just 1 skill. Furthermore they have a maxlevel capacity of 6 out of let´s say 85, which means you can´t progress until you unlock their higher levels. They can gain maxlevels and skills by finding comicbookcovers after stages, or by buying them. More rare heroes are more powerful and more expensive and can be leveled up beyond the level of your weak starting heroes. Now lets calculate how much 1 hero costs. Assuming you are lucky and get a 3 star hero after buying a random cover for 2 Euros, let´s say Loki for example. Each of his 9 remaing skill points comes at a whooping 12 Euros, which means you would in theory spend 110 Euros on one playable character... wow just wow. For 110 Euros you can buy the lengendary edition of Skyrim... 3 times. Also don´t forget your stronger heroes still need to gain levels until they reach their unlocked maxlevel via Iso-8 but i spare you from calculating that aswell.I have no idea how IGN.com and the other fu**-ups that call themselves reviewers can find this scam of a game even playable, but i assume they haven´t even played it and just wrote whatever the developing company paid them to do.In my opionion you should stay as far away from this piece of sh** as possible.

												This is a frustrating game because there are so many parts of it that could be so good. But that was months ago for me and the longer I play and the longer I see what the devs are doing to the game the less I even enjoy the parts of it that I once did.  Nearly every change since I started playing has been for the worse.It lulls you into thinking that it might be easy or playable when you first start because the matchmaking and enemy difficulty seems to understand how to scale with you at that point but the longer you play the more all of that goes out the window. It becomes this banal uphill struggle for any foothold to just get a measly amount of ISO to level up. And that doesn't matter anyway, the better you do the harder they make they game so you'll do worse the next week until it evens out to just doing boringly.I did spend money on this game, not a lot but that's not the point. This isn't a pay to win game, I mean it could be but only if you put in hundreds of dollars but before an input of that size you're really not getting that much, if anything, out of putting money into this game, Maybe I'm wrong and all the people that seem to win every tournament or even any PvE event are putting money into the game but I don't think so, I just think they started earlier when there was less competition.That's all this game is, an endless and fruitless competition. I've gotten close to even winning a few tournaments but it was a really hollow thing to do that. You have to throw all your time and effort to come away with anything at all and if you play casually you'll get next to nothing because there is nothing outside of the prologue that isn't played against other people and unless you can throw hours and hours and hours a day into this game then past the prologue you'll just founder and flail.It might seem appealing now but don't bother. It will suck the marrow from your bones and leave you wishing you never started. Just go play some old Puzzle Quest games and look up some Marvel Trading cards online to look at, it won't be as enticing but at least it won't leave as bitter as I am at this mess of a game.			"

												It is a good enough game on mobile (although heavily laden with microtransactions). But without the ability to link Steam and mobile accounts, it makes little sense to play it on Steam, because of its on-off nature (play a bit, wait for heroes to heal up, play a bit), that doesn't work well on the PC (at least for me). Which is a shame, because having the bigger interface definitely makes the experience more easily manageable.			"

My one gripe is that the computer opponents are sometimes a little tricky - and that you don't get enough roster spots nor gold after beating enemies.			"

												Underwhelming. It LOOKS like the original Puzzle Quest, but it's nowhere near as good. There's no satisfying impact to making moves, no interesting metagame with items and skills, no strategy around what moves you leave available (enemies merely alter the board using resources that regenerate every turn rather than playing on it), nothing that made the original game great. To make matters worse, using abilities feels incredibly floaty and produces long, annoying cutscenes, earning new characters takes an eternity, and all of the great character building and strategy has been reduced down to ""pick three preset sets of skills"", with all passive boosts ripped out. Avoid this one.			"

Posted: August 5, 2014
												This is a fun, free-to-play take on the Puzzle Quest paradigm set in the Marvel universe with most of its most popular characters.  It is designed for bite-size chunks, and offers a lot of progression both in building up individual characters and in building up your roster giving you new options and new combinations to try out.There is a lot of noise and anger within the community here on Steam involving a recent change to healing characters that now keeps people from endlessly grinding out events.  I am adding this review primarily to wholeheartedly disagree with their viewpoint.  Before the healing change, I was about ready to give up on the game.  I have played for a while, and my roster was filled out and developed pretty nicely for a mostly-free player (I have spent some real money to expand my roster size faster, but never to get new characters or develop them -- the characters and XP equivalent come pretty quickly as you play so I never felt the need to spend money to accelerate that).  Unfortunately, I could never devote 8 or more hours a day to an event, so I never had a chance to win.  Players would grind out an event with their #1 best team of 3 characters until their health was low, then grind out a PvE level to heal those characters back to max, and then go back to grinding out the event again.  The enemy teams were almost always the three same characters, the winners' total scores were ridiculously high, and I was about done with the game.Enter the healing change -- any healing during a battle is now temporary to that battle (with a couple of exceptions that can only heal a character back to about 50% of his health).  Now, event winners must play with various combinations of characters and be better at the game (take less damage) than others, rather than simply spend more time than others on the game.  In my mind, this is a significant improvement to the game's health and will make things work much better in the long run.A final word about a game being 'pay2win' -- For most people, when you think of pay2win games, this references some item that gives a player an advantage that can only be bought with real money, not earned by playing the game.  This game includes NOTHING that fits that category.  There is absolutely nothing in the game that you cannot earn directly by playing the game.  The only reason I spent money on it at all was to support the developers for my time spent and because as a collector I wanted to hold on to all the characters I earned in game (they put a 7-day limit on adding a character to your roster to push for money to be spent there, but even the couple of times I lost a character by not adding them during this limit I have always gotten that character again down the road).  In any event, I only play at most about 10 characters, and I have been placing near the top more and more since this healing change occurred.  For reference, you can get 10 character slots with the free real-money currency you earn within the first month or so of playing.tl;dr -- This is a fun, well designed game, and the developers are thinking about the long-term health of the game with their decisions.  As in many free-to-play games, you must spend either money or time to advance and succeed, but both are viable options.  Additionally, you will need to play well and be smart with both your match-3 tactics and your roster decision strategies to have the best chance to succeed in the game and its events.  Thanks to the recent controversial change that many others complain about, you no longer need to devote 8+ hours a day during an event to have a chance to succeed.			"

												It's simply match 3 puzzle game with heavy Puzzle quest-like design and rather poor progression system. If you enjoy playing Puzzle quest, you will find this game rather bland and annoying since powers and level system are heavily influenced by game economy, not usual RPG leveling system. You fight enemies, collect in-game money (is-8), buy a character pack, use it to upgrade your existing power (or add a new one) and level your character (which also use is-8). It's overly grinding system which demands about 600-700 in-game currency per level. Your average payout from early level is around 20 per fight. Not really good here. Despite the fact that there are bonuses resources for each stage you can collect, you are likely to get frustrate once these bonuses are gone.Your roster of heroes is also limited and premium currency is require to unlock more slots. If you're casual player, it's fine. If you're a collector, this will frustrate you a lot. However, this is one aspect that many F2P games use as an income generator and I'm quite OK with it.The gameplay itself is rather bland if you compare it to Puzzle quest. Match 3 blocks and collect colors to unleash your power upon the board (or the enemies). However, each hero has 3 uncustomizable powers and that means you need more to make use of all colors - the first four characters are quite balanced in term of color usage and power design. At least you won't get shred to pieces during the beginning of the game.Also, PvP section should be avoided unless you feel like spending money. If you are new to the genre (is there anyone ""new"" to puzzle game?)  and enjoy collecting large roster of heroes - you are welcome to play it. However, I suggest playing for a while before spending any money (I play it for a day befoe writing the review and spend most of it waiting for my toons to recover ). A 5/10 for me.			"

												Yes it's very much in beta, but you would be better off playing Marvel Heroes (especially if you've bought any of their DLC) rather than paying for it again in, what is, just Bejeweled with power-ups and a simple story attached.That said, if you treat it as a game you spend a few minutes in? It will be an okay, but not great, experience.  I have to wonder how many children with a Steam account would play this though because, as I see it, anyone who is 15 years old and above would see through the transparent nature of the game and be against these kind of microtransactions from the get-go.  Then again, there are those who are playing Hearthstone and buying card packs for that...so no doubt there are some that will buy for this too.In any event, right now I couldn't recommend this game.  Something to revisit in a few months perhaps, just to see if there have been any improvements.			"

												I really enjoy waiting for an hour between rounds while my characters heal... It's bearable at the start when it takes a couple minutes and you can play a few rounds, but it gets steadily worse. The difficulty curve is sharp after the introduction missions, that factor combined with the RNG bejeweled style board means that you'll be watching your heal timer a lot after a failed mission. The demand for cash from D3 publisher is inescapable if you actually want to play the game at any level of efficiency you might need to throw cash at this game. The game gets a plus for having fun game play mixed with Marvel characters, but there are just too many drawbacks to make this game worth recommending. There is a loose RPG system in which you level up characters by collecting comic books, but it's marred by the fact that it too is RNG based (unless you use money).  Some iconic characters are given to you at the start of the game, but everything you get afterwards is all random and the majority of heroes I've received thus far are terrible or useless. You need to continually advance in the game if you desire better rewards, but any impression of success is stymied when you get your seventh 'Hawk-Eye' in a row or some equally as rage worthy hero thanks to the RNG rewards. This game would be much better if there was a way to slowly work towards a hero comic that compliments your roster, one that you can chose and grind towards. Success would feel much better and the grind would be worth the effort if you could finally piece together your Marvel Dream Team and smite some foes with righteous fury. Instead you're forced to use valuable experience, recruitment tokens, and gold to expand your roster never knowing who you're going to get. I've got a 5/5/- black widow and I just keep getting her comic books, it's driving me insane...The gameplay is a bit stiff in comparison to previous iterations of the PQ franchise and some attack animations are slow and repetitive. The graphics aren't anything to write home about and everything just feels slow. This game is a step backwards in almost every area and far too frustrating to be worth time or money. Just get Puzzle Quest 2 and enjoy that game, this debacle doesn't do the franchise justice and is a blemish on an otherwise amazing series of games.			"

If you hope to max out your heroes and keep up with the ever growing roster be prepared to spend even more money (100 dollars is not nearly enough to max out a decent character's level). Unfortunately this is not a game I would ever recommend to any sane person. The costs are just too high and the returns too low. When, if ever, the pay to win mechanic is removed this could easily be one of the better puzzle rpgs. Until then stay far away. Marvel Puzzle Quest is a huge disappointment.			"

												A surprisingly great match 3 game that has a good story along with all of your favorite Marvel heroes. You can (via collecting in game cards through playing the game, or if you really want, by paying REAL money) play as pretty much anyone in the Marvel universe. Daken? sure. Black Widow (I and II) not a problem! paperbag wearing Spider-Man? Yep, he's there too.Play the story, or compete against other players teams, the choice is yours! And when your heroes get beaten up and need a  health replenish, either use an in game health pack (you can win them in game or buy them, your choice) or just play another game for an hour while they recharge their batteries, ready for another fight.It's not a pay to play game, I've put a good few hours into the game and have not spent a penny. If you enjoy match three puzzle games and are looking for something to play to kill a few minutes here and there, you could do a lot worse than Marvel Puzzle Quest.			"

But that was months ago for me and the longer I play and the longer I see what the devs are doing to the game the less I even enjoy the parts of it that I once did.  Nearly every change since I started playing has been for the worse.It lulls you into thinking that it might be easy or playable when you first start because the matchmaking and enemy difficulty seems to understand how to scale with you at that point but the longer you play the more all of that goes out the window. It becomes this banal uphill struggle for any foothold to just get a measly amount of ISO to level up.

												Same addicting puzzle quest gameplay from the origional with a superhero twist. It's exactly what it advertises puzzle quest with marvel characters. It has a slow curve to get a competive set of heroes (think special moves if you've played the origional puzzle quest). But it's loads of fun! "

Being able to collect certain characters & upgrade them with other features & rewards while you battle your enemy with quick thinking & power ups. This game can easily replace those games people are addicted to like that candy crush stuff on facebook.			"

												I find this game relaxing.  It's a solid ""match 3"" puzzle game at the core with Marvel characters duking it out using special attacks based on which characters you've chosen and which colors you're matching.  It's not as good as the original puzzle quest and has almost no story content but the varied character match ups are pretty fun.			"

												I think the reviews for this game thus far have been a little harsh.  Yes, there are ample microtransactions, and at times you do feel like there's nothing to do if you want to recruit that rare hero card you just got, because there's no other way to expand your stable without spending coins bought with real money.However, its also not your average match 3 game.  The heroes have special attacks which use differing amounts of the gems you collect from matching them.  This means using more complicated gameplay than just matching tiles until one side emerges the victor.  Environment tiles add an additional layer of gameplay, but this game isn't the type you'll play all night, every night- and shouldn't be judged as such.  As a lover of marvel, I enjoy the variety of heroes they've incorporated so far and am looking forward to more.  I also think the artwork is nice, but do agree there is little feeling of story progression as you go from battle to battle.  All in all, I enjoy this game.  There are various improvements I could suggest, but instead I'll just log on from time to time, have a few fights and enjoy myself, level up my characters a bit with the currency I gain from my wins and then log back off and do something else.If you take offence at microtransactions then don't click the page with them on, but if you're a grown up and understand that the option is there but is by no means a neccessity, then by all means, give the game a try- it's worth a look if you're a fan of Marvel and match 3 games.

It's a game of matchup,  where matches damage the enemy and build access to bonuses.  New heroes are buyable as you progress.  Since it is a F2P game,  the catch is that if you want to heal or progress faster, you have to pay.  A good mind exercise for the day. :)			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is, at the core, a pretty fun experience. There are quite a few characters to aquire for your team (a number which continues to grow as the developers add more characters to the game) and they generally come with unique play mechanics that make certain combinations more effective than others.Characters aside, however, this game falls off the bus very quickly. The game is inaccurately marketed as free to play when, in fact, the only players who will realisitcally be competitive in tournaments or see the end of the single player campaign are the ones who have shelled out anywhere between 50-100 dollars. If you hope to max out your heroes and keep up with the ever growing roster be prepared to spend even more money (100 dollars is not nearly enough to max out a decent character's level). Unfortunately this is not a game I would ever recommend to any sane person. The costs are just too high and the returns too low. When, if ever, the pay to win mechanic is removed this could easily be one of the better puzzle rpgs. Until then stay far away. Marvel Puzzle Quest is a huge disappointment.			"

												This game is Marvel vs. Capcom meets Bejeweled. Its a match 3 game with 3v3 combat. There are 6 colored jewels and environmental tiles. Match 3 of a color to acquire AP of said color. Your Heros use the AP for special abilities. The strategy in this game comes from setting up a team of 3 with synergistic abilities. You want to be able to utilize all 6 colors and you dont want one hero out too long or they will take too much damage.DIfferent types of challenges require different strategies. Some PC villians use tiles with count down timers. You have to eliminate or delay those tiles with your abilities or take massive cascades of damage. Other times you have to acquire certain colors to keep them away from villians in a turn based game play. You can use AP as you acquire it or save it to combine multiple abilities in board clearing strategies that will allow you to play above your character level.Overall this game has a depth that is surprising and exceeds its genre. Start free to play and then decide if its worth investing.			"

												Overwhelmingly Pay to Win type of game, you'll have to put up with being beaten repeatedly over and over and over in the PVP setup before you can hope to win anything to start putting up a fight. A number of messages in game are misleading, including in PVP where it states that you will not lose health from retreating but you end up always with at least one of the team members dead.Interesting concept, but the Pay To Play features make sure that you'll be in the Navy Man's Barrel for a very very long time.

												I love the Puzzle Quest games. So naturally I also loved this new entry based on the Marvel comics. And in a way I do. But it just feels so cheap, and all because it's free. The character designs are well done and if you've played one of the previous PQ games you most definitely know how they play and this one is no different. It's once again all about matching gems. Which is fun obviously.But unlocking new characters, powers and upgrades take a lot of time and you'll be replaying a lot of battles to earn these rewards... or you can use real life currency to save time, which is ridiculous if you ask me. I'm aware of the fact that I own a lot of games and they've cost me tons of money but one thing I will rarely do (never say never) is pay for in-game content. And yes, DLC is a whole different story. But less of a scam because some of it can be truly impressive. But I'm losing focus here.The text in the text bubbles is gigantic which annoyed me. Replaying the levels many times over to get the proper rewards annoyed me. The fact that you can skip through these steps as long as you are willing to spend money on it annoyed me. And it's such a shame, because it can really be a fun game once you're playing a battle.It's free so it's hard to not recommend this game, right ? But I just can't. I can't. Buy PQ2 instead and witness a truly magnificent game. You won't be disappointed.[Rating: 76/100]			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest (MPQ), is a mobile device port for steam. Is that necessarily a bad thing? I don't think so, but it is something that you need to keep in mind when looking at the UI and graphics. It also effects the pay system, and since this is a F2P game, that's something people tend to focus on. So let's start there:Can you play MPQ without spending money? Yes. Will you be competitive... well, mostly. Let's talk about what real money gets used for: You can purchase the two types of in-game currency with real money. ISO and Gold. ISO is used, mainly, to purchase boosts for use during combat and to spend to level up your characters. It is the common currency of the game and is earned pretty easily. Gold can be used for a number of things. You can purchase additional slots to hold more characters (you are limited to 4 characters at the start and the prices for additional slots increases the more you have), you can purchase some ""super-boosts"", you can purchase health packs, and you can purchase additional covers for your characters. Do you ""have"" to purchase these things? Nope. You do earn some gold through normal game play, and many people (myself included) have found that if you focuse your purchases you don't really hit a wall for a very long time.Let's move onto the gameplay itself. MPQ is a tile matching game that is themed around the Marvel Comic Universe. You swap tiles on a grid board to make 3 or longer chains of the same color/shape (think Bejewelled), you then score a hit dealing damage and (in most cases) generated Ability Points (AP) of that color. Each character that you have selected (three) will have different abilities both passive and active. These abilities are often fuelled by the AP you generate from your matches. Pretty simple. There is an entertaining amount of depth in selecting which team you want to bring to an event, and finding good synergy between character abilities is important.The characters are leveled up by unlocking their skills. Skills are found by getting random drop ""Covers"". Each cover has one skill associated with it. Once you have used that cover to train the character in that skill it will increase the ""Current Max Level"" of the character, you can then use ISO to increase the level of the character. Every level increase raises the max Hit Points of the character, the amount of damage they do and the effectivness of their skills. Once you have unlocked the first level of the skill you can use Gold to increase the skill level (this is the main form of Pay-to-Win that you see in the game, but is limited by the fact that you have to have the base skill first to buy it).Health of your characters is the delaying factor in playing. Not only are you doing damage to your enemies, but they are doing damage to your characters as well. Their health will increase back to max over time, but with high level characters this can take several hours. If you take your three best characters into a match that is over their head and get them all killed, this can mean that you don't get to play again for a few hours... unless you use Health Packs. Health packs allow a character to return to full health immediately. You earn health packs over time, one every 30 minutes, but could buy additionals for Gold.The game provides some basic ""PVE"" missions to get a feel for the game and earn some basic covers and boosts, but the main part of the game that allows you to progress is the ""PVP"" duels and ""PVE"" events. Events rotate every few days and give opportunities for rare and high end rewards, but competition can be tough and some events require having certain characters to participate. Duels are a staple way to put your team against another player. The duels aren't really PVP though, because the same AI that runs the normal missions just uses the team, not an actual player.Long and the short of it: I find MPQ to be very entertaining, something that I have spent many an hour with and am perfectly happy to keep playing. There are issues, some bugs that break events and some exploits that people have found that can let them rank up super fast, and there are concerns about Pay-To-Win, but overall I can say that if you are looking for a casual time waster, this does the job rather well.

												This game is a extremely greedy  to even stand a slim chance of winning a rare card.  Even if your lucky enough to get one you need to pay for another spot to store it on your roster or sell  one your using and each rare has 2 or 3 powers so you need to match it at least 1 time to get the other power..good luck  even on their so called special chances the odds usually are around 1.5% if even that (common heroes odds are around 7%) rare rates are at 0.6% to 0.3% I kid you not always check the ? found somewhere on the picture of the recuitment deal.Even if you manage to join a decent guild and win you find the rewards only semi rare unless you place number 1 or 2 among thousands oh yeah another invisable girl or ms marvel but where is gamorea fury and luke cage.    ps there is no card trading which could have made this game slightly more playable			"

												Avoid like the plauge, you're better off playing regular, vanilla puzzle quest rather than this cheap attempt at drainying your wallet dry. Crappy interface, unoptimised graphics, grindy events and DLC that's £75.99. Really? DLC so expensive you might as well buy 1-3 games for that money.			"

												The game is simple and entertaining for a little bit.  However, if you choose not to spend money, then prepare to hit the wall of boredom with this title pretty quick.  Also, the idea of using ""tactics"" in this game is laughable.  When your opponent gets a lucky drop or two you will wind up losing fast.  Then you either have to use heals on your heroes or wait many hours for them to be healed again.  No thanks.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest (MPQ), is a mobile device port for steam. Is that necessarily a bad thing? I don't think so, but it is something that you need to keep in mind when looking at the UI and graphics. It also effects the pay system, and since this is a F2P game, that's something people tend to focus on. So let's start there:Can you play MPQ without spending money? Yes. Will you be competitive... well, mostly. Let's talk about what real money gets used for: You can purchase the two types of in-game currency with real money. ISO and Gold. ISO is used, mainly, to purchase boosts for use during combat and to spend to level up your characters. It is the common currency of the game and is earned pretty easily. Gold can be used for a number of things. You can purchase additional slots to hold more characters (you are limited to 4 characters at the start and the prices for additional slots increases the more you have), you can purchase some ""super-boosts"", you can purchase health packs, and you can purchase additional covers for your characters. Do you ""have"" to purchase these things? Nope. You do earn some gold through normal game play, and many people (myself included) have found that if you focuse your purchases you don't really hit a wall for a very long time.Let's move onto the gameplay itself. MPQ is a tile matching game that is themed around the Marvel Comic Universe. You swap tiles on a grid board to make 3 or longer chains of the same color/shape (think Bejewelled), you then score a hit dealing damage and (in most cases) generated Ability Points (AP) of that color. Each character that you have selected (three) will have different abilities both passive and active. These abilities are often fuelled by the AP you generate from your matches. Pretty simple. There is an entertaining amount of depth in selecting which team you want to bring to an event, and finding good synergy between character abilities is important.The characters are leveled up by unlocking their skills. Skills are found by getting random drop ""Covers"". Each cover has one skill associated with it. Once you have used that cover to train the character in that skill it will increase the ""Current Max Level"" of the character, you can then use ISO to increase the level of the character. Every level increase raises the max Hit Points of the character, the amount of damage they do and the effectivness of their skills. Once you have unlocked the first level of the skill you can use Gold to increase the skill level (this is the main form of Pay-to-Win that you see in the game, but is limited by the fact that you have to have the base skill first to buy it).Health of your characters is the delaying factor in playing. Not only are you doing damage to your enemies, but they are doing damage to your characters as well. Their health will increase back to max over time, but with high level characters this can take several hours. If you take your three best characters into a match that is over their head and get them all killed, this can mean that you don't get to play again for a few hours... unless you use Health Packs. Health packs allow a character to return to full health immediately. You earn health packs over time, one every 30 minutes, but could buy additionals for Gold.The game provides some basic ""PVE"" missions to get a feel for the game and earn some basic covers and boosts, but the main part of the game that allows you to progress is the ""PVP"" duels and ""PVE"" events. Events rotate every few days and give opportunities for rare and high end rewards, but competition can be tough and some events require having certain characters to participate. Duels are a staple way to put your team against another player. The duels aren't really PVP though, because the same AI that runs the normal missions just uses the team, not an actual player.Long and the short of it: I find MPQ to be very entertaining, something that I have spent many an hour with and am perfectly happy to keep playing. There are issues, some bugs that break events and some exploits that people have found that can let them rank up super fast, and there are concerns about Pay-To-Win, but overall I can say that if you are looking for a casual time waster, this does the job rather well.

												This game is a extremely greedy  to even stand a slim chance of winning a rare card.  Even if your lucky enough to get one you need to pay for another spot to store it on your roster or sell  one your using and each rare has 2 or 3 powers so you need to match it at least 1 time to get the other power..good luck  even on their so called special chances the odds usually are around 1.5% if even that (common heroes odds are around 7%) rare rates are at 0.6% to 0.3% I kid you not always check the ? found somewhere on the picture of the recuitment deal.Even if you manage to join a decent guild and win you find the rewards only semi rare unless you place number 1 or 2 among thousands oh yeah another invisable girl or ms marvel but where is gamorea fury and luke cage.    ps there is no card trading which could have made this game slightly more playable			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest (in general, mobile and Steam) is nothing more than a petty rich get richer pyramid scheme. People who played from day one got to cruise to a cushy position for free and they are inoculated to the countless nerfs and adjustments that hurt new to mid range players in a petty attempt to force them to pay money for what others got for free just months before. Some fall into the trap and pay while others just tell everyone they know at how (supposedly) great the game is to flood the leaderboards with noobs so that they will be elevated into the top 10% more easily. Everything about the game is catered towards paying to overcome those who had it easier than you because they started at a higher tier in the pyramid scheme.The steam version has several advantages over the mobile version, but with a single colossal flaw. By virtue of having more space the in game interface is vastly superior to the hyper-compact view on mobile. The perpetual link to the server forces the battery to drain 8-12X regular drain rate on mobile, which is not a problem on Steam given that we have that constant connection anyway and we are generally plugged in to a power source that will charge faster than it will drain. The problem is that Facebook cannot be synced, so you cannot carry over your mobile save data to your Steam version. This mortal sin is making me uninstall. 0 out of 100 "

												I love the Puzzle Quest games. So naturally I also loved this new entry based on the Marvel comics. And in a way I do. But it just feels so cheap, and all because it's free. The character designs are well done and if you've played one of the previous PQ games you most definitely know how they play and this one is no different. It's once again all about matching gems. Which is fun obviously.But unlocking new characters, powers and upgrades take a lot of time and you'll be replaying a lot of battles to earn these rewards... or you can use real life currency to save time, which is ridiculous if you ask me. I'm aware of the fact that I own a lot of games and they've cost me tons of money but one thing I will rarely do (never say never) is pay for in-game content. And yes, DLC is a whole different story. But less of a scam because some of it can be truly impressive. But I'm losing focus here.The text in the text bubbles is gigantic which annoyed me. Replaying the levels many times over to get the proper rewards annoyed me. The fact that you can skip through these steps as long as you are willing to spend money on it annoyed me. And it's such a shame, because it can really be a fun game once you're playing a battle.It's free so it's hard to not recommend this game, right ? But I just can't. I can't. Buy PQ2 instead and witness a truly magnificent game. You won't be disappointed.[Rating: 76/100]			"

												I went into this game knowing very well, that ""free to play"" usually means ""pay to win"". Still this game made me angry! Why?First off: The base game is great! It's the standard puzzle quest game play. Basically a two player Bejewelled, where each player has life points and each match-3 (or more) is an attack which  reduces the opponents life points. In this game you play a team of 3 classic Marvel heroes and villains, from the starter Iron Man to Spider Man to Doctor Doom. Each has up to three special abilities, which are quite varied. The abilities are fueled with the tiles you matched up.So far, pretty classic puzzle quest. And overall that's done pretty well and is fun to play.What's no fun is everything around it: You get heroes and abilities by gathering ""covers"". You sometimes get them during the single player campaign or during the so called ""player vs player"" events. It's pseudo PvP really, since the oponent is controlled by the AI, there is no way to customize your team and there is no in-game way of communication except via Steam itself. And even then, there is no way to challenge a specific player.Since it's ""free to play"" you can also get covers by spending one of the two in-game currencies, which can be bought in the shop or found by playing: Iso-8 crystals and hero points. The former can be used to level up your heroes or buy the cheapest ones. The latter one can be used to buy the better ones or buy an additional slot for a hero. The heroes are distributed into four categories, 1-star to 4-star, and usually you can get multiple versions of the same character in the different categories. The better the category, the more powerful they can become.To learn a new ability or to make one more powerful, you need to find the cover of the exact hero with that exact ability on it. And did I mention, that you can't choose specific heroes in the shop? Instead you buy them as a kind of booster pack of one. Or you buy them as a booster of 10 and are guaranteed one specific hero. However those are usually even more expensive than the single boosters.And that's basically the problem of the whole game: You have no control what you get, and that little you get is very, very expensive. And don't get me started if you actually plan to spend money on this game: You can actually get the 2 weakest character covers for 50 hero points each. The ""cheapest"" amount to buy is 200 hero points for 1,49€, so about 0,40€ per cover. You need about 10 to fully power one of them up. This is 4,00€ for a full power character. And that's the weakest ones! It only get's more expensive from here! Sure, you can get a whole lot of hero points for about 70€. But I would never spend so much money on a match-3 game. Especially since you can get the original Puzzle Quests for at most 20€ here on Steam. And even if you spens so much, it only gives a discount of about 50%!  What makes me angry, is that the developers are greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and very obvious about it. Play, if you don't want to spend money, but if you do want to spend: spend it for the originals! "

												In a nutshell, its a bad match 3 game as far as the match 3 is concerend, theres just too many varients of the gems and there arnt enough rows or columns...most of the time there is just one move you can make, rarely you can set up a good move with a cascade...the game is about 90% based on your characters, their skills, and building the resources via matching colors.Youll immediately get stung by the old school ""whale RMT"" mechanics that goes after wallet warriors to compete.  Your instinct will be to drop a small amount of money, which youll spend on the wrong stuff (hero tokens) which will cause you to need to buy more slots (the ONLY thing you should be buying).  Youll get a high level hero, think youve won, then realize it ruins your scaling.You need a LOT of hero slots, and those slots are expensive, the rest of the RMT is 100% RNG.  Rather than making an item you can buy to upgrade your heroes, which are seperated by tier, same skills though just higher level cap, they make the hero RNG the same as the skill upgrades.  So youll need many rare hero covers to upgrade that higher level hero and actually have skills, which are more important than good match 3 luck/skill.That one star or two star hero with all its skills unlocked and upgrade potential is far better than the uber rare hero you just unlocked basically...this isnt told to you early on...and its why most of the complaints are about the cash shop..they set you up to fail in this manner, which means...pull that wallet out...you get very little for your money as well (dont even get me started on ISO the material needed to level up, which you can only do after upgrading a skill via rolling another hero cover of the same tier which may or may not be the specific skill you need or want to upgrade)...you can see how it gets fustrating.Not paying money your able to clear the tutorial pve, then youll be stuck doing one daily and not much else to do for a decent amount of time.The game floods you with low tier covers, that eventually you sell off...and are sort of worthless beyond early game.Alliances are either 100% dead or overly competative with high expectations on participation, youll only be able to join with an expensive roster of high teir heroes upgraded fully...which takes ages for free or costs a hell of a lot of money.I drew the line at $20, opened a ton of slots, got a few ""decent"" heroes ill probably never find an upgrade for...but come in handy for pve events where characters are powered up (if you have that specific hero) if you dont its more or less a diceroll if youll get stomped and need to log out for an hour or two, or win and have taken so much damage youll need to log out for an hour or two...damage carries over and heals slowly over time or use a heal pack which drop from pve sometimes or pay up.Im stuck in a between spot on progression, much like if you dont pay early on...i log in to see if the events are for any heroes i have, if so i play them, if not i realize theres very little i can get done in a day.  WHen you realize most rewards are a token amount of ISO (like 250-500 when you need 30k to level a hero) it gets tedious... When you keep getting the same cover for the same hero who has that same skill already maxed, rather than ANYTHING else..it gets old...far too much RNG here...seperate hero characters from skills and just put in a skill upgrade token so we can make use of all our heroes....it makes rare heros almost worthless since youll never be able to upgrade them.Just do yourself a favor, dont bother with the game, if you need to....dont pay...see that progression wall? $20 will get you maybe 10 more hours of play until you hit it again, your rewards wont increase much because of it, and dont even think about competing....for a pve event i was ranked #1 for about 8hours (got lucky and i had all essential heros who were boosted) with 20min left on the event i was pretty far ahead, out of content to do for rewards and points donwscale with repetition...i was done but sure i was going to win some decent rewards (well maybe 500 more ISO than had i just participated and not competed and a chance at a rare hero)  i ended up ranking 38th in that 20min...not that i noticed much via reward...but it was like why did i even bother? 500 iso and a standard token for a low tier hero (one star storm or juggernaught it seems is the 99% on their RNG not worth the iso to upgrade for me)If you can play a few hours every day, and play EVERY day, eventually youll build up a decent roster, with some luck at least...and were talking over months...otherwise pay up big...and even then its a pretty boring game.Oh and the pvp isnt pvp...your playing an AI during it...Also the match 3 mixed with their skill system is extremely fustrating, many skills wont work unless they sit on the board for a few turns, and it seems the AI is really...REALLY...lucky on cascades and skills that randomly destroy tiles that always include your big skill that was going to go off next turn...however when the AI does similair it will be on a tile you cannot possibly touch...you you need to choose a character that can accurately destroy rows (hawkeye) which is kinda lame.If you plan to play 30 min to an hour a day, dont mind long slow progression, and will play for many months...youll get some fun out of it if youve never played a proper match 3 game...otherwise...get a real match 3 game...ironcast is far more entertianing and way less over the long run.Oh and i want to be very clear on their terrible scaling system.  Basically if you open a token and get a high tier character, the game assumes you have all high skill characters, fully upgraded, even if its just one and you have just one upgraded skill.  The game is VERY dependant on skills to progress you cannot compete on just match 3 damage alone.  Having one lv70 character means your lower tier heros fully upgraded at lv50 wont be able to hang in the events, which is how you progress and earn more tokens and coin rewards for more slots.  Your option is to delete the rare hero or struggle to do anything.  You have to horde tokens for months before you should actually open them, something not explained to new players and the most common cause of game fustration.  Typically you only find this out after spending money, or getting lucky on a reward token....youll realize this when you cant progress in an event for coin and tokens because the enemy level is too high for all but one character...and that one character cant carry without a full skill slot as youll be doing match 3 damage for most of the match.  If you play for free or dont want to spend hundreds of dollars...dont open anything other than a standard low tier token and make sure you have like 20-30 slots which will takes many months of free play or about $100....and why have that many slots if you dont have characters to fill them.  The sheer number of heroes means youll be at RNG's mercy to get duplicates, and not just duplicates of rare heroes but ones with the right skills so you can win matches....its insane....			"

Posted: June 27, 2016
												I do like this game, in fact it is my favorite of all the Puzzle Quest and Bejewelled clone games, but I can not recommend it.First, what I love about this game. The powers. Collecting superheroes, each with their own unique powers to use during gameplay, is fun. And using said powers is easily the main draw to this game. And if that was all this game was, it would be an easy recommend to everyone. But unfortunately it's not. It will take a certain type of gamer to appreciate this game, due to the several hurdles said gamers will have to agree to live with.The cons. This is a very competitive game. As a player, you are expected to compete versus a thousand other players for any type of interesting reward. And you will fail. A lot! You would have to be willing to put in the time, LOTS OF TIME, to grow your collection of heroes, just to be able to compete. And even then, you will still lose. Mainly because winning matches is NOT the way to win the big rewards. Being the strongest (and lots of luck) is. And this is where my biggest complaint falls; this game rewards the older players. The rich get richer, while the poor struggle to survive.There are three areas of gameplay. The Prologue which is entirely single player and then there's the Stories and Versus which is where you will be spending all your time. It's probably best to choose one or the other to focus on for best results, but either way it's still very much an uphill battle. And either way it will be hours upon hours of grind to earn your tablescraps. The worst being how punishing the game can be to those who take a break from the game for severla hours (sleep, school, work, etc.) You can spend 23 hours fighting and securing a top place finish, just to have the rug swept out from under you in the last few minutes. Uncontrollably. Unless you pay.So now we get to the currency of the game. First there's ISO-8 which is fairly easy to come by and mainly used for levelling your heroes. Then there's Gold, which is much more difficult to earn and can be used for either shielding yourself in Versus Mode (which does NOT guarantee anything!) or for adding roster slots so you can collect more heroes to use. You can also spend ISO and Gold on covers (which you use to level hero powers or gain new heroes if you have the roster space.) I do NOT recommend doing so though, since you will gain more covers than you will gain roster slots, meaning a LOT of covers will be going to waste since they come with an experation date. Spend your Gold on roster spaceas and your ISO on levelling heroes and purchasing gameplay boosts to quicken battles. Also note, you will need a big roster because a lot of the Story campaigns will constantly be limitting which heroes you will be able to use.There's also in-game purchases, which I do NOT recommend. You can buy ISO-8 which would be a complete waste of money and also Gold which is much more useful, but I still don't recommend. I did purchase some Gold, but it was more due to wishing to support the game than because it was needed. There is also a new purchase called VIP which will give you daily rewards for a limited time. Browsing over the list of items didn't make it very appealing to me, though it is probably the best over-all deal. If you're looking for an early boost to your game, it would probably help. But again, NOT needed. The only real thing you can give this game is time. Lots and lots of time. A new annoyance though is the constant advertisement for the new VIP purchase though. Almost as bad as the Windows 10 pop-ups!Lastly, there are cheaters in this game. The good news is once found, they are moved to their own private servers. The bad news is before they're found, they will ruin your chances for decent rewards, collecting them for themselves (which is frustrating considering they don't need them because they can just cheat.) Almost every single Story and Versus campaign I've played, one or two of the top spots were filled with players who obviously couldn't be there by normal means. Not even with luck on their side. This is especially frustrating considering how much effort you will need to put into getting the meager spot you end up with.One last thing, this game punishes you for crashing. It doesn't matter if it's from bugs, freezing, crashing, or your internet connection. If you leave a battle it considers you a quiter and punishes you for it. I've even already won a battle, gained my rewards, and had my heroes damaged because of the game server acting up. Nothing on my end. And I've had several battles where the game forgets to shuffle the gems when there's no move, especially after a power is used. The only thing you can do is retreat and lose the battle, no matter how badly you were crushing the AI.So will I continue to play this game? Of course. I'm ""invested."" But don't follow my lead unless you're okay with what you're getting yourself into. This is NOT a casual, or friendly, game.			"

												On the surface, it looks like a fairly decent Puzzle Quest/Match 3 style game. But when you dig deeper you find that the game is designed to squeeze you for money every chance it gets. Your heroes' levels are capped by comic covers. The covers are mostly random, or hard to obtain. Plus, despite there being several different covers available, your slots to place them in are extremely limited. The Single-Player game will thus become overywhemling quickly, and stop providing you with any resources, forcing you into the special quests (which likewise dry up fast) or pvp. Those have exploitable methods to try to get more resources, but it becomes a frustrating game of retrying until you get a suitable opponent and then attacking. Not a lot of balance, difficult to advance, very hard on the wallet for a ""freemium"" game, just add up to a product that's best left avoided.This review is a repost of one I had made several months before, which appears to have been deleted in that when I visit the store page, it asks me to submit a review.  Though my old review was still listed in my profile.  Since the time of writing this, the developers implimented a change to the way healing was done in-game.  In order to play, you nead heroes who are healthy.  You can get health packs in game, that regenerate in time, or you can pay for them with the paid currency.  This is a tactic used in many Facebook games.  Simply put, it's a way to force you to constantly pay to keep playing.  And if you want to be ""competetive"", you must keep playing.  Limited time events, both PvE and PvP, require a lot of attention.  That you can't give them if you can't play.  Thus you can't earn the rewards from them.  And thus you fall further and further behind.  The change was that some characters had healing abilities in the game.  This effect let you continue to play, grind for what you needed in story mode etc.  The developers made the change that this in-game healing is temporary.  Once the battle was over, all the damage you received would be reapplied, sometimes killing your character.  Which meant, if you wanted to that character again, you needed to use a health pack.  Otherwise, you would rapidly run out of playable characters.To not believe the ""free to play"" tag on this game.  This game features the worst in the ""freemium"" market practices.  There are far, far better options out there, in both the ""match 3"" gameplay style, and in the Marvel theme.			"

												A very addictive match 3 game. Watch out though, This game can cost you money. The game starts with level 1 and 2 characters through the story mode and when you win you may be rewarded with new characters or power ups. The character will stay in your list if not given a space immediatly for 2 weeks. You do have the option of Joining an alliance which may benefit you for getting characters without buying spaces. I am not in an alliance so I don't know.It will take time to get a decent team together but I do love the game.Some people get annoyed at the ramdom selection especially if they keep geting 1 or 2 star characters but you can just sell them and use the power up.Bad points. The cost of a space as you bulid your team goes up to a 1000 points. The cost of one fully powered hero is just crazy.Deadpools game I'm not sure it the ramdom selection win is as random as they say.

												Ok so this game has to be one of the greatest games ever built.  Not only does it offer the addictive fun of gem matching but includes the familiarty and fun of the Marvel universe while still allowing for a deep game experience with RPG type elements of skill building and character leveling.  This game is winner!  Even works on my old crumby computer.  Some may not consider this to be a good thing but this game is 1 of only 2 games I have every bought in game pruchases for in my life.  I just can't let those top tier marvel characters slip through my finger ;)  Honestly though, you will not be disapointed in the free-to-play strategy game.  Also of note is this game is appropriate for all ages.  I can play this in front of my 4 yr old with no guilt.			"

												I used to love this game, as it should be obvious from how many hours I have sunk into this thing, but the game has made a definite turn for the worst.  It is in the Puzzle Quest style of gameplay with a few tweaks that take some getting used to (team formation, different type of leveling, matching more gems for the free turn, new timers on gems that you want to eliminate/protect with timers, etc).  I would think that if you were a fan of the first couple of Puzzle Quest games then you might enjoy this game as it scratches that same itch.  Most of the adjustments to the gameplay are interesting takes on the old formula, which I think are pleasant.However, recently the publisher has made the game more of a chore to play than anything.  They are employing several different tactics to try to squeeze more money out of the players, to the point where it has become a hindrance to my enjoyment of the game.  By aggressively trying to find ways to get money by adding new 'features' that limit the playerbase unless you are willing to pay more (and more and more) they have completely destroyed my enjoyment of this game.  I used to recommend this game to my friends, however I can no longer do that and have stopped playing the game myself.			"

												Been playing the Android version on my phone for about 6 months now and loved it.  Hadn't been aware there was a version on Steam, so I gave it a go the other day when I found it.  Why not, after all?It's a Match 3 game.  It's not complicated.  It's not resource-intensive (or shouldn't be).  And yet, it runs like absolute garbage (when it does load at all).  My laptop is not weak, and yet you would think I was trying to run GTAV at max settings on it instead of a freaking Match 3 game.Look the game itself is actually great when it works, one of the few Freemium games I've come across where you truly *can* succeed and make headway without spending a real cent of your money.  It apparently does NOT work on PC though, so I can't possibly recommend it here from Steam.  What a truly awful port....			"

												Marvel Puzzle QuestThis game would be amazing if the Computer didn't blatantly cheat, I mean come on,  3 match followed by another 3 match with a 4 match and finally a speacial attack to finish it off is ridiculous , I thought the phone version was bad...smh. Now i undestand the pay to win (PVP) and strategy aspects behind the game and i'm fine with that, I have a problem with cheating the player and forcing the player to drop cash into game knowning that you'll still going to get cheated makes this game unplayable at times and not worth dropping money into period. If they fix the AI issues this game would be amazing but let's face it that's not happening with a cash grab game.			"

												It's a lot of fun, although more of the same if you've played Puzzle Quest before. Definitely fun for those interested in Marvel (as I am). Not particularly a fan of having to level up with coins but, that's the way it goes in free to play games. Would have liked an option to just right out buy the game. All that being said, I played for two hours and spent absolutely nothing. That's more than fair.			"

												Game has become a negative posterchild for pay to win. Before people who didn't spent any or just some money for slots etc. had a fighting chance. And even more importantly, they had some time to enjoy the game. Now they nerfed healing, so most Characters with healing skills get their healing only temporarily. Before, you could play 1-2 hours w/o a problem w/o having to use so called health packs.Now, w/o proper healing, after you used your 5 free healthpacks per day, which can easily happen after 2-3 games, as EACH hero (you can use 3 heroes at a time) needs to get healed with one pack. So after 3 games (maybe 10 minutes) you can easily run out of health packs and that was it for the day as it takes hours for the healthpacks to replenish. Most people won't have the time play for 10-20 minutes every 5 or so hours, because they work and basically have a life.If you wanted, like I did before, enjoy an hour or the occasional 2 hours on the couch, playing Dark Reign, you are now out of luck. After 30 minutes tops you run out of health packs and heroes to play. And guess how you only (reliably) get them back? Right, by purchasing them with real money. You can't even use the ""normal"" in-game currency.To level one hero to 50ish (of over 200 levels) costs about 90 € (NINETY), if you do this with currency from the real-money in-game shop.The most infuriating part is, that the devs think us stupid and lie to people, claiming the new system would save them time, because playing a 5 Minute game every few games to heal your heroes to full is much longer than waiting 5+ hours .TL;DR, it's a predatory business model aimed at addicted players who need to continue playing after they ran out of health packs. Keep away till they change that factor. If they do, the game can be fun.			"

												Marvel plus Puzzle Quest  sounds like pretty cool pairing. The gameplay its here but since it is another free to play game you can count on microtransaction and there is plenty of them. From energy bar making us wait till our hero heals to coins for purchasing and upgrading skills all the way to the crystals for leveling up.Game supports xbox controller but there are some issues with it making use of a mouse a must.Its highly playable and you can sink deep into this title and survivr the transaction wall unless you really want to play online. being matched agains someone who paid a lot means that losing is pretty certain (different hp and abilities makes it nearly impossible to win against someone 10 or 15 levels above you). Still the game is fun an single-player looks  ok.			"

												The use of Marvel characters is great, and the core idea of connecting special abilities to matching crystals is just as good now as it was back in the original Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords. I was a fan of that title, and Marvel Puzzle Quest proves itself to be a worthy new-school successor.Eventually, you figure the match-3 machine is going to run out of steam. But so far enough developers have been able to find new ways to present it that it hasn’t given up the ghost, and it helps when they can hook specific audiences. For comic fans, Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign can definitely do that.Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign does a pretty good job in putting two popular franchises together, and the result is a fun, challenging match-3 puzzle game.

												The gameplay is so much fun - a great time killer. The same old Bejeweled/PQ basic mechanic of 'matching 3 gems or more' is there, a huge appeal for its fanbase. Also, with the quests system, there's a sense of progression unlike the old Bejeweled. You actually need to check your opponents level prior to accepting the quest, rearrange your roster, heal your heroes or arming the power ups to make things easier. In addition to great quests, we also have very decent graphic and badass OSTs. Granted that it's not AAA's 3D levels, but the detailed chars and charming designs are more than enough. The actual Heads Up Display is clear and concise, allowing players to reach the menu they want to use. There's also a simple descriptions to each of heroes' powers so you can understand what you're going to invoke before deciding (since the point placement is permanent and not respecable).The video options are barebones, but really there's no need Anti Aliasing and those fancy Physx Tesselation whatever it's called options. You can use your native resolutions - at least that's commonly used nowadays - to prevent screen tearing. Well, in my case, it autodetected everything so it's click and play.Game performance overall is silky smooth even on my mid-end rig. Transitions between scenes are quite short, no boring loading screen that takes ages to finish and so far zero crash.Now after all good stuffs, here comes the problem, microtransactions. In order to upgrade your heroes within reasonable timeframe, you need to either be lucky with rewards rolls, or grind the best rewarding quess repeatedly, or purchasing DLCs. That's where the major problem is. All would have been a little better if the quest rewards can make up for it so free players don't have to bang against the wall out of frustration.Multiplayer is missing, but I'd imagine it'd be great to have a match up against other people real time matching gems together.Great Free to Play game ridden by micro transactions. It's a real shame, the game has a chance to be other FTP killers on Steam, but severely missed it. In the end though, I'd play until I am tired with the brick wall that prevents me from advancing, or bored.			"

												Great game overall, the best one in Puzzle Quest series. If you ever had any interest in Puzzle Quest then look no further.Characters are closely represented with their respective unique powers, and new heroes are added regularly.Events and storyline are just perfect for newcomers and casual players, but players who spend more than a couple of hours a day may find it thin and repeating. With the addition of health system, the server load should be guaranteed and the ranking ladders will not be owned by marathon players.It is truly a free to play game where you have no obligation to spend anything. As for winning, it's down to how much time spent against other players - just like every MMO games out there. Money can only help making the characters stronger, not the time needed to complete the matches.			"

												I enjoy match-3 games, and this comes with all of the benefits and drawbacks that come with competitive versions. (Matches aren't timed, but opponents take alternating turns against you, with possibilities for long strings of watching the computer play when it gets a lucky combo.) The game makes full use of 4- and 5-matches, giving each a different bonus, and recognizing T-shaped and L-shaped 5-matches. (Games that don't do this drive me crazy.)As a free-to-play game, I like that everything in-game is still accessible without purchase. Progression is a bit slower, of course, but it is possible to win ""hero points"" (in-game gold) and expand the slots available for heroes.The unique elements of this game are two-fold:1) A collectable card-game like element of choosing which heroes to keep and level up, and which combinations to use in each battle.2) A chance for gamers not already steeped in superhero lore to get to know Marvel characters and interactions a bit better. It's quickly turning me into a fan!There are two modes of play: ""story mode"" and ""versus"". * Story mode has in-character intro and outro dialog, pulling you into a comic storyline. It's a fun way to immerse yourself in the lore of the Marvel universe. * Versus mode pits your selection of heroes against heroes from another player's roster. It is worth noting that you are not actually playing the other person, but rather the AI using their heroes and abilities. This is a huge positive for me, because I don't have to deal with connection lags, people who afk for long periods, or trolling in a chat window. But if you're looking to match wits against a human opponent, this might leaving you wanting for more. Over 40 hours in, this continues to be a deeply engaging game!			"

												The game is really fun, fast and a joy for the Marvel Geek. It is free-to-play, which means you can try it with no real danger. I had some luck of the draw when it came to Heroes. This is my first Puzzle Quest title, so there was a phase where I had no idea what to do, but it is easy to figure out after a while.			"

												This version of the game features the flaws of the mobile version. As detailed in reviews below, the mechanic for health is an issue, and then there is the AI, which is designed to cheat. It will be able to use abilities it does not have the points for, and Team Ups are messed up in the AI's favour.The final thing which makes me uninstall the game less than half an hour into playing, is that you cannot link your mobile and Steam accounts together, despite the quote from the developer that ""The PC version runs off the same code and servers as the mobile versions. Battle against anyone, regardless of what device they're using"", that couldn't be any further from the truth.So, they hope you will double dip, spending money in both versions. Well, not this guy, and hopefully you won't either :) If you're thinking about installing this version and you're already invested in the mobile version, change your mind.			"

												My first review, i'm so excited. Lets begin:This game is very addictive , it's one of those games where you are always checking back and forward to see what's happened next. There are roughly 11 events per season(a season lasting 24 days give or take) and we are on season 10. Events lasting 3 days, straight after each other.Unfortunately this game has some incredibly frustrating flaws such as an unfair, unbalanced ranking system where you can get attacked for a frustrating 110 points(that's like dying 10 times straight in COD by just spawning) and superiority anxiety meaning the guy with the best characters' wins.While this game has a very large roster, it has very little little access to them. There are roughly 60 playable characters but few ways to get them.You get fan favorites like Deadpool, Nick fury and wolverine, Rocket & Groot, Avengers and many more, you even get obscure characters such as Venom, juggernaut, Daken(wolverines son), beast, black panther, Blade(yip - surprised to) , Daredevil, The hood(see in game) , Ragnarok(there's an upcoming movie - thor's clone) and even a dinosaur called devil dinosaur.You get characters from the x men universe (beast, mystique, storm, magneto etc), avengers (all from 2012 movie), guardians of the galaxy (so far rocket/groot, Gamora), fantastic four and more. While this game is not perfect, anyone who loves marvel and knows nearly everything about marvel should definitely play this game(free).  They currently on ""Marvel now"" and “Dark reign” story lines. So they very current as these are very recent storylines in the MU.Thanx please comment on my review.Thanks Dragon Priest "

												I wish I could recommend the game with all my hours but I can't really do that. The reason is that the game was fun at the start, but it quickly became apparent how money grubbing the company can be (lowering drop rates of high ranking characters, changing the way healing worked so you have to wait more often, etc.).Another thing I felt was more prevalent here than with other Puzzle Quest games is how much ""luck"" the AI sometimes has getting the right matches. For me it is simply impossible to win from the AI if both teams are the same level.Although you can play about 4 matches a day if you don't use the healing items you can get/buy, it isn't worth it if you want a full Puzzle Quest experience.

												I'm not to keen on free-to-play titles, no one here on Steam i reckon, but as a game Marvel Puzzle Quest is not too bad. It's quite fun actually.Now i have read a lot of complaints about the free-to-play scheme and it more or less forcing you to spend money to progress, but the way i see it is that it gives you a fun time and when you run out of health you just take a break for a while. You can keep it free as long as you keep playing it casually.If you're looking for a Bejuweled clone with a Marvel theme that is well implemented, though you can skip the story, then you'll have enough fun with Marvel Puzzle Quest.

												Im changing my review after some extended play. The issues i originally had with the game were that it seemed intentionally diffucult and designed to make you pay in order to play. I had only played it for a few days at the time and it was very frustrating because i coudl only play 2 or 3 matches before i had to quit and wait several hours so that my roster would regenerate its health and i coudl play again. also because of the weak initial charcters i had it was very diffucult to win and therefore made it feel like i made no forward progress. now i have played it for several weeks and while its true that i did have to invest a decent ammount time initially now i have a large roster of charcters that i like and i can play a lot before i have to stop and let them recharge. and now that i have a stronger roster i can easily participate in all the schediled events adn complet the standalone missions. In short this game is much  MUCH MUCH better that i initially thought. and its one of teh games i enjoy playing an hour or so a day and likely will play it for a long time to come. Its totally worth the time it takes to get into the game and i seriously highly recomend it			"

												It's a fun, strategic match-3 game with Marvel elements. The game is currently running during the Dark Reign period Marvel had. From what I gather, it's following that storyline pretty good. As for the game, there is a good source of strategy to matching your colors, gaining AP (attack points) to get your heroes to use their special abilities. There are anywhere from 2-3 abilities for each hero and some of them 0-2 of them could be passive based on the hero/villian you get. Each hero also gains their powers through ""covers"" and each of these can be strengthend to a power of 5. As you gain more covers, you can then increase your heroes level as well. All-in-all, I enjoy playing the game in short burts on my android for the most part.			"

												Do you enjoy Marvel superheroes?  Do you enjoy matching threes?  Do you enjoy not paying for games?  Well, then, perhaps you should try Marvel Puzzle Quest, a free-to-play match three game featuring Marvel superheroes.Conceptually, MPQ is quite simple.  You pit your team of three superheroes against another team of three superheroes or villains and take turns rearranging coloured tiles to match lines of three or more in classic Bejeweled fashion.  The twist here is each superhero has at least one (and up to three) super powers they can use to affect the tide of the battle.  Each tile you match on the board adds coloured ""action points"" to your reserve, which in turn fuel your heroes' powers.  So after you've banked 9 blue action points, you can use Black Widow's ability to stun her opponent, giving you a couple free moves, 10 green action points will let you use Storm's lightning ability to smash a bunch of random tiles, and so on.  While some powers can really turn the tide of the battle if used effectively, many are just lame.   Would you rather have an ability that changes the colour of a few tiles, or simply clobbers your opponent for 1000 points of damage?  Yeah, me too.  The game is split into two basic modes, Story mode and Versus mode.  In the former, you're following a sort of simplistic campaign, punctuated by a series of really lame cutscenes involving no animation,  a single background, and some cringe-inducing dialogue.  In the latter, you're sort of going head-to-head with another player's team, except not really, because the computer is actually controlling their moves.  The AI is generally not very strategic, and will often make mistakes such as creating a tile that benefits itself, then immediately destroying it.  Two ""currencies"" fuel your efforts; Hero Points and ISO-88, used to both buy new heroes and upgrade their powers.  Unsurprisingly, you can buy either of them by ponying up some real life cash.  I'm not sure why anyone would do this.  The real fun of MPQ – at least for me – was earning points to buy new heroes and then upgrading their powers.  So the option to simply buy as many points as I want would pretty much nullify most of my enjoyment of the game.  Unfortunately, even if you do spend some big bucks on the game, you still can't just buy whichever hero you want; you're just paying for random card drops and hoping the card you want is somewhere out there.  Even worse, if you finally DO get one of the more rare heroes, you won't even be able to use all their powers unless you find more rare cards to upgrade them.  You can theoretically earn more Hero Points and ISO-88 by replaying old missions, but quite often you'll get some lame 20 point reward instead of the juicy rewards you were promised.  Marvel Puzzle Quest has fine production values.  The art is bright, colourful and well-done but the animation is very minimal.  This is most noticeable when using the superheroes' powers, some of which look nice, but many of which look really lame.  Likewise, the music is great, but repeats constantly.  Voice overs would've added some more personality to the proceedings, but it's pretty clear this was not a big budget game. So why would anyone want to play this game?  Well, for starters, it's free.  And the classic match three gameplay has timeless appeal.  Unfortunately, for all its trappings, MPQ really is just a match three game.  So no matter how much strategy or tactics you attempt to throw at it, you're still at the mercy of whatever coloured tiles drop from the sky.  And you'll still lose matches because the AI somehow managed to get an unstoppable chain reaction of matches, with devastating results.   Even without spending a dime on the game, I managed to beat all the story missions and place fairly well in the versus events.  And for some of the many hours I spent, I was actually having a blast.  Marvel Puzzle Quest has the sort of gameplay that's strategic enough to be engaging, but not complex enough to keep you up all night. As long as you keep winning, it keeps doling out a steady stream of upgrade points and ""recruit tokens"" you might be able to turn into a new hero for your roster.  It's not a game anyone should spend money on, but if you like matching threes... hey, did I mention it's free?			"

												Very expensive(think $2-300 if you want to get a particular hero by spending)  Yet the design team loves to crap on paying players.   The ""customer support"" team remains anonymous, cut'n'paste, and lies through their teeth about escalations(they don't really, just cut'n'paste a fake escalation and wait a bit).  And the management team assures if you want to get out of a nerfed character they'll provide a sell back for in game currency less than the worth of the character to buy/build.  Basically, a total money trap.  I have never seen a game so fundamentally anti-gamer.			"

												HORRIBLE game! It is fun to play for a few rounds, but very quickly the game turns into a P2W worst-case scenerio. If you do not shell out hundreds of dollars, you will NEVER be a top tier player, because they intorduce new top tier-characters at a rate that it is impossible to develop just by playing. In short, you either spnd hundreds of dollars of real world money, or you will always be relegated to being a punching bag.Oh, and there are no brakets, and no levels for events. You will be goign toe to toe with people who have sepnt, anf you can go to the official developer forums if you don't believe me, THOUSANDS of dollars to build their teams.You will die a lot. The game will give you freebies that expire if you don't spend money to store them. There are at most 2 PvE events per day, and the rest? Get ready to have somoen with daddy's credit card slaughtering your best team.It is a MASSIVE RIO-OFF!!!			"

												Very fun, and not very pay-to-win like all the reviews say.The PvE story roughly follows the Dark Reign comics, with Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin, creating the subtlely-named Dark Avengers, of which Bullseye is the best by far, in order to do something for someone, I don't know. He is opposed by Iron Man, Black Widow, Storm, Hawkeye, Wolverine, and Thor. It ends with a fairly high level boss fight, which can be easily beaten with stuns or heal abuse because it's a three-on-one curbstomp.After that, you can go through weekly events against other players to earn more ISO-8, which is your experience, or Hero Points, which can get you more slots for more characters. Most of these events have restrictions or characters that get bonuses in stats, encouraging you to use them in your team and keep the characters you're not as interested in.I haven't seen the pay-to-win much in my time of playing. Even if you buy ISO-8 and Hero Points, you're still going to have to keep up against people who have more experience with their characters than you and can set up teams with better gem coverage. And even if you get a full party of rare characters, they don't all work together as well as the lower level characters, and many of the three star characters have weaknesses to their powers, such as Iron Man Model 40's Recharge, which provides gems to use on other attacks, but stuns Iron Man for two turns.Overall, I enjoy this a good bit, and recommend it to others.

												Certainly a pay to win game, there’s no doubt about that, however the game still offers a fun and challenging experience by not even paying at all. You can still experience the full game without spending a dime; all you need is patience and skill. The game may have a dull story but the gameplay of solving puzzles and collecting characters is highly addictive and entertaining. The best aspect of MPQ:DR is that you don’t need to play it a lot in a day; just having a 30 minute session can get you tonnes of rewards and still build a decent team without having to even look at any micro transactions. Overall, I find the game very fun to play and it’s great to burn a few hours a week with addictive and enjoyable puzzle solving. 8/10					"

												Yes it's a little harsh on it's free to play claim, but the game itself is great. With Marvel's vast collection of heroes and villains, once they are able to add more characters, it will be even better. If you pay what you would a normal game, it gives you a head start, but as long as you participate you should get a ton of free crystals just by doing the missions and repeatables. In the beginning I found Thor, Wolverine and Juggernaut to be especially useful in various teams, all 3 are extremely resilient and in the earlier stages of the game Juggernaut's red ability can usually one shot any enemy. I've gotten both Magnetos and The Hood from just basic recruit tokens so you can get lucky there as well. Favorite character so far is 3 star Magneto.			"

												A lot of people seem to moan about microtransactions, but for me the game really is a blast, and I've spent only about 3 euro (SHIELD's recruit pack, discounted at the time) to get more space for additional characters. While it doesn't seem so at first, there's suprising depth to the strategy - you need to balance your team so that you can use every color of tiles and have the stronger characters cover the weaker ones (so be careful not to overlevel your support, like Storm, to the point where she takes the spot in front of your Wolverine and gets promptly chewed in three turns). Don't expect long playing sessions because of the helath regeneration system, but the deafault heal time plus 5 regenerating health packs usually allow you to play three-four games every two hours or so. And honestly, it's a match three game, so you'd become bored with more. Great for breaks at work and extra nice if you are a Marvel fan, I appreciate the use of comic book covers as skill icons. Shame about the absence of Steam Cloud support, though.			"

You start with 3 basic heroes after doing the tutorial and you have to manage to lvl up using the ISO points you obtain by winning battles. Some battles on the campaign gives you extra heroes or hero points (hero points are the ones you need to have extra slots for more heroes).Its a bit slow at the beginning because every time a hero takes damages, it needs time to restore his hp, so whe you have only 3 heroes it can be a bit slow to advance. But as soon as you have 5+ heroes and reach lvl 10+ with some of them, you can keep playing almost indefinitly without having to spend real money on the game. Paying real money on this game only gives you a faster progression, but you can manage to do everything just by playing the game.If you like puzzle games its worth to try this one, just have in mind the first few hours are a bit slow if you dont invest real money.

												The game is pretty fun, at first, then it gets incredibly frustrating seeing how many people are , from the look of it, months and months ahead of you..except that some actually pay for progress. You don't really have to pay if you don't mind moving along in a snail's pace, but you'll get there, eventually. They started requiring that you use certain characters to be able to progress through certain events in order to finish in a good place (good place has better rewards etc etc) , so you either won that specificy character last event, or you purchased it, or you are pretty much destined to finish in a place other than first throughout the event.You can also link up the mobile version with this one so you can play the same account on both devices, takes a few days to get them synced, however, it took them 8 days to sync mine.It's a nice game, though, hopefully they balance it out between F2P and P2W.

												If you can get past the microtransactions, this game is pretty good. Assembling a team makes things interesting, as each hero and villain have unique attacks. Matching 4 in a row no longer gives you another turn like it did in the original, but instead clears out the whole row or column. And Marvel is Marvel. If you're willing to pay for the vanilla Puzzle Quest, I'd recommend playing that instead.			"

												Very fun puzzle quest variant! The puzzle mechanic is excellent, and team creation is dynamic and enjoyable. Rewards are meaningful, and collecting the ""comic covers"" (i.e., leveling your Heros) is very fun.It is also an excellent implementation of both free to play and micro transactions. Spending real money is by no means necessary, and although it speeds up your progress it does not make you more powerful than equal leveled players who have not spent money. The primary use for real money is to buy extra character slots, but you can earn the necessary currency by playing in the campaign or the semi-PvP daily and weekly events. Although a number of other reviewers have voiced dislike for the time based healing system, I actually really like it. Taking damage to your Heroes is bad, and the game is more enjoyable because of this difficulty backed up with a real penalty! I have yet to spend any real money on the game, and yet have played a ton and enjoyed it.			"

												If you have any interest in super heroes, and collecting stuff then this game is for you. Don't heed people who say it's micro transactions galore. You can play without paying. Everyday there are several multiplayer events in which you can participate for free and win lots of Iso-8 and HP (game's more valuable other currency) if you are successful enough. There is also a huge single player campaign with lots of rewards. I don't know what people are complaining about. There is one thing though. If you are very competitive then you might feel you need to pay to get ahead of others. It will only save you game play time. Others will catch up to you if you pay, but it will take a while. Since I enjoy the game as it is and I'm a casual gamer at heart, I enjoy it a lot. The game is addictive. I also played old Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords. I had enjoyed that one though I didn't finish it. This is a bit different from that one in how leveling works and the fact that you don't have a single character to play with. From what I heard, game's support team is very efficient. I didn't have any problems with the game so far though.			"

												I'm having fun. On the surface, it's a simple colour matching game. Easy, right? Anyone can do it. As a Hard Core Casual gamer, I really appreciate that. No timer, no hand eye coordination and instant decision making required. Yeay!It's also ""Free to play"" or supposed to be. Don't believe it! It's addictive. Like... like... shopping for a shopaholic. I'm a shopaholic. Having said that, I'm well aware of my gaming budget limitations. So i've spent enough on this game to buy a PS4 or so my friend tells me. I don't really care since there are no games on a PS4 that I can actually play and my PS3 works just fine. The games on my Playstation watchlist are all coming out on PS3 anyway. So, my game budget can handle this. I just wish Steam would stop blocking me, all the time. I'm nowhere near $2000.00 in 24 hours.Anyway, back to the game... Past the surface there are strategies and tactics that make the battles interesting. Different enemies change the feel and style of play required to win and so it keeps being fun. It's very grindy if your gaming budget or Steam doesn't allow you to buy what you need to level up your characters. BUT if you're not a PVP ♥♥♥♥♥ it doesn't really matter. Take your time, wind down after work with a game or two and eventually in a few... errr... years... ^_~ you'll get there eventually. I've only been playing for a few weeks, but I've paid for my character levels in cash. You get a present everyday you do play a game or two and if you care to play in the PVP arena, the rewards are more consistant than in the PVE games where the reward randomiser can give you the minimum reward heaps before surrendering the good stuff. It seems to be getting better, but that might just be my imagination. I didn't collect any data to compare last week's drops to this week's.The only downside at the moment is that the PVE content seems very limited. There's a Prologue which I have completed, though not obtained all the rewards and no sign of ""Chapter 1"". There are PVE Events, but because they are of limited time... go on holidays without your computer and you miss them.  If your team isn't at a sufficiently high level, you may only be able to complete the first few fights before the opponents get too hard to fight. Then you're stuck grinding those same few fights, your team can manage, to get enough points to reap the rewards on offer in the time that the Event is on for. There's even PVP Events - lots more of these, with Lightning Rounds and Tournaments you have to pay to play in.  I'm not much of a PVP player and once the teams I have to fight get too hard as my ranking climbs, I lose interest until I can level up my characters to get a chance at winning again. BUT by then the PVP Event, is over. Hmmm....I'm much more interested in Chapter 1 and the continuation of the Story started in the Prologue. Don't tell me they continued the story in past Events, cause I wasn't there to play them and when do they become Chapter 1?That's the MAJOR downside of this game. There doesn't seem to be anything beyond the Prologue.So you ask yourself why I'm recommending this game? Because I'm having FUN! Read a few other reviews and the forums and there are all kinds of grumbles about its inadequacies. BUT when all is said and done, it is a FUN game. It is an easy game to pick up and play, and once you get started, the character and power combinations become intriguing. It gets addictive simply because someone like me whats to collect them all and see how well, or not, they work together.I might wish for more permanent content... maybe there will be. I can only hope. In the mean time I'll be having fun with what is there.			"

												Fun game, but it feels better suited to tablets and shouldn't have been ported to PC. A lot if issues that other people are having can be lessen by playing in short sessions, such at 10 to 30 minutes at a time, especially with free heroes that the game will give you every few days, as well as cash shop currancy. With this game being on PC, we're acustomed to playing an hour or more, and this game penalizes that without using cash.One new game mechanic added to the Puzzle Quest system are abilities that effect tiles on the board. Such as Iron Man placing Protect Tiles, that turn the normal gems in to shielded gems to reduce damage to your heroes, or Storm's Attack Tiles that damage your opponent. They still behave like normal gems, in that you can match them to other colors and they'll go away. Some of your enemies also place gems that have a count down timer, and will activate after a number of turns have pasted. Like HAMMER Assassins that will place Sniper Tiles on the board, and will deal heavy damage to your heros after a few turns have passed. This helps you as a player, since you can prevent the enemies abilities by matching those countdown tiles, and removing the ability before it has a chance to go off.The worst part about this game, is that when your heroes are damaged or knocked out in a game, they will have to recover and this can take up to an hour or more without using heal packs. You start out with a dozen or so, but once you run out, you'll have to pay cash for more. Also, improving your hero is terrible. Instead of earning experience in battles, you earn this ISO-8 currancy, and you spend that on heroes to improve their base health and a few other stats. To improve their abilities, you have to either spend a ton of the premium currancy or hope that you get another copy of that hero. Say you have Captain America, and he only has one ability. To unlock his other 2 abilities, you'll need another Captain America, with that ability, and add his to your hero. It requires too much luck to improve just one hero, and Puzzle Quest's bosses are betting that will pay tons of money to do so.Yes, this game has a lot of options to get ahead with cash purchases, and these purchases won't go very far, since most of them are completely random. Say you really want Spider-man on your team, then you have to option of fighting Venom to win a Spider-man with a Fantastic Four suit or throw a few dollars at random hero packs and pray he turns up.I do recommend this game for tablets, since it's best suit to short play sessions.

												I'm not one to be suckered in my free games usually, but having enjoyed games like Bejewelled and Puzzle Quest in the past, I figured I'd give it a try. At first, I played a few times, and then stopped playing for a few months as I wasn't sure if it was really my thing or not. I'm not sure what made me decide to try it again one day, but as you can no doubt tell from the hours I've got recorded playing this game, I kinda liked it... just a little ;) It's likely that it was the whole 'feemium' thing that turned me off to start, but this game is generous enough to make you want to keep playing without NEEDING to spend money.I've never been a comic fanatic or anything, but I've always enjoyed the characters from the Marvel universe, and loved watching the old cartoons like X-Men. Over the years I've been playing this game, I have spent the odd bit of cash here and there, but I don't think the amount I've spent would only come to around $30 I'd say. The team at D3 are continually adding new features and characters which keep my interest, and I am a member of an alliance with a group of firends who play, which makes it a little more fun, being able to discuss things with the group. It also allows you to get extra bonuses, as when your alliance members do well in events, the whole alliance will get rewards.This is a great game to play while having my morning coffee, as it's quick, yet rewarding, but at times during certain events, can be brutally difficult (Damn ninjas!! *shakes fist*). It wouldn't be much fun if it was a walk in the park though!It's also great that they have daily events, which keeps me coming back to see what's new and what else I can get! (This unlocks after you've played through a certain amount of the single player, so don't give up too soon!)If you've ever played match 3 games, and enjoyed them, I can't recommend this one highly enough. Building up an ever expanding roster of characters as fun as the game itself! In my opinion, it's by far the best of all the Puzzle Quest games that have been released, and I even though I have spent many years playing this game, I can't see myself stopping any time soon!I notice a lot of people don't recommend this based on their not being able to sync with their mobile version, but I've only ever played on Steam, and as such, I haven't come across any of those issues. They seem to say that they're given in game currency for free (Hero Points), but you can also get that in the PC version. Perhaps the amounts you get are different or something? I don't know as I've never played the mobile one, so if you only plan to play on PC, don't let that deter you, as you can get free HP in this version too.			"

												Okay, so this clearly isn't a Triple A title but it can still be good right? Right?The answer is no. It isn't. It has good elements of fun. It's fairly entertaining as you gather new heroes, upgrade the ones you like, have cool and sometimes very useful special attacks. So what's the issue then? It's boring and poorly made.Well first off, the game is basically a Mobile Game ported to PC without ANY of the things a PC port should have. It doesn't have a resolution that would be fitting for a PC and instead looks like you're playing a Tablet game on your monitor. While that may not sound that bad, I've noticed even some of the UI choices are still touch screen like. It overall feels down right aweful to look at for extended periods of time.Next is the gameplay itself, it's very barebones as the best animations you will see is the little Gems going POOF from chain completions. The special attacks consit of your character of choice flying into the center of the screen and waggling a bit with some flashing lights and sounds.Once you figure out if you can enjoy the gameplay or not comes the ways you upgrade your heroes. It's basically random lottery as you have to get another copy of your hero to upgrade their skills, after which you then need to use ISO-8 the magical nonsense item to then increase their level. You also can only have so many heroes before you need to purchase more slots. Now that isn't too bad as it's normal, the problem is you can only use what is basically a ""Money"" currency which is limited as you only get some per day unless you wish to pay for it. The same currency is used for pretty much everything and they will try their damnedest to get you to waste it on heroes, upgrades, level increases, etc. Then they shoehorn in some Healing character nonsense that basically ripped off from Facebook games.The story missions try ever so hard to entertain and keep you interested but the lack of voices, new images and basically an interesting story that hasn't been heard over and over again, brings it down on its knees. The more interesting and rewarding stories are locked out until you play and gather Strong/OP heroes. It's not even recommended that you try them WHATSOEVER until you're very well off into the game as they will not only stomp you out but cause you to need ""Health packs"" just to recover and continue playing the game. The next part of story missions is that they often can be replayed for different loot, the problem is even though it says 1/4 things to be looted you can still gain something that ISN'T an option as loot. I've gotten ISO-20 which wasn't an option instead of ISO-100 or another Iron Man. When all you do is want to have 4/4 in loot and you have to replay the same, easy, boring level repeatedly just to make sure you have everything useful from that mission, it gets very boring.The art direction is okay at best; you have art work that doesn't look the best on these big screens as it's made for much smaller ones. The characters don't have the best animations as they seem more and more like paper cutouts than they do powerful superheroes. It's pretty underwhelming watching them play out an unskippable animation.The sound is basically the same as the art direction, bland, boring and not that interesting. I was really hoping for some good Marvel action tunes.In short, the game starts off okay but slowly turns into a long road through Pay to Play. Not too bad if played in short, short bursts but very boring if you're going to play for hours at a time.3 Broken Gems out of 10.			"

												Cons:~ Monetized, and not well. Darn near everything costs and you will never have enough of whatever to do the job. ~ Rewards you cannot use until you pay or earn premium currency for the space to claim it.~ Time-Based System would be acceptable if it were shorter.Pros:~ Puzzle Quest Series' infamous ""Stacking the Deck against you in place of intelligent opponents"" difficulty system seems to have been abandoned. You get lucky drops of new gems just as often as the CPU does. Defeat is not decided for you in advance.~ Interesting improvement system, despite monetization angle.~ Guild system and game modes that reward you for acting together, though apart (sharing powers, guild-wide rewards in their special events). Makes many good things you get into benefits you can share (such as your great high-level card being sent out as a backup to allies).Play it. Cautiously.			"

												Yes it's a little harsh on it's free to play claim, but the game itself is great. With Marvel's vast collection of heroes and villains, once they are able to add more characters, it will be even better. If you pay what you would a normal game, it gives you a head start, but as long as you participate you should get a ton of free crystals just by doing the missions and repeatables. In the beginning I found Thor, Wolverine and Juggernaut to be especially useful in various teams, all 3 are extremely resilient and in the earlier stages of the game Juggernaut's red ability can usually one shot any enemy. I've gotten both Magnetos and The Hood from just basic recruit tokens so you can get lucky there as well. Favorite character so far is 3 star Magneto.			"

												A lot of people seem to moan about microtransactions, but for me the game really is a blast, and I've spent only about 3 euro (SHIELD's recruit pack, discounted at the time) to get more space for additional characters. While it doesn't seem so at first, there's suprising depth to the strategy - you need to balance your team so that you can use every color of tiles and have the stronger characters cover the weaker ones (so be careful not to overlevel your support, like Storm, to the point where she takes the spot in front of your Wolverine and gets promptly chewed in three turns). Don't expect long playing sessions because of the helath regeneration system, but the deafault heal time plus 5 regenerating health packs usually allow you to play three-four games every two hours or so. And honestly, it's a match three game, so you'd become bored with more. Great for breaks at work and extra nice if you are a Marvel fan, I appreciate the use of comic book covers as skill icons. Shame about the absence of Steam Cloud support, though.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is a tipical block combining game that adds to the game the marvel universe/heroes to give some diversity and fun collecting/leveling the heroes.Every heroe has diferent habilities and you can fight in 3v3 battles combining the strenghts of your heroes to progress through the game. You start with 3 basic heroes after doing the tutorial and you have to manage to lvl up using the ISO points you obtain by winning battles. Some battles on the campaign gives you extra heroes or hero points (hero points are the ones you need to have extra slots for more heroes).Its a bit slow at the beginning because every time a hero takes damages, it needs time to restore his hp, so whe you have only 3 heroes it can be a bit slow to advance. But as soon as you have 5+ heroes and reach lvl 10+ with some of them, you can keep playing almost indefinitly without having to spend real money on the game. Paying real money on this game only gives you a faster progression, but you can manage to do everything just by playing the game.If you like puzzle games its worth to try this one, just have in mind the first few hours are a bit slow if you dont invest real money.

												The game is pretty fun, at first, then it gets incredibly frustrating seeing how many people are , from the look of it, months and months ahead of you..except that some actually pay for progress. You don't really have to pay if you don't mind moving along in a snail's pace, but you'll get there, eventually. They started requiring that you use certain characters to be able to progress through certain events in order to finish in a good place (good place has better rewards etc etc) , so you either won that specificy character last event, or you purchased it, or you are pretty much destined to finish in a place other than first throughout the event.You can also link up the mobile version with this one so you can play the same account on both devices, takes a few days to get them synced, however, it took them 8 days to sync mine.It's a nice game, though, hopefully they balance it out between F2P and P2W.

												Very fun puzzle quest variant! The puzzle mechanic is excellent, and team creation is dynamic and enjoyable. Rewards are meaningful, and collecting the ""comic covers"" (i.e., leveling your Heros) is very fun.It is also an excellent implementation of both free to play and micro transactions. Spending real money is by no means necessary, and although it speeds up your progress it does not make you more powerful than equal leveled players who have not spent money. The primary use for real money is to buy extra character slots, but you can earn the necessary currency by playing in the campaign or the semi-PvP daily and weekly events. Although a number of other reviewers have voiced dislike for the time based healing system, I actually really like it. Taking damage to your Heroes is bad, and the game is more enjoyable because of this difficulty backed up with a real penalty! I have yet to spend any real money on the game, and yet have played a ton and enjoyed it.			"

												If you have any interest in super heroes, and collecting stuff then this game is for you. Don't heed people who say it's micro transactions galore. You can play without paying. Everyday there are several multiplayer events in which you can participate for free and win lots of Iso-8 and HP (game's more valuable other currency) if you are successful enough. There is also a huge single player campaign with lots of rewards. I don't know what people are complaining about. There is one thing though. If you are very competitive then you might feel you need to pay to get ahead of others. It will only save you game play time. Others will catch up to you if you pay, but it will take a while. Since I enjoy the game as it is and I'm a casual gamer at heart, I enjoy it a lot. The game is addictive. I also played old Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords. I had enjoyed that one though I didn't finish it. This is a bit different from that one in how leveling works and the fact that you don't have a single character to play with. From what I heard, game's support team is very efficient. I didn't have any problems with the game so far though.			"

												If you can get past the microtransactions, this game is pretty good. Assembling a team makes things interesting, as each hero and villain have unique attacks. Matching 4 in a row no longer gives you another turn like it did in the original, but instead clears out the whole row or column. And Marvel is Marvel. If you're willing to pay for the vanilla Puzzle Quest, I'd recommend playing that instead.			"

												I'm having fun. On the surface, it's a simple colour matching game. Easy, right? Anyone can do it. As a Hard Core Casual gamer, I really appreciate that. No timer, no hand eye coordination and instant decision making required. Yeay!It's also ""Free to play"" or supposed to be. Don't believe it! It's addictive. Like... like... shopping for a shopaholic. I'm a shopaholic. Having said that, I'm well aware of my gaming budget limitations. So i've spent enough on this game to buy a PS4 or so my friend tells me. I don't really care since there are no games on a PS4 that I can actually play and my PS3 works just fine. The games on my Playstation watchlist are all coming out on PS3 anyway. So, my game budget can handle this. I just wish Steam would stop blocking me, all the time. I'm nowhere near $2000.00 in 24 hours.Anyway, back to the game... Past the surface there are strategies and tactics that make the battles interesting. Different enemies change the feel and style of play required to win and so it keeps being fun. It's very grindy if your gaming budget or Steam doesn't allow you to buy what you need to level up your characters. BUT if you're not a PVP ♥♥♥♥♥ it doesn't really matter. Take your time, wind down after work with a game or two and eventually in a few... errr... years... ^_~ you'll get there eventually. I've only been playing for a few weeks, but I've paid for my character levels in cash. You get a present everyday you do play a game or two and if you care to play in the PVP arena, the rewards are more consistant than in the PVE games where the reward randomiser can give you the minimum reward heaps before surrendering the good stuff. It seems to be getting better, but that might just be my imagination. I didn't collect any data to compare last week's drops to this week's.The only downside at the moment is that the PVE content seems very limited. There's a Prologue which I have completed, though not obtained all the rewards and no sign of ""Chapter 1"". There are PVE Events, but because they are of limited time... go on holidays without your computer and you miss them.  If your team isn't at a sufficiently high level, you may only be able to complete the first few fights before the opponents get too hard to fight. Then you're stuck grinding those same few fights, your team can manage, to get enough points to reap the rewards on offer in the time that the Event is on for. There's even PVP Events - lots more of these, with Lightning Rounds and Tournaments you have to pay to play in.  I'm not much of a PVP player and once the teams I have to fight get too hard as my ranking climbs, I lose interest until I can level up my characters to get a chance at winning again. BUT by then the PVP Event, is over. Hmmm....I'm much more interested in Chapter 1 and the continuation of the Story started in the Prologue. Don't tell me they continued the story in past Events, cause I wasn't there to play them and when do they become Chapter 1?That's the MAJOR downside of this game. There doesn't seem to be anything beyond the Prologue.So you ask yourself why I'm recommending this game? Because I'm having FUN! Read a few other reviews and the forums and there are all kinds of grumbles about its inadequacies. BUT when all is said and done, it is a FUN game. It is an easy game to pick up and play, and once you get started, the character and power combinations become intriguing. It gets addictive simply because someone like me whats to collect them all and see how well, or not, they work together.I might wish for more permanent content... maybe there will be. I can only hope. In the mean time I'll be having fun with what is there.			"

												This game gets a bad rep.. and mostly because people are cheap.  Here's my take on it:I know my ""time played"" only says a little over an hour.  But I've easily put 10+ hours into the iPhone version.  And I've never had to spend a dime.  It's a game you can EASILY play for 30 minutes, then come back to, rinse and repeat.  And you would never need to spend money.  I've done very well in the iPhone version and never bought anything from the store.For the PC players.. the game is free.  FREE.  What do you expect for Free?  Have you ever worked at a software company?  Probably not.  Any developer of software would be out of business in a month if they just gave you free games that never asked for micro-transactions.  All you have to do is click the X and move on.Personally, when I tried the PC version, I enjoyed it.  It's pretty much the exact same game, but without the limiting frames of the smart phone versions.  Very big and bright.  But otherwise identical.  It's Bejeweled, and every once in a while a Marvel Hero artwork jumps out and throws some particle effects around.Cons?  Yeah, there are definitely some.  This is a VERY cash shop oriented game that will remind you at every turn that you can buy tokens, iso-8, characters, covers, etc etc etc.  But like most games of this ilk, you can get around that if you don't suck at it, and use your resources wisely.  Sure, there's a bit of luck involved.. and God forbid you would have to spend $5-10 to support the developer of a game you got FOR FREE.  My only other gripe is that the smart phone version of it doesn't sync with the steam version.. it really sucks having to start over when playing it on PC, when I have a bad♥♥♥♥♥team on my phone.In the end, I give this a 8/10.  It's no Puzzle Quest 2 (but what is) and all I can say is that if money is that big of a problem for you, then video games shouldn't be your hobby.  Maybe get a better job.  :) "

The original puzzle quest had other game modes (puzzles, item/spell crafting, and whatnot) that really made it shine.  The devs need to get with the program...			"

												Wow, this game sucks big time. Classic use of a popular license to get people hooked in and then letting them pay in order to advance in the game. Basically just a retheme with some minor twists to the gameplay, but without any kind of real innovation. And in case you actually like it, you're forced to grind the levels over and over again or pay up to get your loot and levels faster.  Feel free to try since it's actually free to play, but don't expect anything original or remotely enjoyable.			"

												I forgot I had already written a review for this so thought I'd write one... in doing so I came across a lot of negative reviews for this game and I actually don't think they are quite deserved.Yes you can ""pay to win"" in this game... but you can also progress reasonably without doing so... there is in fact strategy involved that can help you advance faster (namely when you start getting to the top of the leaderboard in challenges either only battle when your top heroes are healthy, or back off until you have health boosts to bring them back up to full strength otherwise you will fight your way back down the ladder through losses).It is true that your heroes take a long time to recover their health over time... but you also get health boosts (max 5 at a time unless you pick up a bonus pack then you can have more). I have not spent one coin on this game and have a healthy roster (not sure how many but it spans about three pages in side scrolling)... daily rewards and winning battles gives you enough to be able to buy more hero slots and the covers are actually random... I have now had a few high level gold card drops in just the ""standard cover"" category. It does seem as though sometimes the AI throws the opponent a much better board move than you... but if people are honest that can happen in their favour as well.Sure I've received enough Daken 1 stars to create an army... but that's the weighing of chance of the likelyhood of having a great character pop up. It's a game that I am quite happy to put a couple of hours in a day... play the matches I think I can win and slowly build my team.I suspect that most of the people annoyed at this game are ones with no patience who perhaps want everything now but don't want to pay for it. I'm happy to not pay for anything and take my time and just enjoy the game dynamics.A very worthy addition to the Puzzle Quest series. Great use of the Marvel Characters and very good at drawing you in to win the next battle. Well paced rewards and challenges.			"

												Certainly a pay to win game, there’s no doubt about that, however the game still offers a fun and challenging experience by not even paying at all. You can still experience the full game without spending a dime; all you need is patience and skill. The game may have a dull story but the gameplay of solving puzzles and collecting characters is highly addictive and entertaining. The best aspect of MPQ:DR is that you don’t need to play it a lot in a day; just having a 30 minute session can get you tonnes of rewards and still build a decent team without having to even look at any micro transactions. Overall, I find the game very fun to play and it’s great to burn a few hours a week with addictive and enjoyable puzzle solving. 8/10					"

												I'm not one to be suckered in my free games usually, but having enjoyed games like Bejewelled and Puzzle Quest in the past, I figured I'd give it a try. At first, I played a few times, and then stopped playing for a few months as I wasn't sure if it was really my thing or not. I'm not sure what made me decide to try it again one day, but as you can no doubt tell from the hours I've got recorded playing this game, I kinda liked it... just a little ;) It's likely that it was the whole 'feemium' thing that turned me off to start, but this game is generous enough to make you want to keep playing without NEEDING to spend money.I've never been a comic fanatic or anything, but I've always enjoyed the characters from the Marvel universe, and loved watching the old cartoons like X-Men. Over the years I've been playing this game, I have spent the odd bit of cash here and there, but I don't think the amount I've spent would only come to around $30 I'd say. The team at D3 are continually adding new features and characters which keep my interest, and I am a member of an alliance with a group of firends who play, which makes it a little more fun, being able to discuss things with the group. It also allows you to get extra bonuses, as when your alliance members do well in events, the whole alliance will get rewards.This is a great game to play while having my morning coffee, as it's quick, yet rewarding, but at times during certain events, can be brutally difficult (Damn ninjas!! *shakes fist*). It wouldn't be much fun if it was a walk in the park though!It's also great that they have daily events, which keeps me coming back to see what's new and what else I can get! (This unlocks after you've played through a certain amount of the single player, so don't give up too soon!)If you've ever played match 3 games, and enjoyed them, I can't recommend this one highly enough. Building up an ever expanding roster of characters as fun as the game itself! In my opinion, it's by far the best of all the Puzzle Quest games that have been released, and I even though I have spent many years playing this game, I can't see myself stopping any time soon!I notice a lot of people don't recommend this based on their not being able to sync with their mobile version, but I've only ever played on Steam, and as such, I haven't come across any of those issues. They seem to say that they're given in game currency for free (Hero Points), but you can also get that in the PC version. Perhaps the amounts you get are different or something? I don't know as I've never played the mobile one, so if you only plan to play on PC, don't let that deter you, as you can get free HP in this version too.			"

												Whether you will like this game depends on what you are looking for in it. Most of the criticism of this game revolves around the 'pay to win' accusations, and in a sense they're true, you're unlikely to win most of the main events if you don't sink some money into buying new heroes, health packs or slots for new heroes, so if you're the kind of person who wants to open it up and play for hours non-stop without paying a thing this game will likely frustrate you. For me I didn't want to spend much on this game, I've spent a total of £6 after 100 hours playing and I don't intend to spend anymore. When I play I'm not in a rush and am happy to slowly build up my heroes over time, I play in shorter bursts to do certain events and can play in windowed mode to rotate it around with other things. Some people get annoyed because if you lose and have run out of health packs the only way to get more is to buy them or wait to win more in certain events. As for the actual gameplay, there's not much to say. You pick three of your heroes against opposition and match the colours up to best suit the abilities of your selected heroes. It's puzzlequest and free to try out if you're unsure. Also note that for the multiplayer you are not actually playing against other people, it is against three of their heroes that the ai controls.			"

												Cons:~ Monetized, and not well. Darn near everything costs and you will never have enough of whatever to do the job. ~ Rewards you cannot use until you pay or earn premium currency for the space to claim it.~ Time-Based System would be acceptable if it were shorter.Pros:~ Puzzle Quest Series' infamous ""Stacking the Deck against you in place of intelligent opponents"" difficulty system seems to have been abandoned. You get lucky drops of new gems just as often as the CPU does. Defeat is not decided for you in advance.~ Interesting improvement system, despite monetization angle.~ Guild system and game modes that reward you for acting together, though apart (sharing powers, guild-wide rewards in their special events). Makes many good things you get into benefits you can share (such as your great high-level card being sent out as a backup to allies).Play it. Cautiously.			"

												Let me get this out of the way: this is a very nice game. It combines match-3 with cardfight (not sure what they are called) games where you level up your cards. Here you level up your (Marvel) heroes by earning Iso-8 and by earning their skills.There are events that give you big prices (lots of Iso-8 or recruit tokens for more heroes).More heroes. That's why I wouldn't recomment this game. You start with roster of 4 heroes. For every extra hero you need to buy an extra slot for Gold. You guessed it, gold is real money.Four hero slots is nothing. I played less than a day and already had 10 heroes (5 rostered and 5 waiting to be recruited).If that part of the game was any different or if buying with real money doesn't bother you: play this game. It's nice. Good graphics, nice sound effects, good skills and there's even a storyline.For me however that's a dealbreaker. You will not progress enough if you do not buy extra roster space.So...byebye MPQ.			"

												It's a free to play, but pay to win.  You can try to grind it out but you won't really make much progress.  This is a game that is sort of fun to play when you first get it, but then it starts throwing tougher enemies at your low level team.  They get knocked out, you have to wait, you play again, eventually you win and get a reward and then...you can't really use the reward since you only get a few free character slots.  You have to buy more.  Yeah...and you have to pretty much buy anything else to make the game playable beyond the initial starting misssions.  The freebies were fun, but the cost to keep playing is not my idea of money well spent.  You have $10 sitting around?  Wait for a sale and get a good game you can keep playing over and over.  On the other hand, if this your thing, spending money and more money to play a ""free game"" so you can keep up, then go right ahead.  It's definitely not for me though.			"

But over time they changed the game mechanics so that a casual player will not get anywhere.  In order to get all the rewards you have to join an alliance.  To be in a competetive alliance they expect you to play in all the events.  And to compete in all the events is a 2-3 hour a day commitment.  At this point I followed the dozen or so friends that I had in the game a stopped playing.			"

												A good Puzzle game that can be fun and addicting, but a lot of bad things inside it, 1st of all a Bullcrappish on MICRO-TRANSACTIONS and this game is full of it, the power boost doesn't stack beyond 10 so anything acquired beyond that gets lost in a void. Starting with 3 to 4 Character slots and acquiring more requires you to spend in-game currency which you will end up depleting in meer minutes if you recieve better and new characters, making you SPEND MORE ON MICRO-TRANSACTIONS and they ain't cheap. Did I mention that the character slots increases it value from 50 to 100 to 150, I don't know what goes beyond that, its just ridiculous.Don't get this game if you don't wanna spend more than $5 which can only get you 3 to for new character slots, so its a waste of time esp. if the slot value increases everytime you buy a new one. ITS A GOOD GAME, BUT LEAVES A BAD TASTE IN THE END. DEVS SHOULD FIX THEIR PRICING...GREEDY BEASTARDS.			"

												I think I've given the game a decent chance. It is kind of hard to rate, though; it's fun enough to play casually, but it makes casual play difficult with its problematic scaling that so often doesn't work and a level system that is completely dysfunctional.It really tries super-hard for microtransactions, which I understand are helpful to the developers, but good grief. When the game itself is made less fun and, more importantly, less functional for the sake of encouraging pay-to-win (or at least, pay to have more of a fun game), I feel there has been a fundamental failure.If a game, in and of itself, is fun, microtransactions can enhance that. But the most crucial part where Marvel Puzzle Quest falls short is that the game so often isn't fun, with a frequently cheap AI, problematic scaling algorithm, and restrictions and level-locking everywhere you look.There are many characters to choose from, which is very appealing, and the art and animations are great for what they are. Unfortunately this also is a double-edged sword, since you'll unquestionably find yourself up against the old and familiar obstacle of never really getting characters you want -- and being unable to just buy the specific character you do, even with real money -- and instead getting no end of characters you really don't.I really wish Marvel Puzzle Quest had a more casual play option, but everything is geared to ""encourage"" you to spend real money on making the game a more fun experience, which it should have been from the start. I know it's a free game, but it would be a lot more enjoyable, and I think more people would be more willing to give it a better score and recommendation, if it were a game priced reasonably and given a limited cash shop, but crafted better and more enjoyably. It's just a plain fact that they couldn't find a way to monetize a more casual play option, so it's not there. As a result, playing the game often ends up a frustrating reminder that if you'd just pony up the cash, you could probably have more fun.Meanwhile, Juggernaut's getting his fist ready. Better bend over. Some of the characters are plainly broken outright, and Juggernaut? He's one of them. Not only does he have massive health, but all of his moves are devastating. And you guessed it: he will always -- always -- get the combos he needs.			"

												Typical puzzle game with a twist. Each super hero has special abilities that are charged up by matching gems of each color. For instance, a super hero may have a power that requires 12 ""red"" gems to charge, so you must match 4 sets of 3 red stones, then that power becomes available to use. There are some interesting strategic combinations that affect the outcome of the game, and the Marvel characters are beautifully rendered.It doesn't take long, however, before you doubtlessly realize that you have hopelessly screwed up your game, either by buying heroes when you should have been buying hero slots or leveling up your existing heroes. This will basically make the game a fun sucking grind early on. The obvious solution would be to start over from scratch. This is easy... if you are playing this game on a phone. If you are playing on a PC, you're basically screwed, because the developers haven't bothered to allow players to reset their progress on PC (at least not a way that's as easy as ""start new game"").Go ahead and look up how to reset the game, and you will find a lot of conflicting opinions, and very little that is likely to work, since the solutions are all from 2013. The quick and expensive way to make your game playable again is to buy tokens to fix your FUBAR game save... so, of course, that's where they want you to go... when phone users can just delete their file and start over from scratch.This game is hopelessly flawed on PC. It's literally stops being fun as soon as you hit the brick wall of battles the game says ""are trivial"" difficulty. Unfortunately, it's yet another underwhelming Marvel title on PC. Stick to the phone if you're going to play it at all.			"

												It is exactly the same game as the android and apple app for phones and tablets. The only difference is you get a little more information on the screen so it might be a bit easier to keep track of what moves your opponent might make.  I'm not a big fan of the micropayment model especially in this game as you can spend money and end up with a low level cover you do not want or need.  Its fun to log on and play once a day but I wouldnt sink a bunch of money on it just yet.			"

												The gameplay itself is fun and just different enough from the traditional Puzzle Quest games to make me want to go back for more. However, the in game purchases (which are the reason the game is FtP) make later quests almost frustratingly difficult. I would recommend Puzzle Quests 1, 2, or Galactrix over this title for this reason.I would much rather have had it be a $20, one-time purchase over the Free to Play model.			"

												Not sure what's worse, the writing or the micro-transactions. Which is saying a lot since they will try to nickel and dime you blind. It takes coins to recruit the good characters and coins to make sure you have a team slot to place the character so you can recruit them...I know Free to Play isn't really free, but this is pretty awful as far as f2p models go.

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is effective at generating a false sense of achievement.  There are many different metrics by which you can make easy, regular progress.  Acquiring new characters, levelling them up, progressing through story missions, and reaching new reward tiers during the events all make it feel like your are gaining something.  Ultimately, though, it feels like a continuous grind with no real end goal.  Like many micro-transaction based games, it is more interesting to see how far you can progress without making a purchase than to buy either of their in-game currencies, so this may truely be a free-to-play game for you.

												For the first couple of days I played this game I was a little frustrated.  It seemed that the items were very overpriced (and they are), and that I couldn't get anything I wanted.  However, If you are smart at how you spend your money, use your items, and which characters you play, you can do very well in this game with little or no cash.  The real game is in the PvP, which isn't PvP at all really.  The Prologue, is just that, a starting to the real game.  Once you get 3 characters around 25-30 you can actually start playing the game which is all in building various teams who's abilities compliment each other.  I started out with Iron Man Model 35, Storm Modern, and Black Widow Modern.  This team will take you very far.  Now the anchor of my team is Black Widow Original.  She can heal and steal AP so I almost always end a fight with full health.  She does very well with Wolverine or Thor.  As you can see I've spent many hours playing this game on my PC (although half or more was probably AFK time.)  I've spent $10 on this game and I've felt it was a good choice.  My husband also plays and he spent $5.  We both spent the money to buy hero coins which we used to open slots for more characters. You will need at least 12 to get started and I currently have 18. 18 slots is enough to keep my favorites.  I never felt the need or pressure to buy for anything else.A note on the PvP, you get to choose who you play.  If you don't like the team, press skip, and you will be presented with another choice.  You can find teams you can beat at any level and since the very dumb AI is controlling the opposing team you can generally beat teams much higher level with smart play.  You get either 70 or 140 ISO-8 for every match you win, and you should be winning nearly all of them since you get to choose who you fight.  With an average of 105 ISO-8  per match and matches lasting about 3 minutes  you can level up characters very quickly in RPG terms.  However it probably seems slow for a casual mobile app.  You get points in tournaments based on the ranking of the team you fight, not their level, so with smart picks and persistence you can rank well and get good rewards early on, but if you have to come in first, you're going to have to work hard and wait a long time.  In addition to the end of tournament rewards, there are frequently progression rewards which you get regardless of your final ranking.  As there are frequently multiple tournaments hapening simultaneously and shield trainer always available, even after you've exhauseted the story line rewards there is always plenty to do and more characters to collect.  I find Marvel Puzzle Quest fun and surprisingly addictive, yet not at all pay to win.  In fact, the items are so expensive that several hundred dollars wouldn't get you very far. So those who do spend mony don't have any real advantage beyond saving a few minutes.  In summary, if you can get over the slow grind to level 30, this game really takes off and becomes much more fun.  Don't spend hero coins or money on anything other than opening up more roster slots until you fully understand what you are getting in return (i.e. hardly anthing). Participate in the tournaments early and often as this is where the ISO-8 you need to level your characters comes from even if you don't place well.  I'm not surprised that the people who only played an hour don't like it, though.  It's not really a play for a few minutes kinda game.  It's much better suited to long sessions on the PC.  It's the most fun I've had for $10 in a while.			"

												Interesting twist on bejeweledThe game play was mostly intuitive, although how exactly the enemies move/fight back is not very obvious, as there are different types of enemies that use different game mechanics to fight you. Also, choosing which ally is in front isn't very obvious either, even tho it's critical sometimes to know exactly who's in the front line and who will get the hit.This game, being free to play, has a leveling system that requires coins, which you can buy in the in-game store or otherwise purchase with real money. I'm not a big fan of free to play games for this reason, so it took away from my enjoyment of the game.The art and animations are pretty good, and the ""storyline"" is ok for a Marvel storyline. It's mostly just a big excuse to put all the Marvel characters together, but it does enough to provide a background for the game.Only not recommending this game because I dislike free to play. However, it is a solid bejeweled spin-off other than that.			"

												It's a match-3 puzzle game that lets you bring your choice of characters, each with their own special abilities, into the match. Depending on the characters, rules will be altered or added to that will alter how the match plays and can have a massive effect on the outcome of matches.Damage suffered is per-hero. Damage carries over between matches, so you can barely win one match and start another only to lose after your first turn if you don't wait for any suffered damage to your heroes to be restored. You can pay real world currency to hurry the healing along, but there's no requirement to do so.The publisher makes money from a cash shop, selling healing items, hero roster space, and random hero draws. You can get more heroes and ingame shop currency from playing the game, but even paying players feel an inventory squeeze if they're even slightly packrat-like.Think Puzzle Quest with a mostly optional microtransaction business model.

												I read most of the reviews, and saw how negative people were because of the microtransactions. Having tried the game, I can say that even though there is a lot of microtransactions, they do not restrict you in any way. So far, I have been able to get most things just by playing, and have been awarded a decent amount of coins just because of playing. Of course, you won't be able to own everything by playing, but you also don't have to buy anything.As far as gameplay goes, the game offers a fine experience, some strategy, and a lot of puzzling, and I find myself enjoying it, especially considering that it's free.The best thing I can say is that you try the game yourself and see if you think that microtransactions bother you or not. In my opinion, I think they are not and that you can enjoy this game decently without paying anything.			"

When you play it just sometimes a day (waiting for a party inside another game or when you have 15 min at hand)you can acctualy grind through some of the time sinking just dont expect to be playing it nonestop for hours if you dont want to spend money. Going with Events gives you the ability to get some of the better Cards ingame and you will slowly progress and getting your first Card to max level feels kind of good.I would recomend this only for People that either want to spend money or need a Bejeweld with some Powers for the 15min a day you dont know what to do			"

Bonus couns can be obrain by playing campaign.The game was nice and later need a lot of tactics. BUT now negatives:Game was fun, until new wave of balancing. Changing abilities to balance game is ok when it is phase of beta testing, but not in middle of game, when a lot of players use real money for hero builts.Before balancing good combination of heroes could defeat much stronger heroes, but after balancing good combination of heroes can defeat only same level team. Whatis the worst, that balancing were only 2 and 3 stars heroes, so now many of one stars heroes (low quality heroes) are stronger than 2 or 3 stars heroes.			"

You can't just play as long as you want.  you must work within the bounds of the rules that have been set forth.With that small matter out of the way...It's a good game.  The story-line is solid.  The gameplay is addicting.  I suggest you atleast give it a shot.			"

												It is exactly the same game as the android and apple app for phones and tablets. The only difference is you get a little more information on the screen so it might be a bit easier to keep track of what moves your opponent might make.  I'm not a big fan of the micropayment model especially in this game as you can spend money and end up with a low level cover you do not want or need.  Its fun to log on and play once a day but I wouldnt sink a bunch of money on it just yet.			"

												Like any free game, this game is run by microtransactions. Your pace of play is limited if you want to play for free, but you can get both types of in game currency from playing the game so you can pay to accelerate progress but can also play the game for free if you don't need to sit and play for hours at a time. Decent Marvel themed match 3 game.			"

												I don't normally go for these ""gem"" games...they make me nervous.  But this is a new take on an old concept.  I found it fun 'cause by lining um up you activate different heroes and different powers used by those heroes.  Plus, there are some cinematics in-between the rounds of gems for flavor.  Apparently there are other types of puzzles in the game..? Didn't play long enough to find out on my first go.  I paid for the first 2 DLC packs but not sure how to tell that I got them.  There was no additional download.  I liked it, but then I eat Marvel for meals.			"

												I enjoyed the original Puzzle Quest game that came out on at least the DS and PS3, and I still play both.  This is like it in the way that your hero(s)have abilities to do a give move to help defeat your enemy.  It also reminds me of Bejewled games with the shape of the puzzle pieces(?) I suppose you could call them that.  All in all a fun game to play when you only have a little time to play a game, and then again, it's addictive. :)			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is effective at generating a false sense of achievement.  There are many different metrics by which you can make easy, regular progress.  Acquiring new characters, levelling them up, progressing through story missions, and reaching new reward tiers during the events all make it feel like your are gaining something.  Ultimately, though, it feels like a continuous grind with no real end goal.  Like many micro-transaction based games, it is more interesting to see how far you can progress without making a purchase than to buy either of their in-game currencies, so this may truely be a free-to-play game for you.

												I am not the biggest fan of freemium games since most requrie that you spend money to progress through the game. I wouldn't say that this one is the exception to the rule, but you can certainly enjoy the basics of the game without having to pay money to continue playing. I put in around 30 hours before I decided to pay 9.99 to add some ways to preserve some characters that I started winning. If you're willing to grind or play smart then you can certainly put the time in without spending a dime. I highly recommend playing the multiplayer section in the Danger Room to add some quality upgrades in a relatively easy manner. A couple quick cons - the newest update added a penalty for skipping hard multiplayer battles. It's not a huge penalty, but if you're in management or free mode then it's going to take a bite out of upgrading. I'd also like to see some of the prices come down a bit to make it easier to save your rewards if you don't want to spend money. Otherwise, this can be something to enjoy between FFVII or Metro:Last Light games.			"

												There's a pretty severe proviso on this game.You may need to spend a smidge money. Not to buy cards, but to buy card slots. You can win a lot of the in-game currency, and once your decks are strong enough you can get more. Events allow you access to even more, but if you don't have enough slots you can't capitalise on the randomness of the card drops. They've set a week's lifetime on any card drop before it decays, so if you're willing to lose cards while you farm the currency then don't spend a cent.It's not a bad game by any means, but it takes a lot to get off the ground and start winning successively and consecutively. If you're a bit timerich and waiting on some new releases not the worst thing you could play. But don't spend more than $20 on it.			"

												Addictive, free to play, jewel matching. Hero powers and damage variation of colors help add an element of stratgey to the board play. The RPG elements of collecting heroes, leveling them, and building the best team combination are the driving motivation. The story and delivery are nothing great, but what are you really expecting from this type of gameplay? The down time (hero recovery) period can be frustrating sometimes, especially when just starting. There are always events and tournaments happening that are enjoyable and can provide great rewards. Overall, this game is a great pass time and does NOT require any real money to advance (as so many reviews claim), have spent $0 and havent had any issues. 8/10			"

												I read up on a lot of reviews before playing this and they heavily recommended against the free to play game because of the Pay-To-Win methods. Microtransactions are present and I can see where they're all coming from however this game is still a good game.For being free it provides the basic advantage of being there for you to play if you've got nothing better to do. The game isn't really one where you can sit and spend hours upon hours playing but it is great for a few minutes between things if you need to burn the time. For example, I play league of legends with my friends and always find the wait between matches about 5-10 minutes long with champion select and the loading screen included. Therefore I can get a few matches of Marvel in and still enjoy the game for what it is.After playing this game for almost a month I can finally see some serious problems as to why people wouldn't want to play this game. Even after a months time I'm unable to really collect higher level characters due to their rarity and the slow process of collecting coins to buy roster points. The game heavily presses for the purchase of coins however they're so damn expensive it would have been better for me to just buy the damn game for $60 to unlock everything. Which to be honest wouldn't even get you everything in this game since everything is given to you by chance.Either way after this month of playing I've still found myself getting one for a few matches and putting it away. Having fun and still progressing through the game even if it is slow. I recommend everyone to pick it up as a game to have on the side but it is definitially not a game I would spend all day playing.			"

												This ain't your Candy Crush Saga...Like any of the other Puzzle Quest games, this is a match 3 score puzzle game with the theme of Marvel Heroes. It has a story mode competeting off against the AI in various story scenarios, now with weekly special events allowing players a variety of PvE puzzle games to choose from. And there is also PvP arena, while also simulated by the AI, you'll face off against other player's team, composed of three of their heroes and/or villians. Competeting in these events (PvE and PvP) will place you upon a ranking system in brackets of other players around the world. In these brackets, there are milestones providing various bonuses as incentives to duel creating an addictive puzzle grind for glorious rewards.Generating in-game currency named, ""ISO"" you'll use this to level up your heroes and villians once you've unlocked (recruited) them either by purchasing the booster cards or earning them from playing the game. It's quite exciting earning cards, as each time you'll have a random chance - while some higher %'s than others - of obtaining that elusive hero or villian you've been after.It's a fantastic Puzzle Quest game, and I am a fan of the previous PQ games as well... so perhaps I'm biased, but it's definitely a fantastic match 3 puzzle game and highly reccommended by me.

												Addicting.  Having played Puzzle Quest on my PS3 I was familiear with the RPG/Match 3 hybrid mechanic.  If not, you soon will be, because the game is free, so there is no excuse to not try it out.  That being said, I'm sure the largest criticism will be that it is pay to win, which is not  *entirely* true.  If you play daily, participate in tournaments, join an alliance that is active and stay active....you will naturally earn gold coins (premium currency) and the ISO that is required for leveling characters.  You will end up selling premium covers (2 stars +), because roster slots cost gold coins, and you don't want to pay.  However, if you stick it out, keep playing, you will get those slots and then you just have to pray for good drops from cover pulls.The top players clearly pay or they have more hours in the day than God to play.  The game is meant to be casual, but can be cutthroat, give it a try, its the perfect game when you only have 15 minutes here and there.EDIT 9/10/14So being a player with 33 roster slots, Ive had some more time to reflect.  Clearly, as you progress without spending money, you are easily trumped in most high level encounters in tournaments, but success is not impossible with a little strategy and luck.  Most notably, I've noticed that as the developers continue to add new characters (covers or powers) to the possible roster, the chances that you will draw the same 3 star character necessary to level the one you already have becomes lower and lower.  For example, I've had a level 69 Hulk forever, because I have not drawn another cover due to the low 1% chance in most instances.  In the meantime I've accrued 5 or 6 other three star characters that are basically useless with only one cover outside of special circumstances during rare tournament opportunities.What this means simply is, if you can't afford new roster space to increase room for new characters, you will almost never level those three star characters necessary for higher level challenges.  The devs clearly use this to milk more money and stiff the consumer.  They need to add more two star characters and make three star character opporunities more plentiful.I still play, but with little opporunity for progression at this point, it is getting tedious and boring to play.

												Interesting twist on bejeweledThe game play was mostly intuitive, although how exactly the enemies move/fight back is not very obvious, as there are different types of enemies that use different game mechanics to fight you. Also, choosing which ally is in front isn't very obvious either, even tho it's critical sometimes to know exactly who's in the front line and who will get the hit.This game, being free to play, has a leveling system that requires coins, which you can buy in the in-game store or otherwise purchase with real money. I'm not a big fan of free to play games for this reason, so it took away from my enjoyment of the game.The art and animations are pretty good, and the ""storyline"" is ok for a Marvel storyline. It's mostly just a big excuse to put all the Marvel characters together, but it does enough to provide a background for the game.Only not recommending this game because I dislike free to play. However, it is a solid bejeweled spin-off other than that.			"

												if you've ever played puzzle quest (1,2, kindgoms or galactrix, idk if there are others) then you'll find the gameplay similar (swap stones to match 3 vertically/horizontaly to cause damage to opponent & gain resources used to employ secondary abilities). this iteration of the series strongly borrows from free-to-play mmos/facebook games in the form of microtransactions. characters are upgraded through cards purchased through in-game currency which is gained through rewards for completeting missions or events, or bought through the in-game shop. it also suppliments the typical puzzle quest battle system with a 3v3 marvel vs capcom style team fight, which adds another level of complexity to the game.disregarding the whole play-to-win aspect, the game itself is fun, with great artwork and an interesting variety of iconic marvel characters. at times i find the pace a bit sluggish for a casual game, and the difficulty can sometimes spike unexpectedly, but overall it is a very fun game, without needing a huge investment of time to be fun.

												I had a BLAST with Iron Man while trying to unleash FURY back into the world. I cast a web with Spider Man and fought valiantly against familiar and deadly villains and foes. This is a fast and FURY-us game with many surprises and power-ups.  I had to use SHIELD to lower the H.A.M.M.E.R while searching for the optimum match-ups to enhance my powers.  You earn rewards along the way and bolster your hero's super powers while staying alive to fight another day. All this while dodging sniper bullets and wondering what new heroes and villains are yet to be discovered.  This is a MARVEL to me and it broke the monotony from my much tamer and more usual game play.			"

												This ain't your Candy Crush Saga...Like any of the other Puzzle Quest games, this is a match 3 score puzzle game with the theme of Marvel Heroes. It has a story mode competeting off against the AI in various story scenarios, now with weekly special events allowing players a variety of PvE puzzle games to choose from. And there is also PvP arena, while also simulated by the AI, you'll face off against other player's team, composed of three of their heroes and/or villians. Competeting in these events (PvE and PvP) will place you upon a ranking system in brackets of other players around the world. In these brackets, there are milestones providing various bonuses as incentives to duel creating an addictive puzzle grind for glorious rewards.Generating in-game currency named, ""ISO"" you'll use this to level up your heroes and villians once you've unlocked (recruited) them either by purchasing the booster cards or earning them from playing the game. It's quite exciting earning cards, as each time you'll have a random chance - while some higher %'s than others - of obtaining that elusive hero or villian you've been after.It's a fantastic Puzzle Quest game, and I am a fan of the previous PQ games as well... so perhaps I'm biased, but it's definitely a fantastic match 3 puzzle game and highly reccommended by me.

												Addicting.  Having played Puzzle Quest on my PS3 I was familiear with the RPG/Match 3 hybrid mechanic.  If not, you soon will be, because the game is free, so there is no excuse to not try it out.  That being said, I'm sure the largest criticism will be that it is pay to win, which is not  *entirely* true.  If you play daily, participate in tournaments, join an alliance that is active and stay active....you will naturally earn gold coins (premium currency) and the ISO that is required for leveling characters.  You will end up selling premium covers (2 stars +), because roster slots cost gold coins, and you don't want to pay.  However, if you stick it out, keep playing, you will get those slots and then you just have to pray for good drops from cover pulls.The top players clearly pay or they have more hours in the day than God to play.  The game is meant to be casual, but can be cutthroat, give it a try, its the perfect game when you only have 15 minutes here and there.EDIT 9/10/14So being a player with 33 roster slots, Ive had some more time to reflect.  Clearly, as you progress without spending money, you are easily trumped in most high level encounters in tournaments, but success is not impossible with a little strategy and luck.  Most notably, I've noticed that as the developers continue to add new characters (covers or powers) to the possible roster, the chances that you will draw the same 3 star character necessary to level the one you already have becomes lower and lower.  For example, I've had a level 69 Hulk forever, because I have not drawn another cover due to the low 1% chance in most instances.  In the meantime I've accrued 5 or 6 other three star characters that are basically useless with only one cover outside of special circumstances during rare tournament opportunities.What this means simply is, if you can't afford new roster space to increase room for new characters, you will almost never level those three star characters necessary for higher level challenges.  The devs clearly use this to milk more money and stiff the consumer.  They need to add more two star characters and make three star character opporunities more plentiful.I still play, but with little opporunity for progression at this point, it is getting tedious and boring to play.

												I neither recommend or dislike this game for a simple reason, and that is that you CAN get a lot of it without paying. What you cannot do is compete at the higher levels without paying or expand your character space.There are issues with the gameplay, it does seem rather annoying that whatever you do as a player the AI always get the jewels they want. And it is also very, very frusrtating that when you are fighting bosses who need certain colours for thier attacks they miraculously drop for them regularly but not for you, and the only way to beat them is to grind and compete in daily events to potentially win better characters.And therein lies the nub of this game, to use better characters and not scrap the ones you have invested time and ISO in you have to purchase character slots and these go up in price aswell as size as you play daily. So now I need 300 gold to purchase 3 slots, rather than being able to buy 1 for 100.This is all very clever from a P2W point of view, but will simply mean I will move on if I cannot win enough gold to use these characters. But the very, very sad part of that is that the characters have a time limit on their availability, tempting you to spend money. I find that rather manipulative and poor.I have seen players with six pages of characters, and goodness knows how much they have spent. That more than outweighs those of us who play for fun, so let them do it and enjoy a simple game for nothing. "

												ok, I wanted to rage about this game so bad, I have played it on my mobile for so long, I cant just quit my 2 year rooster jsut to start over, but hey ... thats greed ... coming from the developer who wishes to drain as much money from your poket as possible. Dont play it as so many have said it has the worse type of pay to win scheme in place, even if you win new heroes it doesent guarantee you will be able to use it unless you pay money to open space in your rooster for them. Its scumbag behaviour. On top of it all now there are a lot of new 3star heroes which if you played anywhere from more than a month you would know that these dont come at a certainty, I have around 10-15 3 star heroes only with 1 or 2 covers (and you need 13 covers to get a heroe to max level). It sucks that you cant convert any number of 1 or 2 star covers to have a 3 star that you actually need. DO NOT PLAY IT.			"

												What could be a fun puzzle game ruined by the same cash schemes and artificial time gates of many IOS ports.Between the forced real time recovery of any hero when  they take any damage, to clear grind or pay to win keep buying covers to power up heros aspect, any fun the game has is eroded by it's petty restriciton mechanics. the game makes the more frustrating aspects of puzzle quests even more frustrating because one bad match can make an entire day effectively moot.Worse still is that while stages have multiple rewards to earn, The game will more often than not randomly decide to reward you the item you already earned, and since you cannot re earn said reward you will be given the same pitance you'd get from replaying a stage fully cleared. i've had strings of six+ fights consecutively where the reward I was given was the only one i 'earned' every single time.Without the terrible healing restriction and a way to level up heroes outside of using the same currency you must earn to buy covers the game would be a fun, if inferior sueprhero version of the classic Puzzle Quest. As it currently is the game is just going out of it's way to force you to give them money, instead of making a product you want to pay for.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is meant to be a puzzle game with RPG-ish elements where you can level up your character and increase the damage of their attacks by spending points on them. The thing is that you rarely get these points (coins in-game). You can tell that this game is the typical free-to-play game when they hit you with the fact that you either have to waste health packs on your heroes to recharge their health or wait 10 minutes to heal your heroes. Marvel Puzzle Quest is really designed as the average mobile game where you come back after your characters are able to be used (i.e. Injustice Mobile). So this is a Marvel version of puzzle quest, which is basically bejeweled except your actions control characters' attacks. There is a cool factor to this where you can increase the powers of your heroes by using resources you collect (Iso-8 Crystals) BUT you can't even purchase these upgrades until you purchase another ""layer"" of your character... AND THE THING IS that you can't do that without COINS, YES RARE♥♥♥♥♥COINS!!! Level 1 upgrades are 125 coins and I just want to point out that 200 coins costs 2 DOLLARS!!! Why do the creators try to screw us like this? But besides this In-Game-Purchase BS, the story really isn't even interesting, and the dialogue is quite boring. If only the heroes and villains had voices behind them it would be more interesting. This game does have some pros to it buy mostly cons. Not recommended...maybe to puzzle quest fans and very patient people but it doesn't change the fact that this game has tedious recharge times, boring dialogue and an uninteresting story.			"

												There's a pretty severe proviso on this game.You may need to spend a smidge money. Not to buy cards, but to buy card slots. You can win a lot of the in-game currency, and once your decks are strong enough you can get more. Events allow you access to even more, but if you don't have enough slots you can't capitalise on the randomness of the card drops. They've set a week's lifetime on any card drop before it decays, so if you're willing to lose cards while you farm the currency then don't spend a cent.It's not a bad game by any means, but it takes a lot to get off the ground and start winning successively and consecutively. If you're a bit timerich and waiting on some new releases not the worst thing you could play. But don't spend more than $20 on it.			"

The RPG elements of collecting heroes, leveling them, and building the best team combination are the driving motivation. The story and delivery are nothing great, but what are you really expecting from this type of gameplay? The down time (hero recovery) period can be frustrating sometimes, especially when just starting. There are always events and tournaments happening that are enjoyable and can provide great rewards. Overall, this game is a great pass time and does NOT require any real money to advance (as so many reviews claim), have spent $0 and havent had any issues. 8/10			"

												Although it incorporates many of the mechanics from its namesake, and art/characters from its theme, the game seems to lack depth and character development, instead relying on grinding or payment for character progression. The character artwork looks nice in combat as well as cutscenes, and the party system with character based skills is interesting with a good amount of variety, using the puzzle quest style of gameplay. This is overshadowed by the unfortunate fact that you will most likely not get access to all of the character skills and upgrades without grinding or paying for 'hero tokens', or hoping that an upcoming event has a chance to win an upgrade for your preferred character. As the difficulty increases you may need to ditch interesting low level characters for random high level ones just to keep up with the stat scaling.With better RPG and leveling elements I could recommend it, otherwise it feels like a chore to upgrade the characters you enjoy.

This game leans in favor of the Pay-to-Win playstyle by only giving you the chance to earn/grind small power for free and offering the option to ""purchase"" greater strengths.The puzzle system itself should have another look at because no one player should be able to match 3 colors, then the boards drops all the next right tiles to make an 11-combo match, that's just rediculous.I myself have been able to score 2 free moves in a row by matching +5 tiles in a row.  given that you never actually play against other people, just their computer-controlled teams, it's still unbalanced.If this game gets an update to make it better, i'll undo this review.  Until then this is how i feel.			"

												Another sad example of a f2p that is p2w. Basic heroes are basically garbage. They do little damage and have very low hp. Even the easiest missions will require the use of health packs if you want to play more than 2 matches in a row. Pvp is a joke. People will say it's about how you play, but when your opponent has 500hp more than you and is doing 5x as much damage, all the skill in the world isn't going to be much use.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is meant to be a puzzle game with RPG-ish elements where you can level up your character and increase the damage of their attacks by spending points on them. The thing is that you rarely get these points (coins in-game). You can tell that this game is the typical free-to-play game when they hit you with the fact that you either have to waste health packs on your heroes to recharge their health or wait 10 minutes to heal your heroes. Marvel Puzzle Quest is really designed as the average mobile game where you come back after your characters are able to be used (i.e. Injustice Mobile). So this is a Marvel version of puzzle quest, which is basically bejeweled except your actions control characters' attacks. There is a cool factor to this where you can increase the powers of your heroes by using resources you collect (Iso-8 Crystals) BUT you can't even purchase these upgrades until you purchase another ""layer"" of your character... AND THE THING IS that you can't do that without COINS, YES RARE♥♥♥♥♥COINS!!! Level 1 upgrades are 125 coins and I just want to point out that 200 coins costs 2 DOLLARS!!! Why do the creators try to screw us like this? But besides this In-Game-Purchase BS, the story really isn't even interesting, and the dialogue is quite boring. If only the heroes and villains had voices behind them it would be more interesting. This game does have some pros to it buy mostly cons. Not recommended...maybe to puzzle quest fans and very patient people but it doesn't change the fact that this game has tedious recharge times, boring dialogue and an uninteresting story.			"

												I really enjoy this game a whole lot. I find it can be addicting, it makes me want to come back and keep trying to earn more heroes, train ones I have, and to try and compete for the top. It's pretty fun, I'd recommend it to someone who likes puzzle games and marvel characters. My number one dissapointment with this game is that I started playing it on my Android device and have invested a good amount of time and some money into it, but my account from my android does not yet link to my steam account, thus I cannot transfer between the two. When you play this game, be sure you're choosing the platform you want the most before you get too deep into it.			"

												I neither recommend or dislike this game for a simple reason, and that is that you CAN get a lot of it without paying. What you cannot do is compete at the higher levels without paying or expand your character space.There are issues with the gameplay, it does seem rather annoying that whatever you do as a player the AI always get the jewels they want. And it is also very, very frusrtating that when you are fighting bosses who need certain colours for thier attacks they miraculously drop for them regularly but not for you, and the only way to beat them is to grind and compete in daily events to potentially win better characters.And therein lies the nub of this game, to use better characters and not scrap the ones you have invested time and ISO in you have to purchase character slots and these go up in price aswell as size as you play daily. So now I need 300 gold to purchase 3 slots, rather than being able to buy 1 for 100.This is all very clever from a P2W point of view, but will simply mean I will move on if I cannot win enough gold to use these characters. But the very, very sad part of that is that the characters have a time limit on their availability, tempting you to spend money. I find that rather manipulative and poor.I have seen players with six pages of characters, and goodness knows how much they have spent. That more than outweighs those of us who play for fun, so let them do it and enjoy a simple game for nothing. "

												This is one of the most elegant, amazing, match 3 RPGS I've ever played. I've played it pretty much every day for 18 months now - way more hours than Skyrim, Mass Effect and Borderlands put together. Spending cash simply speeds up your level gain. I've dropped cash on this, and happily so - hell I paid for those last three games. The devs don't always hit home runs out of the gate when they release new ideas(who does?), but they're great about updating and improving the game and actively solving problems. The art is great if you're a huge comic fan. Highly, highly recommendeed.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is effective at generating a false sense of achievement.  There are many different metrics by which you can make easy, regular progress.  Acquiring new characters, levelling them up, progressing through story missions, and reaching new reward tiers during the events all make it feel like your are gaining something.  Ultimately, though, it feels like a continuous grind with no real end goal.  Like many micro-transaction based games, it is more interesting to see how far you can progress without making a purchase than to buy either of their in-game currencies, so this may truely be a free-to-play game for you.

												Having played the mobile version of Marvel Puzzle Quest for a couple of years now, i decided to give the steam version a go. Unfortunately, an account cannot be shared across both platforms which is a huge shame. With that in mind, i find the mobile version better suits the game than on steam. Being able to play a few matches while on a train or waiting for something/someone is where the game excels, and it doesn't really work as well when sitting down for dedicated play sessions. If you are thinking of trying this game, i would suggest checking it out on mobile, as i've now decided to return to. There aren't many differences between the mobile and desktop versions besides some UI differences, and my recommendation for the mobile version is simply due to the easier ability to drop in and out of the game rather than any issues that i've encountered while playing the version available on steam.As far as the game itself goes, i do think it's one of the best games on the mobile market, and i've put hundreds of hours into it (possibly thousands, all things considered) There are over 100 recruitable characters (although it's worth mentioning quite a few are varients of the same characters) and the gameplay is quick to learn but can become very challenging and tactical as you rank up and face tougher matches. The game does point you towards in-game transactions a lot, as you would expect for a free game, but i personally haven't spent a penny in-game and have a very strong and competitive roster that i've managed to collect and level. There is nothing that is innaccessible without payment, and with events that constantly run and cycle every couple of days it always manages to feel worth my time. This isn't a game that you can lose yourself in and play for 6 or 7 hours on end, but it is a great game to play for short bursts or breaks and i would definitely recommend it to any fans of the marvel universe.

												I've been playing this game on iOS for a month and a half so far (since it came out), and I have to admit that so far the iOS model seems a little better, but the major flaw here is that the iOS version had a much longer and slower learning curve and far more ways to gain characters and level up without feeling vastly behind in the game.  This Steam launch version is the exact same model as the current (updated yesterday) version on iOS, on which I have spent ZERO real money, and my characters are level capped and I am enjoying the game quite a bit.  TLDR: give it time, don't spend real money, missions are the way to go!			"

												This title constitutes a rather pleasant surprise by Marvel due to the fact it is something completely different from what we are used to. By extension if you are willng to put aside action RPG΄s and MMO's for a while you will discover a very beautiful puzzle game with beautiful graphics and even a storyline based on Marvel Comics!			"

												I've been playing this game on my android since it was released, I've easily put 50 hours into the game, I have 25 roster slots, over ten heroes that are Lv30+ all without spending a dollar. Don't put this game down for microtransactions since you don't need to spend a dollar with all the rewards the tournametns and the PvE gives you.-Update-I still see people are complaining about the Microtransactions. 1) If you play the game daily roughly 2 hours a day and do all the missions in the PVE events and PVP a couple times a day you should get roughly 3,000-5,000 Iso-8, the tool to level up your characters. It costs roughly 20k Iso-8 to max out any 1* Hero and roughly 80k to max out a 2* hero. You will be able to max out any 1* or 2* character within weeks of just playing a couple hours a day. 2. You will also roughly get a few hundred Hero Points in the process, if you are starting out the game. Use them on the 100 Daily Deal Heroic pack. That is how you max out your 2*s. If you have played the game for a while, save the Hero Points for Alliance slots, or join an open alliance. I created a 20 person alliance and only spent twenty bucks on it, I could have waited a month for the same ammount of Hero Points. ((Some people spent a hundred))3. Now for the 3* covers, playing a lot in any tournament or event will nail you 1-3 3* covers of one hero. You will also get covers through the Heroic Packs and any other special pack that you spend your free hero points on. They require alot of Iso-8 to max out. 170k for a rough estimate. HOWEVER the final level still requires only 2500 iso-8, which is something you can easily get within an hour. 4. Guys this isn't a game that you get Lv100 of all the strongest characters within hours of playing. This game is set up more of an MMO where you have to do the slow grind to get to that point. I don't mind it. I currently have 5 maxed out 2* Characters at Lv85, 3 maxed out 1* characters and I have a handful of other 2 and 3* characters over lv50 with two that I just need to grind all the way to max level. I've only spent fifty bucks on this game because I actually felt like it. I didn't feel like I needed to in order to continue this game. To compare with other games I've played, I put almost a thousand bucks in to League of Legends and I had put six hundred bucks into Dungeon Fighter Online before that got shut down. I probably could spend more money into this game, but I don't.			"

												I do not understand why others cry over this. It is a fun casual game that you may play when you don't feel like playing hardcore games. You do not need to invest money in this game, you just have to have a good strategy. Here is hint: Take every event and go as far as you can in them. You will get nice rewards from events. Also, I am pretty excited when I get a new hero with good level or when I level up my favorites. I hope they will put Steam trading cards.In conclusion, it is a very nice game. It is casual, but you still need a little strategy. With my hint from above you may get far.			"

												8/10This is a free-to-play Match 3 game.There are MANY others like it, but I'm a comic book fan, (Slightly more a DC/Vertigo fan but still love some of the Marvel lines.) and this isn't the worst thing to happen to the franchise, or even the top 3 terrible things. *If they got Halle Berry to VO the game, it could get there...)The game itself is adequately executed (as the producers of ""Electra"" should be...) It's ... well, it's Puzzle Quest, with a few Marvel bits thrown in so your power-ups share the names of your chosen heroes' powers (Iron man's Repulsors, etc)The ""Story"" arouond the game... They try, and didn't destroy a load of canon to beat a storyline around the missions.The Free-To-Play bit...Obviously they're going to try to take your money, but they don't throw it in your face constantly, nor do they ask you to ""Share your victory with a friend"" every 5 minutes. If you play a little bit every day you can easily get enough rewards to make up for not paying for stuff, but if you want you can speed up your success. Just remember to save all your ""Hero Points"" for when you actually need them, and you'll have them when you do come upon a need.			"

												Under normal circumstances, I would say for a free to play like this its not bad. But there is one simple thing that drives me crazy, and that's the fact that you almost never get the covers you're looking for and that enemies get much stronger much faster than you can by simply grinding. I also have had issues where I will make a match, and that'll be it. Then the AI will make a match which leads to a chain of new pieces dropping and making more matches which goes on and on in a chain that I can never seem to match. This is annoying. I am not sure if it's my bad luck or if it's just the way the game is. Either way, the only people that really seem to do well are people who have no life and log mad hours into this game, or the people that don't mind dropping cash into the game in order to get the packs which in my opinion defeats the entire purpose of ""free-to-play"". In short, while many may enjoy this game and do well in it, I am not one of those people and cannot bring myself to recommend this game no matter how much I wanted to like it.			"

												I haven't spent a penny on this game and have played it for over six hours so far, improving my characters throughout, and I have expanded my roster by five new heroes. Three of them are over level 15 now. The storylines are pretty generic but it is still fun to strategize on the puzzle board and figure out how to use your ""powers"" and beat the bad guys.I suggest that anyone who likes puzzle matching games give this a shot because it is free. That's right, folks...it's completely free to play unless you choose to pay anything. Of course there are microtransactions involved to help get through the game faster. People actually worked on this game and want to get paid somehow. How many players whining about microtransactions will go to work tomorrow and tell their boss, ""I'll do these tasks for free. If you choose to pay me, I'll do more""? Zero.If you like ive this game a try. For free.			"

BUT (and usually I like big butts) you will have to pay a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of money to actually enjoy it and even win. Because of the card slots. Which are paid by cash... See? You never have an empty card slot for the level fifteen daken you just acquired because you have two ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hawkeyes!!! Preposterous Marvel, Disney and Valve! Aren't you our digital parents or do you take us as cash cows for you to milk???? Oh wait... Walked right into that one. Alas Marvel will dry us all... Poor things...

Not being far into yet, I do hope that there is some sort of ""end"" to the main story for that feeling that you beat the game, and not just continually the same over and over like in other match 3 type games (i think of Columns 3 for sega cd, where after losing on lv 187, i gave up ever playing it again).

												First off, it is free. I personally have not paid one dime to the devs. And I have a full roster of rare, legendary, and gold characters. If you choose not to pay as I chose NOT to pay, then you must have patience. I only played when I wanted. I didn't get obssessed with the events. I simply played casually. And it all fell into place. I started with Ironman, Black Widow, and Juggernaut. Kept winning with that combination and started collecting several other characters. My favorite line up right now is Thor, Black Widow (rare), and Juggernaut (or Storm..again, rare one). If you have patience and are not going to get swept up in having to win every event, not have to win every cover, not force yourself to play 3 or 4 hours a day then this game will be fine for you. The game concept is simple: match tiles/blocks to destroy segments but with the Puzzle Quest twist of having special powers to activate once you collect certain colored tiles (AP). I can confidently recommend this game. But you have to know what kind of player you are. If you need instant gratification and know you'll get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if you can't unlock all covers quickly or win every single event to get more covers, then don't play this game. If you feel you will reach into your pocket and throw all your money at this game to get a pay to win advantage and that is what is going to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, then don't play this game. But if you can enjoy the game casually it can be very rewarding. And hey if you DO want to throw your money at it, then go ahead. Either way the game actually is fun. I just have to tell myself not to get wrapped up in the treasures that always seem to be outside my grasp. I kept my money in my pocket and played casually (10 hours a week or less). And when I figured that out, treasures started falling in my lap.			"

												Highly AddictiveCasual game. Some sort of a blend of a card fighting game and a three-in-a-row game, with some twists.Three of your heroes against one or more villains.Your heroes have some powers that can be used, after they have collected some pieces of a certain color.But, villains also have their own powers.That makes more interesting the three-in-a-row game, because the goal is to defeat the villains, trying to use your powers and, trying to avoid villains to use their ones.So, strategy is important.While fighting, you can get some cristals, which you can use to train your heroes (level up them).The bad side of this game is that your heroes go injured or dead and, there is a long waiting time until the health is being restablized, so you can end without being able to continue the game, until, maybe one day later.And, there is where this FREE to play game wants you. If you are anxious, you can buy game coins (with real money) to buy medkits, cristals, enhancements or whatever you need to restore health and to train your heroes.If you are ok being forced to leave the game until next day then, enjoy this game as it is.Dialogues are forgettable (I bypass all them) and, are badly translated to Spanish. They add nothing to the game, IMHO.			"

												I've played this for a while now.  While it IS fun, there are a lot of issues with it.  You can earn better heroes, but most of them will be rare and cost you a lot of money.  What's more, you'll have to get these rares repeatedly in order for them to be worth anything...on top of the hours upon hours of getting 20 crystals per fight in order to purchase a random character at 500...or the hundreds you spend leveling a character up...not counting the hours you have to wait for your characters to ""heal"".  This is NOT a game meant for a PC...instead it looks like a straight port from a tablet or iPad, and they're just trying to make more money off of it.  Great concept, but poorly executed.  Try a different match-3 game.			"

												I have only just started playing this game, but I disagree with the other reviewers right now...I think ""Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign"" is alot of fun, I know there are a ton of optional micro transactions that you can take advantage of (operative word being OPTIONAL), and I can see where this could become a ""Pay to win"" scenario on all fronts if you want it to be.  Brass Tax this is a fun game, if you keep your head where it belongs (between your shoulders not in your backside), and your pride out of the equation and just have fun... If you go into this game and you are a person with a pride problem who gets his feelings hurt and throw tantrums everytime you lose, knowing this is a potential ""Pay to Win"" environment with no money to make yourself cpompetitive then that is your fault, not a flaw in game design nor concept.The storyline is humorous and moves swiftly from battle to battle, the transitions and animations are top notch so far, and the over all design makes me want to play all  the time and start collecting comics again.From what I have seen, having so far finished the first story and half of the second... You DO NOT have to pay for, nor buy anything to have a good time. Tip: If you run out of heals and you have to wait for your heroes to regen health or revive, go make a sandwich, or grab a drink, and when you finish you will be ready to play again. (You don't just have to buy a health kit right then and there... if you do that is your fault not a flaw in the game... Personally I go play the android version of the game on my phone while I wait for the heroes on my desktop to recover, that way I can play as long as I want to with no real interruptions .-Peace-			"

												____MARVEL PUZZLE QUEST REVIEW____Upon logging into steam and finding this featured in the store as F2P, A part of me leapt in excitement. As a long term puzzle quest lover I found myself drawn into the universe that is Marvel Puzzle Quest. Instead of having one character, you have up to 3 that switch in mid battle (each character is strongest with a particular tileset). As you match tiles, you gain the amount destroyed as power which you can then use as abilities. This opened up some room for strategy, in which I would try to think 2-3 steps ahead and plan my attacks according to my characters strengths. The campaign is somewhat lackluster in the script department, with the cutscenes just being the same portraits as the ingame characters. However as you progress through the prologue, you are faced with goons that deploy timed tiles that explode after the timer expires. In certain situations you can be unlucky and not have any tiles nearby, but with careful planning, most tiles can be destroyed before their time expires. Going further into the campaign, these encounters just repeated, with very little varience. However, there is plenty of varience in the somewhat multiplayer aspect of the game. Instead of fighting other players in realtime, the opponent's party is controlled by the AI, which is rather predictable (always uses abilites when they get appropriate power), but because you are fighting someone else's roster, you think about what strategy they were thinking about with their particular roster. This is somewhat compelling, but the real fun comes in the weekly events. Every week there is a particular event in which you compete with up to 1000 players for a chance to win rare covers. This brings me to my next point: the levelling system.Instead of levelling like a normal rpg through experience points, you level by collecting the same cover with that particular ability and since heroes are level capped by the amount of covers they have, the more covers you have for a particular character, the higher you can level that character.This hampers progression and you will find that you will level the characters with the most covers instead of thinking about some strategy.  This is where the transactions come into play. There are two types of currency: Iso-8, which is very common and can be generated by winning each game and awarded by winning particular events for the first time; and Hero points, which can be found in only a handful of stages in the PvE campaign. Conversely you can place in the top 25 in events and earn hero points, but to be able to do this, you need a good hero roster, which in turn requires hero points. Therefore every player will either have to wait 1 week for 50 hero points (hero points are awarded for logging in once per week) or they can choose to pay $1 for 100. At first this doesnt seem like a big issue. only $1 and you can have 100 hero points. However, the more roster slots you have, the more hero points it costs to upgrade. This is one area where the developers aimed their micro transactions at. I am guilty of spending $5 for 600 hero points to unlock a few more slots. I am currently up to 20 slots and have only paid $5 which I believe is reasonable. The other area where microtransactions seem tempting is the recovery time for your heroes.As you battle, your heroes will get damaged. They will recover when they are not in use, but as you gain higher levels, the characters take longer to recover. For example, a level 1 Iron Man takes only about 10 minutes to fully recover, as apposed to a level 50 Iron Man, which takes 4 hours to recover. The whole aspect of waiting for characters to recover interrupts the flow of the game, which seems like a good idea when you're on the move/on a mobile device. However, this should have been removed with the PC version as most people can just play a few rounds, then they have to wait 2-3 hours to recover. You can instantly recover by using medkits which are somewhat rare, or can be purchased for 50 cents each. This price of 50 cents doesnt seem high, but when you have to do it almost every battle, you start to feel a pinch on your wallet.One strategy that I believe newbies should employ (and this is only to help progression and to enjoy the game as it should be: uninterrupted) is to set your system clock forward. This tricks the game into thinking that time has passed and your characters will recover the amount of time you put the clock forward. Ignore the events, just focus on the prologue, get through it and level up your characters. Once you have finished the campaign, set your clock back to normal time and use 1 medkit on each character.This ""trick"" should not have to be used and it's bad gameplay design to have to resort to such things. However, with all this said, I have put about 100 hours into this game over the last 2 weeks, so they must be doing something right. Think of this game as a CCG with puzzle quest elements. Overall I would recommened this because it is free and you can still get a lot of enjoyment for free.____Pros____+Classic match 3 with marvel heroes+Weekly events and login rewards+Randomised PvP battles keep it fresh____Cons____-Progression hampered by random levelling system-Cant battle steam friends in realtime-Unable to sync IOS version with steam-Predictable and repetitive AI			"

												This game ramps up in difficulty immediately after getting you hooked, like a lot of bad free-to-play models. Based on the difficulty, I can't imagine it would be fun even if I paid them money. And I even got lucky and ""found"" a level 35 Wolverine when all of my other heroes were Level ~6. Even with that, so many of the missions are ridiculously hard. (Ones labeled as Trivial are medium-hard, and those rated as Normal are hard to impossible.I'd rather they just make a good game for a flat $4.99 (as a ported phone game, or else $19.99 for a ""real"" game) than make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that I can make slightly less ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by giving them money via extortion.My advice is BUY AND PLAY PUZZLE QUEST 2. That game is amazing and makes this game looks like a preschool game. Optionally, you can play Puzzle Quest 1. It's good but slightly annoying in the way the campaign is laid out (TONS of random encounters). It's a fun game, but can't hold a candle to the perfection that is Puzzle Quest 2. The only problem with Puzzle Quest 2 is it's too easy, but that's okay, it's still fun. There's a difficulty setting, I'd recommend turning it up and if you can't beat a boss villain twice then turn it down. Otherwise most of the peon challenges are on the easy side. (Which is fine if you just want a casual time-waster.)			"

												If you like the core Puzzle Quest gameplay, this is worth checking out. There's a lot of free gameplay here.  It's definitely designed around throwing money at it though.  It's a good variation on the classic Puzzle Quest formula. I like the art they used, and the variety of Marvel characters included.  I've played 8-9 hours of it so far and haven't spent a cent.  If they ever run a good sale on the Hero points and ISO 8 stuff, I'd be tempted to get some. The character health system reminds me of a Facebook game.  Like those games where you have a certain amount of ""energy"" or ""turns"" you can do before having to wait for it to recharge. Thankfully you seem to get 5 free health restoring packs every day, plus you can earn some as rewards for completing the missions in game. I like to play in relatively short spurts. Play a mission or two, then go do something else while my teams heal up. Overall it's not a bad ""freemium"" game. I'm not really sure where the limits of free play end though, or if there's a limit.			"

												This game used to be a lot of fun. However, recent updates have changed the game engine. It has always been pay-to-win, but that's not my problem with it. The thing is, it gets you to compete in Vs. competitions for prizes. When you get high enough in the standings, The AI begins to manipulate the puzzle board so that the opposing team scores a multitude of extra turns, causing huge damage and amassing a lot of mana for the other team. So you die and you have to use health packs to resurrect your characters. Which means you have to buy health packs or pay for a shield.  I don't mind paying for character slots, or even a shield if I'm not going to be able to play for several hours. But it's ridiculous to ask me to pay even as I'm playing. Other game manufacturers try to get people to play their games, and these guys have a game that people want to play, and rather than capitalize on that, their strategy is just to nickle and dime you to death on health packs. Ridiculous. Unless they fix it, I would only recommend trying this game if you have a lot of self-hate, and don't mind forgetting how you spent your money.			"

												I personally don't enjoy these type of puzzle games so maybe I am not the best person to get a review from but this game got old for me after a few levels.  If you are into these type of puzzles then go ahead and download but even the marvel liscence was not enough for me to countinue playing			"

												Well what can I say? The game is a match 3 puzzle with a Marvel license. It was quite addicting on Android and connected with your Facebook account for a sense of community. This version does not but is still fun.Lots of Marvel characters from classic to modern with more being added all the time. Fun stories and powers. Worth playing for a little while.			"

												Amazing match-3 game--think Bejeweled meets Chess meets trading card game--but only play it on mobile devices, I suggest.  It won't sync across to (or from) Steam, so don't bother playing it here.  (It does, however, sync from iOS to Android, via your Facebook account, which is nice)And for people complaining about the microtransactions: just don't use them.  You can quite steadily earn the premium points from doing missions, events, and pvp.  If you can control your competitive impulses to splurge, you can play the game just fine without spending $$.  Or, y'know, actually spend a bit of cash to show the devs some support.			"

												This game combines the adictiveness of casual tile matching with the thrill of using Marvel characters as your own to beat the living day lights out of your enermies, and using the tiles you've matched up to activate their powers. Its a very Unique and fun game, with slight draw backs such as grinding some levels for rewards you've yet to unlock and constantly having to find previous character comics to unlock more of their powers and increase their max level, but if you spend enough time into the game, it quickly becomes very rewarding and fun.

												Here's the problem.  If you get into this game, you will want to pay.  There is something about it that hooks into your hoarding instinct if you keep playing.   It is under constant development and the new characters keep it fresh.  That's worth paying something.I played this on my phone for six months and then decided to start playing on the PC so that I have a better (bigger) interface.My ground rules WERE:  No buying ISO-8 (experience points).  No paying for 10 packs or abilities.   Freely spend to buy slots when I win a new hero.   If you keep those rules, they payout is much like a subscription:   You win a couple of new characters every month and you pay a little to expand your roster.  Very reasonable.Then they introduce a rare character like Professor X.   He's really good (4-star).  If you buy a 42 pack which features him (3.2% chance per card draw of getting one of his three abilities) then there is about a 25% chance you don't get him in the draw of 42 cards.  ((1.0-0.032)^42)   What's the chance of getting all three abilities in a 42 pack?  Haven't done the math, but it must be around 5% or worse.So how much is a 42 pack?  15800 gold points.  You buy gold points for about 20000 for $100.   Therefore if you want a solid chance at getting all three abilities, you might pay about $400-$500.   You could get luckier.Knowing all this, I still bought a 42 pack this week and got two of the three abilities.   I was very lucky and I can barely resist buying another 42 pack.  That is the hook.Playing with the low level characters is very fun, there'se nothing wrong with it.  It's the desire and excitment about playing with a new one which makes you break your rules.BTW, the endpoint for cost of a slot for a character seems to be about 850 gold per slot.  That's about $4.25 per character once you have a fullish roster.   If you win a character, you pay $4.25 to keep it.  Fine.   But then you want the other 2 abilities that you didn't win.   Keep that under control and you will find this game reasonably priced.Oh, BTW, you do get all of the 1 and 2 star characters essentially for free over time and the cost of the extra slots is cheap at first.  It's the 3 and 4 stars that tempt you into paying.   You'll be happy in the moment and kind of sick in the long run.I saw a comment on a review which pointed out that any free to play game that you play for more than a couple of hours should have a massive thumbs-up.  OK, so thumbs up for that.  You'll love it for 5 or 10 hours, then you have to start resisting the temptation to pay.Having said all this, I can't argue with the thumbs-down reviews.  They're not bull####.  Watch your wallet if you start playing this, especially if you love it. "

YouTube™ Video: Steam Cleaning - Marvel Puzzle Quest 

			Views: 36		

			We crack open my year old account to play some good old fashion match three with a marvel twist. The premise is straightforward, match color gems to earn energy to fuel your team's special attacks.		

The premise is straightforward, match color gems to earn energy to fuel your team's special attacks.  Four clears a row, while five grants an extra turn.Teams are built up of three unique characters that you invest currency into to increase their power.  It can be daunting at first to jump into a F2P game, there is always that flashing notification to encourage you to spend money.However, Marvel Puzzle Quest is balanced well that if you choose to spend time over money you will find a good amount of success.

												Right so I've played this game for quite some time and it's a faily enjoyable timesink. I've been told it's like puzzle quest, only you have multiple people on your team so you can choose who to take hits from and there are more tactics to it.There is a pay-to-win strategy in that you can spend all your money to get tokens to buy powerful heroes (or villains) and have them on your team. The most powerful ones are the most expensive ones, obviously, with the biggest level cap. You can sell old cards you don't want as you have a limited roster of heroes to have and a limit of 3 in each battle.Beyond that, if you've played puzzle quest or any matching game you've got the idea of the game play to get at least 3 in a row, but here different characters deal different damage. For example, my group has Storm, Hawkeye and Iron Man. Iron Man deals the most damage with red so when they're matched he attacks and is open to attacks. Black ones Storm is most powerful at so she ends up in the firing line. they all have abilities based on colours you collect so there's also the tactic of wanting a really powerful ability to activate, but you can't use it unless you have X amount of this coloured jewel. For example, Iron Man's best power is Ultra Feron Beam which, at the moment, requires 19 Blue. 19 is a huge number, but with it he deals a huge amount of damage (which one-shots most villains by the time I get the amount) and even if it doesn't defeat them, it stuns them for 1 turn. Some abilities are direct attacks, stuns, destroys tiles, transforms tiles so depending on who's in your group, you can string together a large amount of abilities and combos to win the game.I only play this at a time sink for when I want to hear background commentary on a game or movie and it works well for that. Also every day if you win a combat you get given a special daily reward which can be anything from hero points (also attained in game) to hero cards. You also  will want to re-play many battles as there are alternate rewards where you can have the chance to win 1 out of 4 choices, but only a chance which forces a grind, but a enjoyable grind.			"

												This game is getting a lot of flak for having micro transactions, which is true it does have a number of boosts or tokens you can buy to cheese your way through the game, but that can all be pretty much ignored. Each hero you use has HP which can get hurt during a stage, heroes automatically heal themselves over time or you can use a medikit for a full heal which auto regenerates over time. This kind of mechanic can be seen in a lot of F2P games like Farmville or Travian. I had gotten though the first level/city/whatever without needing to spend a dime and in the second area boosts made an appearance which yes, you can buy, but you will also receive free boosts just by playing. The only thing that got on my nerve is each stage has 2-4 rewards for beating the level which are unique the first time you receive it, but then if you would receive that same reward you get a paltry 20 ISO (in game resource) so if you want a full clear you have to continually do the same stage over and over.

												So, the problem is we live in a world where Free to Pay is profitable. The good news is that despite the constant downvotes littering the CR board this is a Free to Pay thats viable without cashgasming. The gameplay  is on par with the puzzle quests that have preceeded it. Whats exciting here is that this looks extremely expandable. With the entire marvel universe up for grabs this has the potential to be a long play favorite for those willing to put in the time to progress. I for one have enjoyed the 12 or so hours i've played so far and haven't spent a single cent. Just sayin.			"

												This game has the standard gem matching elements, but with a great thematic quality with the Marvel Heroes.  I actually found myself matching specific color combinations over large combo chains just to maximize the hero abilities, so they have a definite impact on the standard matching gameplay.  There was a surprising amount of depth, but I do wish it had an option to turn off the flashing match hints that was readily apparent.  I'm sure it's in there somewhere and I haven't found it yet.

												Marvel puzzle quest’s game mechanic is amazing. As a fun of puzzle quest, I got hook to this game early on. However, the pay-to-enjoy aspect kills it for me. The game encourages players to have a large roster of heroes in order to enjoy a specific mission for the week. In order to increase your roster, you need to gain a currency which is acquired through drops from prologue battles, finishing a mission with a high ranking score than other players or purchase it with real money. Obtaining a hero you want or levelling a hero you have also requires too much time and money. Gaining a 1 or 2 star hero is not a problem. Getting a 3 to 4 star though is a different story. You either have to be lucky at getting a 3 star hero from the standard cover drop, finish a mission with a high ranking score, or use gold to get draw a cover from the mission drop. "

												Having burned a lot of hours on this game, I would love to give it a positive review. The gameplay is decent and the character balance is fairly good so long as one learns how their skills synergize with each other. The plot is nothing special, but it's better than the atrocity Marvel sold to us as the Dark Reign crossover event. It dragged to hell and just wasn't very good.So why am I refusing to recommend it? No, it isn't because of Pay 2 Win. Yes, the game suffers from that severely; people willing to burn hundreds of dollars on this game will quickly find themselves way above other players, with most high-ranking players having obviously bought their way to victory via cover upgrades and hero packs. But in the end, there can still be a satisfaction of working your way up to that level and doing a good job with what you can earn for free.The problem is the AI, which has been horrendous ever since the original Puzzle Quest and hasn't been improved in the slightest. You see, the thing with Puzzle Quest games is that their grids are not generated on the fly. Rather, each column has gems pre-generated for a good 20 drops in advance. The AI knows that; it is given full information to which gems are going to drop next, meaning it can set up combos by abusing information the player has no way of accessing.The result is that if you play this game, you should get used to losing not because you did bad, but because the AI made one move which escalated into 10-30 successful combinations, overloaded its resource pool and allowed it to spam you to death in one move. There was a time when I legitmately sat there for 30 seconds, doing nothing but watching as gems drop onto the field and immediately successfuly match themselves because of one enemy move.I could forgive Pay 2 Win, but I will never forgive artificial difficulty achieved via a cheating AI. As such, I cannot possibly recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Having played a ton of match-3 games I can safely say that Marvel Puzzle quest is one of the better options out there. Solid gameplay, frequently updated, tons of free stuff and new content roughly every 2-3 weeks. All of your favorite Marvel heroes in one game with many more to come. Unfortunately the game has become a bit of a grind fest with players having to sink in some 2-3 hours a day. I personally don't mind it but if you don't fancy playing for that long you might want to skip the game. My advice - give the game a go. Solid, fun , decent match-3 game on par with some of the other similar titles like Gems of War and Duelyst. Fan of the match-3 genre and superheroes? Give it a go, do it some justice and get hooked.			"

												I invested 10 bucks in the game to buy some slots.This way, after you collect a few heroes, you can shuffle them around while damaged ones heal.Other than that it's classic puzzlequest, save for the sometimes laggy port (stuttering/lags when moving tiles)It's a fine game but misses lots of fine nuances from the classic PQ (no puzzles, no mounts, no own castle, and so on)It's just lots of comic book covers which improve the spells of characters you already have.If played in short bursts, absolutely fine.

												I invested 10 bucks in the game to buy some slots.This way, after you collect a few heroes, you can shuffle them around while damaged ones heal.Other than that it's classic puzzlequest, save for the sometimes laggy port (stuttering/lags when moving tiles)It's a fine game but misses lots of fine nuances from the classic PQ (no puzzles, no mounts, no own castle, and so on)It's just lots of comic book covers which improve the spells of characters you already have.If played in short bursts, absolutely fine.

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is a free to play game.  It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok.  Uses match 3 puzzle system.  Has Marvel characters and story.  Can level up characters, use charged powers.  Your characters can get knocked out in a puzzle and lose the puzzle round.  Could be challenging.  You might wanna read the negative reviews.  Try it, maybe you might like it.For more info:

												It wants to be fun but the AI is poorly written, often getting so many free turns from random falling tiles matching that it's turn goes on for a minute or more, with the computer getting several extra moves. When it isn't giving itself exactly what it needs it is making poor moves and not a challenge. Seriously needs some balancing, could be a much better game and that's not mentioning the constant suck that is pay to win/pay to progress games.			"

												I can really recommend this Puzzle Quest in the Marvel universe.The adventures are plenty and fun, there are unique events every day so you won't get bored, and the tactics are nice and varied (big differences between fighting goons and fighting heroes). Since you play 3 characters with up to 3 powers each (and there are a lot of characters) you'll have plenty of choice and it's fun to maximize the efficiency of your team.It does have a rather peculiar monetization system (it's free-to-play), which I have read nothing but negative comments about, but I honestly do not mind it at all, which is really weird since typically I wouldn't touch game like this with a 5 feet pole.I watched TotalBiscuits WTF is.. of this game and so didn't expect much of it. Thought I'd deinstall in 5 mins. Instead I have been playing a lot. On and off while doing other stuff, just taking the time to let the heroes heal back up. Played this way, in between multitasking, I really like this game. I recommend you watch TotalBiscuits (or another) review though. The monetization system can put you off.			"

												Dont judge my hours I was playing this when Steam was down for me about an hour.NOTE: This is a mobile port.+ clean UI but only in puzzle fights+ its free and is based on Marvel characters+ its kinda fun, especially in multiplayer/adictive+ has a LOT of updates, something you wont see for all F2P games- horrible interface outside of puzzle fights- mobile port(tap to continue shows, very lazy)- tutorial that is too long and is treating you like a dumb (its trying to teach me how to match 2 games in a row?)- looks cheaply done- lacks substance from Puzzle Quest and is clunky- P2W, paying for spaces and to heal heroes, I dont mind grinding if the game is solid but it isnt and WAITING 3 HOURS for heroes to heal, God No.Conclusion: Devs shoudnt have been this lazy and should have worked on REAL PC version and is falling in the trap of P2W  free games.

												Even if it's just a passing glance, you owe it to yourself to play this. A simple mechanic that becomes much deeper as you gather heroes into your party. There are PvE quests with storylines and also tournaments against other players. It's a nice distraction for those who want to unwind without the fuss that other games put you through. Be warned that with these types of games if you play PvP you will run into people that have dropped money on the rarer and stronger characters. Also, you cannot link your account if you have already played the mobile version of this.			"

												Love the puzzle quest games and the theme on this but wish it had a cloud save function so different computers don't have different save points. Your heroes seem to be located only on the machine that you are playing on. The Steam version saves only local content.There's also some other annoying items like some screens don't scroll down for me to get to information below.I'd also recommend that if you do plan on investing time in the game to actually play the mobile version. That version will save a copy of your characters to Facebook and allow you to play across multiple devices. The Steam version does not.It's good for me to just kill time. Don't expect to go very far into the game unless you want to deal with microtransactions.			"

Pros:-Just like bejewled, but with super heroes and special abilities!-Fun gameplay with a campaign mode-Weekly and weekend tournaments where you can pick how difficult you want your opponent to be-Is not pay 2 have fun at all!Cons:-Can be p2w-A bit grindy (this is why the game is p2w)			"

												TO clarify at the start, i am Recommending the Mobile version, NOT the PC version.I play this game pretty reguarly on mobile and the majority of complaints i see come from the timers for heroes to heal and microtransactions. The microtransactions were recently inflated to obscene prices on mobile as well but in all honesty you do not need them to enjoy the game, i advise spending Iso cyrstal on levelling your heros and after a couple of lighting rounds and other events you'll amass heroes faster than you can get space to hold them all. Im at 19 character spaces without paying for any 'fun' coinsAs for the Timers of health regen, It was originally designed as a mobile game/ gate mechanism to prevent you from playing the whole game endlessly. That obviously does not fit well here on PC, but i spend weeks playing this on the mobile to return each day to play a bit more until i get bored or all my main characters are awaiting regen.The game itself however is your typical Puzzle quest game! A match 3 gem game where any colours you match are stored for use as Powers that your characters have. The game ends when you reduce the enemy team to 0HP. I won't lie, sometimes you will feel cheated by the game for chaining colours and anniliating your team, but it happens sometimes for your benifit as well. Also some battles are so artifically hard thats about my only legitimate complaint about it. When you come up against a level 230 Venom as an optional mission, yeah you'll skip it but think how your even supposed to complete it as currently most chracters can only reach Lv 141.But to re-iterate, i really enjoy this game. Even the ""PvP"" aspects which are just more single player matches vs an AI using another players characters. The choice shouldn't be about wether to play it or not, it should be about what platform to play it on.  And i choose Mobile.			"

												Microtransactions suck but if the gameplay is good enough it can still be a good game worth playing. The problem I have with this game is that it is clearly not finished and they are charging money for the products they are producing.The quality of the menus, graphics, user interface are poor. They did not even bother to add voice to the characters.The original Puzzle Quest had much better sounds effects and music. While playing the game I noticed there are basic issues with functioning of selecting enemies to attack, displaying what moves the enemy has made, what is required to continue on the story missions, what is expected of the player to have done up to the point of challenges , pvp, or bosses.My problem with this game is that the core game is not complete. To the people complaining about microtransactions in a free to play game: lol.			"

												I've played this game ALOT on my android phone, and just saw this released today on steam.  Thinking i could play my game on my PC without draining my phone battery all the time i quickly loaded it up.  The problem is....it doesn't access your activity from your phone.  It's a completely different server/database even though it's the *exact* same game.  Having grinded a ton on the phone version, i'm simply unwilling to put in the work to get back the same stuff i have now, and anyone else doing this on android will probably think the same thing.That said, the game is very fun once you grind through for a week or so and get an idea for what good character combinations are.  Fans of Puzzle Quest will be very pleased with the way it plays, though you'll find yourself skipping the dialog which is something i never did in puzzle quest.  Pick it up, and don't worry about spending money.  There's a very limited # of characters right now, and there's many ways to win them.  Only spend money if you want more variety of characters when you first start out, or if you're taking the tournaments seriously.  They're serious time sinks and more characters are required to grind out 2-6pt matches to get top 10.			"

It's a great twist to the puzzle quest formula with teams making up the player characters. It's a Free2Play game, but doesn't really feel like it's free to win, since I haven't identified any sort of a versus mode. You earn resources fairly quickly, I was buying new characters to spare after the tutorial missions alone.			"

												This game is fun, but given that in-game stuff describes it as a work in progress, it really ought to be labelled as Early Access.Anyway, it's fairly normal puzzle quest-type gameplay, and it's good. The character progression largely works. If you want to progress with any speed, you will need to sink some money into the game - but then, you have to do that for most games to get them in the first place. If you want to consistently place high in the events, you'll probably need to spend more money, but I guess that's cool if you care about it that much.			"

												I originally recommended this game, but no longer do. The primary reason is that power creep makes it so that you can put in thousands of hours into the game, but still have a worse roster than someone who put in a fraction of that effort in the last 2-3 months. Unless you are willing to spend at least 6-8+ hours a day into a game like this, and at odd times, I don't recommend it. Original review below.===This is quite a decent puzzle quest (match-3) setup with the additional backdrop of the Marvel universe. The biggest difference between this and a typical puzzle quest is the addition of timer counters, which trigger effects for either side. There is also the addition of standard attack and hp for each character, based on the color matched. This triggering difference leaves you trying to balance the matching of strong attacks with trying to get rid of opponents stronger timed attacks. Strategy wise, often you have to allow certain timed attacks to go off. Some pvp enemies also do not make moves at all, but attack only with timer counters.Leveling is restricted by a character power level, based on the abilities of your hero and the level of those abilities, raised by an ingenious card system. These ability cards are won through missions, tournaments, and general pvp play. Of course the rarer character ability cards are hard to get and require many hours of investment.There are 2 main types of currency, Iso-8 or xp (the common currency) for leveling up characters, and Hero points (rare currency) for gaining additional hero spots. Any other use of Hero points is mostly a waste. Honestly, the monetization is a little ridiculous. Iso-8  is not worth buying at all unless you are a pay to achieve kind of person. There is a huge temptation to buy Hero Points when you just need a few more to recruit the next hero. Character balancing has been decent overall, though many characters are plain useless unless you manage to level them up, or they are temporarily 'iso' boosted for a tournament. Overall, this is a great time-waster and quite addictive. I can't count the number of times where I was like, just one more game before I go to bed, even after 100 instances like that had already passed. I really have to quit playing this game. After one more round.			"

												Pros: Fun match game. Characters are designed well with their theme given the limited scope of a match 3 game. Easy and addicting to start.Cons: Pay to win. There is a lot of power creep with the goal of forcing in app purchases no matter how much you have already spent. You cant effectively play new characters till 6+ months after release unless you wan to pay 100$ each. Too much time is required to earn rewards that have an increasing chance of providing no value.			"

												GAMEPLAYBasic design is 3-vs-3 team of super heroes where each hero has 2-3 powers and they level up with XP. You do Bejeweled style color matches to build up the powers and activate the power which either affects the board to your favor (like forming defensive shields, invisibility for your character, bleed damage tiles, secret trap tiles, count-down timers that have some affect, and many other tile types that are essentially damage, buffs, debuffs, heals and so on). As time goes on and you win matches you gather both XP (called ISO-8) and character covers (new characters, new powers, or level-ups for existing powers). You build your character, you level them and have fun.MODESThere are two main Modes:1) Story - You play a storyline with a lot of different types of teams you fight and this is called the ""PvE"" side of things in the game.2) Versus - You play matches against the computer where they other people's teams are computer-controlled.Both modes very fun.MICROTRANSACTIONSMicrotransactions do speed up the game for you but are NOT required. You can start out easily and keep playing it and you will easily get good characters reasonably quickly. Alternately, spend $5 to $20 like a normal game and get your boost.PROsThe game is very well designed. There is a lot to do and the devs are constantly working to add more and fix the existing, Many fun events all week long. Great gameplay that is easy to pick up but the strategy is deep. All your favorite Marvel superheroes.It simply is a good addictive game. YMMVMicrotransactions help you speed things up.CONsCurrently the only downside is that the PC version and the Mobile version are kept completely separate so if you start on one you are stuck using that version as all your progress is limited to that version. This *needs* fixing but so far nothing. :/TLDRYou are doing your gamerself a disservice if you don't spend at least a few hours playing this game. :) It is excellent and strongly recommended.			"

												I have to say I completely disagree with what the top reviews are for this game.First off let me say that it is FREE TO PLAY & not pay to win.The in game currencies that everyone is raving about are really given to you quite often. I would like to point out that you cant simply pay your way to the ultimate team of characters. Really it is quite smart in that you have to get ""covers"" that unlock your powers & let you level up from in game rewards. It can be frustrating as hell when you can't get the cover you need to level up but it also means you can just drop $30 on your hero (or villian) & perfect them. The other side of this is in my experience you are only matched with players who are of a similar skill level to you. You shouldn't be getting nerfed at anytime.I have only spent real world money on expanding the amount of heroes I can have & I didn't even need to do that, just wanted to have more people. I would say it cost me $8 bucks because I did it a couple of times. It's worth noting though that I was given plenty enough of the game gold for free, I just chose to spend it like an idiot on trying to get rare players!With that I would like to give out some hints that are really going to save you alot of time.#Use the in game gold that you get through playing to expand your roster first instead of trying to get rare characters. The more slots you have the more likely you can level up. Also means with mulitple characters you can play with one set while the other heals.#Pick two (maybe even 2) of the one star heroes at the start (Iron man, Black Widow, Storm, Juggernaught, Venom,) & focus on levelling them up. Cover drops are ultra common & a fully powered level 50 one star player is really powerful, you can beat much higher levels if you use skill. I have got other characters far past level 50 & still throw Storm in against high level players because here powers are so strong.#Play the daily events. Even if you only have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ characters you can at least get a cover drop from playing only 1 or 2 matches.#Don't forget when you are starting out that in the daily events you can skip a match if you think you will lose. There is a button in the lower left hand cornerAnyway, obviously I enjoy the game. It's a great time waster (as you can see by my hours) You can choose to trust me or you can choose to trust someone with .2 hours game time. Good luck!			"

												So yeah, it's another match-3 color game. I saw a lot of people say it is not as good as the original puzzle quest and yet it is a very fun and addicting game.Beyond the basic mechanic of lining 3 colors to progress you have many interesting features. First of all, you have to collect hero cards(which drop randomly after a game was won, or you can buy them). Before the start of each game you can select 3 heroes to play with. Each hero has skills, which can be activated if you accumulated enough gems of a certain color. The game is lacking in some social interaction options, but the developers update the game from time to time and balance heroes.In the end it's a very colorful and addicting game, and hey, who doesn't want to make their own superhero team.

												I really enjoy this game, and would recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games. It is a free-to-play model, which may frustrate some, but I found it to be no problem, since the basic gameplay is solid enough to warrant a decent playthrough. Admittedly I have not played a lot in the PC version, since I started off with Android, but I find this game to have a decently attractive presentation.Graphics: The character designs are interesting, and the animation is decent, especially for a free to play puzzle game.Concept: This is basic puzzle quest, except there are up to three characters on each side per battle instead of one. The leveling system is a little odd, since leveling your characters requires ISO, but leveling their powers requires covers, which can be bought or won in game. Some covers are aggravatingly hard to get, but it shouldn't stop anyone from enjoying the game, because the lack of leveling one hero's powers does not break the overall experience.Sound: Overall, the sound design is good. I wouldn't say it was amazing, since the music is repetitive and generic and the sound effects accompanying each power can get old once a certain power is used multiple times in a battle. The sound won't win any awards in my book, but it is decent enough to not detract from the experience of playing this game.Replayability: This game is really replayable. The basic concept is solid, and the gameplay, although it relies a bit on luck, is addicting and engaging. Levels in the game can also be replayed for different rewards, which encourages another playthrough. In most games, backtracking is considered a chore, but in this one I find it to be worth while, since the main gameplay is fun, and it is not to tedious or necessary to complete further levels in the game. In other words, it is optional to those who are completionists, or who are looking for something in particular.Grade: 8/10 (Honestly, a number cannot truly describe an experience, but I am including it for reference and a quick glance to see the sum of the parts I have described.)I hope all find this helpful in determining if this is the right game for them.

I'll simply play another game while this one is ""charging up my heroes""I Just about finished the game's ""Prologue"" which seems to be the whole game other than the events, and in these events I end up ranking at 45-150 place... I do believe anyone (EDIT) COULD  have HAD fun without spending or complaining about moneyif Mister Number One wants to spent a buttload of cash to have all of his heroes maxed and be an invincible player, good for him, I'll keep playing with mere mortals down here.EDIT: as of now, I'm dropping this game, since they made a tad boring to play as a mere mortal, no big deal, it was a fun game, and if it were a regular game, bought at steam stores, without in game purchases, I would grab it in a second, now things just take too long and cost too much to be worthwhile, I recommended the game once, and changed my vote, nice going, you can, most certainly, take the free players away from free-to-play games!

												This game is very much like a Match 3 Collectible Card Game.  Basically through playing rounds and being ranked highly for an event you get in-game currency, and cards to either upgrade or add to your roster.  The characters each have skills which can be used after you destroy enough of that color gem.Each character I've seen so far has different attacks from the next one.Unfortunately this game has no actual interaction between players asside from an alliance system.[at this time]  It feels like a grind machine, but there are stories associated with a lot of the events. As far as the game goes I would recommend it for anybody that wants a simple game to play to waste time.			"

												Something about mixing the match 3 of candy that i never liked, with Marvel has created a great game. While it may be wanting you to spend money, you do not have to. And trust me it gets better with the more heros, all the stratergy behind each move. Anyway, if you like match 3 games or mavel this is a great time waster			"

												This game is very much like a Match 3 Collectible Card Game.  Basically through playing rounds and being ranked highly for an event you get in-game currency, and cards to either upgrade or add to your roster.  The characters each have skills which can be used after you destroy enough of that color gem.Each character I've seen so far has different attacks from the next one.Unfortunately this game has no actual interaction between players asside from an alliance system.[at this time]  It feels like a grind machine, but there are stories associated with a lot of the events. As far as the game goes I would recommend it for anybody that wants a simple game to play to waste time.			"

												The reviews for this game on Steam are generally negative, and that is unfair. This is a free to play game, that does feature strong incentives to spend on microtransactions, and that is, indeed, hatefull. I am the first to agree that something is very wrong in the industry right now regarding the f2p model. However, I believe a game should still be judged by how good a game it is in its own right. And this match 3 game is, in that regard, quite spectacular. The implementation of the original puzzle quest design is great, the look and feel of the game is pleasing and professional (it looks way better than puzzle quest 2, and better than most games of the genre), and there is a deep strategic level to the gameplay, which is quite surprising. Moreover, the use of the Marvel IP is clever. There is a pretty nice story going on, which is tied up with events on the comics, with the intentional cheesy but great dialogues that are a staple of the genre. Collecting your favorite heroes from Marvel universe is a fun activity in itself. There is a good variety of heroes, from both X-men and Avengers comics, alongside playable villains and rarer heroes (Punisher and Invisible Woman, for instance). Each hero play different, with obvious dps, tank and support roles, so that finding a team that works well together, and the right way to level them so they will interplay efficiently, is an interesting challenge. It delivers on all its promisses, being both a good Marvel game, and a good, a very good indeed, Puzzle game. It's microtransactions scheme is a big flaw, something I wish I would never encounter in any other game again. Unfortunately, that is where the industry is right now, and it is killing otherwise great games.			"

												Disclaimer:  Yes I have used the microtransactions and have invested money into this game, but I did so not out of a feeling of being underpowered to enjoy the game, but after nearly 60 hours of game time.Ok, that out of the way, I have to say that I really enjoy Marvel Puzzle Quest.  If you can just set aside the microtransaction part of the game, there is a lot of game here to enjoy.  Once you get to know the basics of the heal mechanics as well as learn the abilities of the characters in your stable, it becomes highly strategic and addictive.  You will want to get engrossed in the cycle of fighting through the ""campaign"" missions to earn recruitment drops in the hopes of upgrading your stable.  Once you have your ""go-to"" team, you'll take place in the daily challenges which are something like a-synchronous matches with other players where you earn points toward a reward.  The more points you accumulate through battling other teams, the higher up the ranking ladder you climb, but the higher you are, the more you are worth in points to those below you.  These ""tournaments"" can become highly addictive as you constantly battle and check your standing, and the instant feedback is pretty gratifying.  Its also pretty intimidating when you see other players that have level 100+ characters.  But I just placed 1st in a tournament with only level 40 or so characters, so it can be done without being ridiculously overpowered, hence the strategy.  The other cool thing is the variants of the powers and the characters, and a feel of wanting to collect them and get them leveled up.  This however is where my only complaint comes in.  Your roster size is limited by a slot system.  And you have to pay for slots using the in-game ""hero points"" currency.  Depending on how you play and how well you do in the events, you may come to a point that you have more waiting recruits, not enough slots, and not enough hero points to unlock new slots.  The game gives you 7 days before recruits you earned expire, and that may or may not be enough time to earn enough hero points to fix them in your squad.  It is the only ""micro-trap"" that I have seen really.All in all I have over 170+ hours on the game now, and I would gladly recommend it to anyone. "

												Marvel + Puzzle Quest has got to be illegal.  The substance is so addictive, it's probably regulated by the government.Marvel Puzzle Quest is pretty much what it sounds like.  It's a Bejeweled-style game with Marvel Heroes.  You pick a 3-hero team and battle against a computer controlled team.  As you make matches, you gain ""Action Points"" to activate one of the abilities of heroes to do damage.  Whoever wipes the other team wins. There's a cash shop element, of course.  All cash-shop money can be earned in game.  Purple money is earned pretty regularly, and Gold money is earned by ranking in the tournaments.  You don't need to spend money to get anywhere in the game.  It just takes longer.The game is updated constantly.  New story events, new tournaments, and new rewards come in two or three times a week.  There's plenty to do.  I do recommend setting up a facebook account so you can gift/receive rewards that come in.  It speeds up leveling up your characters significantly.Overall, this game is a great time waster.  Give it a try.			"

												If you like bejeweled and you're a fan of marvel super heroes than this is an awesome combination. For me the bejeweled basics with the hero element added on top is fun to play with. The way to progress through the levels however isn't.The game mechanics work in a way that you use your hero during combat and you steal points from your opponent. Your opponent does the same to you. When the round ends, your hero ends with a number of life points left. This number of points slowly regenerates to full health. This makes the game a combination of waiting and playing.The money to invest into the game to keep playing without interuptions isnt worth it. Although it got me a bit hooked on the game, playing regular bejeweled is more fun for the money involved.If this game would be realeased as a paid title I will be interested to play it, but not in the current format.

Personally i enjoy playing this game, although it can be a bit frustrating when randomly you don't get the items you were expecting and when a free to play game makes you want to spend money so you can have room to save the heroe cards you won (for example). It can also get a little boring, because it's a bit repetitive in the challenges and gameplay.			"

												I'm a mobile user, I kind of wished that I started here but the effects would still be the same. This is a P2W game all the way. I've been using the app for over a year and the only reason I haven't deleted it is because I've invested so much time in it. But I deleted The Quest For Stuff and that Simpsons one when they kept moving the goal posts further and further until you could only reach them if you paid for it. I'm going off track but it's kind of related.Everything about this game is severely P2W, the majority of updates ove the past year has been catered to ""the elite"" so they can stay in their position by paying for it. When I first started playing they were still introducing third tier characters, when they introduced fourth level characters they were available in standard character packs as I managed a neat couple of drops.Then things started changing, when fourth and fifth tiers started developing they dropped even fourth tier characters from standard packs. The drop level even for third tier dropped with standard packs and a legendary option was added, but to achieve this token you'd have to parcipate in PvP and PvE events with over the top achievements to get there. I work fourty hours a week, even devoting two hours in the morning before work, playing sporadically through my breaks and a couple of hours after work gets me nowhere, My points always end up halfway to where it's needed even with everything I put in. It seems like if I want to achieve anything in this game I need to quit my job and devote my entire life too it,The P2W goes even further with later updates, not only can you upgrade tiers 2/3/4/5, if the character is already maxed out you can make them chanpions then up their levels even more. I've been playing for over a year and this game is still finding ways to punish me and reward the people who throw money at it even more,Pro's\Con's:There's a variety of characters, just be prepared to pay for them.There's a variety of events, just be prepared to pay for them too,			"

												I didn't think a 'Puzzle Quest Game' about Marvel could actually be any fun but it is. Those unfamiliar with Puzzle Quest; it's not about just mindlessly matching colors like in Bejeweled. If you don't either plan out your moves (based on your team/moveset) or prevent your enemy from planning theirs, you'll find yourself quite easily defeated.However.. with this game being both another Marvel game as well as being Free-2-Play it shouldn't come as a surprise that the game does have Pay-2-Win elements even though there is no real-time PvP. That said, I'm one of the very few people out there who would still recommend this game.There's still plenty of enjoyment you can get out of this game without paying by either treating it as a casual 'facebook game' or by just playing it really smart. The latter really goes a long way if you understand the mechanics and are able to master your playstyle/heroes.			"

												This is my third review of the game. I've spent over 900 hours playing MPQ and for the most part I did enjoy most of my time on the game. I've gotten to know a decent amount of people and I've been in some of the best alliances the game had to offer on the pve side of things. I did do pvp sometimes but to me what MPQ isn't real pvp, it's simulated so I really wasn't into it.MPQ is a fun puzzle game but I can't recommend this game UNLESS you plan on putting in some serious cash or you don't care about being a top player or in a top alliance. Understand that you can play as a free player and have fun, but if you are trying to compete in pve and/or pvp you might want to pass MPQ up. There was always a pay to win aspect of the game but it wasn't that bad till the new year(2016) started and Champion Levels began and when it did I decide it was time to end my time on MPQ. I want to add that this wasn't the only thing leading up to my deature from MPQ. There were several big events I got screwed by sever issues and to put a lot of time in all week to get screwed by sever issues isn't fun. If you are a top player and in a top alliance you understand how much this matters when competing.On a side note, some of the publishers I've gotten to know during my time playing were pretty kool.

												Not sure what all of the hate is about over this one.It's puzzle quest with a different theme in a F2P format. I didn't think I'd be playing this too much, but I've actually put in a good bit of time. Bit of a mix of strategy and frustration and I have not found the F2P mechanic all that limiting. If you are obsessed with advancing quickly or be able to recover instantly from a loss, yes - sooner or later you're going to need to lay some money down. As other positive reviewers have stated, develop your free characters - use your game currency for character slots and just play the game. Repeat your missions until you get all of the possible loot - some of the tutorials missions only have 1 reward, however after that they have from 2-4. After the first day or two, you should get 2 free characters from a large pool. I thought I was lucky with 2 uncommon heroes - modern hawkeye and cap, but my son received a rare spiderman and a legendary x-force wolverine. The event system has a reward structure of its own, and you can win many of the missions even with a new team. Most of the missions I have seen have a pre-assigned hero that joins you for that fight and you can leverage them to help win fights you would not normally be able to pull off. If you sink everything into 1 character you're going to be sitting around waiting for a long time if they get ko'd in a fight, so try to spread the iso-8 around when your can. Unlike PQ, you do not heal automatically after a fight. Your characters need time to heal up and this is lengthened a bit if they were ko'd. You can acquire medkits which will give you a full heal, but if you are reckless, rely too heavily on one character to win your missions - or just not very good at the game you will burn through them quckly.

												First of all the time displayed about how long I've played isn't really accurate. I just have the game running in a window a lot of the time and am not playing it but it still looks to Steam like I'm playing itOK that out of the way. I see a lot of people are hating on this game and I can appreciate a lot of people will hate it because it is so very pay to win. Here's another perspective from someone who hasn't paid anything for it. I've had maybe 5 solid hours gameplay out of this, really enjoyable gameplay too. You only get so long to play free then you need more health and such and that's the point you're supposed to pay. That's the point when I leave the game.I let it recharge then come back the next time for another go. Because I can't just sit there and play for hours on end, it makes matches meaningful. A few losses are devastating and that's it for the day really but getting it right with the wins is then extremely rewarding. This game was always designed to be something you dip into and that's what I love about it. Fire it up, have a bit of fun for a short while and I'm done and back to surfing for pictures of cute cats.Now my complaints. I would really like to pay for this game because I like it. The problem is real money gets you so little its just not worth it. 5 health and enough iso8 to start to upgrade one character for £6.99 is just not good enough. Not even remotely inticing. If the DLC (lol) ever goes on sale, I'll be very interested but right now, no thanks, I'll just dip in now and again for free and enjoy what's there until its taken away			"

												If you want to play Puzzle Quest with a Marvel paint, here you go.  It is a fun game, but there are a lot of negatives to it.  There's a large roster of characters to play with and there is some interesting strategy you can employ while playing the game, but the strategy is a bit lost in the fact you can only fight AIs.  They force you to change up your roster because characters need time to heal or revive from the last battle they've been in; this is good because loss monotany, but bad if you enjoy just playing specific characters.  It is possible to enjoy the game for free, but spending money on the game definitely gives pay players an edge over free players.I still recommend it for a fun distraction, but if you want a deeper Puzzle Quest, play puzzle quest.

												This game is surprisingly fun.  The character abilities are a bit limited but being able to level them and the character itself allows for the challenge level to develope without crippling you.  Basic mechanics are solid and, while luck is a huge factor like any simple match 3 game, there is definitely room for strategy.  Is the game perfect.  Heck no.  There are too few character slots so you wind up either selling a ton of characters or paying some cash to make room for them.  However, you can play the game for a while without spending cash if you are willing to grind rewards a bit.Play the game, have some fun and then spend a little to support the effort.  When you hit a wall that requires a serious investment, move on to a new game.			"

												It's puzzle quest in all its glory, but sped up a bit from the longer battles of puzzle quest 2, the free to play model is for the most parts well integrated in the early stages, so far i don't feel handicapped for not spending money, except for rosters, you have to play to get/unlock new heroes, which makes sense, but the amount of gold required to then use the heroes instead of discarding them is obscene.Despite that it's a great game, don't expect to beat it without spending months grinding or pay 50 euro+, but as a fun casual game for a couple of weeks it does the job.

												This game is good for casual players but in all honesty...its not the game that will captivate your interest. Its good until you realise that the game doesnt have much to offer... you just go on from puzzle to puzzle trying to hone your skills in ""matching colors"" and thats it. If you have nothing better to do then this game can be quite entertaining. Its not the game that you will want to pay for or that you will be excited about to play. The only reason why i recommend it is because i played it for more than most other free to play games (which means that it is atleast fun to play) =)			"

												Watch out !  This game will suck your time like no other.If you like Puzzle Quest, you will love this game.  In addition to the use of Marvel characters, it also add a variety of contests.  Would have loved to share the same progress over cloud but you will have to set up different user for iphone, Ipad and PC.  Graphic wise this is like any other modern card games with beautifully rendered cards and a fairly slick interface.  Having played for over 30 hours, there is really no major story lines.  Both the story on the in-game campaigns and the tournament has very simple story lines and the dialogs are terrible.  Gameplay is where this game really shine.  If you have played Puzzle Quest, you will not exactly what to expect.  Simple to learn, hard to master.  The tournaments are somewhat skewed towards players with better cards which brings me to the freemium nature of the game.  Overall, I have not spent a single cents and it is still enjoyable.  Having said that, it is hard to compete in tournaments against people who is willing to spent some cash which is to be expected.    "

												Marvel + Puzzle Quest has got to be illegal.  The substance is so addictive, it's probably regulated by the government.Marvel Puzzle Quest is pretty much what it sounds like.  It's a Bejeweled-style game with Marvel Heroes.  You pick a 3-hero team and battle against a computer controlled team.  As you make matches, you gain ""Action Points"" to activate one of the abilities of heroes to do damage.  Whoever wipes the other team wins. There's a cash shop element, of course.  All cash-shop money can be earned in game.  Purple money is earned pretty regularly, and Gold money is earned by ranking in the tournaments.  You don't need to spend money to get anywhere in the game.  It just takes longer.The game is updated constantly.  New story events, new tournaments, and new rewards come in two or three times a week.  There's plenty to do.  I do recommend setting up a facebook account so you can gift/receive rewards that come in.  It speeds up leveling up your characters significantly.Overall, this game is a great time waster.  Give it a try.			"

												1 out of 5 SupervillainsI was intrigued by the concept of Puzzle Quest and I am a superhero fan. So this game has to be fantastic, right? And it is. The Bejeweled mechanic combined with special abilities works just fine. And the level system for new skills for your heroes motivates. Thumb up! (5 out of 5 Superheroes so far.)So why no recommendation and only 1 out of 5 points?1. The game is designed to be slow. Your heroes get hurt in battle and heal over time.2. Resources are scarce. Whatever you do, you have to choose on what to invest your resources.3. You get overwhelmed with opportunities. You don't have enough resources to follow each and every path at the same time.All those problems sound like good game mechanics for strategists. But they are just designed to motivate the player to pay money. I don't have a problem with a free2play game to offer options for payment. But Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign is pay2win. I tried it quite a while to see some higher hero levels and some more content. But in the end only one thing is certain: without payment you loose.You loose heroes, because you don't have enough character slots.You loose events, because your heroes don't heal fast enough, to win enough battles.And in the end, you loose either money or motivation.The game creates a highly motivating circle of simple/casual gameplay, challange, success and reward. It creates an addiction for more success. With new rewards you feel confident to beat new challanges. And the more you succeed the more you get. It's addictive.But the rewards are never enough. And you start to become frustrated.To be clear one more time: this game is designed to be pay2win. And if you don't pay, it hurts you. It is more than other free2play games for which you need more time to get better. This game makes gifts to you but if you are not good (=rich) enough, it takes them back. It destroys you, until you pay or leave.It beats you. But not on the common battlefield New York, but in your head.			"

												The game is really fun to play and has a fairly curious story. There are some problems with it though. The levelling of the characters using the in-game currency (which you have limited amounts of) is kinda stupid, but passable. The fact that you have to wait for your characters to heal is also weird, but presumably a leftover from being an android port. All things considered this makes the game perfect for breaks, but not for longer sittings, as it will at some point force you to leave and do something else. So if you just want a game that you can play on your lunch break, or when you are taking a break from studying go for it. Otherwise you might get disappointed.			"

												This game is a cash grab pure and simple.Seriously.I started the game was forced to buy the default chars, fine. This game is PAINFUL to get started.  Everything is painful unless you pay for coins to unlock better cards... no joke..  I can't upgrade my characters because I don't have gold, They don't reward you with gold that often... In my area one map I earned about 150 gold ... it takes 525 to buy  an upgrade that way ....  So now you have to grind the exact same level over and over for crystal and you need 400 to get a shot a crap pack in the hopes to get the same char you already have inorder to unlock and ability to ACTUALLY LEVEL THE CHAR UP SO THEY GET MORE HP.... Everytime you get hit with a progress blocker your reminded that you can pay real money to get past is.I just fought Dr Doom in the first act.  He blasted all my lvl 2 char's and my second attemp went worse than the first.  So all my characters are dead and reviving then after that they have to heal ...  UNLESS I PAY GOLD...I say steer clear of this game.If you want to see it in action for yourself you can watch Totalbiscut on youtube first look this game.			"

												The reviews for this game on Steam are generally negative, and that is unfair. This is a free to play game, that does feature strong incentives to spend on microtransactions, and that is, indeed, hatefull. I am the first to agree that something is very wrong in the industry right now regarding the f2p model. However, I believe a game should still be judged by how good a game it is in its own right. And this match 3 game is, in that regard, quite spectacular. The implementation of the original puzzle quest design is great, the look and feel of the game is pleasing and professional (it looks way better than puzzle quest 2, and better than most games of the genre), and there is a deep strategic level to the gameplay, which is quite surprising. Moreover, the use of the Marvel IP is clever. There is a pretty nice story going on, which is tied up with events on the comics, with the intentional cheesy but great dialogues that are a staple of the genre. Collecting your favorite heroes from Marvel universe is a fun activity in itself. There is a good variety of heroes, from both X-men and Avengers comics, alongside playable villains and rarer heroes (Punisher and Invisible Woman, for instance). Each hero play different, with obvious dps, tank and support roles, so that finding a team that works well together, and the right way to level them so they will interplay efficiently, is an interesting challenge. It delivers on all its promisses, being both a good Marvel game, and a good, a very good indeed, Puzzle game. It's microtransactions scheme is a big flaw, something I wish I would never encounter in any other game again. Unfortunately, that is where the industry is right now, and it is killing otherwise great games.			"

Only sucky heroes drop, and there comes a point in the game when even with max level free heroes get one shot.  Farming only seems to help marginally, as pre-defeated duels give a true pittance of experience.  Unless you've got 50 bucks a week to spend on pay to win or just want a casual game, pass on this.

												Sad that game tells you to buy starter heroes and once you waste your credits it doesn't give you the starter heroes if you already purchased one previously. If you buy Hawkeye or BlackWidow, dont buy the other one, you won't have space and you cannot delete heroes already attained to ensure room when you spend credits. So loose credits and no new character if you already have 4 heroes.

												Unless you have HEAPS of time, or are willing to not advance in a LONG time, you shouldn't invest time in this game. For starters, the ""story mode"" is pretty much limited, and frankly, subpar. To continue, the brunt of the game is PVP. The basics of the game are 2 days tournaments, after which you earn some prize based on your position. You can get some minor rewards based on performance. But here's the thing. You'll be fighting random people, some of them have spent thousands of dollars in this game, and are pretty much unbeatable, making a free player unable to get in the top 10.Also the game lies in the avaliable languages department. Yes, it says it's in spanish... and the game is right... as long as you call spanish something with untranslated lines of text, and has blind idiot translations (check tvtropes) for the rest of it. I mean ""Ironman se parte""? You'd need ""Ironman breaks himself""/""Ironman shatters himself""/""Ironman laughs his♥♥♥♥♥off"" for that. And yes, ""Ironman laughs his♥♥♥♥♥off"" is what spanish readers will read. It's quite a funny idea, having all these heroes laughing at each other. Power descriptions are quite inacurate, too. I have to assume that every other language is riddled with these bad translation issues, but can't say for sure. The Spanish translation, at least, is even worse than using google translator. So there's that.There's also the luck factor. Sometimes luck is against you. I know that it's par for the course in a puzzle-quest game, but, for the heck of it, I spent literally 4 minutes watching how the computer cascaded after removing 3 piezes on the uppermost line. That kind of luck means you'll have to spend at least one hour and a half waiting for recovery packs, in order to try another game.And that's the final issue for me: Downtime. In every battle, for the most part, you'll get hurt, at least a little. And then you need to spend downtime recovering. At first, it doesn't look like it's too much. five minutes or so, for the first few levels. Then you level up, and notice that the recovery rate isn't based on a percentual of the heroes' health, but on their individual hitpoints. So if you happen to have a heroe with 7000 hitpoints, be ready for waiting a few hours... or spend some money to recover it. Well, you get health packs every 35 minutes... But even so, that means you'll be playing 5 minutes, waiting almost 2 hours. That would be perfectly ok for a mobile game. Just play once while on the bus/subway, and forget aboit it while working. But as a pc game it fails horribly.So, as I said, unless you're willing to play 2 or 3 games a day, or pay a LOT of money, don't bother with this game.			"

												well, it's free to play...it's not incredibly exciting nor challenging, but it's interesting and it is basically a series of puzzles. it has a twist where you can make the game easier for yourself and less time-consuming to go through if you give it money, kinda like various facebook games i guess. i wouldn't spend a lot of time on it, but it's an interesting go and it shouldn't affect your wallet. puzzles are pretty cool, but this game has its temptations. if you're easily tempted, i'd stay away from it because the time-sink could be pretty frustrating.the music is pretty fun to listen to, so that's a bonus. there are various aspects of the game i would totally change if i had the power to, but in the end it probably doesn't matter a whole lot since i don't spend much time on it nor do i plan to.

												I'm not into Bejeweled games at all but this adds character progression, levelling up and also multiplayer. If i was into Bejeweled I would have pee'd my pants over this game I think. Graphics are good. Sound good. You make 3 gems or more crush down and that does damage to your opponent. The one who makes the best moves does more damage and wins. You can also use special abilities from chars like Iron Man etc (Repulsor ray) to add more damage and then level those abilities up as you gain experience.As I said. I am not into Bejeweled games but this adds a lot more and even hooked me. Give it a try it's free and a small download:)			"

												Everyone brings up the microtransactions, and they ARE pretty excessive.  It's hard not to get stickershock looking at a package of fake money that costs $100 of REAL money, but I think there are some more fundamental things wrong with the game, at least at this point:1) It's hard to tell what's going on, who is getting damaged, etc.  Feedback, which was super clear in the original Puzzle Quest, is really poor in this version.2) Given all the microtransactions and the cross-platform nature of the game, it bugs me that I can't access the same account from my phone as from my Steam account, and that the game isn't even aware of my progress if I log on from a different Steam machine.  3) The game has a lot of the bugs inherent in an early launch, including bugs and weirdness.  The game is clearly meant to allow players to use an Xbox 360 controller, but parts of it, including tutorials, break -- sometimes badly -- when using the controller.			"

												The gameplay itsels is a pretty solid Bejeweled clone. The problem lies in the fact that they almost don't want you playing the game. Marvel Puzzle Quest is as freemium as they come. There are a ton of restrictions built into the game's infrastructure that limit not only how much you can play, but what content you have access to. Everything in the game is tied to either a timer or the random number generator. The game has potential, but unless the devs make some major changes, it is far from worth playing.			"

												A perfect example of how being made 'free-to-play' can utterly destroy an otherwise greatly enjoyable game.In fairness, this was always going to be a little novelty title that people wouldn't pay much for, and would only play in small doses. But it IS a fun game. At least until you have a bad round, and your heroes take so much damage during the a five minute or less match that you then can't play it again for over half an hour (unless, of course, you fork out some real-world cash for the privilege).Trying to collect as many heroes as possible is similarly frustrating, as the story missions give you plenty of opportunities to gain more, yet far fewer opportunities to gain the particular in-game currency you need to expand your roster size so that you can actually fit the extra heroes the game keeps trying to throw at you. Though once again, the game is always quick to suggest you could avoid this inconvenience if you'd just whip out your credit card.Despite all this, I will reiterate that the game is enjoyable. So I would heartily recommend giving it a try _IF_ you can either police yourself to never playing for more than maybe 10 minutes in a session, you're happy to regularly alt-tab out or read a book for half an hour between matches, or you're the kind of person who doesn't mind sinking hundreds of dollars into a minor distraction for features that you'd expect a $5 game to come with as standard.If not, save yourself the frustration and don't bother.

If you don't like Puzzle Quest, don't bother.Now to add a few things. The game is free to play and you can get along without paying any money for quite some time. If you are not a very competitive kind of person you can get lots of fun from the game and not pay any money at all, ever. If, on the other hand, you want to complete the game and/or play the pseudo-pvp on the high levels you will have to invest, a lot, as it's hardly possible to level your heroes enough for those challenges.Having said that I still have to admit that the game is tremendous fun without spending a dime.

												If you want to play Puzzle Quest with a Marvel paint, here you go.  It is a fun game, but there are a lot of negatives to it.  There's a large roster of characters to play with and there is some interesting strategy you can employ while playing the game, but the strategy is a bit lost in the fact you can only fight AIs.  They force you to change up your roster because characters need time to heal or revive from the last battle they've been in; this is good because loss monotany, but bad if you enjoy just playing specific characters.  It is possible to enjoy the game for free, but spending money on the game definitely gives pay players an edge over free players.I still recommend it for a fun distraction, but if you want a deeper Puzzle Quest, play puzzle quest.

												This game is surprisingly fun.  The character abilities are a bit limited but being able to level them and the character itself allows for the challenge level to develope without crippling you.  Basic mechanics are solid and, while luck is a huge factor like any simple match 3 game, there is definitely room for strategy.  Is the game perfect.  Heck no.  There are too few character slots so you wind up either selling a ton of characters or paying some cash to make room for them.  However, you can play the game for a while without spending cash if you are willing to grind rewards a bit.Play the game, have some fun and then spend a little to support the effort.

												First of all the time displayed about how long I've played isn't really accurate. I just have the game running in a window a lot of the time and am not playing it but it still looks to Steam like I'm playing itOK that out of the way. I see a lot of people are hating on this game and I can appreciate a lot of people will hate it because it is so very pay to win. Here's another perspective from someone who hasn't paid anything for it. I've had maybe 5 solid hours gameplay out of this, really enjoyable gameplay too. You only get so long to play free then you need more health and such and that's the point you're supposed to pay. That's the point when I leave the game.I let it recharge then come back the next time for another go. Because I can't just sit there and play for hours on end, it makes matches meaningful. A few losses are devastating and that's it for the day really but getting it right with the wins is then extremely rewarding. This game was always designed to be something you dip into and that's what I love about it. Fire it up, have a bit of fun for a short while and I'm done and back to surfing for pictures of cute cats.Now my complaints. I would really like to pay for this game because I like it. The problem is real money gets you so little its just not worth it. 5 health and enough iso8 to start to upgrade one character for £6.99 is just not good enough. Not even remotely inticing. If the DLC (lol) ever goes on sale, I'll be very interested but right now, no thanks, I'll just dip in now and again for free and enjoy what's there until its taken away			"

If you have nothing better to do then this game can be quite entertaining. Its not the game that you will want to pay for or that you will be excited about to play.

												The game is a bad iOS thing, better suited for a touchscreen than a monitor. The speechbubbles are gigantic and it seems to out of place. With an interface clearly designed for touchscreen. The game can be played without sinking money into, and there are some possibilities to earn the Money Currency but overall you are strongly incentivised to buy the boosterpacks. The good and rare heros seem to be hidden inside the money bags and not obtainable via ingame currency.The prologue is horribly written, with Ironman trying to be funny and overall displaying what i would call his Movie Personality. The writing of the story is bad. To the point where one ends up just pressing the Skip button.There isn't much to be said for the mechanics, as the whole game is just a basic match3 mechanic. The music got repretitive real quick and the fact that if your hero gets damaged you have to wait up to an hour or use an item in order to keep playing. You can't even decide to keep playing with a damaged hero. Like missing 20 HP of a 300HP bar, takes 5 minutes to heal up, but wouldn't let me start a match going into it with a damaged hero.They should have left the game on iOS devices, its most certainly not a game to be played on a widescreen monitor or even bigger screens like Big Screen Mode.And as i mentioned twice so far. The game gives upgrades via boosterpacks. New Abilities are unlocked by finding a variant of the hero you already have. Some can be obtained through play, but the rest are expected to be bought via gambling packs. You have no control over which hero you get. Want to play a Team with your favorit Heroes? Good look getting them. There isn't even a trade system, so you could trade them with someone else. You'll probably end up sinking a bunch of money into it, in order to get your dream team of heroes. The pricing of the packs feels like a rip off to me. With Trading Card Games i not only have the option to trade the cards, but also i understand they have to be printed. Here i got no option to trade cards, or non i saw, and since seem to have only a limited amount of heroes i could have with me, and no obvious option to buy more slots, you probably just end up playing with whatever hero you end up with.As a Match 3 game, i find the soundtrack unappealing and yeah, its a F2P Match3 game designed for iOS. If thats what you are looking for, don't be discouraged by Marvel heroes. As Marvel Fan... give this a pass, you won't be getting what you coming for.			"

												My experience so far...The first hour was fun! Really, really fun! The second hour wasn't bad. The third hour, I'd realized that in fact, yes, you CAN play all the way through a game where you're only ""unlock"" for that level left is a cover or charicter token, and get a 20 crystal card several times in a row for no discurnable reason instead. So, that's kinda a problem.Do you like choosing between laying out significant real world money? Do you like deleting charicters you've spent hours leveling up? Do you like deleting charicters you JUST got in a drop but don't have a space left to play with it? If you can answer ""yes"" to one of those questions, this is a great game for you.Honestly, if I could get the entire game for $15-20, I'd say go for it. It's a fun little puzzle game...but I wouldn't put a dime into this game.			"

												I'm a puzzle quest fan and this is not a bad game at all; however, the pay to win/pay to get better characters system simply destroy all the fun.Once you complete all of the story missions (I have finished mobile version) all you do is to level up your characters. Like many others said, it would be better if they just sell this game outright and charge a small price if people wish to buy additional in-game currency. Unfortunately the pay system totally destroy such a wonderful game.			"

												I played this game almost 2 years. I managed to get a maxed out top tier (4 star) character after ONE YEAR of heavy grinding. I initially spent 20 bucks, but soon realized that spending money doesn't help at all. The better you get, the tougher the game gets.I got a second maxed top tier character after 15 month, but he wasn't what he used to be, because they nerfed him shortly before. I now have 4 more nearly maxed 4 star characters, but progression is so slow that I decided to finally quit the game. I do not recommend the game, because progression is too slow and the goals are changing too fast. (You build up a strategy over month, just to see devs change everything the moment you nearly finished.)And the stories are exceptional lame. Its Bejeweled with characters but not Puzzle Quest.			"

												I have played this game on mobile for 45 days for now and I have to say that this is one of the most enjoyable match-3 games I have played thus far. Maybe because I am sort of a fan of marvel myself that the whole grinding thing is not really that 'painful' as compared to other match-3 grinding games. The gameplay itself is pretty fun. You need to match certain colors more often than other time and you can activate certain abilities to reach victory.The reason why I am not recommending this steam version is simply because the whole thing is more suited to mobile environment and I was trying this steam version because I thought it would give a different kind of experience. But since there seems to be no way of transferring progress from my mobile to PC (or vice versa) and there is truly no point in starting from zero, I can't seem to find a good reason for myself to play this, let alone to recommend.

												Match-three meets Micro-transactions meets CCG mechanics. Free to Play but also Pay to Win.Cons: -Storyline virtually inexistent-Brings nothing new to the genre -Does not delivers especially well what's been done better in other games of the same genre-Worst thing about it? Everything about this game feels like a test of endurance in ''How long will you hold out until you succumb and spend money''. Pros:FreeRecommendations:I would recommend the average consumer to avoid this product, although I have to admit that someone who actively enjoys the feeling of ''outsmarting'' the game design of Free To Play/Pay To Win titles might get a good number of hours of entertainment out of it.Actual length of content:As the game is updated regularly, with game modes coming and going, the actual length depends greatly on the consumer's personal tolerance for that genre and its repetition more than the available  I personnally checked out after less than 3 hours even though I must have spent more than 300 hours on similar titles.

												I love this game. I play it every time my five health have replenished and when my heroes are healed. I love the gameplay because it is very fluid and the powers are woven in to where you feel almost like you are playing a fighting game as opposed to a puzzle game. Great time killer and nothing feels better than when you unlock a 5 star character until the moment your realize you don't have enough hero points to buy another hero slot so you have to loose one, earn more HP before the card expires or delete a character you were working on previously. All of this I get and appreciate because it feels challenging to me. I think that for a F2P game I honestly do not feel forced to pay whatsoever. Other than not being able to link my account on my iPhone with the one on steam I recommend this game to everyone that loves puzzlers, super heroes and a blast!			"

Basically through playing rounds and being ranked highly for an event you get in-game currency, and cards to either upgrade or add to your roster.  The characters each have skills which can be used after you destroy enough of that color gem.Each character I've seen so far has different attacks from the next one.Unfortunately this game has no actual interaction between players asside from an alliance system.[at this time]  It feels like a grind machine, but there are stories associated with a lot of the events.

												I mostly play F2P games just cause im a broke a$$. I find this game quite entertaining and ya if you spend the money you be doing alot better but I play for free never paid money for anything. It takes a little time to get to where you can just play without having to wait for your health packs (which are earned or bought XD) but there are some heros that heal your dudes so you can spam that in a weak lvl for quick healing. There is a PVP in a sense but it's owned by the guys who pay. but thats ok cause there are plenty of side events that are dev made and its fun. these negative douchers expect so much from a f2p game cut these guys some slack THEY DEVELOPED IT FOR FREE!!!!!!!!!!! not so bad to ask for money for a better game :/ thats my opinion.

												I have been playing this for awhile on PC and android. I am by no means an expert, but I think I can bring a more reasonable spin on things. I think one thing people kind of gloss over, is that the game is not final. My overall impression of the game is positive. It is a fun low-commitment game. By that I mean the more you approach it casually from a time and money perspective, the more you will like it. Yes, this game is pay-to-win, but if you do that then there really is no reason to play this game. The game is entirely about improving your characters. It is not about PVE or PVP(more on that later). Yes, there are annoying cockblocks that preventprogression, so then do not do so. Consider it an appetizer for your main course, whatever game you are really playing. This is the kind of game you play when you are about ready to go to bed, or that moment right after you turn on your pc or tablet. I would say this game works better as a mobile game, quick and dirty gaming, but the UI is much better in the PC version. Pros:-Graphics and effects are nice. The artstyle in particular is noteworthy, if this was a comic series I would pick it up. -The game is in beta, so the developers are still improving the game. For example, attacks and effects used to happen much more slowly, but now they are instantaneous. The UI in the android version used to be truly terrible, but they have added little changes that make it less tedious to track abilities and AP. There is hope for improvement, and I doubt development costs for improvements for such a simple game are so large that change will never come. -If you are a Marvel fan, I am sorry to say this, but this is probably the best comic book game available to you. This is no Arkham City, but fun can still be had here.-The core gameplay is fun and easy to get into. Once you know what you are doing, it is fast and strangely satisfying. That is, before the inevitable wall, but we went over that already.Cons:-The fact that it is pay-2-win is not the issue, the fact that ""PVP"" is forced on you is. Pay 2 win is only an issue in PVP games, for singleplayer games who really cares, and that is how I want to play this. What I mean by this is that PVE offers a very limited means of upgrading your characters. You will never get enough ISO, HP or character covers to upgrade your best toons by PVE alone, it is more practice for PVP with forgetabble storylines. You will get plenty of low level character covers here to upgrade, but the daily rewards will start overwhelming you to the point where you are forced to ""compete"". -PVP is not really PVP. Like most mobile PVP games, you are really just fighting representations of other players characters. So, not only are you forced to PVP, it is not even real PVP. Oh, so who are you really fighting? An extremely sketchy AI. The AI is so sketchy in PVP and events it is hilarious. Cascade after cascade awaits you. This is to counter the fact that there is no true skill matchmaking, you will find your level 15 toons up against level 40 toons, uh no thanks. You can skip these guys, in fact you as the attacker have every advantage. You pick the team, you get to use upgrades, and you get to skip. That is probably why the AI cheats so much. Oh, and apparently your team is whatever team you last used, which is never explained to you.-Nothing is explained to you. You probably read a lot of the above thinking what is this person talking about. This is what the game does, it only explains a very basic notion of the game. You kind of have to learn from your mistakes as you go. They never explain important things like the limited amount of points available to upgrade a toon, imagine if you paid to max out a character and found out you put too many points in the wrong talent, I bet you would be pretty upset since you would have to start from scratch.-A lot of this game is just luck. Upgrades, prizes, even combat can often come down to good old RNG. If you are like me, I hate RNG with a passion. You have no control over the colors of the gems in this game, but I am sure the AI you will face does. In fact, count on it. Just make sure you have a team that can utilize the colors of the spectrum. You see a lot of cons there, I often want to quit, but then something happens to pull me back in. This game is a continuous carrot-on-a-stick game, which is not surprising given that it is free. I think at minimum you will definitely need to drop some money for character slots, it is very hard to get around that. You will want to quit often, but then they will give you a free 3 star card and you will say, ""maybe another chance"". But, like I said earlier, a little perspective helps a lot. Do not try and ""beat"" this game, and you will enjoy it. It is a good time killer, not a time filler.    "

												I was going to write something longer but I think TL;DR is the prefered format here.In short the game is pay to win, if your playing very casually you wont notice it much and it's a fine fun puzzle quest game. If however you want to sit and play for an hour or take part in a tournament or flash event you will quickly find yourself penalized heavily for not having spent money to add more hero slots, buy more heros, ISO and healing packages.

												Very fun at first, but then it's all pay to win.  Buy experience, currency to buy heroes, everything.  Only sucky heroes drop, and there comes a point in the game when even with max level free heroes get one shot.  Farming only seems to help marginally, as pre-defeated duels give a true pittance of experience.  Unless you've got 50 bucks a week to spend on pay to win or just want a casual game, pass on this.

												well, it's free to play...it's not incredibly exciting nor challenging, but it's interesting and it is basically a series of puzzles. it has a twist where you can make the game easier for yourself and less time-consuming to go through if you give it money, kinda like various facebook games i guess. i wouldn't spend a lot of time on it, but it's an interesting go and it shouldn't affect your wallet. puzzles are pretty cool, but this game has its temptations. if you're easily tempted, i'd stay away from it because the time-sink could be pretty frustrating.the music is pretty fun to listen to, so that's a bonus. there are various aspects of the game i would totally change if i had the power to, but in the end it probably doesn't matter a whole lot since i don't spend much time on it nor do i plan to.

												Unless you have HEAPS of time, or are willing to not advance in a LONG time, you shouldn't invest time in this game. For starters, the ""story mode"" is pretty much limited, and frankly, subpar. To continue, the brunt of the game is PVP. The basics of the game are 2 days tournaments, after which you earn some prize based on your position. You can get some minor rewards based on performance. But here's the thing. You'll be fighting random people, some of them have spent thousands of dollars in this game, and are pretty much unbeatable, making a free player unable to get in the top 10.Also the game lies in the avaliable languages department. Yes, it says it's in spanish... and the game is right... as long as you call spanish something with untranslated lines of text, and has blind idiot translations (check tvtropes) for the rest of it. I mean ""Ironman se parte""? You'd need ""Ironman breaks himself""/""Ironman shatters himself""/""Ironman laughs his♥♥♥♥♥off"" for that. And yes, ""Ironman laughs his♥♥♥♥♥off"" is what spanish readers will read. It's quite a funny idea, having all these heroes laughing at each other. Power descriptions are quite inacurate, too. I have to assume that every other language is riddled with these bad translation issues, but can't say for sure. The Spanish translation, at least, is even worse than using google translator. So there's that.There's also the luck factor. Sometimes luck is against you. I know that it's par for the course in a puzzle-quest game, but, for the heck of it, I spent literally 4 minutes watching how the computer cascaded after removing 3 piezes on the uppermost line. That kind of luck means you'll have to spend at least one hour and a half waiting for recovery packs, in order to try another game.And that's the final issue for me: Downtime. In every battle, for the most part, you'll get hurt, at least a little. And then you need to spend downtime recovering. At first, it doesn't look like it's too much. five minutes or so, for the first few levels. Then you level up, and notice that the recovery rate isn't based on a percentual of the heroes' health, but on their individual hitpoints. So if you happen to have a heroe with 7000 hitpoints, be ready for waiting a few hours... or spend some money to recover it. Well, you get health packs every 35 minutes... But even so, that means you'll be playing 5 minutes, waiting almost 2 hours. That would be perfectly ok for a mobile game. Just play once while on the bus/subway, and forget aboit it while working. But as a pc game it fails horribly.So, as I said, unless you're willing to play 2 or 3 games a day, or pay a LOT of money, don't bother with this game.			"

If you are not a very competitive kind of person you can get lots of fun from the game and not pay any money at all, ever. If, on the other hand, you want to complete the game and/or play the pseudo-pvp on the high levels you will have to invest, a lot, as it's hardly possible to level your heroes enough for those challenges.Having said that I still have to admit that the game is tremendous fun without spending a dime.

												Yes, it's pay2win. Yes, it's even pay2play when you're first playing. It doesn't require you to pay money for anything, it just makes it so you don't have to wait. Yes, coming from Puzzle Quest 2, or Galactix it's extremely annoying that you can't sit down for 4 hours at a time and grind through levels. Once you get past those major complaints (and they are valid) you find a fun puzzle quest game. The art is fun, variety a good time. The only real issue (aside from those very real complaints I listed) is once you find a playstyle, 90% of the characters you find in game are useless (I'm looking at you Spiderman). The missions that come in every day/week force you to change it up, though I still find myself going back to my normal crew when able. Remember, this started life as an iPhone game, so treat it as such - play 5-10 minutes at a time, and you won't have the complaints most see.			"

												For a free to play game that many look at as a p2w I quite enjoy it. I think the pay curve is actually quite small, unless you are wanting to play competivitely. But as a time killer this game is totally worth the price of admission (0$) which is great.			"

												Pay to win, just do yourself a favor and skip this game.There are plenty of free games out there that are built more like ""pay to get a huge bonues for awhile""  or ""pay to up your chances of getting hero cards & upgrades."" .    Not ""PAY TO PLAY OR DONT PLAY AT ALL""This is more like a slot machine,  oh yeah your gonna lose.   The computer is built to FORCE you to lose some rounds.   Its stacked against you because without that they make NO MONEY.   So of course your gonna lose, and lose quite a bit.    Then you'll see suddenly you'll win by a far margin.    Its just dumb...			"

												I wasn't sure if I'd like this game or not.  In general, I like casual games; howeverI had seen reviews that said players had to do a lot of grinding.  I'm going to give this 3 (of 5) Stars.That translates to postive/recommended, with caveats.I enjoy the Match 3 play, with the strategic elements they have addedbased on Marvel's Graphic Novel mythos.  However, its a very slowstart as a new player to build up your characters/slots, and the bestoppurtunities to improve them do mean you spend a fair amount of time""grinding"" during specific multiplayer competitions/events.  This, of course,encourages PAY-TO-PLAY aspects of the game.UPDATE:  I've been playing this game, almost daily, for a couple of months now.  The grinding is constant.  Even when you ""win"" a major event (I came in #2 once), the prizes help you a lot if you were starting out but don't change your ability to succeed very much at all most of the time.I now think this game has been optimized for Pay2Play.  I'm lowering my score to 2/5, and changing my recommendation to NO.			"

												Ok....so....I'm addicted.   As of this review 706 hrs played and I'm not sure it has tracked them all.  This is the most I've played a Free to Play game.  The addiction is getting new characters and upgrading existing ones.  I've dumped about $200 in it over the last year and a half....at least.  But divided by the hours of fun it's still cheap.  If you like Marvel and match three you will get hooked.			"

I have always loved puzzle games but with the attack methods and character upgrades it really make this game a nice twist on the the whole thing. Out of all my steam games this one hs racked up the most hours to date.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest combines the simple and addicting gameplay of Bejewelled with the brilliant personality of the Marvel Universe. One of the best parts of this game is that it is free and the developers are constantly working on it to make the Puzzle Quest experience better.My only complaint is that it will get increasingly difficult to play competitively against other players without having to spend st least some money on in game purchases.

												A simple match'n drop puzzle game.  I enjoy it.  Great for casual play, considering my other most played is DOTA2, where you are locked into a 30-70 minute match with nine others ... pausing can be impractical there.  On Marvel PQ, you can just walk away and make your sandwich, check on the kids, come back and pick up where you left it.The game play has a few bells and whistles, nothing inventive for the genre.  I do enjoy grinding out rewards and new heroes though.  Many would call this a pay-to-win.  If you go that route, you are investing hundreds of dollars.  I enjoy unlocking everything through matches won ... and they have several ""special events"" each week to compete for the free unlocks.If you already have some intensive action games on your most played, and would like a relaxing puzzle solver to fill in between matches, or when you are to busy to commit hours at a time, I highly recommend this F2P.  Also works on the smartphone, though the interface is a little clunky there, IMHO.			"

												At first the game seems like a good distraction form the day.  Basicly a puzzle game matching colors with a bit of super heros thrown in.  But if you try to compete in any of the comps. to get ""better heros"" You have to spend money.  Every patch ""fixes"" a hero that make it unfair.  Wolverne used to heal all the way to max health, Orginal Black widow used to add perminate hit points and so forth.  OS unless you have friends that pay money and have a big guild team or you pay money.  you will never get the top tier super heros.  So unless you are a super hero fanatic don't get the game.			"

												I have played this game since very, very shortly after it came out on Android, and was just absolutely ecstatic to see it come to the Steam platform. I will admit, I honestly wasn't entirely certain how well it would translate between the platforms, but they did wonderfully and, honestly, it's an even better game on PC than on mobile, in my opinion. I've been a huge fan of Puzzle Quest since Challenge of the Warlords, and when I first found this game on mobile I'd honestly been looking for a Puzzle Quest game rather than the ports of their existing games which were either ""free"" but made you pay to get anywhere and were terrible ports anyway, or up-front costs that I wasn't willing to pay since I'd already bought a couple copies of the games already (3 for prior phones, and Android versions were the priciest yet). So I was therefore absolutely delighted to see this new release and hadn't expected it to be much more than a traditional Puzzle Quest game with some Marvel characters slapped on to make it sell better but otherwise not really changing anything, and I would have been happy enough with that - however, much to my surprise, lo and behold it was an exquisite melding of the two worlds to create something better than both alone. The game has since captured my attention and kept me rapt with excitement for hours on end, laughing at the writing as I read along about the characters I already know and love in new stories and situations, on both platforms, as I match away and watch my Marvel heroes absolutely own face after some TLC and level-ups. I absolutely cannot recommend this game enough if you have any interest in puzzlers or Puzzle Quest-like games.			"

												It's a pretty cool game, though they still need to do a lot to improve it.First, let's talk about ""freemium"". This is one of those games where you can buy tokens to get things faster. That's fine. But the prices are so outrageously expensive (as are most freemium games) that there's not a chance in hell that I'm going to actually buy anything. The prices are so high that it's clear that their only interest is in milking stupid people and teenagers (but I repeat myself) for every coin they own. And they'll make a lot of money doing that. I just wish the rest of us could play. The prices are set high, to milk about 5% of their players, while other people who are willing to pay (like me) are too smart to pay their current absurd prices. So, it's not going to last me more than a week, because they don't want my business.Second, ever heard of tooltips? Right-clicking? Apparently this game's programmers haven't. I know it's basically a port of a mobile game, but that doesn't excuse anything.All of its problems aside, it's actually a fun game, and I really enjoy collecting and leveling characters. But again, I wish they would allow me to participate more in that.UPDATE: I played for a while after I wrote this, and discovered that after a certain point, it's impossible to progress without paying absurd amounts of money for characters, skills, character slots, etc., so I had to change my recommendation to ""no"".I'm not expecting this game to be 100% free, but I do expect it to be reasonably affordable.

Fighting against enemies with different sets/color pairings of powers changes which colors you aim to steal from them, and which heroes you want to get their own colors.

With the latest patch healing now only effects that fight, leaving with you a choice of using health packs or waiting hours for your characters to recover.

												This game is a cash grab pure and simple.Seriously.I started the game was forced to buy the default chars, fine. This game is PAINFUL to get started.  Everything is painful unless you pay for coins to unlock better cards... no joke..  I can't upgrade my characters because I don't have gold, They don't reward you with gold that often... In my area one map I earned about 150 gold ... it takes 525 to buy  an upgrade that way ....  So now you have to grind the exact same level over and over for crystal and you need 400 to get a shot a crap pack in the hopes to get the same char you already have inorder to unlock and ability to ACTUALLY LEVEL THE CHAR UP SO THEY GET MORE HP.... Everytime you get hit with a progress blocker your reminded that you can pay real money to get past is.I just fought Dr Doom in the first act.  He blasted all my lvl 2 char's and my second attemp went worse than the first.  So all my characters are dead and reviving then after that they have to heal ...  UNLESS I PAY GOLD...I say steer clear of this game.If you want to see it in action for yourself you can watch Totalbiscut on youtube first look this game.			"

												Well, the game by itself is cool stuff to spend time with and quite entertaining. BUT, it is NOT , FREE. Well in fact it IS, FREE, but if you want to deliver some competition in any or well ok, almost any tornament(but i still prefer to say ANY tornament) or win some prizes, you need to spend A LOT of real money here. So yes, this is cool game, but if you want to have some of the best or at least good characters with who you want to win some serious matches, you need to pay for it. So decide for yourself. Get yourself this  game if you want to kill some time in free math-three type game with cool comix atmosphere. Or if you ready and can spend a lot of money (though i guess you can spend them in more better way) then you will be able to have full fun here and try to get yourslef at very best places in any tornament.Anyway i cant recommend this game for that people who want to spend their money - cause the prizes are not THAT cool, and some of the best characters and their bonuses is too expensive. This is not THAT game where you get something THAT cool stuff.			"

												Great game, lots of fun. Recommend when you first start you concentrate on leveling up good guys. You may get the opportunity to get Daken (Wolverines son) and a couple other of the Dark Avengers, but i wouldn't invest too much iso on them at the start. Most of your early boss battles will be against Dark Avengers, so you'll find your best heroes aren't available in major fights if you've leveled up Dark Avengers.If you're going to spend some cash recommend utilising the daily deals and concentrating on the 2 star and up good guys for leveling.Whilst leveling up 1 star Storm, Iron Man and Black Widow might seem a good decision at the start, if you're planning to play long term I wouldn't wate too much iso on them. They're level capped to 50 (from memory) and are quickly outgunned by the 2, 3 and 4 star heroes.			"

												They need to connect this game to the versions on Android and Iphone.  I assume the best way is via Facebook.  Steam version doesn't have the FB login like the phones do... yet?  Other gripe I have is the healing required for each character if they are injured.  The more health your guy has due to it's level, the longer it takes to heal.  I don't mind the healing itself... but if this were a static percentage healed per minute, I'd appreciate it a bit more. As it stands, I can still spend all day playing this without stopping, but not always the characters I wanted to play at the time, as I'm waiting for the heal. I miss Galactic Quest's gameplay right now too... argh.			"

												If your a fan of puzzle based game, specifically of the cascading piece variety you'll love this game. It's a versus puzzle game thta features many marvel characters from Spider Man to Thor etc etc.Interesting story that involves the dark avengers, which i always thought were pretty cool. I've had tons of fun with this game, it can make you mad sometimes, but it still keeps me coming back.			"

It's only pay to win if you suck at puzzle quest.I've been playing about a week, haven't spent any money, and after having completed all of the PVE content have started consistently placing highly in the PVP tournaments. You can earn the microtransaction currency by playing in the tournaments, even if you don't do very well. Stop complaining and get better at video games.			"

												Not a bad game. I've spent 5 bucks so far. If you dont want to spend any money and still progress, you have to save all your coins for buying extra hero spots.Also, a hero in your group that can heal is a must. you can play for a long time without using your health packs with a healer. the lvl6 black widow is ideal.

												Very fun at first, but then it's all pay to win.  Buy experience, currency to buy heroes, everything.  Only sucky heroes drop, and there comes a point in the game when even with max level free heroes get one shot.  Farming only seems to help marginally, as pre-defeated duels give a true pittance of experience.  Unless you've got 50 bucks a week to spend on pay to win or just want a casual game, pass on this.

												You really don't need to spend any real money in this game if you don't want to, it is still fun to play. If you like games like bejeweled, but with light turn-based battle system where you fight as marvel characters against other marvel characters. Maybe the only downside is that for those daily rewards you really have to play daily you really have to play daily or else you have to start stacking up days all over again. (and rewards you've gotten, won't reset)Fun to play in either short or long sessions.			"

												Sad that game tells you to buy starter heroes and once you waste your credits it doesn't give you the starter heroes if you already purchased one previously. If you buy Hawkeye or BlackWidow, dont buy the other one, you won't have space and you cannot delete heroes already attained to ensure room when you spend credits. So loose credits and no new character if you already have 4 heroes. Needs Work... 3 1/2 Stars of 10 based on the hour i spent playing it, and I have quite a few Puzzle Quest Games for many consoles.			"

												The game was fun and interesting. I sunk hours and money into it. Then they made some major changes to some characters. Impacting those I had and rendering my previous approach useless.No big deal. Game balance, I can understand that.So I sink more time, more money into it, because the game was still fun.Then they make some more major changes. This time, it impacted in such a way that my average play time went from 1-2 hour sessions to about 15-20 minutes sessions based on changes to healing abilities.I didn't invest time and money to see the game shift in such a way. As such, I finally opted to uninstall it.			"

												EDIT (07-29-14): I decided to go back and check out the game after a lengthy hiatus to see if any of the ridiculous balance issues had been addressed. Unfortunately, these issues seem to be worse now than months ago, when I originally quit playing. Enemy teams will almost always get multiple lines per turn and always get whatever color gems they need to drop at precisely the right time to keep their combos going to 2, 3 or 4x After uninstalling today I can safely say I'll not ever be going back. Marvel really should be ashamed of themselves.There are a few things you should consider before jumping to Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign.1) Do you mind only playing in small, bite-sized chunks?2) Do you mind spending real-world cash to continue playing?If you answered ""no"" to the first question then have at it. You'll have fun building your deck of characters, leveling them up, taking on new challenges, etc. It's essentially the old Puzzle Quest with a Marvel spin, which isn't a bad thing. It's quite fun if you enjoy that type of game and completing challenges and quest lines is rewarding.If you answered ""yes"" to the second question then prepare to be sorely disappointed. You can play this game without ever spending a single cent, but you won't have the best characters, won't have enough storage space for additional characters, won't be able to level them high enough to compete in multiplayer events and will always be running short on health packs. Basically, without spending money on it (and not just once, but regularly) you'll never get the most out of it.D3 and Demiurge took the exact same iOS/Adroid game, complete with it's heavy insistance on rampant microtransactions, and ported it to PC. It's a rather shameful cash-grab, in terms of milking players for as much money as possible, but underneath all the negatives is a solid, enjoyable game. It's just too bad you have to dig through so much bad to get to the good.			"

												The game is a bad iOS thing, better suited for a touchscreen than a monitor. The speechbubbles are gigantic and it seems to out of place. With an interface clearly designed for touchscreen. The game can be played without sinking money into, and there are some possibilities to earn the Money Currency but overall you are strongly incentivised to buy the boosterpacks. The good and rare heros seem to be hidden inside the money bags and not obtainable via ingame currency.The prologue is horribly written, with Ironman trying to be funny and overall displaying what i would call his Movie Personality. The writing of the story is bad. To the point where one ends up just pressing the Skip button.There isn't much to be said for the mechanics, as the whole game is just a basic match3 mechanic. The music got repretitive real quick and the fact that if your hero gets damaged you have to wait up to an hour or use an item in order to keep playing. You can't even decide to keep playing with a damaged hero. Like missing 20 HP of a 300HP bar, takes 5 minutes to heal up, but wouldn't let me start a match going into it with a damaged hero.They should have left the game on iOS devices, its most certainly not a game to be played on a widescreen monitor or even bigger screens like Big Screen Mode.And as i mentioned twice so far. The game gives upgrades via boosterpacks. New Abilities are unlocked by finding a variant of the hero you already have. Some can be obtained through play, but the rest are expected to be bought via gambling packs. You have no control over which hero you get. Want to play a Team with your favorit Heroes? Good look getting them. There isn't even a trade system, so you could trade them with someone else. You'll probably end up sinking a bunch of money into it, in order to get your dream team of heroes. The pricing of the packs feels like a rip off to me. With Trading Card Games i not only have the option to trade the cards, but also i understand they have to be printed. Here i got no option to trade cards, or non i saw, and since seem to have only a limited amount of heroes i could have with me, and no obvious option to buy more slots, you probably just end up playing with whatever hero you end up with.As a Match 3 game, i find the soundtrack unappealing and yeah, its a F2P Match3 game designed for iOS. If thats what you are looking for, don't be discouraged by Marvel heroes. As Marvel Fan... give this a pass, you won't be getting what you coming for.			"

												My experience so far...The first hour was fun! Really, really fun! The second hour wasn't bad. The third hour, I'd realized that in fact, yes, you CAN play all the way through a game where you're only ""unlock"" for that level left is a cover or charicter token, and get a 20 crystal card several times in a row for no discurnable reason instead. So, that's kinda a problem.Do you like choosing between laying out significant real world money? Do you like deleting charicters you've spent hours leveling up? Do you like deleting charicters you JUST got in a drop but don't have a space left to play with it? If you can answer ""yes"" to one of those questions, this is a great game for you.Honestly, if I could get the entire game for $15-20, I'd say go for it. It's a fun little puzzle game...but I wouldn't put a dime into this game.			"

												If you want to play Puzzle Quest with a Marvel paint, here you go.  It is a fun game, but there are a lot of negatives to it.  There's a large roster of characters to play with and there is some interesting strategy you can employ while playing the game, but the strategy is a bit lost in the fact you can only fight AIs.  They force you to change up your roster because characters need time to heal or revive from the last battle they've been in; this is good because loss monotany, but bad if you enjoy just playing specific characters.  It is possible to enjoy the game for free, but spending money on the game definitely gives pay players an edge over free players.I still recommend it for a fun distraction, but if you want a deeper Puzzle Quest, play puzzle quest.

Unfortunately it didn't take long before I became frustrated with the ""Pay-2-Win"" business model they've employed. This is more of a mixture of Puzzle Quest and Farmville, requiring you to wait exorbitant amounts of time between games to ""heal"" or choose to skip that waiting by paying money. The game itself just doesn't quite feel solid enough to justify dropping my hard earned cash into and therefore becomes almost unplayable. Disappointing.			"

												Judging by a /massive/ negative feedback this game seems to generate in the review section, this is going to be unpopular.To begin with, there is a false belief that the game is purely pay to win. In my humble opinion, that is totally untrue. Sure, the game offers a lot of things that make gameplay easier for irl cash.But the core elements, are completely free to play. I mean, it's a friggin match-three gameplay, they don't tell you to pay for borad smasher or something similar. Even the cards can be obtained without paying anything, just by playing the game.What is more the things that you pay money for, are largely irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, as even the PvP is in fact done vs not-a-human.The only problem, is the health regen ratio for characters.

												Never played a Puzzle Quest game before this but this is one of the most epic puzzle games I've played in awhile.  Combining turn based RPG battles with a puzzle game is a fantastic idea.  Sadly, the game feels a bit heavy on the cash shop.  Despite this, it's still a very fun game to play.			"

Not worth the time it took to install much less the time it took to determine how the game's design focuses on inconvenience.Other unflattering posts on this embarrassing money grab describe in better, lenthier terms how poorly this game plays...trust the quantity of the negative reviews here.   Your valuable time is better spent elsewhere.  Don't bother...this will be shuttered soon.			"

												This game is an unholy mess of microtransactions and monotonous grinding. It's 'free to play' but if you want to have any kind of fun they expect you to fork out on massive amounts of DLC otherwise you will have to grind for 30 hours to even have a chance of getting something you actually want. You can lose PvP games and tournament/daily challenge points without even being online because you dont actually play against live people, just bots of the teams they have.If you enjoy tedious and soul crushing gem swapping for days on end just to be in with a slim chance of getting your hands on a trivial trinket or you think dropping $150 on a 'free to play' game is acceptable then this is a good choice. If you have half a brain I advise you to avoid it like the plague. The business model is designed to bleed people dry and these types of games should not be encouraged.			"

												Bejeweled on Steroids. This is a great game to pass the time and have fun playing with and against the Marvel Characters. They are all here, from the Avengers to the Xmen. It is FTP but as usual you can spend real money on Powerups, new characters, etc. etc. I for one never bother with spending my own money on these types of games and judge them by how much fun I can have without doing so. The answer is a resounding ""A Whole Lot of Fun""! If you like Marvel and you like Bejeweled mixed with some rpg elements, mixed with PVP then download now and thank me later!			"

												I'm a puzzle quest fan and this is not a bad game at all; however, the pay to win/pay to get better characters system simply destroy all the fun.Once you complete all of the story missions (I have finished mobile version) all you do is to level up your characters. Like many others said, it would be better if they just sell this game outright and charge a small price if people wish to buy additional in-game currency. Unfortunately the pay system totally destroy such a wonderful game.			"

Graphics are good. Sound good. You make 3 gems or more crush down and that does damage to your opponent. The one who makes the best moves does more damage and wins. You can also use special abilities from chars like Iron Man etc (Repulsor ray) to add more damage and then level those abilities up as you gain experience.As I said. I am not into Bejeweled games but this adds a lot more and even hooked me. Give it a try it's free and a small download:)			"

												Everyone brings up the microtransactions, and they ARE pretty excessive.  It's hard not to get stickershock looking at a package of fake money that costs $100 of REAL money, but I think there are some more fundamental things wrong with the game, at least at this point:1) It's hard to tell what's going on, who is getting damaged, etc.  Feedback, which was super clear in the original Puzzle Quest, is really poor in this version.2) Given all the microtransactions and the cross-platform nature of the game, it bugs me that I can't access the same account from my phone as from my Steam account, and that the game isn't even aware of my progress if I log on from a different Steam machine.  3) The game has a lot of the bugs inherent in an early launch, including bugs and weirdness.  The game is clearly meant to allow players to use an Xbox 360 controller, but parts of it, including tutorials, break -- sometimes badly -- when using the controller.			"

												A perfect example of how being made 'free-to-play' can utterly destroy an otherwise greatly enjoyable game.In fairness, this was always going to be a little novelty title that people wouldn't pay much for, and would only play in small doses. But it IS a fun game. At least until you have a bad round, and your heroes take so much damage during the a five minute or less match that you then can't play it again for over half an hour (unless, of course, you fork out some real-world cash for the privilege).Trying to collect as many heroes as possible is similarly frustrating, as the story missions give you plenty of opportunities to gain more, yet far fewer opportunities to gain the particular in-game currency you need to expand your roster size so that you can actually fit the extra heroes the game keeps trying to throw at you. Though once again, the game is always quick to suggest you could avoid this inconvenience if you'd just whip out your credit card.Despite all this, I will reiterate that the game is enjoyable. So I would heartily recommend giving it a try _IF_ you can either police yourself to never playing for more than maybe 10 minutes in a session, you're happy to regularly alt-tab out or read a book for half an hour between matches, or you're the kind of person who doesn't mind sinking hundreds of dollars into a minor distraction for features that you'd expect a $5 game to come with as standard.If not, save yourself the frustration and don't bother.

												A fun and most addictive game that unfortunately relies on a cash shop for you to be able to progress/collect every hero in later stages. Might be worth spending some cash though, because for Marvel and Puzzle Quest lovers, this game really delivers and is worth at least the starter pack dlc.Free to play does not mean that the game is entirely free, and it should not. A lot of effort (not forgetting to mention the costly Marvel license) has been put into the game, it offers story missions, events, weekly events, pvp, daily missions and rewards for free,However, the prices seem a bit on the pricy side, as is often the case with f2p cash shop games.

												I love the old Puzzle Quest games and so I was keen to play this new version. It looks great and the basic puzzles are the same as previous games with nice themes which is great, however after around 15 hours play, some of which were just waiting for my heroes to heal up, I'm getting annoyed with it.Looking from a single player point of view, either you are forced to replay missions to gain aditional rewards, or you have to constantly pump money into the game to buy power ups. Later on it seems very much geared towards the later with the game not paying out decent rewards for replaying missions.The storeylines are really lacking. There desn't seem to be any long term story, just short fight series of missions. It may be that I haven't joined the dots yet for the big story but I'm stuck now and I'm not paying any more money into the game.Sadly disappointing after a fairly short period of time.			"

												I have played this game since very, very shortly after it came out on Android, and was just absolutely ecstatic to see it come to the Steam platform. I will admit, I honestly wasn't entirely certain how well it would translate between the platforms, but they did wonderfully and, honestly, it's an even better game on PC than on mobile, in my opinion. I've been a huge fan of Puzzle Quest since Challenge of the Warlords, and when I first found this game on mobile I'd honestly been looking for a Puzzle Quest game rather than the ports of their existing games which were either ""free"" but made you pay to get anywhere and were terrible ports anyway, or up-front costs that I wasn't willing to pay since I'd already bought a couple copies of the games already (3 for prior phones, and Android versions were the priciest yet). So I was therefore absolutely delighted to see this new release and hadn't expected it to be much more than a traditional Puzzle Quest game with some Marvel characters slapped on to make it sell better but otherwise not really changing anything, and I would have been happy enough with that - however, much to my surprise, lo and behold it was an exquisite melding of the two worlds to create something better than both alone. The game has since captured my attention and kept me rapt with excitement for hours on end, laughing at the writing as I read along about the characters I already know and love in new stories and situations, on both platforms, as I match away and watch my Marvel heroes absolutely own face after some TLC and level-ups. I absolutely cannot recommend this game enough if you have any interest in puzzlers or Puzzle Quest-like games.			"

												Fun for very casual play but will quickly become frustrating if you are unwilling to constantly buy points.  A good game for someone who wants to play only a few minutes at a time but not for the person who wants to sit down and play for hours straight.  This is the kind of game you get to play for a short amount of time and you will need to wait for your characters to heal.  You may of course pay ungodly amounts of money to speed things along.  If you are going to spend money on points I suggest you only buy the gold coins to unlock roster spots.			"

												I personally enjoyed this.  While the game does push microtransactions at every turn, to buy slots for heroes, to merely upgrade heroes and beyond, I still got enjoyment out of this game.  That being said, the actual puzzle quest titles are better, solely for the reason that they are games you've already paid for, thus play differently.To actually get a hero, you'll have to have a comic book cover for them. To actually make said hero practical, you'd will search for 10-13 covers for each hero. In turn, you get a ton of comic book covers from all sorts of sources. It would be nice to have something to do with the 10's or 100's of covers, for heroes you've already maxed out, other than selling them for 100 ISO. It would be nice to perhaps combine 5 1-star covers for a 2 star cover, for example.The hero slots are also quite limited, requiring premium currency to expand. That being said, by spending all the hero coins the game gives you on those slots, getting 10 slots of heroes is fairly manageable. You can get a lot of coins from events, as well as set rewards. It would be nice to have more of those rewards though. With the current event to recruit the Hulk, it's quite annoying when most of the level options are marked as 'impossible' since there isn't much for scaling. The difficulty might give a general idea, but it's far from accurate. I'm not sure if the difficulty marker is for my top heroes, or the current line up from the previous battle. It's far from perfect, but playing a game I haven't paid for I'm expecting some rough edges. This is rougher than most.  To give a scale of how much I enjoyed this game, it would range between 6 and 7.			"

												It's a pretty cool game, though they still need to do a lot to improve it.First, let's talk about ""freemium"". This is one of those games where you can buy tokens to get things faster. That's fine. But the prices are so outrageously expensive (as are most freemium games) that there's not a chance in hell that I'm going to actually buy anything. The prices are so high that it's clear that their only interest is in milking stupid people and teenagers (but I repeat myself) for every coin they own. And they'll make a lot of money doing that. I just wish the rest of us could play. The prices are set high, to milk about 5% of their players, while other people who are willing to pay (like me) are too smart to pay their current absurd prices. So, it's not going to last me more than a week, because they don't want my business.Second, ever heard of tooltips? Right-clicking? Apparently this game's programmers haven't. I know it's basically a port of a mobile game, but that doesn't excuse anything.All of its problems aside, it's actually a fun game, and I really enjoy collecting and leveling characters. But again, I wish they would allow me to participate more in that.UPDATE: I played for a while after I wrote this, and discovered that after a certain point, it's impossible to progress without paying absurd amounts of money for characters, skills, character slots, etc., so I had to change my recommendation to ""no"".I'm not expecting this game to be 100% free, but I do expect it to be reasonably affordable.

												This is a very fun game.  The story boarded cartoon cut scenes feel like a comic that you uncover as you play.  It feels like a bejeweled style game with power ups like Puzzle fighter.  Fighting against enemies with different sets/color pairings of powers changes which colors you aim to steal from them, and which heroes you want to get their own colors.  Like all free to plays it has its drawbacks that sometimes it takes a while to get who or what you want, but with a little patience you will get there			"

												The game itself is great, but the slippery techniques they use to get you to shell out to play render this one of the most disappointing games and the worst puzzle quest game I've ever played.You can only play for breif periods before your heroes must be healed, which starts off free and then you have to pay for in-game currency to purchase health packs. You only have a small set of heroes, with the option to purchase more, what you are not told at this juncture is that you have to purchase hero storage upgrades to be able to fit new heroes into your roster so, if you shell out for new heroes and you have no space for them you lose them.The art is really nice and the comic panel cutscenes are great but the freemium nature of the game ruins it.

												The game is really fun to play and has a fairly curious story. There are some problems with it though. The levelling of the characters using the in-game currency (which you have limited amounts of) is kinda stupid, but passable. The fact that you have to wait for your characters to heal is also weird, but presumably a leftover from being an android port. All things considered this makes the game perfect for breaks, but not for longer sittings, as it will at some point force you to leave and do something else. So if you just want a game that you can play on your lunch break, or when you are taking a break from studying go for it. Otherwise you might get disappointed.			"

												Well, the game by itself is cool stuff to spend time with and quite entertaining. BUT, it is NOT , FREE. Well in fact it IS, FREE, but if you want to deliver some competition in any or well ok, almost any tornament(but i still prefer to say ANY tornament) or win some prizes, you need to spend A LOT of real money here. So yes, this is cool game, but if you want to have some of the best or at least good characters with who you want to win some serious matches, you need to pay for it. So decide for yourself. Get yourself this  game if you want to kill some time in free math-three type game with cool comix atmosphere. Or if you ready and can spend a lot of money (though i guess you can spend them in more better way) then you will be able to have full fun here and try to get yourslef at very best places in any tornament.Anyway i cant recommend this game for that people who want to spend their money - cause the prizes are not THAT cool, and some of the best characters and their bonuses is too expensive. This is not THAT game where you get something THAT cool stuff.			"

												While the game itself is pretty fun, the business model is terrible.  It has many of the same flaws as iOS/Android shovelware.  For example, health regenerates very slowly between battles to try to get you to buy health restores.  You can spend money to level up your heroes.  I also thought the story got in the way of the actual gameplay.  Do yourself a favor and buy Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords and actually own a complete game.			"

It is FTP but as usual you can spend real money on Powerups, new characters, etc. etc. I for one never bother with spending my own money on these types of games and judge them by how much fun I can have without doing so.

												My experience so far...The first hour was fun! Really, really fun! The second hour wasn't bad. The third hour, I'd realized that in fact, yes, you CAN play all the way through a game where you're only ""unlock"" for that level left is a cover or charicter token, and get a 20 crystal card several times in a row for no discurnable reason instead. So, that's kinda a problem.Do you like choosing between laying out significant real world money? Do you like deleting charicters you've spent hours leveling up? Do you like deleting charicters you JUST got in a drop but don't have a space left to play with it? If you can answer ""yes"" to one of those questions, this is a great game for you.Honestly, if I could get the entire game for $15-20, I'd say go for it. It's a fun little puzzle game...but I wouldn't put a dime into this game.			"

												Puzzle Quest will turn you into a zombie, with the addition of Marvel... you shoud inform your next of kin you will be missing for a long, long timeUnfortunately this title has been heavily tuned to Grabbing your cash to an extent that after a few hours of play, its quite clear that this is indeed a pay to keep playing title. As your characters need healing after battle,  you only get 5 free heals a day... and thats where the money leaching starts...Not Free to Play, Not Pay to Win, this is like an old arcade machine where it will continue to suck your wallet dry as long as you want to stay and play.This is a Pay to Play title. Completely miscategorized. I'm not saying its a game you have to purchase, I'm saying its a game that will continuously bleed you dry everyday. For an addict this is the worst possible type of game, and it shouldn't be on steam. There is only one free to play option, download and play the first few nooby rounds. However; once you start building out any character it becomes clear: the monster in the room is the health cycle. You could sit back and wait 3 hours for your heroes to heal, or you can pay .50 cents per heal, per character, so this game could cost $1.50 a round with no perk characters granted, or an average of $1.00 per round. That is if you dont want to wait 3 hours after your 5 free heals are used. This is a Puzzle Quest tittle, anyone familiar with the series will know that it takes an incredible amount of grinding to build any character. Bottom line is this game would cost a small fortune to master, or to make it to the top of the player charts...Is it worth it? I dont think so. As much as I am a fan of Puzzle Quest and Marvel, this game truely punishes the player ( and wallet ). This is actually a blight on the series with this type of pay to play structure. I believe this title was programmed to rake cash.Disgraceful. Uninstalled promptly after writing this, and will not likely ever reinstall.			"

												Not a terrible game as the mass of negative reviews may indivate, however, there are some major drawbacks which certain gamers won't get on with.The Bad:1) Filled with ""micro""payments (not that micro really...) where you can pay to get ahead.2) Although the steam version was released 5 days ago, you're competing with iOS players who have obviously had a long time to play. They have more stuff, better characters, and there's many PvP tournaments to unlock more, better, characters which are virtually unobtainable due to their inherent advantage. If you were to pay to get yourself competitive, you'd be looking at paying thousands of pounds. Maybe they could have given Steam users a boost, or segregated the communities or had steam only contests so it's at least level?3) There's a lot of required characters for limited time events. Some are provided for use in certain battles, but I've found limited time games blocked from me because I don't have Iron Man Mk40.4) There's nothing original here, it's the same old game with some Marvel characters.5) It takes gold to unlock more character slots. Gold is available in finite amounts from the various single player and PvP events, but frustratingly once you receive a character card you are given 7 days to put it in your roster (either by increasing the roster or destroying an existing character card) else you lose your new character. It appears more characters have been added over time, as iOS players gathered enough gold to boost their slots. As a steam player this is a further handicap.6) Your characters have health which regenerates over time, but if they're K/O'd in battle, you lose them for an hour or more as they regenerate. You have 5 health packs for an instant revive, and a new health pack generates every 36 minutes. This does allow you to keep going, but you may find as you get into the game you are reluctant to try harder battles because your team will take damage which means you'll have to stop playing for a while. This is more designed for players who have half an hour to kill at regular intervals, rather than someone who wants to play solidly.The Good:1) It is puzzle quest, and it's free (sort of) so if you can resist paying, it's not bad.2) Since the iOS players have such an advantage, you're never competitive so there's less of a compulsion to be right up there. This makes it easier not to pay, and if you enjoy the challenge of being an underdog, it's not bad. Of course, if you're naturally very competitive you'll hate this game because there's no way you can do that without spending a sum which could be better used as a deposit on a mortgage.3) The game appears solid and bug free.4) It is simple enough to leave the game running in the background as your team heals when you do other things.I'd probably give this about 4/10, and would only recommend it to fans of Marvel, casual gamers who like CandyCrush/Bejewelled, and anyone wanting a free to play game who can resist the urge to pay for in game purchases. This is nothing special, it's a run of the mill game designed to milk money from gamers, but it can still be fun.			"

Well in fact it IS, FREE, but if you want to deliver some competition in any or well ok, almost any tornament(but i still prefer to say ANY tornament) or win some prizes, you need to spend A LOT of real money here. So yes, this is cool game, but if you want to have some of the best or at least good characters with who you want to win some serious matches, you need to pay for it. So decide for yourself. Get yourself this  game if you want to kill some time in free math-three type game with cool comix atmosphere. Or if you ready and can spend a lot of money (though i guess you can spend them in more better way) then you will be able to have full fun here and try to get yourslef at very best places in any tornament.Anyway i cant recommend this game for that people who want to spend their money - cause the prizes are not THAT cool, and some of the best characters and their bonuses is too expensive. This is not THAT game where you get something THAT cool stuff.			"

												It is ftp as long as you don't intend to win and just want to match 3 from time to time.The AI is horrible - no discussion.The delays between being ""allowed to play for free"" are annoying. The delays increase in relation with your health pool. Basically you can play a couple of matches every 4 hours.The story is boring.If you just want to puzzle, this is a possibility.			"

												While it is technically a free to play game, and you can certainly play it as such, you have to go into it with the understanding that you can't get very far in a sitting. This is one of those games where you play on your coffee break, or during commercials of your favorite tv show. If you like match 3 games, this is certainly an enjoyable one so long as you understand the wait time that is built in in order to weed out the less than patient. Go into it aware of the fact that it is programmed to encourage purchases or, what I like to call stretch breaks, and you should be fine and have an enjoyable time.			"

												I personally enjoyed this.  While the game does push microtransactions at every turn, to buy slots for heroes, to merely upgrade heroes and beyond, I still got enjoyment out of this game.  That being said, the actual puzzle quest titles are better, solely for the reason that they are games you've already paid for, thus play differently.To actually get a hero, you'll have to have a comic book cover for them. To actually make said hero practical, you'd will search for 10-13 covers for each hero. In turn, you get a ton of comic book covers from all sorts of sources. It would be nice to have something to do with the 10's or 100's of covers, for heroes you've already maxed out, other than selling them for 100 ISO. It would be nice to perhaps combine 5 1-star covers for a 2 star cover, for example.The hero slots are also quite limited, requiring premium currency to expand. That being said, by spending all the hero coins the game gives you on those slots, getting 10 slots of heroes is fairly manageable. You can get a lot of coins from events, as well as set rewards. It would be nice to have more of those rewards though. With the current event to recruit the Hulk, it's quite annoying when most of the level options are marked as 'impossible' since there isn't much for scaling. The difficulty might give a general idea, but it's far from accurate. I'm not sure if the difficulty marker is for my top heroes, or the current line up from the previous battle. It's far from perfect, but playing a game I haven't paid for I'm expecting some rough edges. This is rougher than most.  To give a scale of how much I enjoyed this game, it would range between 6 and 7.			"

												Fun for very casual play but will quickly become frustrating if you are unwilling to constantly buy points.  A good game for someone who wants to play only a few minutes at a time but not for the person who wants to sit down and play for hours straight.  This is the kind of game you get to play for a short amount of time and you will need to wait for your characters to heal.  You may of course pay ungodly amounts of money to speed things along.  If you are going to spend money on points I suggest you only buy the gold coins to unlock roster spots.			"

You cant effectively play new characters till 6+ months after release unless you wan to pay 100$ each.

Another thing not to expect is getting the Marvel story line correct. If youre a comic geek like myself and appreciate comic to game continuity, they really don't produce in that department.

												This is my first review ever. I am the kind of player who tries not to pay anything as far as free to play games are concerned. I have been playing this game for 3 weeks now.I love puzzle quest and indeed its not possible to dominate or enjoy this game without paying sth. Even for the player who doesnt want to be competitive, he still has to pay sth in order to get room to store his cards. I am not refering to storing extra cards (like having spiderman twice) but only to the cards you can get after playing the for some time. Putting those things aside its a great game. It is probably the best puzzle quest game so far. Its challenging, fun, addictive, and it a game that makes you pause for a little while for your heroes to rest (if you are a F2p player like me). Some people consider that pause a disadvantage. Considering how addictive the game is its best that you pause now and then. Events are fun and even F2P players like me get a chance to win some cards. Maybe i will not get the high level cards P2W players will get but nontheless the feeling of achievement is there. And due to the high requirements to level up heroes i believe  i will be playng this game for a long time with good fun. Plus due to the level cap of heroes i will eventually catch up with those P2W players.I believe spending money to get the 18 euro gold pack will get you the room necessary to store most of the cards you will get in game. Whether or not that will be worth it, its up to you! I certainly haven't regretted spending them.			"

												If you're into MARVEL, then get this game. If you're into match 3 (or more) games, then get this game. If you're into both DEFINITELY get this game. This game has a massive collection of different characters (both old and new), and all of them have the comic - style look to their display picture (which looks awesome)9/10If you have the space, get this game - it is worth it.

												I played this game almost 2 years. I managed to get a maxed out top tier (4 star) character after ONE YEAR of heavy grinding. I initially spent 20 bucks, but soon realized that spending money doesn't help at all. The better you get, the tougher the game gets.I got a second maxed top tier character after 15 month, but he wasn't what he used to be, because they nerfed him shortly before. I now have 4 more nearly maxed 4 star characters, but progression is so slow that I decided to finally quit the game. I do not recommend the game, because progression is too slow and the goals are changing too fast. (You build up a strategy over month, just to see devs change everything the moment you nearly finished.)And the stories are exceptional lame. Its Bejeweled with characters but not Puzzle Quest.			"

												I have played this game on mobile for 45 days for now and I have to say that this is one of the most enjoyable match-3 games I have played thus far. Maybe because I am sort of a fan of marvel myself that the whole grinding thing is not really that 'painful' as compared to other match-3 grinding games. The gameplay itself is pretty fun. You need to match certain colors more often than other time and you can activate certain abilities to reach victory.The reason why I am not recommending this steam version is simply because the whole thing is more suited to mobile environment and I was trying this steam version because I thought it would give a different kind of experience. But since there seems to be no way of transferring progress from my mobile to PC (or vice versa) and there is truly no point in starting from zero, I can't seem to find a good reason for myself to play this, let alone to recommend.

												I don't know why this game gets a bad rap. The combat is excellent, reminds me of an old school turn based game like Final Fantasy 1 or the original Pokemon. You don't have to pay to win, just grind it out and you'll be fine. I see a lot of complaints about how much time you have to invest playing in order to progress. I think people are really grasping for straws when that is the only type of complaint they can muster. You can't buy command points directly, so in my opinion it is not truly pay to win. Get on my level nerds, at least people aren't hacking this game like Pokemon Go or buying complete character sets with micro transactions like so many other card games. I'm enjoying this game a lot for what it is, and that's a solid combat RPG with puzzle mechanics.			"

												I started this match-3 free-to-play game without putting any money into it, and while the time limitations of such f2p games is in place, it still allowed me to play for stretches of about an hour a few times a day.  I got a nice puzzle fix, and I have to say that, compared to other f2p match-3 puzzle games, I found the reward system for this one giving me that extra little incentive to actually keep coming back to this one.By doing the quest lines I was able to acquire some character covers to upgrade my characters, and earn the Iso-8 which is used to level them up after upgrading, and even some gold which I proceeded to use to pick up a few more cover slots allowing more heroes.  With about 6-9 heroes available in various stages of upgrade, I was able to start in on some phases of the Deadpool dailies, earning Iso-8 more quickly and continuing to upgrade.Joining a random active alliance I began to get meager rewards from the weekly events and start giving it a shot myself.  I obviously did not get very far or do very well, but I did succeed in getting just that little more gold or Iso-8 or hero cover, and the prospect of earning just a little more kept me coming back, as did the continually expanding daily login bonus. (up to day 105 and still going, including a three star hero cover and heroic level random covers to boot.)Once I reached over 200 hours played, I decided to go ahead and support the game itself by spending $50 on it.  I have picked up AAA titles for my consoles for $50 and not spent nearly as much time, both hours-wise or days in a row played, as I have this game.  I have to say that, had I put that money in sooner, I don't believe it would have boosted my performance much in the beginning, but at the point I was at, having finished the story quests for all their repeated rewards and filled my f2p expanded roster, being able to add a dozen more heroes suddenly made my capabilities at this stage much more effective, and the game has just renewed itself in making me want to return to it each day just to see how much I can accomplish this time.If you have the patience, and enjoy match-3 puzzle games, and on top of that if you enjoy the Marvel license, this is a no-brainer.  It can be fun and enjoyable, even without putting any money into it, just don't expect to play it all in one sitting.  Much better as a short-session time waster, and approached as such, can feel very strategic, rewarding, and beneficial.Update: Passed the 900 hour mark, and still playing, still enjoying, still killing time with it.

												Match-three meets Micro-transactions meets CCG mechanics. Free to Play but also Pay to Win.Cons: -Storyline virtually inexistent-Brings nothing new to the genre -Does not delivers especially well what's been done better in other games of the same genre-Worst thing about it? Everything about this game feels like a test of endurance in ''How long will you hold out until you succumb and spend money''. Pros:FreeRecommendations:I would recommend the average consumer to avoid this product, although I have to admit that someone who actively enjoys the feeling of ''outsmarting'' the game design of Free To Play/Pay To Win titles might get a good number of hours of entertainment out of it.Actual length of content:As the game is updated regularly, with game modes coming and going, the actual length depends greatly on the consumer's personal tolerance for that genre and its repetition more than the available  I personnally checked out after less than 3 hours even though I must have spent more than 300 hours on similar titles.

												recently the developers have set a precident that they dont care how much money or time you have spent playing their game. one of the hardest characters to get was recently reduced in power simply because it was used more than other characters. people have spent thousands of dollars or countless hours to get that character and were offered extreamly lack luster compensation. the game may be somewhat entertaining but the developers dont care about the quality of your gameplay and only care about what keeps their microtransactions rolling. The reward system is dishonest and the percentages are not the same as the payouts received. The would lke you to belive that you have a random chance at geting rewards but in reality your rewards are predetermind and get cycled out for fresh ones . for a quick fix the game is ok. but dont expect to acheive anything because they will just take it from you. there are thousands of people in aliances right now that feel betrayed and jaded. im just trying to save you from our fate.

												Seeing all the hate, and having played this game for a long, long, LONG time, I believe I have the knowledge and experience to leave a detailed, comprehensive, and balanced review. I will start by saying that very few of the complaints aren't without merit, which is why I LOVE to HATE this damn game.Recently, D3 GO! released several innovations which increase the fun of playing the game...as well as still maintaining a skewed balancing system that favors the infamous micro-transaction. And I should know...I have made tons of micro-transactions in my long history of playing this game. A little here, some there, maybe a major buy or two (in fact, I think exactly two, LOL) over all that time. And believe me, the micro-part of the transaction can really add up over time. Let's address these new additions first, shall we? Command Points: Not too long ago, D3 GO! added Command Points to the MPQ universe. It was meant to thinly disguise the pay-to-pay (you read that right, not much of a free game if you have to pay to even place, much less win, IMHO) aspects of hero leveling. Here's the issue; if I have to have 250 CPs to take my hero up just one freaking level, it ain't doing jack for me. Especially since CPs are sparingly earned in only the toughtest missions (usually the two top 'boss' style stages of a level and maybe a really tough mission or two.) And you waste so much power and health trying to get one CP that you might as well not even try. And that's if you are running around with a fairly stacked roster!! (Mine is, BTW)     Now a lot of people might say, ""Well you can't buy CPs, so it's all fair, and cash don't determine no leveling no more.""  Yeah, stupid, except there's an issue with that. Purchasing the largest packages of ISO or Loonies gets you a crapton of CPs...not just for you, but for your whole friggin' Alliance, as well!! Just one Alliance member with really, really, REALLY deep pockets can upset the balance of power in a heartbeat. In addition, only the highest leveled (i.e., pay-to-win) players can actiually breeze through the missions to hit the fourth replay that gets you your damn CP in the first place!! (But the CP drops on those missions is random!! Yeah, no, moron. Count the number of times you actually get the damn CPs. Almost always on the fourth replay.)  Favorites: This feature is straight up bull $#!^. I have issues getting covers for my Jean Grey Pheonix Classic. Ever since getting her years ago (sarcasm) I've only ever once gotten a JGPC cover on a random draw. Now here, my CP and Favorites complaint merges--no matter how many 'Classics' packs I open...there's never a damn JGPC in them!! (You can buy a Classics pack with 20 CPs. Don't expect any--you know--actually useful characters. Same for the Modern Legends packs. And so when the Favorites feature was ntroduced, (which promises increased chances of drawing a 'Bonus' Cover for a Favorited character)  I was all, ""Yay!! Now I finally get me some of that Jean Grey!!"" And I set her as my only favorite. Yeah, no. Not happening. >_>Bottom Line--Even with a consistent stream of micro-transactions (meaning micro in the truest sense of the word) you will not place better than mid-tier status without forking over massive amounts of cold, hard cash. I really wish Steam would get that 'Mixed' review button out, because that's exactly my feelings on this game--mixed. I like the new innovations, but I hate how they are still balanced towards in-game transactions. I like that new stories are coming out pretty frquently, and new characters are coming out constantly--but don't like that I can never get them until literally months down the road because I am not investing enough to mortgage a house on. I will leave this review with a concise summary of Pros and Cons. If you understand the nature of the game, and expect little in the way of competitive wins, then this game is for you. If you can have fun, and enjoy what successes you do have--and don't get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥over the losses you do get--this game's for you. If you are willing to work hard to level your characters, and realize you may never get those really fraking cool big canon versions of your characters, then this game is for you.My Meter leans ever so slightly on the Pro side here, and thus the thumbs-up. But it is a very slim recomendation indeed. :/ Pros:Fun to play.Challenging.Great hero variety.New Features like the Champion system, which gives extended life to your lower tiered heroes.Cons:New Hero Slots are expensive as hell. (Best bet--dump loosers like Deadpool, Gwenpool, T-Rex looking thing, etc.)Game is rigged to favor P2W tactics, and not real--you know--strategy.Limited ability to even grind properly, as the scaling of the 'Boss' stages favors P2W.New features slanted towards P2W, thus♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them of their usefulness to the 96% of 'normal' players. (For example, the 'Heroes-for-Hire' feature is outrageously priced for what you get.)			"

Don't expect any--you know--actually useful characters. Same for the Modern Legends packs. And so when the Favorites feature was ntroduced, (which promises increased chances of drawing a 'Bonus' Cover for a Favorited character)  I was all, ""Yay!! Now I finally get me some of that Jean Grey!!"" And I set her as my only favorite. Yeah, no. Not happening. >_>Bottom Line--Even with a consistent stream of micro-transactions (meaning micro in the truest sense of the word) you will not place better than mid-tier status without forking over massive amounts of cold, hard cash. I really wish Steam would get that 'Mixed' review button out, because that's exactly my feelings on this game--mixed. I like the new innovations, but I hate how they are still balanced towards in-game transactions. I like that new stories are coming out pretty frquently, and new characters are coming out constantly--but don't like that I can never get them until literally months down the road because I am not investing enough to mortgage a house on. I will leave this review with a concise summary of Pros and Cons. If you understand the nature of the game, and expect little in the way of competitive wins, then this game is for you. If you can have fun, and enjoy what successes you do have--and don't get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥over the losses you do get--this game's for you. If you are willing to work hard to level your characters, and realize you may never get those really fraking cool big canon versions of your characters, then this game is for you.My Meter leans ever so slightly on the Pro side here, and thus the thumbs-up. But it is a very slim recomendation indeed. :/ Pros:Fun to play.Challenging.Great hero variety.New Features like the Champion system, which gives extended life to your lower tiered heroes.Cons:New Hero Slots are expensive as hell. (Best bet--dump loosers like Deadpool, Gwenpool, T-Rex looking thing, etc.)Game is rigged to favor P2W tactics, and not real--you know--strategy.Limited ability to even grind properly, as the scaling of the 'Boss' stages favors P2W.New features slanted towards P2W, thus♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them of their usefulness to the 96% of 'normal' players. (For example, the 'Heroes-for-Hire' feature is outrageously priced for what you get.)			"

												This is one of the best F2P games I've ever played, so much so I've bought a 20 dollar pack if only to support the Devs, not to make things easier for me. The game is balanced enough to enjoy on your own, with enough events or daily tasks to let you get packs with a wide variety of heros, seriously the selection of heros you can get are pretty impressive, like you got the classics like Wolverine, Mr Fantastic, Iron Man, the Hulk. But what about Devilsaur, Howard the Duck, Squirrel Girl, and of course the always awesome Deadpool, so awesome that he is running the daily quests, nice.This game clearly was built with love, the devs put so much heart into this game that this does not feel like a cheap cash grab. I highly recommand this game for people who either need a quick game, on a budget, a puzzle game fan, love marvel, or just want something fun in general to play. Devs, ya did good, and I appauld you for not going the route of many F2Ps			"

												Good game. Although gameplay can be limited for players who don't spend real money. You can get almost everything a paid player would get, but not anywhere nearly as quickly.			"
