												ThankYou, Irrational Games for this unique, utterly fun and most uber´heroic RPG georgessness You blessed us with .. Never mind the date of creation - this thing still kicks some in´glorious assess all around the gaming board of nowdays produced self´erious halfbaked sh(allow)it. :) It doesn´t take it self seriously, yet it possesses some seriously great game-mechanics .. Very engaging and fun variable (real/slowdown/stopped time) combat system, wide range of memor(like)able superheroes (and their antagonist) with dozens well represented powers to choose from, superb controls and u.i., well written and (with proper dose of pathosilliness) narrated script, destructable enviroment and myriads of nazies to beat.Oh, how much I wish they make a sequel! Deserves one to be kick-startered up and above the stars./ Don´t get confused by the play-time above .. I had been making looov to this beauty a loooot more before my steam-days started to call the shots (and other mouse-button-bound activities:) /			"

												I have never liked a game as much as this, and have never desired the final game to complete the trilogy as much as this series. I liked the first game, but loved the second one. Both game have fantastic characters, but the second one has more of them. Great stories, great character interactions, completely interactive enviroments (you can destroy an entire city if you want). This time around we see major villain vs villain action in the story! Graphics are good for the time the two games were made, the only thing that bothered me from the first game to this one is the ability to over or under power your attacks but it didn't affect anything that much. 9/10			"

												I've read some complaints that the game feels more like an expansion. Those are not without merit, but I'd say it's superior to the first one. The story is even more crazy, but always interesting, the levels are more varied and look much better (thanks to some comic-bookey textures), the mission objectives are generally more interesting, the new characters are cool and it's not as long as the first game, which I feel is an advantage, considering I was getting kinda bored during the last couple of hours of the first game.At the price you can usually buy these during major sales, it's totally worth it.

												Freedom force vs. the Third Reich is the right kind of nostalgia. The kind that isn't a repeat of something you saw with a fresh coat of paint, but a celabration of WHY we love this thing we love. Stylistically it seems to lovingly and joyfully toss in every silver age (and lots of golden age) comic book trope and cliche both in how the characters speak and look. Expressed no more beautifully than through the amazing hero origin cut scenes between each mission. Cut scenes which I hasten to add are easily the best element for me in the entire game. From the narration, to the story itself, to the personas of each hero...the game just knows what it is and knows exactly what its calling back to.Gameplay wise the game isn't mind blowing but I wouldn't call it bad. It feels like a slightly looser and far less complex version of the pause/start style of a Balder's Gate or Dragon Age. Teetering on this little border between beat em up/strategy/crpg. You pause, issue commands, target enemies with abilities or allies with buffs and heals, unpause. It works and honestly its a style of gameplay Id love to see given over to actual comic book video games in the future if it evolved some. I mean it makes perfect sense for this kind of strategy light gameplay to be how a super hero team game should play. Now the issues start to nip at the edges when it comes to things like AI pathing and priorities. But really at the pop of a button you can pause anyway so even though it'd be nice to have your heroes act smarter when not under direct orders at all times...it aint nobodies fault but your own that they ever don't have said orders. Imagine one of the old syndicate games but with more verticality and the ability to pause and issue commands. Also I think some of the 'Jagged Alliance' games utilized this mechanic.For me though the issue with this game I had most trouble dealing with was the length. Mind you I played it in 2 hour stints but by the time I got to the end I felt like it had overstayed its welcome. I had long ago seen the last of the amazing hero origin cut scenes and by the time I stopped felt like the game had become rather drawn out. With missions made needlessly long for the sake of tacking on time played.  That being said I could easily still recommend this title to anyone who is a lover of silver age comic books. Its like the first Freedom Force game but better. It's the kind of thing a comic book fan cannot help but smile at over and over again. so considering how cheap it usually is I firmly suggest giving it a try.			"

												The Freedom Force games are a must play for anyone who enjoys superhero games. Gameinformer ranked Freedom Force in it's top ten superhero games of all time. Freedom Force vs. The Third Reich builds upon the mechanics introduced in the original game, and adds a brilliant new layer to the story. Established characters are developed further than in the previous game, and the balance between old characters and new ones is kept marvelously, especially when in WWII. I have played this game since I found it years ago, so when I found it on Steam I grabbed it quickly. Although at this point I don't have many hours logged in, I have probably invested over 100 hours into this game and have thoroughly enjoyed each play through. One of my favorite superhero games of all time, and I hope they come out with Freedom Force 3 some day!			"

												Don't let the 2 hours on record fool you.  I played this for years before Steam, and bought it here thinking it would be nice to be able to download it easily instead of digging out the CDs again.That was a mistake.As any fan of this or the first Freedom Force will tell you, the strength of the game was in the mods, moddability, and community online.  Steam neutered that.  It is difficult, sometimes impossible to run the mods for this game that are, honestly, necessary for me now that I've experienced the game with them.FFX adds so much that the game is basically bland without it, and Steam makes it impossible to run the mod.  Because it's Steam, I can't run the game outside of Steam now, so I can't manually use the mod either.Not recommended because of this.			"

												From involving story to eye-popping graphics, very funny script, incredible characters, great voice acting, ultra-smooth gameplay, and an unusual range of extended play options, FFVTR brings it all together. One of the best PC games of 2005. The neatest thing about FFVTTR is that you truly interact with the environment – you can destroy buildings, and even pick up lampposts to swat opponents. This is a serious innovation and really makes the game stand out, in 2005. The game is still pure, unadulterated fun at its finest, so don't expect complex strategic decision making or hours of agonized role playing as you customize your characters. Instead, let Irrational's newest delight serve as a reminder that games, above all else, are meant to entertain and amuse us. The only complaint, the game went political correct and removed the swastika on the armband.			"

												This version fixes some of the issues from the original - you start with more chars and they all have more abilities.  However it is basically the same game but with worse camera issues.I could not bring myself to keep playing it because of the camera issues.  Everytime I selected a new charactor, the camera would zoom in, turn, and tilt.  This makes it really annoying to ""pause"" and start telling each team member what to do during combat.It also removed the ability to move around and look at places your chars are not standing.  So basically it was the camera that drove me nuts after an hour that I decided it was not worth my time.It is a good game, funny game, and interesting if you like comic book style stuff ~ however you need to like micro RTS with 2-3 units and bad camera issues to really get a good play out of it.

												I never played this game when it was originally released but I was a huge fan of the first game. The interface and game engine seem smoother and less clunky than the original. Considering that the game was released in 2005, it looks great. I had no problems with running it in Win7 on an HD monitor. There's no distortion in either the in-game cinematics or gameplay and the graphics have held up pretty well due to the cartoony nature. The voice acting remains solid and matches the tone well. Some features, such as the multiplayer feature and the custom character import, don't work, but the single player campaign works perfectly fine. I only have 6 hours in the game *so far* but I wanted to post a review while it's on the Steam holiday sale. For less than $2, the game is totally wrothwhile.			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. If you are a fan of comics or superheroes, this game does a very good job at providing a charmingly campy feel and an immense selection of cutomization options for making your own hero, from climbing walls to punching buildings into rubble, to throwing cars, to flying, to super speed, to mind control. I had always wanted a game that allowed true freedom for developing a hero that can do almost anything, and when I found out this existed, I couldn't contain my excitement. Of course the graphics are now outdated, but the game still holds up as an enjoyable comic experience. There is even a mod called Freedom Force X (FFX) that I have read adds more abilities like shapshifting and additional attributes. I have yet to try it, but have downloaded it and look forward to the additional content. I highly recommend looking into this if you are at all a fan of superheroes. Besides, at the asking price of less than $8, there isn't a lot to lose.			"

												Funny superhero game with tactical strength as long as you dont exploit the character creation option like I did :D Very rare bugs, nice abilities and background story give you about 5-8 hours of gameplay to complete.If you cant get enough of Nazis with imperfect German and an American accent this is your game. Also: Look at the posters at the walls of the underground bases ;D(Also justificates and promotes violence by .... *PUNCH* FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR FREEEEEEEEDOOOOOOOM!!!			"

												While not quite as good as the original, I still enjoyed playing the game. There's no real new ground broken here. If you liked the first game, you'll probably like this one. If you didn't like the first one, this one won't change your mind.This game is a decade-old and has the design quirks you'd expect given that. There is no autosave, so you need to save during missions yourself. If you don't, you'll find yourself suddenly dead and needly to replay 30-40 minutes of a fight. The enemies, even at the end, can be tough. Make a single tactical mistake and an enemy can land a punch that does 40% damage to some characters. There is not much healing on most maps, so a mistake early on in a mission usually means you don't have enough health for the climax.On a few maps, a bad team choice can make the mission extremely difficult (which you sometimes don't know until you're 10 or 15 minutes in), e.g. when you discover the Nazis suddenly have flying units and you're stocked up with ground melee units.Like the first game, you are overwhelmed with characters and I never felt like I got much of a chance to explore many of them. Given how long most missions are, and the how much one poor character (in a team of only 4) can hamper you in a mission, it is easy to ""play it safe"" and go with the same smallish set.Despite the flaws, this is still a great RTS with a strong single-player campaign.

												A precious gem.  It's cleaned up a lot of the messy bits of the first game, but somehow the story doesn't resonate as powerfully.  Maybe because it focuses strongly on a few characters, rather than keeping the ensemble feel of the first story.  Still, another delightful, incredible, brilliant game.			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. If you are a fan of comics or superheroes, this game does a very good job at providing a charmingly campy feel and an immense selection of cutomization options for making your own hero, from climbing walls to punching buildings into rubble, to throwing cars, to flying, to super speed, to mind control. I had always wanted a game that allowed true freedom for developing a hero that can do almost anything, and when I found out this existed, I couldn't contain my excitement. Of course the graphics are now outdated, but the game still holds up as an enjoyable comic experience. There is even a mod called Freedom Force X (FFX) that I have read adds more abilities like shapshifting and additional attributes. I have yet to try it, but have downloaded it and look forward to the additional content. I highly recommend looking into this if you are at all a fan of superheroes.

												Great continuation of the Freedom Force story with the same great gameplay and humor. Great comic plot, this time with a World War 2 twist.			"

												Brilliant Action-RPG that still holds up after almost a decade. The interface and gameplay have been refined from its prequel and the writing is spot on. It really brings comic books to life. However, be warned that the ending may have you wanting a third installment of the series, which, sadly, is looking unlikely.			"

												Pretty cool game, and a nice sequel to the original Freedom Force.  The hammy voice acting and cut scenes are pretty fun, and the gameplay is great - good UI with easy-to-learn mechanics.  Thanks to the basic art style, the graphics don't look too dated even 10 years later.  This game is mostly held back by the heroes your'e stuck using sometimes -- once you decide who your favorites are, it will annoy you that they're probably not available for some of the campaign missions.  In spite of this, it's still a classic game that deserves another sequel. "
