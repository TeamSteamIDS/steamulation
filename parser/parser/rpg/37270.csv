												Wandering Willows is the closest game to Animal Crossing I've experienced. If that doesn't sell you, nothing will.			"

												I have to admit this is better than it looks. It plays kind of like a casual MMO, with the majority of the gameplay involving simple quests for the townsfolk. If you're in the mood to pick berries and make clothes for yourself and others, you could do far worse than this game.The characters and storylines are simple, but effective, and - much to my surprise - they can actually be pretty funny. The game uses a lot of internet humor, but I don't mean copy+pasted memes. One of the main characters repeatedly disturbs others with his sexual deviance (dressing up as a furry is only the beginning), and another gets addicted to an MMO. I found these things to be an amusing surprise when I was just looking for a simple game to fill a few hours with easy mindless clicking.			"

												I got this game in a bundle a while back, and it's surprisingly addictive and very fun.You crash land your hot air balloon on an island, and your goal is to repair your balloon and go home. In order to do this, you must perform tasks for the natives, which usually involve crafting or cooking various items for them, or delivering items to someone else. Rather than climbing trees or digging for things yourself, you use one of the many animals roaming the island to do it for you. As the animals level up, they can climb higher trees, dig tougher rock piles, and fight stronger...other animals, for the items they drop. Sometimes, they will drop an egg, which you can hatch into a new friend. Collect them all! "

												I found this game very addictive; farming and foraging items with the help of your charming pet for crafting items to customise your character or appease the locals requests in a bid to escape their insane dialog (though occasionally hilarious!) I'm kind of sad that in 12 hours of gameplay I have completed the main scenario and there's not much left other than collecting the other pets and costume items... Which could get tedious as some of them are extremely rare to encounter and eggs are the rarest drop. The costume items if I collect them all I estimate would add another 2-5 hours of play.Movement controls can be irritating when you accidentally click on something to harvest you didn't intend to, slowing down movement and depleting your pet's energy which in turn slows your progress. The characters move slowly and the graphics could use a clean-up, but it has a nice frame rate which doesn't trigger my motion sickness.			"

												Perfect game to accompany a binge watch of a fairly complex TV show.That is: it's easy. It's cute. There is mild humor, and mostly you will direct whatever pet you have active to dig, climb, or make friends with other pets. You'll farm, kinda. You'll walk all over the place but the mini-map allows you to click on your destination and go fix yourself a snack while your character self navigates. If you happen to get engrossed in your show, your character will sit on the map, amusing itself contentedly.I tend to play more intense games on consoles; my computer is for keeping my fingers busy while I""m watching TV. This game was absolutely perfect.I'm gonna put it this way: have you ever downloaded one of those cute little freemium apps for your phone, played for an hour, fallen in love with the simple little story, the one dimensional NPC's, and the collections you need to complete, then suddenly BOOM! ""Invest $5 daily or it'll be so slow it ain't worth it"" happens?This game gives a similar experience, but with no BOOM!GIVE MORE MONEH! experience. You simply....interact with the one dimensional NPC's, do tasks for them, collect, collect, and then collect some more, do all the little tasks, and chill.Reminds me more of Tamadochi Life than of Animal Crossing, but it was enjoyed by myself, my 6 year old, my 8 year old, and my friend got it for her 13 year old who has completed it twice, so I guess it's a hit!

												I got this as part of a game pack... played exactly 5 minutes.  Reminds me of Animal Crossing for the Nintendo.  Seemed to run OK on Windows 10.  Can't say much else, as it's not my type of game.			"

												Willow of Wandercraft Lite. Wander through the willows and discover the mysteries that will help you with your ultimate quest; going home. The only raiding you'll need to do is yout fridge because if you don't, you'll feel the hunger within as you pull an all-nighter trying to accomplish everything this wonderful game has to offer.
