												There are game genres wherein terrible writing is acceptable. Pure RPGs, which thrive on story at the expense of almost all else, are not among them. While the combat gameplay is passable, the writing is beyond bad, heaping contrivance upon awkward shoe-in on top of nigh-endless obsequeious player-praising that would make an Elder Scrolls writer blush. Everyone is a dramatic charicature of a person, /everyone/. This is not the grand arena, you are not the chosen one, there is no evil empire, and this game most definitely does not smell like incense. Give it a pass at anything even remotely like full purchase price.			"

												To be quite honest, this isn't one of WinterWolves' better games. I enjoyed it, but I also was increasingly frustrated by it.It's an older-style RPG, like another of their games, Loren, but with a bit of the mindless dungeon-crawler aspect. As much as I enjoy dungeon-crawlers, this game managed to drag through some of them. You're supposed to search through the desert to ""find"" specific items needed to continue with the plot, but your searches can turn up random items or monsters, which you can flee (when possible), or fight.Sometimes, however, the battles seemed overpowered, and there isn't as much that grinding to help. You get most of your items from the supply room on the ship, so you don't get to fight and earn money to purchase your own supplies. Most of the higher items come as you fight and raise up, which I found more difficult to do than in their other games.While this game does have its otome/visual novel elements, they do take a large back-seat to the game. It doesn't have as large of a choice pool for potential partners, if that's your cup of tea, and I found the scenes to be more amusing (if often shorter) in Loren than I did in PS. That said, I enjoyed the game more or less, but I don't believe I'll be replaying it, and I'm glad I got it for 50% off. I'd recommend it, I suppose, if you enjoy old-style RPGs, and have some time to kill, but otherwise, it's probably not for you.			"

												To be fair, I haven't been playing a lot of the story. This did take a lot of time though.The story seems to be OK, but filled with a bit too many stock plot ""twists"" to be really interesting. For a cheapish game, I can live with it. Dialogs are simple and rather... dull. You are presented with a block of text, follwed by another block of text and so on. Once the talking is done, you're presented with a few options (which you can repeat untill you hit the magic ""stop talking"" button). So far, I've found very few real dialog options.Dialog does affect relationships from time to time, but just like too many other ""RPGs"" you often have no idea what the effects will be; when allowing my party to drink while gathering information, my relations with the super soldier party's alcohols is reduced.The combat is typical for it's genre -- your party goes in order and get a few options to attack the enemy. The enemy then goes in order in the same style, untill either side is defeated. XP appears to rewarded on a kill basis -- when a party member finishes an enemy that person gets all the XP from the enemy.Combat difficulty appears to scale much faster than your characters do. So far, I've gotten 1 level on my main character (by manageing damage so he could get more kills). In the meantime the enemies have gone from doing about 5 damage per attack to about 20 damage per attack and hit points have gone from 40ish to 300ish.If you want to have level your main character fast, go for scout -- accuracy is the most important thing when dealing damage and scouts, at equal skill level, will be significantly better at hitting enemies, while doing roughly equal damage (that is, more damage) than soldiers or guardians.On top of the poor combat and the bad writing, the game's performance is appauling. On a 2.8 GHz CPU the UI is sluggish, animations choppy and picking dialog options have delays. Combat is equally slow. The only part of the game which does not have extremly bad perfomance is text rendering, which is a big help, since you'll be skipping most of it anyway.Overall, I cannot recommend this game. The balance of the game is really poor and the story simply doesn't make up for the rubbish combat.			"

												I picked up this game after playing ""Loren-The Amazon Princess,"" which is by the same company.  I liked ""Loren"" a lot (except there was a ton of purple prose when it came to the in-game romances and a few of the romances felt creepy/abusive) for the mixture of story and very oldschool game mechanics.  The difference between ""Loren"" and ""Planet Stronghold"" is pretty much they emphasized different things.  ""Loren"" developed the relationships and romances to a huge degree - the romances didn't just happen, the player had to seek them out, but had minimal game mechanics.... ""Planet Stronghold"" has minimal romances and an implausible story (put the cadet in charge of a war because he has a familiar last name?) and really good (though oldschool) game mechanics.  The aggro system in ""Planet Stronghold"" is AWESOME.  You can instantly tell which one of your group is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the mobs the most by glancing down at their meter, and comparing it to the other group members.  Best system for aggro control I've ever played, in any game.This is a solid game to play if you're bored and if it's on sale.  I did almost 19 hours on it.			"

												Quite an enjoyable RPG with a good mix of story, party and skill management, and exploration. If you like the look of the screenshots, I think you will like this game.+Main character customization including gender and class/skill specialties+Variety of characters to include in your party, customize all their skills on leveling+Choose and upgrade weapons, armor, and items for all party members+Story and side quests are well done, rewards for exploring+Battles are fun and some challenging, requring varying tactics, psionics add more depth+Events allow options for completing tasks/quests based on skills+Save/load anywhere, at any time-No voiced dialogue outside battles-Not a wide range of available weapons/armor for most the game-Save anywhere makes it all too easy to avoid any negative outcomes for choices-All skills are known (but not developed) for all characters, no new skills appear with levels-Combat/non-psionic classes don't have their own special skills			"

												The music is quite good. The art is good enough. That's all.The story is not bad by itself. But the writing is terrible for a visual novel. Careless, full of inconsistencies, too conceited on the player. Absolutely below average. And I'm a sucker for visual novels.The RPG part is a bit dull. The normal difficulty is adjusted to force you into grind every map, and can get a bit over the line sometimes. With the DLC you get an enormeus variety of weapons with random names, making them even harder to compare and choose. Being most of them not better than the ones you get through history, they mostly add clutter.In the end, I can not recommend the game. There are plethora of other VN much better than this one, and many are free. I also find the RPG part too weak, too, or at least not satisfying enough to justify a recommendation.You may have seen the ""hours played"" counter and think it is too low. I got the game in a bundle and played the DRM version. Seeing the game has trading cards I may try to get the alternate arc and romance option I didn't care about the first time I played.10/10 Would get steam cards again.			"

												Standard Role Playing Game with a bit of Visual Novel thrown into the mix.This is probably the most difficult negative review I've had to write so far, but there are just enough large (but not game-breaking flaws) to overlook.(--) The level up/skill-point system is broken. Basically, they fall into 3 categories: combat skills, non-combat skills, and psionic (magic) skills. Most of the combat skills are divided into weapon skills, of which you should only put levels into one of them, which is based on your class selection. Every 20 points in a weapon skill, it raises damage with that weapon type by 1 per shot. This means that weapons that get 4 shots in one round get 4x more improvement than weapons with 1 shot - this is silly. The other combat skills: armor, accuracy, and evasion actually all do work alright, and are tempting to level even when they're not a class specific skill. Leveling individual psionics skills is absolutely broken, however. There is a singular root psionics skill which improves ALL the subskills in such a way that leveling individual skills is completely pointless. The non-combat skills are 'okay'. All they do is influence the RNG in various plot events that occur throughout the story, and a few give some mild combat perks.(-) Psionics is not a very well balanced skill set. The one class that is dedicated to the use of it, it works pretty well, and a majority of the spells will see some use from it. Unfortunately, the 3 other classes in the game, while they're meant to have varying aptitudes with psionics, they're effectively bad enough with it that just attacking is the right answer.(-) The inventory/equipment UI could be a lot better. It's a non-trivial matter (when it ought to be) of comparing the values of weapons.(-) The characters are pretty shallow, although I'm mostly giving this one a pass due to the nature of the game.(+/-) There isn't just attacking. There's 3 different attack types which have varying levels of shots fired per round, hit %, crit chance, and aggro drawn. The first 3 of those parameters are pretty boring - with some time spent with calculations, you can find out which attack type gives you the most damage for the weapon you're using. However, the level of aggro drawn is an interesting mechanic that I'll cover later.(+/-) Lots of RNG. Can lead to some frustration, can also lead to some exciting down to the line fights.(+) While it's nothing too special, I did like the flow of the plot and the setting. Based on other users' negative reviews, I guess your mileage may very significantly here.(+) Games often have to sacrifice in order to provide a gamepath that isn't on tracks.(++) Aggro management. Different actions will raise the probability that the enemy will target that particular character on their turn (and thus lower the probability of attacking the other 3 characters). This mechanic right here is significantly responsible for tactical decisions, and despite all the other flaws of the game, actually leaves combat kinda fun. It's an intricate balance between shaping as much aggro on your characters with the best resistances to the enemy attacks, but also still spreading enough damage to other characters, since even your characters with the best resistances can get overwhelmed by 2 consecutive rounds of the enemy focusing on him. Enemy will have enough mana to use an ability that will block a character from using normal attacks for a couple turns? Better ramp up the aggro on your Psionic.In summary, I believe a broken leveling system (and its subsequent damage on the magic system) has wrecked an otherwise mediocre title that would earn a $10-15 pricetag.

												A choice-laden narrative and attractive soundtrack are minor positives for a game let down by an immature story, horrible dialogue, and boring, badly implemented / balanced combat. Avoid unless frustration is your preferred form of masochism.First the choices. There are a lot of choices, and they do branch convincingly: if you wanted to romance a certain character and screw it up, there's no way to charm yourself back into their good graces. Find a save, and re-load. The choices aren't just about romancing: every single member of your party has dialogues and side missions that will unlock if you talk to them enough and make the right dialog choices. Even faction alliances are contained within mutually exclusive dialog choices. Full marks for a branching narrative.The choices and consequences are real enough, but don't buy Planet Stronghold expecting mature levels of writing. The story verges on the ridiculous – a recruit with all of 2 days of experience is put in charge of an army. I'm all for playing pretend and enjoying impossible accomplishments, but come on. It's not like in Dragon Age Origins, for instance, where Alistair cedes command of the party to you; that was explained within the story as part of the character arc. Here, you get a command because the prince you've known for a few hours suddenly “trusts you.” Some of the dialogue is worse than what you would find in a B-movie. And there's no voice-acting to make the lines sound better than they are. They're just there, and if you as a player can't commit to the characters and the story, you'll be absolutely p*ssed about how the dialogue sounds in your head. You'll see other reviews proclaiming the challenging combat as a great addition to a story-driven game. Yeah, no. Combat is awful. It takes the relaxing visual-novel experience and forces story progression through hours of meaningless and boring combat. Fire guns, use Psionics to buff the hero and his team, let the bad guys fire back, repeat until the enemies fall. When weapons are dealing 5 points of damage per shot (even after de-buffing the target), and an enemy has 350 points of health, that's a lot of sitting still and clicking, waiting for the fight to be over. What makes matters worse is that the combat itself is badly balanced (if the word balanced can even be used here). Here's an example. If my character has an 80% accuracy rating, there is no way (mathematically) he should miss 3 shots out of every 5. At most, he should miss 1 out of 5, or 2 out of 10, or 3 out of 15. But when his burst of fire is 7 shots, and he misses 5 of them, something is badly wrong. “You need to level your Accuracy skill and take into account the enemy's Evade skill” (I did) “and don't use the Burst setting!” (I didn't). I even reduced the difficulty to Easy to see if it would make a difference. It doesn't. The only conclusion I can draw is that the results of the turn-based combat are entirely random. Not a good thing to hang onto your choice-laden visual novel. Not saying the IDEA of having turn-based combat in a visual novel is bad – it isn't – but don't make it randomized, then boast your game is “challenging.”I generally start a game wanting to like it. Planet Stronghold was no different. After 20 hours and multiple attempts at progressing, I'm giving up and am off to play something else.			"

												This is one of the first visual novels I've ever played and I remember loving it. Don't pay attention to my time in game or achievements, as I've completed ""Planet Stronghold"" few times before it was even on Steam. Recently though, I've decided to go back and experience it once again, since I plan to buy ""Planet Stronghold: Colonial Defense"" and I wanted to remind myself a bit about the lore and check how the game is holding up.Well, I was surprised to find it doesn't hold up very well.Let's start by saying that ""Planet Stronghold"" is an RPG/Visual Novel hybrid (similar, in that aspect, to Loren: The Amazon Princess from the same developer - great game). It's early Winter Wolves game, so some issues are obvious, although still needs to be pointed out.First of all - game is laggy. I'm not even sure how that's possible, since it seems like such a small game and my PC surpass the requirements. And it's not even during fights - game tends to lag during looking through inventory or going around the map, which really shouldn't happen. UI is terrible. Do you want to change character's weapon? Well, first you need to put it out from the main character inventory (as usually every item that you got ends up there), but to do that, you need to go to the armory, and then you need to transfer the item to the other character and then open this characters inventory and then equip it. There is at least three more steps than necessary and that's annoying.Writing is bad. It really is. The nice thing is that you have two routes available from very early in the game - you can support prince and try to make peace with alien races or support king and fight them. Sadly, it's very obvious what is the ""right moral choice"", so if you chose king, for most time you feel like you are fighting for the bad guys. There isn't nearly enough build up to make ""your own"" decision - you kind of hear that king is a genocidal maniac, but you don't spend enough time around any group of aliens to see if there is any justification to his action. There is also a lot of plot holes and questionable decisions, that I will mention later. Dialogues are simply bad.Main Character. You play as Joshua or Lisa Nelson. You may chose your gender, which is neat and that changes some aspects of the story. That being said, both of the MC are quite annoying to play as. Joshua is almost drooling on any woman sight (which is weird, because you have neat homosexual option within the game, so you would assume that writers will get you more freedom in terms of shaping this character, that just giving it an instant and rather stereotypical ""straight guy"" attitude) and Lisa is treated by one of her teammates in a way that just begs for ""punch this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" option. It's also worth mentioning, that the game starts with us coming to some military base as a recruits and shortly after, we start commanding the troops. And the reason is... Well... I guess we did good in some fight? And we have a surname that one of legendary war heroes had? And king want us to lead because of... reasons? As you can see, it just feels very unrealistic.Characters. Most of characters are very stereotypical, they lack depth. You can see that writer tried to do something interesting with them, as each of character has some sort of backstory and special mission, but because of bad writing, it just feels flat and uninteresting. Also, justification for ""let's go alone on this mission and not bother any of our crew members"" is silly. For example, Rumi wants you to go with her to special facility that may be heavily guarded, but that's so ""personal"" to her, that you can't take any other team members. It's just dumb, not to mention that her mission seem very similar to Jack's loyalty quest from Mass Effect.Romance. Your gender determines your romance options. Each MC has three available romance partners and one of them is same gender option. Sadly, as in many Winter Wolves games, romance is very rushed and out of place. I really like Joshua x Cliff story line, but I may be biased towards same-sex romances. At the same time though, I though Lisa x Michelle wasn't interesting at all, so I'm not sure that's it. Damien is an intriguing option, but he doesn't get nearly enough in-game time to make him a compelling character and Tom starts nicely and then just acts in a childlish manner. That's the reason why I felt like there isn't a good romance partner for female MC.Skills. That's the part of the game I actually enjoy. ""Planet Stronghold"" offers you an option of solving conflicts/gather data/finishing quests/obtaining new items not by fighting, but by using certain skills. You can choose any of your teammembers and let him/her do the job. You always see the how high chance of success they will have and if they fail, you can simply reload the game and try again.Fights. I usually don't have much to say about fighting mechanism, it isn't any different here. There are a lot of enemies, with strong and weak points, and different squads require different kind of strategy. That being said, fights aren't very captivating and often feel unfair.It breaks my heart to give this game a negative review. I actually wanted to do the opposite, when I started writing this , but when I see all the things I've mentioned above, I know it would be very hard to justify it in any way. ""Planet Stronghold"" is a very sentimental game for me, but it's far from being good, especially in comparison to other, similar titles.			"

												I tried to like this game I really did. It seems like there is a dynamic skill and character development at your first glance but it quickly wears off as you can save at literally any time during both conversations and battle. This means you cans save for random dice roll percentile skill checks (given like 22% chance of success) and you can bump each party member in 1 skill and since you have your entire huge party available for most tasks you always succed. Talking to your party hurts me physically as most of the other party members (soldiers) in the game have high school kid conversations. I ended up nearly maxxing charisma to only use it two or three times the entire game.  The game appears and plays to be a high class flash game from a website not so much a game worth $20.I am a big fan of games like Planescape Torment, Fallout, Shadowrun and Age of Decadence so story really matters to me, and with a game which has combat in which you can just click through you need meaningful conversations to happen. The weak dialogue and character interactions really disappoint because the plot was quite interesting albeit extremely short but the immersion is too easily broken with your character stammering and getting embarrassed like a kid about to have sex for the first time all the while everyone praising your magnificent efforts.Worse part is I'm likely gonna finish the game just so my character can get laid by sexy female character with the last name ""Fox"". Also the females have a permanent blush tone to their face and with the character writing it seems like a dating simulator with RPG combat elements to advance the storyline.5.5/10 on completion.			"

												I can't say I really enjoyed playing this game. It seemed good at first, but the more I played, the more mind numbing, tedious and boring it became. I thought it was going to be good because it added a social element to a typical RPG. However, this game is nowhere near as good as the likes of Persona or Fire Emblem: Awakening. The social aspect is limited to making simple choices between two options which either impress or irritate the other characters in the game. Additionally, a lot of the choices look as though you're going to irritate the person you're talking to either way, which I personally don't like.Yet, this isn't the only problem I found with the game. The equipment you have is fairly simple and there are only two ways to obtain more. Recycle your old gear for scrap metal and build new equipment with it or find it on quests. To find new equipment on quests is not efficient as you have several crew members who all need their own equipment and the quests yield nowhere near the amount needed. As for the recycling method, the amount of scrap metal needed is far too great (from my experience).Finally, I find the combat to be very repetitive. A lot of the enemies are extremely powerful and take a lot of effort to take down. This results in you needing to go through long battles on a regular basis doing the exact same moves and praying luck is in your favour, since you really need a lot of luck in this game. It wouldn't be so bad if there were ways to grind against some weaker enemies, but as of yet, I have not found a single place where I can grind against waves of weaker enemies to train my team up.All in all, it's not enjoyable for me. Especially since I feel the need to rest to restore my HP/PP at the end of every single battle. It makes me feel cheap for doing so but I know that if I don't, I'll end up dying in the next one. If you do decide to play this game, I have only one bit of advice for you. Save often. The autosave feature is buggy. I know I've lost some good progress just because the autosave deleted my save files out of nowhere.			"

												I had long wanted to play this game, as well as Winter Wolves' Loren The Amazon Princess, mostly because I was curious as to how well an RPG made in a visual novel engine would work. Now that I've finished this game once, I can say that its value lies mostly in being a curiosity, an example of what is possible in Ren'Py.Unfortunately, whether I look at it as a visual novel with RPG combat or as an RPG with visual novel storytelling, as a game Planet Stronghold falls short.The RPG part alternates between dull and irritating. The battles themselves fall into predictable patterns. I've seen the threat mechanic before in other indie RPGs, so it wasn't particularly impressive to me. Evaluating equipment is a hassle at first because the specs of the weapons and armor are presented in a horizontal line, which makes the numbers more difficult to decipher. And comparing equipment is even more unintuitive because the UI uses green or red numbers to indicate whether the specs of the item you currently have are better or worse than the new item you're considering--the exact opposite of what RPG interfaces normally use such numbers for.In my playthrough, armor appeared frequently as a quest reward, which seemed like a great idea until I realized that I hadn't been spending skill points on armor for many of my party members, and a lot of these pieces demanded high skill levels. My fault for not anticipating, I admit, but I would have liked different grades of armor for different classes so that these quest rewards wouldn't feel so useless.As for the visual novel part, the student-level writing fails to carry the contrivance-laden and flimsy plot. I wish I had a nickel every time someone expressed surprise or anger with ""What?!"" or stammered in discomfort, or declared success with ""We made it!"" The characters experience little development. The romance path I tried didn't seem like a natural progression of affection and chemistry between two people; it was just kind of there all of a sudden, and right after the big kiss scene, it was gone even more abruptly.In the end, this game was a disappointment. I would have happily tolerated the middling RPG experience if the visual novel writing and choices had been compelling. As it stands, Planet Stronghold is worth playing only as something to learn from. I'm looking forward to playing Loren The Amazon Princess to see how it improves on the RPG-VN formula.			"

												This game is a very good mix between RPG and Visual Novel as there is a friendship system in play which effects others and the choices you make will effect this, it also blends everything together very well, the difficulties offer a harder or easier experience and in the Deluxe DLC you have the option of an even harder difficulty that requires allot of thought during later battles. There is also a chat system where you can scroll back through text to see what someone has said or to even change a choice incase you are trying to play a certain way. The story is pretty good and quite understandable and has some interesting twists and turns. The characters and scenery are done extremely well. The gameplay is pretty much your average turn based Final Fantasy but with a few added features to it which does offer a unique-ish feel to it as you can choose how you want them to attack which will effect how many times they can attack and the chance of critical hit. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes reading as there is allot of it and the story is really interesting with allot of choices and dialog. ConclusionThis is a really well done visual novel fighting game and offers a very fun and challenging experience to all. I do recommend picking up this game. Rating: 8.5/10.			"

												I don't know how the sequel is, but on it's own this game is boring. The combat's uninteresting, the romance feel like the developers forced it in, and the story's too simple. Fairly early on you have to decide whether to support a revolution or follow the current emperor (not a spoiler since there are achievements for each choice). I thought this was a morally gray choice where both would have negative consequences, but it turns out the only downside to supporting the revolt is peace among the various alien races (how horrible!) and a slightly ominous ending.If you want a sci-fi rpg look pretty much anywhere else, if you want a visual novel get World End Economica, if you want romance play Katawa Shojo or Analouge: A Hate Story, and if you just want a good story get To The Moon.

												Mixed feelings here. A lot of work went into this game: perks, gear, dialogue tree are well developed. Characters' graphics are terrific even if a little manga-style. Game mechanics work well, the only black spot being you can't verify your team's stats when you need it.Sadly the RPG side is lacking, here it boils down to Romance-Playing Game. Dialogues are too long and poorly written, most answers start by ""Yes but ..."" and are too predictable. Combat becomes quickly repetitive : put all your team in ""burst"" then after one or two turns, two characters continue shooting and the other two heal them.It was mildly enjoyable to play at the beginning, but I don't think I'll ever finish it. So much for the achievements, 8 out of 10 are romance based.			"

												This game it's not worth the 18,99€ it costs. It's not even worth half that price. The story is bland, the combat gameplay is bland and the interface is very uninviting and unappealing. Surely, lots of effort were put into the game, but it doesn't hold up well. The fourth wall is broken too many times and it breaks any kind of immersion. The characters and kinda cringy and the art is average, as well as the soundtrack. Personally, I would not recommend it, but RPG fans should check it out.			"

												I didn't play much beyond the introduction.  The writing felt incredibly cliche from the very beginning, characters had little nuance, backstory and lore were introduced in the most heavy handed way possible, and I had little idea what was motivating either myself or other characters.  The gameplay elements seemed fine and the art isn't offensive but that's about all I can say in Planet Stronghold's favor.			"

												Really disappointed, had high hopes but combat is frustrating, you go from fights which are cakewalks to fights which are almost impossible or actually impossible, the writing is mediocre and there are just lots of niggling little problems with it. Very ddisappointed, glad I didn't pay full price for it.			"

												I had this before the Steam release, and I've played more than what Steam has recorded. Planet Stronghold is a mix between RPG and Visual Novel. It's RPG mechanics are okay, and it's storyline can grab your attention quite quickly in this game if your the type to prefer story over gameplay.The RPG mechanics are fairly basic. As you go through the game, new gear will be offered for free basically at the Armory, and that's where you upgrade your equipment. You can find a lot of better stuff by exploring the world and researching it(also basic), but the Armory stuff is enough to get you by.It's not just ""read story"" and ""battle enemies"". There's other skills you can level such as charisma, survival, explosives, repair, science, sneak, and some others. These do not have too much use outside of combat, except for a few, but there are various events that happen, as well as side quests, that these skills can be used to change events, whether it be weakening an enemy, completing the objective/goal without fighting, getting new items, or other interesting things, theses skills are used to change how the encounter plays out. There 8 characters that you have traveling with you, and while you can only have 4 max in combat, and sometimes a character isn't with you due to story, but these characters level alongside you, and you can just have each character invest in 1, or preferably 2 of these ""event"" skills, and you'll rarely have trouble passing these skill checks. I still found them a great way to spice up various encounters.Combat itself is standard RPG affair. One thing to notice is that every weapon does a type of damage, and that every enemy has different resistances to the damage types. It's very important to carry at least one of each damage type, and that every character should have at least 2 weapons with separate damage types, else they can be rendered useless outside of healing since they won't be able to do much damage against the enemy. However, they game gives you basic equipment to counter the enemies, since this is still a story driven game and doesn't want the player stuck on enemies, so there's no reason you should end up unprepared for a fight, other than your own negligence.The story itself is okay. It won't win any awards in my opinion, but it's a good story. Conclusion: The price point for this game is very high in my opinion(I got it in a bundle). While I think it's a good game, I wouldn't say it's worth $20. Unless your a very big fan of visual novels, I'd recommend waiting until a large sale. If I recall correctly, this game is free on android, though the Deluxe edition has extras. Try that if you can. There's also a free demo on their site. "

												It's basically an indie Mass Effect, except with turn-based RPG combat instead of a shooter.  It definitely lacks polish, but I loved the hours I spent on this game.  Fun!			"

												Nice game, overall rating ot 7/10.For me, the battle system in a style somewhat reminiscent of old GBA Pokemon games. The romance sub-plots are reasonably engaging, though they could certainly have added more interaction post the romance scene.I always play the female character in RPGs and take the yuri/lesbian relationship option(s) if available; character development isn't lacking, but I'd prefer it to be better fleshed out.Hope to see this, and the return of the characters (esp. Michelle, Lisa's love~) in the sequel, if there's one in the works.			"

												Written by teenagers apparently. Dialog and story is so cliched and ackward that I couldn't play past the tutorial. If you want something serious don't buy this game. Also why every graphical novel must have romance subplots? Play meet&f**k games if you want bad p0rn.			"

												Overall not a bad game , if you can endure its clumsy UI. It's an RPG mixed with visual novel settled in the future. You lead your teammates fighting with various enemies. Also there are two major different endings can draw you to play again. But some skills/equipment are imbalance. The fighting is ok , turn-based fight with magic. In conclusion , worth trying in a bundle or big discount.			"

												Addictive game, multiple routes, able to back track. Great story, interesting development. Still wish Lafleur was bi. Nonetheless wonderful game, you buy it, you'll be playing it for a bit. Feels great for a Vn with Rpg aspects similiar to science girls, sunrider, and a few other VNs and Rpgs you've seen here. This piece of work goes in quite the depth similiar to Loren the Amazon Princess. Still very great.  Rating 9/10. Reason is I just kind of hate the inventory gui. It sets the new guys who haven't played something like this off, no sorting order, has to be manual, also comparison are confusing if they don't know how to identify them. Can't tell you how many times I was looking at a weapon to double check it's stats and my armor too. I didn't want to die out there. Still great game, highly replayable for a few reasons.			"

												I got this game in the humblebundle a month or so ago, and honestly it's one of the greatest VN style games I've ever played. I heavily enjoyed the gameplay and plot, even if the characters can be a bit forced at times into the roles they were designed to fill, it's a great game regardless. Good combat system, good story, good dialogue, and in general a fun way to spend an evening or more if you're looking to get all the achievements.Glad this game got launched on steam, and I can't wait for Planet Stronghold 2 :)			"

												A glorified browser game where the combat SUCKS. As I write this, the game sells for $19, but I think it is barely worth $3. In combat, I didn't really feel like I had much room to maneuver. The only real strategy is to decide which enemy to attack first. I didn't even get to name my character. I have played free adult games that were funner than this.... And free.			"

												I haven't play the whole game, because I found it to be quite boring. There's a lot of text, which I normally don't mind, if it's good, but this game has badly written, long and uninteresting dialogues and characters that are just boring and cliché, which is what made me stop playing. Couldn't cope with it after a while. The graphics are nice, and the battles are well done, but since this is a game that's centered on the dialogue and story, I cannot recommend it.			"

Depending on the options you choose it is what you get go back play again with different choise.			"

												I played Planet Stronghold because, well, I like romantic options in a game, and this one certainly delivered! (I did a Google search on games with same-sex romance options.... yes I know....and this came up) I really enjoy the games produced by this company because they are very unique and well-made. The game play is challenging enough (even on easy) to keep you interested, yet it is never frustrating. You could certainly play through more than once to unlock different options; there are different paths you can take according to decisions you make. I played through the first time with a male, romanced the prince, and protected the aliens. My next play-through will be with a female that romances her commanding officer, sides with the king and queen and eliminates the aliens.  It's fun, cute, romantic, entertaining, and possessed of replay value.  Please make more!!!!!!			"

												Not a completely bad game, but not a visual novel diamond. Several romance options even a gay and lesbian option. Story isn't very interesting. The enemies have no personality and arent interesting. Supporting characters have their own stories that are very short and are a way for you to get some new armor or weapon. Battles are interesting the first time but quickly get repetitive and you will be clicking your mouse a lot to get faster through them (set all weapons to burst unless you miss a lot). Also its hard to navigate the menu because you can't access  every menu from any point of the game. To access quests or skills overview you need to be in dialog window. Can't access it from the planet (world) map. I'm saying that cause you sometimes need to know who has the most points in a certain skill. Anyway, not a completely bad game, but you will want to play it only if you are a visual novel lover. Even then you will want to rush through it on the easiest setting.			"

												Caveat: I am recommending this game but only at 75% off or 5$ or less. (Only applies to the frugal buyer.)It was cheesy, badly written or translated and had some balance issues.I know glowing review but aside from all that it was fun and I got through it. As a 30+ year gamer it has become very easy for me to turn away from a game quickly as there are so many hundreds of options to spend my limited free time in. So if you look at the Store Pages pictures and think to yourself ""That looks amusing but cheesy"", it is and I recommend it! Again though only on sale, or if you don't care about the money you toss at games.			"

												-The story is pretty poor. It's basically ""John Carter the VN"". If you're really into that, maybe this is for you, but I was expecting something much different. I found myself skimming most of the story.-There are a lot of characters and none of them have that much time to shine, or at least, early on. Still playing.-Even on Medium difficulty, the fighting is long and grindy.+The combat, even on Medium, is sort of challenging, at least.+There are a lot of skills to improve and become proficient in.-All of the non-combat skills can just be save-scummed and are thus almost entirely pointless. There's very little incentive to not min/max either (why would you improve your sniper rifle skill when your heavy weapons skill is already max'd out?)-Itemization is pretty weak - you ocassionally get item upgrades but it's all randomized with little strategy to finding the best stuff to equip.Overall, I'd say the game is mediocre as a VN and mediocre as a RPG. It's passable/playable and I'll probably finish it, but it's only worth it if you can pick this up super on sale.			"
