												At first, I really liked this game.. No real reason. It was aesthetically cute, and the cash shop was mostly there for little ""pretties"". Unfortunately, I am writing this review as a negative, as I cannot suggest this game to anyone due to the practices of the company. In short, once you start buying points with real cash, if you choose to stop buying, they will ban your account.I had been playing this game for a little while, and purchased quite a bit of points, but when my points started piling up and I just felt i had nothing to truly spend them on, I ceased buying, only to be greeted with an email a few months later stating that ""for my protection"" a ban has been placed on my account due to billing inactivity. They inform you to contact support on their website, and provide transaction histories that you cannot access, due to not even being able to log into your account. If you attempt to, you are greeted with a messege saying your account is frozen for ""violation of terms of services"". Don't believe me? Run a google search. The issue speaks for itself. It is not that I did anything illigal. I did not violate terms of service. The company banned me for choosing not to buy ""optional"" points via real cash, on their ""free to play"" game.			"

												One of the greatest (if not the greatest) free mmorpg right now for several reasons imho. I will give you my pros and cons and keep in mind that this is an ANIME mmorpg , i know that not every1 likes animes but i love them and based on my experience i ll assume that to be in the pros category ! :) PROS : - It is FREE , you can become great without even spending a single euro/dollar ! - Anime graphics , well designed world and characters !- New player friendly , anyone can learn all he needs to know from the in-game tutorials which are all implemented in the story-line and are presented at the proper time. - Nice storyline that will keep you interested (if you are ever read missions and not skip them) - Clever way to involve pets (named eidolons in the game) in the storyline and awesome system to get them gathering key fragments. (pets and mounts are different)- A big variety of classes and the abillity to choose a subclass at later levels allows for many different playstyles and combinations !- Fishing , digging and other extra stuff to keep you busy even when you think you are done leveling up (you ll never actually be :P ).- Nice and friendly community, you can surely make a lot of in-game friends and have fun in the game !- Quests offer an autopath for the monsters you have to slain or the things you have to find so you wont need to blindly search for them. CONS : - For those who skip missions it will be boring as it doesnt offer anything more in leveling up other than grind and more grind. - There are not TOO many dungeons , you will have to repeat some of them at certain points which you may find tiring. - Lags and glitches do exist but they are not unbearable , considering that the game is still young they shouldnt be a problem that will last for long. - IF you decide to buy something with real money you need to know that things in the store are TOO expensive. - Still in progress so the game still doesn't offer an ending at it's story line , it will be released at a later date. RESULT : As you can see : PROS >> CONS and overall this is a GREAT mmorpg that i strongly recommend to every single gamer out there , either you are a fan of mmorpgs or not ! It will keep you playing for hours and you will have a great time ! Awesome game , awesome kingdom ! :)			"

												Got perma-banned for ""inappropriate language"" because I said 'shiit' in the game.The reply I got after I contacted the costumer support:http://imgur.com/u3EvhoYThe reply I got after I inquired that how long my ban will be in effect:http://imgur.com/N4NJpFFThe last reply I got after telling them that they are going overboard, and that a certain infamous paying user got away with repeated offenses for months before being permanently banned.http://imgur.com/RZZj6Y9I'd also like to add, that I reached level 75 without paying just the day before I got banned. And after I contacted customer support (first screenshot) I was told that I'm free to make a new account and play the game. Which is strange, because if they really wanted to get rid of players that break the ToS, they wouldn't let me to get back into the game with a different account. The product manager himself stated in a forum thread before, that they ""punish players and not accounts"". Of course, that thread has been deleted since so it's up to you whether you believe it or not.The conclusion of my review is that you should be very careful if you are a free player, because the game rules apply to you differently. While a paying player may get away with months of serious harassment, a free player may get permanently banned for saying a word as harmless as ""shiit""I hope you will think twice before you support such company with your money.

												I can confirm that AeriaGames & Aura Kingdom perma bans (or suspends) accounts due to inactivity of billing..Meaning if you made a brand new account and played one of their games.. lets say Aura Kingdom for instance, making your very first microtransation or item shop mall purchase on that account or in that game, entitles you to a one time bonus package for first time purchaseAfter that, your account is now a timebomb ticking.. as you were to ever go inactive from the game, or decide not to ever spend more money on the game for a total of 90 days to 180 days or longer, you would get randomly suspended for inactivity of billing. none of the payments to aeriagames are ""recurring"", so they have no valid reason to ban for something like that.. but they do because they're a very greedy company I do not recommend themIf you were a VIP item shop mall spender and you spend ALOT of money on the game, you will get a random permanent ban for trading with gold farmers, or chargeback fraud even though it didnt happen, they will ban you for itPlease think twice about investing into Aura Kingdom & AeriaGames their one of the worst publishers out there, and pretty soon they will shut down just like gPotato did.. (gPotato was even worst)If for some reason you still want to play this game, Here is some steps to NOT get perma banned from AeriaGames & Aura Kingdom for no reason: Do NOT spend any money on the game at all! not a single penny.. nor have any payment information on your account profile Do NOT merchant ingame.. the art of buying low and selling high to make ingame profit would get you perma banned for trading with gold farmers Do NOT farm dungeons & bosses! you WILL get banned for botting believe me Do NOT participate in any AeriaGames Forums discussions at all.. they will ban you from the forums as well as in game for just stating a simple opinion or rant---I can give you a scenario of how two of my AeriaGames accounts were permanent banned for no reason:First account I created back around 2006 and played Grand Fantasia Created a Wizard Character Made a two or three microtransations and bought stuff from the item mall Leveled up to 40 doing quests Upgraded all equips using alot of enhancing items from the Item Mall Stayed level 40 to be within that PVP level bracket (was the best on the server at that time) Being proooooo (no actually i was more like a P2W noob but i was good at PVP anyway) I had alot of PVP honor points saved up so i bought the level 50 PVP set Bought even more enhancing stuff from the Item Mall and upgraded all of those equips, sold whatever i had left in game on the marketplace.. (I remember the Gaia Blessing or whatever its called was worth like 10k gold each at the time) Leveled to 50 to be within that PVP level bracket Got bored and quit the game for awhile Few days later I get Permanent banned for buying gold from a gold farmer?Made another account Last year to play Aura Kingdom with a friend With what previously happened to my other account i decided not to spend a single penny on the game Leveled to about level 55 solo & doing quests Seen a special bonus package deal for new accounts that makes a 1st AP purchase. decided hell i'll just buy that since its less than $5 Leveled up to 66 and crafted my own armor and weapon set using the materials i gained farming solo & party dungeons myself Grind was becoming hella boring, and i had no idea what the heck Sky Tower was.. so I quit the game A few months later I get suspended from the game (can not login to the game at all) due to Inactivity of Billing (note I have not made a single purchase in a couple of months, and the purchase I made in the past was NOT recurring.. Ban email message below)Also to reply to many of the previous comments stating that the suspension is ""temporary"", that is not always the case, many people dont even remember their full account credentials and/or cannot recover their accounts at all.. and like i've mentioned earlier this is my SECOND account that I no longer have access to.Others had the same problem on various occasions, and while customer support ""sometimes"" does help them with their problem, they end up getting banned (or suspended) AGAINLINK: Similar problems other people had[aeriagamestruth.blogspot.ca]LINK: More Similar problems other people had[aeriagamestruth.blogspot.ca]LINK: Even More Similar problems other people had[www.centralslayers.net]Aeria Games: Your account has been suspended

												I played many hours of this game before it came to Steam. It's not the perfect MMO and it caters to a specific demo, I would recommend it based on the fact that is is free to try and worth a look. Pros- Beautiful world. The enviroments and the animals look like hand drawn anime.. the good kind. Not the cheesy cliche kind- Very populated with a (usually) friendly player base. - I thought I had to pay for the scarf around level 20 to continue the main quest line but apparently I did not need to. I think they make that a bit confusing on purpose. Other than that the F2P model is pretty good.- Very easy to understand and pick up and play. Nothing is overly complex and the UI and all other things surrounding gameplay make sense.Cons- The million dollar MMORPG word.. grindy. The game is VERY kill 10 of these and collect 8 of these. They throw some curveballs in there occasionally but this is what ultimately had me stop playing in the 40s. It just stopped being fun. - Dungeons are repetitive cut and paste. Nothing special there for sure. - Didn't care for the music so I put my own ambient soundtrack to it.- Easy. This could go under pro or con. I didn't mind it but some will. Aside from dueling I never got too much into PvP in this game so I can't really speak on that. Each class seems pretty cool and you get to pick a secondary skill along the way which helps keep combat fresh. The battle companions are cool but can get annoying with the constant dialogue thing. Overall I'm happy with the time I put into it. I'm sure it gets more fun when you are at or close to cap but I could not continue any longer. You can check out my video review in my First Impression/Final Impression videos below. Enjoy!

			I picked up Aura Kingdom because it was ""Free-to-Play"" and I usually give most F2P games a shot and it is currently my favorite game. It is probably the prettiest most relaxing MMORPG I have played.

			Well, I made it to level 46. Once I got to level 40 the game slowed to a crawl. 20 kill this collect that quests to gain a level. It just wasn't fun anymore. But, I had a blast getting to that point.

												i played this game before it was released on steam and i reached a level 42 character after a week of on and off gaming. i gotta say i really enjoyed my time with it. im gonna show a list of  pro's and con's of this game just to shorten this out and give my own overall opinion of the game.pro's1. its a free MMO2. the anime design and texture quality is pretty good compared to other titles. also pretty unique 3. has many graphical opions for a wide array of systems4. no mana - very well done cooldown combat system with quite smooth movement. ( not perfect movement but good for what it is)5. very large areas and a arrray of monsters to fight and quests to complete6. ALSO COULD BE CON! simple 1 click quest navigation allowing you to quickly get to a quest location without having to hunt for its location7.  has a great starting area and not as dull and lengthy as other starter areas.CON'S1.  ALSO COULD BE PRO! simple 1 click quest navigation. for those who like to explore and find what you need with a group this could ruin the experience2. very specific audience if you dont like the asthetic of anime or cartoon look then this wont be for you3. camera can be a hassle when playing for the first time and no real lock on system. would help those who cant multitask as well as others with controls4. after a while it can be a grind to complete certian quests if they are repeated quests.5. can be quite easy and no really challenge if your fighting at low levels. even at higher levels you can do most of the questing alone without a group. 6.PRO/CON: certian dungeons require a group to complete allowing more co-op opportunites or a hassle if you wish to play alone 7. in certian areas and certian times. it can strain your system and according to other users. runs porrly on certian compontents ( be sure what your pc parts are and any issues with them and the game before playing if you wish to avoid problems out the game)for me i really enjoyed this game. alone and in the company of random people in those specific dungeons. there is no hostility and is just a blast to play for a few minutes to a few hours. i also really like this games art design and the character design ( even though there is clearly fan service) overall i would recommend you give this game a solid try and see if you enjoy it. if you like numbers on a scale i give it a 8/10  not perfect but worth a try if this game has your interest			"

												Aura Kingdom is a fantasy anime-style MMORPG that has the player take on the role of an 'Envoy of Gaia' - a human with abilities far exceeding those of all but other Envoys. Every player is given three Eidolons throughout the story, NPC companions each with their own unique set of abilities, stats, and even personality.The gameplay of Aura Kingdom is fairly repetitive, with hundreds of kill __ of __ and gather __ of __ quests. There is also very little 'multiplayer' as far as MMOs go. One could potentially complete every quest alongside friends rather easily, but there is little merit to doing so other than the obvious social benefits. Armour grants you stats and costumes grant minor benefits and the visual appeal. While this somewhat stifles players' creativity in creating costumes from inexpensive armours, you will also never have to walk around in a barrel. Everything is stylish and fits someone's tastes.The level cap set at 65 (correct me if I'm wrong) the grind to 40 goes smoothly enough, with quests being the best source of EXP around. Monsters grant players VERY little EXP, usually below .15% per. Now here's the catch; this game can be quite addicting when played with friends, and there is always a fresh, shiny new set of armours and weapons waiting for you at every level milestone. Despite being an MMO, this game holds plenty of replayability to try out each class, skillsets, and offensive/defensive point spreads. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a casual game to goof around in with friends. Disclaimer This game may contain panty shots. Select costumes with care.			"

												Like so many others, got randomly banned for not playing in a while. Played since initial release, lost level cap main and several alts, as well as all the cash store things I mistakenly bought way back when I thought Aeria were worth supporting. My friends all lost their accounts too, pretty much my entire clan I believe. With no warning. For not logging in for a while. Yet I still get sent emails about cash store offers :'D 10/10 classic Aeria Games.			"

												Beautiful game, fast and easy to learn, with that said I'm just gonna throw some pros and cons:Pros:- If you're into anime stuff you will love this game.- Beautiful scenarios, day/night phase in almost all of them, colorful and cute.- Easy and fast to learn, with a few hours in game you will catch it pretty fast.- Most of the community it's pretty friendly, always glad to help low levels (at least an 80% of it).- Not P2W, the only thing that you can actually do with money here it's get pets, costumes/hats (you can get the same costumes/hats just playing the game and saving ""loyaty points"") and/or mounts. There's an alternative to real money stuff, the ""loyalty points"" are currency in-game that you can earn doing daily quest and completing achievements.- Eidolon system, which in my opinion adds that special thing to the game, there's a long list of 'em, some are easy to get and some take time.- Weekly maintenance and more content to be added in the future.- As every other MMORPG, events.Cons:- Grindy, once you finish the main quest, you will probably get stuck in the 57-60 level area, where the only thing that you can do it's: well, dungeons, dungeons, daily quests, dungeons, and desperate a bit for that level 60.- Bots, yes, each of the three servers have a load of bots, also known as ""the redhead army"". They're just gold farming bots, who usually send you trash mail telling you to buy gold for 4 bucks.- Can turn boring time to time, and probably in the ""57-60 area"" previously descrived. - Lag/delay in some dungeons- The devs are hmmm how to descrive it, hmmm they're not bad, but they're kinda lazy, and when a problem arise most of the time they will opt for an easy solution. Note* this doesnt happen most of the time.- Huge risk of a rollback when an imminent issue shows. Ex. a few months ago the item mall started to work wrong, the prices were wrong, and of course people took that chance to get cheap stuff, with that done the devs just did a rollback (if you're not used to that word, a rollback it's just what it sounds) they returned the status of the server to the day before that issue happen, with that done every single player lost the items/gold/exp/levels/progress achieved that day, after that they apologized with the community and gave to every player affected by the rollback a special package and a week of 50% more drop and exp.

 REVIEW BREAKDOWN In this review, I will be breaking it down to four different categories:-Community / Playerbase-Gameplay-Money System-Overall thoughts/experienceOh, and there will be a TL;DR at the bottom as well. Community Aura Kingdom's community throughout my experience was not exceptionally bad, although it isn't what I would consider good either. In AK, the majority of players are quiet, there are very few conversations going on in even the main cities/zones in the game unless it is due to a quest and/or event where partying is required. This issue may be due to the fact that Aeria Games, or rather, Aura Kingdom specifically is having a 'bot' problem making players (including me) feel less engaged into the world. Gameplay Even though Aura Kingdom uses the standard MMORPG controls (who some may not prefer), the game itself was very enjoyable, the animation in each classes abilities were stunning and beautiful. Mobs and monsters in this game were each unique but some displayed the same attack patterns making it feel slightly repetititve. Also take note that AK is a extremely easy game until near endgame (lvl 60+) as well as the fact that once you DO reach endgame it is extremely slow to level which may make it feel boring due to lack of effort needed or fatigue. Overall, it uses a nicely executed combat system but Aeria Games may want to take a step up on the early difficulty. Money System So, is Aura Kingdom Pay to win or not? The answer is no, heres why;Although Aeria Games advertise themselves quite heavily as you play through, all you can really buy with the real money content are rare items or ruby coins which can be used to sell for in-game currency, gold. The rare items (such as costumes) changes your stats very insignificantly and is not different to those stats of a free costume that is earned through questing. Sure, you can buy gear with that gold you earned from spending your real money but in the end, most gear in Aura Kingdom isn't very expensive and can be earned fairly fast without even having to spend a penny on the game. I have experience on both my characters, one which I spent money on and the other I didn't, although they are different classes there aren't much difference in strength, at least not enough for me to consider Aura Kingdom pay to win. Overall Aura Kingdom is a fun and entertaining game, it may not suit everyone but it definitely kept me satisfied with everything it is and will continue to for a long while, I have shared a lot of fun memories with my friends and people I have met on this game and although the community is fairly quiet once you find the right people, it will make the game feel so much more engaging and lively. If I were to give Aura Kingdom a rating, it would be a 8/10.TL;DR: Aura Kingdom is a fun and entertaining game to play but has its own fair share of problems such as bots and being too easy. It is not pay to win.*BRIEF EDIT (2/4/2015)*This may hinder the gameplay for some and was worth mentioning, Aeria Games does a fairly poor job in terms of management when it comes to Aura Kingdom, lack of updates, unorganized events, etc.			"

												Seems like nobody really mentioned this, so I will just go ahead with it. I read that this game is full of friendly, helpful people, so I decided to give it a try. I ended up liking the game a lot, however the opinion regarding players couldn't be further from the truth.Pros:-Amazing anime style graphics-Skill customization - change the behavior of skills you already have-Gliding - fast transport around the map-Autopath to quest objective - regular quests have this, ""hidden"" quests do not. You will find both on all the maps.-Creative missions - take control of npc during a main quest-Achievements system - you get them for just about every quest you do. The names are creative and it makes the game more fun-Sub class system - lets you mix 2 classes together for greater variety-Pets - called Eidelons, they contribute to your damage significantly and you can swap them around based on the situation to take advantage of their special abilities.Cons:-Bot heaven - the review I read stated 99/100 players are friendly and helpful. The truth is, 99/100 players are bots. They are complete clones of each other with the same naming convention, yet nobody seems to care about it. You find them everywhere, not difficult to get 5-10 on your screen at a time.-Players - virtually everoyone ignores you completely. Those that do not only see you as a resource, not a person. There is a system of ""loyalty"" points and guild points so people only friend you so they can click a greeting button on you once a day for loyalty or that you farm guild points for their benefit. Beyond that, you mean nothing-Lag - you feel it in every slightly crowded area or town. This is especially noticable with delay on jumping/gliding-Character appearance - some could say there is a lack of options for character customization. I haven't really run into lookalike characters yet except for bots that all look the same.-Class balance - some classes are seriously overpowered, just about all players agree on who those are (Ravagers, even after a nerf they are still the most dominant by far)Conclusion: If you have friends to play with, this game is pretty fun and enjoyable. If you do not and are not a solo player, don't bother, you won't get any help around here.			"

												Here is a truthful account of my time playing this game. Let me put this straight up in front - the game itself IS GREAT. There is nothing wrong with it and anyone who plays it would surely enjoy it. If that was all i had to say, i would gladly recommend it. But it isnt. The COMPANY Aeria Games is the problem. More so, their business practices. Here are the FACTS:- If you do not pay for anything for 3 months, your account will be PERMANENTLY BANNED. They call it ''suspended'' but it is really a permanent ban. This means, you cannot ever log into your account ever again. - You are asked to provide information such as account name, server played on, character names, ip addresses, last purchase ID, purchase method etc. but all they give you is an AUTOMATED response and nothing more. They will IGNORE your responses from then on. - Do NOT join their Discord server hoping to coax some help out of their support staff. They will DELETE your messages, call your requests for help ''spamming'' and remove you from the channel and maybe even the server. - Any purchases you made with your account will be forever lost. I dont know or even heard of any other game company that flat out gives you a permanent ban for inactivity of billing. NEVER. In answer to the question, do i recommend this game? The game itself, YES. The company OPERATING the game, no. Sadly, you cannot have one without the other. You cannot play this game without having to deal with the company's absurd business practices. Key thing here, if you pick up this game, ALWAYS buy something every couple months, just to keep your account from being permanently banned.You want more proof? Google this for yourself and see just how wide spread a problem this is. Google this ""aeria games banned for billing inactivity"" and read the long lists of people banned for not paying and not playing.			"

												The game is a great casual MMO. I played a lot of this off of Aeria Ignite, not Steam. So excuse my hours.However, they had a server merge. Despite being logged in recently; I logged on to see all of my characters were wiped. I had 2 max levels and they both had premium currency purchased content, and now they are gone.If you're new to this game, you're probably going to like it. But if you played before and were on one of the two servers that underwent the merge... you probably lost your stuff, and you're angry like I am.I'll probably never come back to this game. This is an inexcusable bug.			"

												This game is a enjoyable MMORPG. If your a anime fan and you like MMOs this might just be the game for you.  Now this game is lacking in places and still has alot of glitches but the game is not very old and still has a chance to fix these issues. The world is very creative and nothing hurts the eyes. You get the ability to choose a secondary class at level 40. Not really much pay 2 win but its still there of course. great game, cool story, and nice community.I recommend this game to anyone who likes anime and MMOs!			"

												First of all let me start by saying the game is decently fun for an anime MMO now you might ask if its nice why are giving a negative review?Its because of the greedy company behind the game.Since i enjoyed the game i broke my rule and decided to throw a small sum of money to support the game and get some extra fluff for myself and i simply never got the promised items.I tried to get in contact with their support only to receive automated messages raising the waiting time from 24 to 48 to 72 hours yeah GG AeriaVerdict:Play it only as free game and dont spend a cent on it cause your gonna get scammed or banned due to their billing policy.

Even after you click quit game the game still runs in the backgroun and you have to force quit steam to end it. The english version is a joke, so are the supports and developers for this version.

												I did enjoy this game but I can now say that the reviews stating about bans are true. I decided to pick this up again. Re-downloaded, sat through the updates and got failure to log in. Go to website, hit forgot password(I really have forgotten), typed in email and yep. Banned for violating ToS. As I get notifs of damn near everything from the email it is attached to, I was never sent an email stating I was banned or violated anything. To even try and contact them for a dispute or a why, they want you to fill out when you started playing etc that for any person who has more than 5 games on Steam, will know that struggle. Even checking the discussion board, clicking on the link that says how to contact us? Yep, bad link, sends you nowhere.So stay away from this game and find something else to forgo the frustration that I am feeling with this game.			"

												In general I have two things to say about this game:* it's nice looking anime-styled and not oversexualized game;* it turns incredibly boring when you get to level 55.I managed to crawl to level 66 btw and raised a few alts to 50-55… just for more grind.~~~TL;DR: If you like anime and repetitive grind - this game is for you. If you only like anime then try to enjoy the story during your quest to The Level 55 great barrier. Don't forget to make a few screenshots of rich players at Navea when you get there. Then kill it with fire before it became too boring to play.~~~Unfortunately, this game has almost no quests which you may want to bother to read and the vast majority of them are mundane kill and fedex. There are a couple of oddballs, but they are rare and clunky. They don't feel like they belong here. After level 55 it's non-stop grindfest and repeating of the same dungeons over and over again. Every single day. Especially if you want to get some rare Eidolons. Every 5-10 levels a few ""new"" areas will open for you. Did I say ""new""? I meant you will be revisiting the same areas with different enemies on your way. Due to that game looks cheap. All locations in the game are small, low detailed, and reused on every possible occasion. It's especially easy to see in the daily fame quests. The game pulls 5 random quests out of 40 every day for you, but there are only 5 or 6 different maps! You just start from a different point and different enemies may crawl around (fixed for each quest). Even ""urgent"" event quests reuse the same maps! Near the end of 2014 they added guild dungeon system and you think what? They've reused existing maps again! They just placed invisible walls around some spots on the low-level maps and called them dungeons. You can even get out of these areas by jumping and walk through empty from players and NPCs versions of low-level villages.Yet another massive fun-stopper in this game is exploration part. Collision boxes for many world objects are just wrong. They stop you from flying over the small bumps, streams and all kinds of chasms. Have fun getting out of the city in Demarech Mines or Ventos Praire or just try to walk under the bridge in the Vulture's Vale. They don't exist where you expect them to be or just much less detailed and stands far from the visible object boundaries. See that chimney? Jump on top of... 1 meter above the chimney invisible floor. See that roof? Oh wait we are in the house now. In an odd way. You can glide to traverse locations faster, but you will hit invisible walls just everywhere. That's another reason why this game looks cheap.Now add to that autopilot for almost all quests in the game and absurd storyline. Soon you will notice that you don't really play the game. You just click on the quest objectives to get to the location and repeating the same attack pattern like a bot. Why? Just to get through the next area and reach a higher level.Ah, right, bots. You will see A LOT of them running around and 1 or 2 in-game spam emails with proposition to buy some gold for money will greet you every single day. Well, at least it tells that the game isn't dead yet. Someone still bothers to buy it after all, even though it's bannable.Did we finally reach the PvP section of this review? Well, PVP is not even broken. It has to be implemented in the first place to be broken. It's slapped on top of PvE and completely imbalanced and having so many classes does not help to balance it at all. It's hard to balance even 3-5 classes and we have more than a dozen here! Also, it's limited only to PVP arena and occasional duels if someone will accept them. Do you think you can go to the arena at any moment? You can't be more wrong. Well, it won't be that bad if PvE and exploration parts would be fun.Ah, btw, everything in this game is bound to timers. Eidolons spawns at the guild hall at specific hours every day. PvP arenas (there are a few different types) open and close by the timer. All dungeons resets by timer and you have only 1 entry at the top difficulties before the next reset which will happen in around 6 hours. Have fun getting rare Eidolons and items. Fish kings spawn only at specific hours and world bosses too. And on the top of that standing Sky Tower which is open only 6 times during the weekend. And you can enter it only once per day with the same character. So, you need to have at least 3 high-level characters with a good gear if you wish to run it 6 times. And it doesn't really worth to do so due to incredibly bad drop rates. It's 1.5-2 hours run for 40 people and it's likely that not even one will get anything from it. And all these timers are intersecting. So, you always will have to miss one event to go to another.I had a little fun in the beginning, but then I realized that the game turned into a work. Dull and boring work which only eats my time and doesn't make me happy (or make me feel any other emotion besides frustration). At some point, I started to think that the whole point of this game is to get Kotonoha and make her wear less modest dress through thousands of hours of grindfest. Well, you can speed up this process with money a bit (or just waste them for nothing depending on your luck).Another problem is The Word Filter. It seems broken or just way too simple since it detects ""a s s"" in the ""glasses"" and ""class"". And many other ""rude"" words in the middle of completely normal. Try to write ""Titanus"" in the chat (dungeon boss name). It will be completely blocked since it consists of ""t i t"" and ""a n u s""! It even breaks item names and links to items in the chat making it impossible to show some of them there.Good sides of this game:* It isn't straight pay to win.That doesn't mean you won't need a lot of gold to get your gear and get it to its full potential, but you can get this money in the game. In a few months or rather... Years. -_-* It's nice and cute looking. Especially some of the Eidolons.Yet most of the best Eidolons are either incredibly rarely or available only in the store for real money. I got 1 fragment out of 10 for Endora and 1 for some other rare during my gameplay and I did a lot of runs through high-level dungeons for that.* Community is rather nice and friendly.BTW, it actually amuses me to look at all the people coming here in the comments section enraged by the fact that I downvoted the game which I played for so long. I'm almost sure it's better than endgame in the actual game.			"

												So let me clear a few things up first. I have been playing AK for about a year now. I have 6 characters on the Chimera server(all of my characters are ranging from lvl50 to lvl 80). Aura Kingdom is not a new game but it has a very active and large community. The story line is good and the fighting mechanics are superb aswell. CLASSES:As in any MMO RPG when you first create a new character you will be able to pick between a couple classes. You can chose between Guardian, Duelist, Ravager, Wizard, Sorcerer, Bard, Grenadier, Gunslinger, Katar, Battle Bow, Tachi, Scythe or Holy Sword. Depending on your liking you will chose the class that suits your game style the most (Although  I have seen a lot of new players chose Duelist as their first class I have to say that if you are just starting to play the game make a Holy Sword it is a easy to play class and it has a lot of dmg, while Duelist is one of the hardest to play classes(Hardest to play and be GOOD at it).CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION:There is not a lot to talk about when it comes to the basic character customization that you get at the start of the game, however this isnt all you can do to customize your character. In game you get different costumes (body, head, weapon, back, face,..) With these costumes you can completely change your characters apperance to your liking (you can even change color of CUSTOM Costumes). LEVELING:The leveling process is as in a lot of MMO RPGs. Leveling from 1-40 is not that hard you can get 1-45 within a day if you get really into it. The next stage in leveling is at 45-60 you will notice that you need enourmos ammounts of xp for a lvl. And this just continues the ammount of xp you need to get to lvl 80 in insane but once u do its worth it. I also think its worth mentioning that the level cap is now 90!!! So there is a lot to do to reach endgame.PVP:The pvp aspect of the game is as in any other MMO RPG. You have arenas and Battlefields. While arenas will match you up with players around your level lvl 50-59, lvl 60-69 and lvl70+, Battlefields on the other hand match everyone togeather no matter the level. For PVP you will need pvp gear which isnt that hard to get (although pvp weapons are a bit trickier to get). Now I would not recommend pvp to new players since you will most likely get killed instantly. Since for pvp it is important to have your gear fortified and starred (This gives you bonus def and HP in armor and DMG in weapons).PVE:In the case of PVE there is not really one bad thing I have to say about it. You have a large veriety of dungeons (solo and party to chose from). Dungeons are locked to different levels so as you level up you will unlock more dungeons. Also PVE gear can be crafted but I would recommend crafting PVE gear after you reached lvl 60 since green gear for your normal solo dungeons until lvl 60 is fine.All in all a very good Anime MMO RPG game with a great community and good mechanics.

In short, I do not recommend playing this game under the current English publisher (Aeria Games), even though the game itself is great.Personal opinion below --Art style: Anime style that is... (Hate to use this word but...) ""CUTE""!Sound & Music: The fantasy-style soundtrack that goes really well with the art style. (Some quickly gets annoying after multiple loops.)Gameplay: Very casual standard MMORPG... Unless you are a try-hard.All of the in-game features, such as auto-pathing, auto-fishing, and quest object targeting, are aiming to make this game as casual as possible.Replayability: Unfortunately, this is the sole reason why I do not recommend this game. I simply cannot enjoy coming back to play this game because...1. Major delay of new reversion from the publisher, Aeria Games. (The English version is already three major updates behind when I wrote of this review.)2. Bot and gold seller. (Once again, due to the lack of active control from Aeria Games.)3. Lack of coordination between English publisher and the developer. (You can forget about sending feedback and suggestion.)...How can I enjoy a MMORPG, when the publisher only shows interests in whether I spend real money in the cash shop or not?			"

												If you liked Forsaken World or Perfect World International (PWI) (in some ways even Battle of the Immortals/War of the Immortals) then you will like this game, it plays a lot like them with various improvements and it may even be the same game engine. Single click auto-pathing for quests, lots of unique little things to participate in, ability to skip quest dialog, full featured minimap will click to move, no need to loot after monster kills, etc. The user interface is refined and has a lot of nice little features not seen in the larger MMOs. The improvements make the game easy to understand and play.The game is definately targeted for the casual player. It has nice graphics and sound, but a lot of the improvements are focused around making the game fast and easy to play. Unlike so many other MMOs, you get a mount very early on. You should be level 10 and have one toolbar of skills, a mount, and your companion, within an hour or two of starting the game.You get to choose your companion when you create your character, and there are seven different choices. Each one has different skills and focuses - one may be a healer and another a warrior type. The companion is similar in functionality to SWTOR companions, but you can even have little conversations with them.You gain new skills (based on the class you choose) as you level automatically, and you have character improvement tileset. You gain one improvement point every three levels. I call it a tileset because its not a tree, your starting point is in the middle of all of the tiles and you can pick improvement tiles moving outward in any direction. The in game store items seem a little expensive compared to other games. They have plenty of various cheap or expensive items, but just for comparison: 75 cents for a 20% xp boost for 60 minutes, $5 for a 20% xp boost for 24 hours play time (24 hours of played time, not calendar time so it will last multiple days), $50 for a unique mount that is 60% movement speed, if you buy 4 of them you can combine them into a 90% mount. For $15 you can get an item that gives you a 24 hours of 50%/25% monster/quest xp boost. I like the play time versus day time system, because it discourages afks and it is aimed at the casual player who might play one or two days a week. So if you play around 5 or 6 hours a week, the $15 boost will last you about a month. You can purchase XP books from the store that instantly give amounts of XP, 29 cents for a book that gives the equivalent of 20 monster kills of your level. You can buy the in-game cash shop currency in $5, $10, $25 etc increments. They also have spending ""tier"" rewards per month, as you reach higher tiers you get greater free rewards. The first two spending tiers are at $5 and $15. Purchases go through the Steam Store so you don't have to visit another website.Overall it is a very refined game with a lot of features and a better UI that is not found in today's larger MMOs. The cash shop is optional but the enticement to buy XP outright, or buy timed XP boosts will always be tempting - but ""free"" games are not free to build and run by the companies that make them and they need to make a profit.

Posted: June 7, 2016
												I loved how cute this game looked and I'm really easily entertained when it comes to video games, so I was very excited to give this a shot! However, I've gathered my 'hours on record'' over the first 2-3 days of playing Aura Kingdom, and literally haven't touched it since. The most appealing aspects of Aura Kingdom are the cute outfits, cool fighting partners, and relaxing environments. It's very easy to chill out and have a calm MMO experience with this game. I'm a huge fan of just, mindlessly farming for things in MMOs, and it had a great balance of being engaging, but also relaxing. At least, at first.Once I got to around level 40 (which took me less than a day) the quest progression came to a screeching halt. When leveling up from 1-30, there was a good variety of quests. Of course, the most common quest type was the ""go kill 8 mobs, then report back to me!"" but it didn't feel too overwhelmingly prominent until I hit level 40. As I progressed through each zone, the variety of quests all just became the same ""go kill 14 of this mob, and report back to me"" back to back. Increasing with the number of mobs to kill as the zones levels became higher. I stopped once it had reached '16' as the norm for quests.An example of a quest area would go as such...NPC: ""Hi! I'm in trouble, can you go kill 16 of those [insert mob here]?""NPC: ""Hey! Thanks for killing them. Now, can you kill 8 of [mob A] and 8 of [mob B] for me?""NPC: ""Yo! Awesome man! Alright, go collect 16 of this material around mobs you have yet to see! You'll have to kill some to get to the stuff I want you to collect, but that's fine!""NPC: ""Oh hey! You got the stuff I wanted... but those mobs you just killed a bunch of are scary! Kill 16 of them even though you've already killed quite a few""NPC: ""Thanks! Okay, now go kill 16 of [Another mob]""NPC: ""Oh wow! Kill 16 of the SAME MOB again! Why? I dunno they're like REALLY scary""And this repeats for literally every single quest area. The questing is just, absolutely atrocious. I understand that some people love kill quests, it's the standard for MMOs, but this games way of doing it really just begins to feel like a chore at the later levels. It also doesn't help that the EXP you get from completing quests is nerfed significantly. Once you reach around lvl 45-55, it expects you to start the daily dungeon grind to gain the remaining levels to reach level cap. (which has been raised to 90 recently) So instead of completing a super tedious task and receiving around 10% - 15% of your current level, you only receive 2% at most. Which is a bit discouraging when each enemy takes a good 15-30 seconds to kill, and you have to kill 16 of them.All in all, this game was very fun from the start. I played with some friends, browsed the item mall and contemplated sinking some cash into it once I reached max level. But I was never able to. Even if the added content from levels 60+ makes the questing better (even though I've read that quests full on STOP at lvl 55) I cannot recommend this game. Questing from 40-55 was such a low point that I have given up on it completely. :(			"

												This MMORPG is polished, and funEven though I'm in China, the server has fast response and little lagThe game is generally funHowever there're two main problems:-First, it is not fully voiced, your character is completely slient so there's basically nothing to hear other than repeating BGMs and stupid SEs.-The other problem is the one that almost haunting every MMORPG on the internet: BOTs It's not only making the game unfair due to the great inflation caused by currency pouring inside the market gained via using Bot, but also make our life miserable-game provider thinks it's a great idea to make lvl30 tradable so they can block Bots from trading. THEY ARE SO WRONG. BOTs don't really care, but WE DO.We are suffering from this stupid policy and have to level up like no tomorrowAccording to my experince, I spent 11 hours to reach lvl 31. So basically the first 10 hours of gaming you are prevented from any kinds of trade, period.But the characters do look cute, and that's all i really care about. "

												My experience from this game goes as such: Community basis, is very accepting, and kind. You can join a raidcall and within a minutes make friends. In the actual game you do busy work until level 60 where you can finally start to do something entertaining. However, after 65, the leveling gap really becomes apparent. at level 70, an entire run of dungeons gets you roughly 1 percent of your current level and less so the higher the level. Also with the rarity of the drops. You either have luck, or stop playing you are waisting time. This game is based on luck on time. If you don't have both of those, don't play. 124.3 hours in game in the past two weeks got me nothing of use from dungeons, high level monsters, high level anything. Now that my rant is over, in all seriousness: Pros:Very friendly communityWeekly updatesTeamwork orientedCons:Very time consumingVery luck based (you need to be very lucky)Progessively large xp and level gaps (One size fits all)Foot in the door type currency systems (difficult to make money, items are usually very expensive, unless you have a sugar momma/daddy, refer to Cons 1 & 2)Very difficult to get level up armour and weapons (Cons 1, 2 & 3)""OP"" Idolizing (You are either over powered, or weak and if so, be useless, refer to cons 1, 2, 3 &4)Not much ""OOMPH"" to be felt from this game, not a lot of energy to take away with. Think of a sports event like football. Now imagine replacing the drinking, bbqing, shouting, screaming, yelling for their team with relaxed clapping.			"

												P2Win? No.All gear currency is earned through playing. gear can be ""fortified"" up to +20. In many MMO's the higher ranks have a chance of breaking the item if you fail. This game is the exact opposite, if you fail enough the item gets upgraded instead of breaking.Now that that's out of the way, I wanted to share how the game works.You quest (same old kill mobs/collect style thats been around forever). There are dungeons, both group and solo content.PROS:Cash shop: As mentioned earlier, no cash shop advantages. If you want to argue that being able to buy things like xp boosts and whatnot is pay2win, you have no idea what youre talking about. You can advance your characters faster with cash shop, but they wont provide you with an ADVANTAGE over anybody else. Basically the fortification system is not a pay2win system like it is in so many of these asian MMOs. There are no ""real money stat boosts"" to speak of either.Visuals: The game looks great and runs well on my semi-modern 700$ PC (gtx 950, i5 6500, 8gb ram, 850 PRO SSD). The art is very anime style and the effects are well done.Story: Despite the bland gameplay of the quests, the story and setting are quite interesting IMO.Classes: Lots of classes.Loyalty Points: An Alternative currency you acquire by playing the game that can be used in place of cash shop money to use in the cash shop._____________ConsThe chat window: Settings for the chat window do not save on client restart. The default ""general"" tab is mostly trade chat spam. Sellers and buyers completely dominate the window most new players will see as well as gold spammers. If I wasnt actively fiddlng with the chat window I wouldnt have ever known someone even whispered me or seen guild chat.Sound design: For the most part all skills sound almost exactly the same. If you pay attention to games such as WoW or Guild Wars 2, youll notice skills have such an iconic sound you can tell whats happening with your eyes closed half the time. In Aura Kingdom the sound design does not contribute to your awareness whatsoever. The music is pretty generic Asian MMO as well. Questing: Bland and generic quest system thats in a thousand games. Kill these, collect these. Over and over and over and over. A lot of people like my self have no problem tolerating that sort of thing though.Eidolons (youll learn what they are) and new loot kept popping up over my quest tracker and blocking the button you can click to autopath. Pretty annoying, especially since the Eidolon that pops up cant be closed quickly and you need to wait for it to go away/ Might just be my resolution though._____Pro/con depending on who you askAutopathing: Game has autopathing and you will be doing a lot of it.Character design: Premade faces with no ""slider"" customization. You can however acquire many costumes, hats and weapon skins and dye your armor. Personally I felt I was able to customize character so its pretty unique.Grind level: not so bad in the beginning, but getting and upgrading the end game items to max is extremely grindy.Battlefield: Havnt tried all the pvp types, but the one I tried involved putting players in 2 groups regardless of their level and making them fight. At lvl 53 with full pvp gear, People could blow air at me and id drop dead right then and there. Like honestly, I had 20k hp with -50% crit dmg from players and about -20% total damage from players on top of that due to my pvp gear, someone hit me for over 800k with one ability, when my max hp was just barely over 20k. So yeah. Dueling people around your level is fun though.			"

												Graphics: 10/10The graphics are by far the best part of the game in my opinion. The game looks lush and explorable. At times more explorable than it actually is. It looks like you really CAN go more than two minutes into the ocean without bumping into an invisible wall! (of course you can't though, the invisible wall is very much there. ;D) Each place looks unique and beautiful. I'm in love with the style as well. Anime styles can often go wrong, especially in games, but this one is the good kind of anime, not the cheesy kind. The characters are cute and vibrant, and just look plain good.There is a lot of eye candy here!Customization: 8/10The customization at the beginning of the game is average. 10 or so hair choices and eye choices with colors to go along with them. You can choose your class (all of them play very similarly by the way) and skin color. The classes aren't gender locked which I liked very much.I would have liked to have sliders for things such as height, weight, and length of hair. If you'd like a shorter or chubbier character you're out of luck. I also would have liked to be able to choose the bangs and back of hair seperate. There are many hair styles that I only liked the front or back of. You are going to look cute no matter what you choose but it could use some more options. You will find characters that look just like you.Gameplay: 5/10This is where the game goes wrong. I've heard it was too easy, but I didn't think I would mind. I've enjoyed plenty of easy games, such as Kirby and Pokemon but this isn't just the 'leveling up too fast' easy. This is the 'holding your hand throughout the entire game' easy. You can literally press a button for any quest and be guided to wherever you need to go without moving your character at all. The character is drawn by a shining path and you can just sit back, relax, have a soda, and watch your character move for you. Kind of ruins the point of a ""game"", eh?Quests: 3/10I'm not very far in the game yet, but the quests are already pushing me away. They are painfully generic. A couple of ""Kill these bad guys for a reward"" quests are fine in an MMO, but those kinds of quests are ALL this game has. Every single quest is nearly exactly the same. Expect a whole lot of ""Sure...I can help you...but first you need to kill 10 sheep for me."" And when you finish the quest they will tell you that another person could help you and they will ask you to do something very similar. The loop goes on.One thing that annoyed me is that the things they ask you to kill aren't even bad. Most of them are animals that seem docile and don't harm you unless you harm them. Seems a bit unfair...Story: 4/10Average MMO story. You most likely won't get attached to any of the characters and won't care about the story much. Overall pretty boring.Sound: 4/10Repetitive, and unmemorable.Recommendation:My opinion may change, but so far I can't really recommend this game. The graphics are gorgeous, but the gameplay is awfully generic and boring. If you are in love with the graphics however, and want to become the amazing OP anime character you dream of, you should give this game a try! I'd say just download the game, play it for a couple of hours, and toss it if you aren't interested. After all, it is free right?			"

												For a free to play game, I wasn't really expecting that much from this but boy was I in for a surprise...Here are my reasons for recommending this game:Story:-The main storyline is intricate and interesting meaning you always want to know what happens next with the constant plot twists and never-ending mystery. Especially with no voice actors whatsoever, I feel that it adds a new perspective to how you view the story and lets your imagination do the work for you.Leveling and Skilltree System:- Leveling in this game to me isn't that difficult and will be easy for those who are new to the game. This is because you need only follow the main questline. However, at later levels at 55-60+, the Exp requirement is stepped up a notch. In addition, the skilltree system is complex in its structure but simple to navigate and understand in a short amount of time.Graphics:- The graphics are surprisingly good. Great detail on the character models, weapons, VFX and terrain. This added detail always compliments a well-layed storyline. (Play on medium+ for maximum effect).Premium Currency (Known as Aeria Points):- As always, you get the temptation of paying real money to get an edge in the game. The payment system in AK is supported through steam as well as their online store. The one major advantage of paying for premium currency is that the amount that you spend in a month goes towards a loyalty feature that gives you rewards at certain milestones. As these milestones increase, the rewards get better and better. I haven't personally bought any but if you are, I would recommend the online store as it gives you bonus AP.Side note:For anyone who was permanently banned, the main reason for this is that you probably bought gold from a third party for a cheap amount of cash but you haven't realised that it is against the Terms of Service that they stick to 24/7. If anything other than this reason, then try to contact them directly. So, I wouldn't advise buying in-game currency from any third party sites whatsoever, as there is pretty much a 100% chance that your account will get permanently banned.In conclusion, if anyone likes the following in a game, then I fully recommend you to download and install this game:- Good & Immersive Story- Great Graphics- Extensive Leveling & Complex Skill System- Option to use IRL money to buy yourself an advantage- Kind & Friendly Player Community- Anime based Character Models- Wide Variety of Costumes to wear- Quest Grinding- And of course that you like Fantasy MMORPGs with PVE & PVP elements!I really hope that this review gives you the insight you need to make a decision to play Aura Kingdom! xD ;P			"

												Most easiest MMORPG i have played.Pros : +Awesome Graphic characters+We Can Marry people (If you have a partner gaming to play together)+More than 10 class playable+We can change secondary class by anytime+Not Pay 2 win , But grind to win (If you're non cash player)+There's a small job like gathering, Fishing and cooking+You can reset skill by using your money ingame+More hardwork you get, More Money you can get+The story is easy to understand+The costume is great tho, even the classic one+You can make a public trade, After you reach lvl 40+You can PVP with 1 vs 1 or 5 vs 5 (There are some place tho) +You can make your own house. After you can reach lvl 55 (Prepare your money ingame to make it )+14 dance action and more free actions+There's a quest that helps you to lvl up easily+Cash player have a quite advantage (For cash players) (the price are quite friendly they tend to give good price)+You can talk to your Eidolons :) +Some pros are helpful+Lots of players (300-800+ players per day)Cons (-)-Lagging (For me sometimes, 20-120 fps)-Sometimes disconnect without reason-No Voice sound fighting in your avatar-Why those Low lvl guys using grenadier class (Aka BOTS)-Good luck with the connection, Result may been in certain region, Sometimes at some region are stable. The other are not so lucky with the connection.-Some pros tend to mislead the newbies (Beware, you can't always trust everyone)-Lots player means your connection or fps will drop (if you have good connection and great spec means over the recomended state, you can skip this cons)Note : If you having bug in main quest, Just Reset Ul. If can't, Do a fullscan in the launcherRate : 8,5 /10Small tips : Loyality point is the most important for non cash players, You can exchange the Ruby coins. Ruby coins use for roulette a premium quality. Such a costumes, Enchancement, Eidolons fragment, Card Enchancement, and also a Mount.There's a daily quest that you can get those loyality points in : Cacktakara forest, Cresent hill and tritiao Highlands And Navea : Blacksmith Keith (If you finish those quest you will get 500 loyality per day, repeat those quest in 10 times (500x10) loyality +1000 loyality (For 10 days Login) + 1000 loyality (For item mail) = 7000 loyality points you can get those. What are you waiting for :3 Buy ruby coins 4000 and spin it :3 . There's also expensive items that you can sell in auction house xD. Pro players also need that xDHere's the daily quest : Lvl 25 Farmer quest : 50 loyality (Cresent hill)Lvl 40 Cooking quest : 50 loyality (Cacktakara forest)Lvl 50 : Doctor quest : 50 loyality (Triatio Highlands)Lvl 40 :Refine quest :50 loyality (Navea)Lvl 50 :Refine quest :100 loyality (Navea)Lvl 60 :Refine quest :200 Loyality (Navea)Note : Refine quest (Gather some guild coin by completing mirabelle quest and also lvl 60 daily quest Guild if you get enough guild token, you can buy material from guild shop)Hope this helpful for you :) Senpai xDAlso, if you see anything missing. Just tell me :) don't be shy. Also you can tell me if you having problem. I'll explain as long i know the problem.			"

												I played the game since over 1 week and have 2 chars over level 50 and i tested all the 10 (11 after a patch) classes in the first 30-40 levels and i know that i play this game very long time in this 1 week.So i think i can give a early review with a enough experience for it.It´s your choice to play the game or to let it be but i want to help you with your choice with a pro-neutral-contra-list.Pro: -10 classes they are feels diffrent and all feels good playable. (i tested all the first 30-40 levels)-after level 40 (i think it was 40 but it can be a little bit more or less) you can choice a second class for combine it to create your playstyle-2-3 classes from this are better for each first class because you become 3 extra skills from the combination but you can play every class with every class you want (not the second class as first class... i mean you can´t play with bow and bow or something)-good balanced skill-cooldowns-you can dodge heavy attacks with movement! (it´s not to hard)-the community is good (i didn´t read a lot of flame or other bad stuff in chat like in other MMORPGs)... i don´t speak from the steamcommunity because i only have the experience from before this game was on steam-I like the petsystem (pets are called eidolons) because they are very usefull for fighting/buffs/healing and you can upgrade they-You can play the game and watch Videos in high quality or other things at the same time because the game don´t need a lot of ressources from hardware (at maximum settings) and you don´t need a good internet to play it without laggs-You can become with quests/loot/buy in shops a lot of dekoration items for your character (on the left side at the top from the minimap you can find a boosymbol, click on that and you can search all dekorationitems, eidolons[pets] or other items and you can see how they look)-groupfinder for dungeons (this made it easy to find a group for a dungeon)-you can find a list of events at a symbol near the minimap and with that you can see at wich time you can join a eventNeutral: -the questingsystem is standart like in the most other MMORPGs (only a very few of all have a diffrent questingsystem)-no mana... i´m not 100% sure this is good or not because this made it easy... but maybe to easy?!?-the game is buggy because it´s a open beta but it´s very able to play and so much better as other open betas from MMORPGs in the last time (the most of them was terrible and realy not worth to play a long time)-the tutorial that you must play with every char is very short and that´s good-the cashshop is it not realy worth to buy things from it because you can become all things from loyalty points or trading with other players and that´s why i think the game is able2play and not pay2playNegativ: -you can´t play together with guys they are don´t play with steam because the servers are diffrent-the graphic looks not up2date on highest settings(i´m not very intressted in high quality grafics but for other guys this is maybe negativ thing)-the choice in charactercreation is very small because you have only 1 race (human), the choice between male/female, few complete faces/haircuts/eyecolors/haircolors and the charname. That´s all.-you must play the tutorial with every new char-tradechat=allchat... it exist a item to write in allchat but this consumable and so write all player in tradechat-it exist few spammbots but they exist-future forecast: the game is from aeria games and it´s free2play -> the support from all this games is bad and slow -> that´s good for hacker and bad for all other player -> updates will be small and they will don´t fix bugs fast -> that´s very good for hacker and bugabuser -> negative reputation and leaving players (the future looks dark and i think it´s not a game that you can play for ever if you want a real good and fair game... but i think you can have fun with it for months)I think i forget a lot of things but i will complete my review later and i hope it was helpful for you.And things they i don´t tested in my playtime are: guildsystem, PvPsystem and a lot of events.-Edits-Pro: -look at the eventtimer and you will see when you can join a event like quiz or something.-you can change your second class now with a item from the shop or buy it from other players. it´s not to expensive.Neutral: -the lategame is grinding dungeons and daily quests for leveling. it need more time to creat new quests for lategame-they bring a new class into the game that´s called samurai. it´s a very strange class that mixed meele and range. it is the only class that i never want to play again because the swordstance don´t looks like the real swordstance from a samurai and the playstyle is bad. a lot of other guys write the same ingame and only few like this class. the class is very defective at the moment and the skills need bugfixes because you can interrupt your own skills or the skilldamage and other things they are negativ for you if you play this class. (this is neutral because you don´t need to play it and this class isn´t overpowered)Negativ: -the gameforum is very confused because the mods are don´t put the right threads into the right forum sections-the pvp feels strange because it has fixed times for joining. so you can´t play pvp if you want and that means you must want pvp if it´s possible or you can´t play it(that means not the duell function).-the pvp is unbalanced and need much more patches for being fair and the matchmaking looks very random. in other MMORPGs it´s much better but i know that it´s only in a very few good.-if you change the map it clears the chat. so you must be sure every time you want to change the map that other don´t write to you in loading screen (because you will never be able to see it) or short time before and you must be sure that you don´t want to read the chat from this map. (groupchat and other chats are cleared too)-if the server crash you will don´t be able to play the game for longer time... the last time as the server crashed we must wait 2 days to play the game.

												I've played dozens of Anime stlye MMO's over the years, and some are similar, some are different. What usually defines how that game is not like all the others tends to usually fall into one major gimmick per game.In Aura Kingdom that would be known as the 'Eidolon' system.Basically it's your own pet that fights with you. They're core in the game and are not too hard to obtain.(This review is based on a few things. I have two characters. One lvl 50 and one level 30. I have yet to do the more 'lategame' stuff like high level dungeons. As of this review I've clocked around 40 hours.)The main points of the game, you decide if it's good or bad.- Quests are heavy and pretty much constant till you hit lvl 48. There is no monster grinding whatsoever and leveling is fast.- Even though there are parties, questing is pretty much a solo thing and instances need to be done solo.- The classes and skills are quite different and unique.- Appearance is based on global costumes rather than class related armor.- There seems to be class imbalances at the current time of the game. So far my Ravager (which is considered more AoE) has bested duelists of my level.- There is no MP (as far as I can tell) in the game, letting mages spam.- There is a need to kite enemy spells as they can be dodged by movement and skills, meaning there is a bit more skill in some mob fighting.- All classes, even the support types like Bard are capable of solo questing and don't need to depend on parties.- Gaining decent items at earlier levels is not too hard provided you know your way around the market and auction area.- Mobs spawn back really fast so dont worry about AoE mob stealers or KSers.- Gaining 'Bonus EXP' is fairly simple with parties. EXP is not split between members however - making Power Leveling unapparent.- There is quite a number of bots who auto follow quests since going from place to place is REALLY easy.- High number of 'grindy' collection quests which require this or that killed/collected. This is countered by the decent drop rate. Seems to be around 60%.To collect 5 eggs from birds you usually have to kill around 10 or less.- Eidolons are quite handy in a solo game like this. They're easy to level up.- You can glide.- Characters have very little stats to customise due to lack of MP related stats.- Subclasses can be obtained to make your character even more unique.- There are tons of daily and hidden quests for you to find if you really want to.- There is an achievement system for those who like to collect.A review of the basics:-Very story driven.-Leveling is easy.-Classes are unique.-Easy to understand GUI.-Easy quest system.-More of a solo-ish game.My personal experience:Got to level 40 on my first day because I have no life. Made a guild with my real life friends. There wasn't much interaction till 1 daily quest and there still isnt. It's been 5 days and I only just got to level 50. Im slowly starting to get bored of the monotony now, at this level there are around 10 quests of collection and killing♥♥♥♥♥♥and you don't even ge to the next level. I'm gerenally a fickle person with my MMOs, I play things until there's too much repetition because I don't have the patience for that and the novelty of the game wears off when that happens.My Ravager makes quick work of nearly all mobs and I dont require the use of a potion due to my innate tankiness and the fact I have a DMG/CRIT type. The only problem I face is soloing boss monsters which tend to mow me down quite fast and actual skill is required to kill them though kiting (which is a good thing). My sorcerer pretty much is a spam machine that doesn't even compare to my Ravager.Based on:40 hours, 2 characters (50, 30), Ronin patch.Verdict:Worth a shot for anyone into MMORPGs, especially for those trying to learn it. the quest tracker makes lives simple for those learning about these type of games and all NPC chat doesn't need to be read to know what's going on.For more reviews check out my website:Explicitly Honest.[www.explicitlyhonest.com] "

												This is simply the best MMORPG I've ever played. Played this game since its OBT on 2014 till now. Well, If you are looking for a MMO with anime art style, this one is maybe the best.Pros :- Nice anime art style with beautiful environment- Decent gameplay- Not-so-really Pay to Win- Loyalty Point, which let you buy items from the item mall (and play Paragon Tables)- Pretty easy to level up to 83 (Level cap is 90 atm)- You can master every profession in this game (Cooking, Gathering, Archeology, Fishing) - You can change your sub-weapon for free- You can change appearance and gender of your character freely- Fortification/enhancement won't break/reset/destroy your gear if you fail- You can see everyone's pantsu if you wish toCons :- Bot here, bot there, bots everywhere- Repetitive quest (Well, it's a typical generic MMO, so don't expect too much about it)- End game content is way too grindy. You want those level 80 DPS Armor set? You need to grind hard for it, especially for new players- Monsters, some dungeons and some weapons were copy-paste and the only difference is their colors- And more bots for youNeutral :- The soundtrack is good, but a bit repetitive.- Community is so.. err.. quiet? Though I don't really care because there's no spamming chat, this is may be a problem for new players to ask something about the game. But don't worry, just ask in the trade channel, they will answer you. Or find and join an active + friendly guild.This game is worth to try, it's free and won't hurt you much.			"

												Decent game but don't put your real money into it.Getting from start to level 60 is possible within a couple days; leisurely playing. 65 and up is a repeatative grind. More things unlock at 66, 70, 75, 76, and so forth in this pattern.The Eidolons are cool looking but are weak unless you can manage to get literally every form of buff for them; 3 star evolution, 3 star their wish requirements, strong accessories. The best eidolons are often requiring real money to get, or a lot of work in game to even attempt towards getting before that eidolong related item becomes unavailable again.Sky Tower is basically only way to get certain items and those require a good raiding team. Join a popular guild, and that's basically your only hope of getting said items.The community is on all ends of the spectrum, but the worst are the loli lovers or open pedo's. Have meet a few normal people from the game but it's like needle in a haystack of finding them. Overall: 7/10They could do better and it's more clear of that the longer that you play. Mainly community management needs improving, the market needs leveled out from pay to win, and could fix the leveling system for higher levels past 65. Won't invest my real money until things are improved.			"

												STAY AWAY FROM AERIA GAMES. You might agree or not agree with meI have experience play game published from Aeria Games and they are the whorse publisher ever and dont really think about player only think about profit. first of all try look at the market they sell all good items you want in Mystery Box in all their games. do you know what Mystery box is?? its gambling the chances for you to get item you want is very very low. Just think about this why do you have to pay the item you dont need or dont want to with the same price that item you really want. About the support?? most of ticket you send will be answered by copy pasting sentences. They dont really care about you, go check on Aeria Game's forum how many player raging about their ticket system, they have the whorse service everIf you been playing this game for so long time and think their not that bad, Maybe support on Aura kingdom not that bad compare the other game like Shaiya. again im talking about the company not the specific game.Seriusly I no longer trust this company and its so sad to see a good game published by bad companyJust be aware about message from fake GM that offer you something and dont click on the link given because that was phising link try to steal your account.last word from meStay away from Aeria Games.

												Actually this game is pretty well, possibly one of the best anime MMORPGs, it's pretty beautiful, but it sucks anyway!When I played it in 2014, I had no technical problems, everything worked fine, and this quick review will be based on the gameplay of 2014. Just cons, everything else is fine.CONS:The game is very easy and boring, just automove to your objectives! You can play it with your eyes CLOSED.TOO MANY DAILY EVENTS! It's so ANNOYING!!! Just login everyday and do same quests, same dungeons, and don't forget to click on your pets every 10 or 15 minutes!When I played for the whole day, I had enough time only for a few main quests (My lvl is 60+)And some people say it's a black hole for money, I don't know I broke on 60+lvl and I didn't have to donate then.Just don't waste your time on this.

												Gotta say, I've been grinding a lot on this game and find it pretty simple and easy to play. Just you have to do a lot of research on your own if you want to know how to do specific stuff, or you can learn it on your own in the hard way like any gamer. But I totally recommend this game for people that like anime and barely are starting to get into MMO's.			"

												If you have all the time in the world to grind faster than 10 bots(that is doens't have to rest), this game is for you. If you can read Trad chinese go play on the Taiwan servers, US servers are unbearable to say the least. The review will be for the US servers.Servers are very laggy if your not near or in the US. 1 ~ 10 minute delays if you dont disconnect. as of 12/12/15. Peak hours (for bots) you can't interact with npcs tp gates etc for about 10 ~ 30mins. Server merges only worsened the problem, this only further caused the low player base to decay.I play this from the launcher rather than from steam, I can say i have at least 2k hours on the game.Aeria games is just a failure in game management, it has come to the point that people that love the game (for its art style) looks for bugs in the game. Meanwhile Aeria is just sitting there waiting for XLegends to do everything for them. If only this game came out under another company, it would have had a bright future ahead of it.1 Prime example is failure to uphold its founder pack promises, they were not cheap. The handful of founders left still playing are also leaving due to this. As a company they will try to squeeze every penny they can from you, once they do they just toss you aside, in this case it was the founders. After they paid $550, with the uncertainty the game will even make it through to release, their exclusive content is now being released to non-founders for free. Other physical contents were unable to be given to the players, AG then tried to sweep it under the rug by giving players conpensation ingame.RNG in game is like entering a lottery for a trillion dollars. They try to use that as a way of enticing players to spend real money(for boosters that do jack all), meanwhile this pertpetuates the botting problem as buying gold from bots are WAAAYYYY~ cheaper and you 100% get the item. Thus the cycle continues with rarer and rarer drops while bots get more and more revenue to continue botting. Player to bots ratio? About 1 : 3. If you take the fact that most players have 5+ characters you can basically take the ratio down to a 1 : 10.Content between lvl 1 ~ 50 is basically a SP game with 1 daily multi-player dungeon worth doing, takes 2 mins. Gear doesn't  matter.Content between lvl 50 ~ 66 is paced nicely with reasonable grinding times to lvl and gain items. Gears start to matter.Content between lvl 66 ~ 70, phew, grindy to say the least. Gears is the key to be able to do party dungeons.Content from lvl 70 onwards, its world record grind fest with RNG that is basically non-existent. Don't expect to make it into a party for dungeons in this lvl range unless you have end game gears. Back to being an SP game except now theres not even a story, as the gap between quests get bigger there is less to nothing that keeps the player going, other than the thread of hope that they might win the lottery.You basically cannot reach the end game stage without spending most of your time on the game (6 characters doing all the dungeons every 3 hrs impossible to do all the ones that reset, across the span of a half a year to say the least), playing merchant for about half a year if your lucky, buying gold from bots, or buying AP (Aeria Points) with real money. Paragon table a lottery table where you roll items, is nicknamed the scam table. People have spent 500k RC (each roll is 200RC) on it and failed to obtain anything aside from junk and emeralds. Emeralds let you roll at the table some more, the results are similar to the ones using RC.If your new to the MMORPG style, try TERA the RNG is acutally reasonable and it has an awesome auto match making function for dungeons that balances your team. Main reason people play this is for the anime like art style, Eidolons (grindfest v 1.1) unique art style, nothing noteable other than that. Sad to see a game with such a unique art style die because it landed in the hands of a worthless company.			"

												An alright game.Pro:1:Not Repetitive and grindy like most Western anime mmo's I play.2:Give out free costume for your char as you progress through the game(not many mmo's do that).3:Not a pay to win game, don't need to spend a penny on this game.4:Great sound tracks and very fiting. 5:Best anime mmo ever with character creation that out in Western.Cons:1:A Bit to easy, not much of a challange(until level 50-60 and sky tower which is the only challange in the game). You can go solo in this game no problem, the difficult in this game seem fake.2: Like number 1, the parting in this game seem a little pointless, just only a little XP boost and only for small potion of duns but the rest its pretty much pointless.3:This game is grindy, very grindy but not a grind-fest. All mission is just kill these and gather that over and over but you progess very easy in this game and don't really need to do subs or anything to level up really, just doing your main you progress just fine so results of it gets pretty boring quickly.Do I reccomand this game? I say just give it a try, I don't play it much but I like it, I'm trying to slow down in this game cause I tend to get pretty bore of it fast. The costume and new awesome weapons you get for free through the game and with friends a little drive me in.			"

Of course i dont remember it and click i forgot. Where does it take me? Not to a reset password page like any other normal user friendly game. No. It takes me to the main website, so i had to search around and eventually had to even google where to reset it. Where was that? Submit a ticket and wait up to 48 hours for a response. No kidding. So after wasting my time downloading it i couldnt even log in. I told them to delete my account, its not even a good game hence why i had only played for a half hour previously anyways.

												I've played tis game since beta through the aeria ignite. so my steam game record time isn't muchServer Hydra, Now Phoenix.Be warned, tis game is extremely laggy even if you have a godly spec pcthe game itself is broken, everyday on the 5am daily ranking update ( also the centurion sched )there will be a massive server delay that will last from 3 - 15 minutes and another warning is for the random account banning that aeria does originally intended for bots but now they just ban anyone with no reason.The game was good before the invasion of bot army started, now 6 out of 10 people you would meet in game are basically bots, added to that whatever's left of the original community are a bunch of elitist that won't accept under leveled newbies in high lvl dungeon runs ( lvl 70+ dungeon raids ) and people nowadays are mostly leeches that asks to be carried ( though if you plan to invest a lot of effort in the game and be able to overpower dungeons, people will instead flock to you like little maggots pretending to be friends ^o^ )In terms of PVP forget it, if you're a newbie just starting out and has gotten curious about it chances are the moment you enter arena you will be used as a farming mob by veteran players who will tab away from fully geared players ( especially cancer types ) and will continually aim for undergeared low level enemies. 95% of arena fanatics are like that and the remaining 5% are those who are truely skilled in making build ups and are always noted as quit on sight. ( Quit the match they will eat you alive ) Well, If you do however manage to find a nice welcoming guild with senpai's who are willing to help you out, you will find that this game is really wonderful to play, the anime style graphics that allows you to peek at your own toons pantsu...  oops i mean the fast pace style of the game will surely keep you coming back for more, despite that some people had stated that the repetitive grinding is one of the biggest turn down, i would like to differ by saying as a warbow i loved the way on how i was able to kite so many mobs, running while shooting them with movement speed of 200 same could be said in playing wizards and gunslingers. i love kiting.Overall despite a bot army and terrible human community plus insane server lag, i would still recommend Aura Kingdom ( purely because of the loli's and waifu's ) for it has a fun and fulfilling style of gameplay. Hey, it's free so why not try it out.I'd still give it a 6 out of 10 score.   6 / 10P.S i hate fishing , digging , cooking			"

												This review is going to be negative.I've leveled a ranger to level 63 (got decent gear that I crafted and upgraded).-Leveling up: All you got to do is quest your way to gain xp, meaning: You do quests, quest says ""kill X monsters"" - quest done, get xp. Extremely boring and repetative, hundreds of same quest over and over and over again 99% of the time.to sum up: leveling in aura kingdom is boring repetetive and a drag...-Servers: if you're playing from europe, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.This game is running fine without lag for maybe 5 hours a day, the rest of the day you get lag spikes and disconnections, why? because the servers are complete garbage. Even if this game was fun, enjoyable and perfect, it is unplayable for europeans such as myself.To be clear I got a god-like pc that runs crysis 3 on ultra high and I got 100Mps internet which I never lag in any game (unless the game servers are trash).This game for the most part is laking of game-play diversity and extremely repetetive you do the same EXACT stuff over and over and over without a porpuse or a good reward at the end.

												The game itself is quite brilliant, a really solid ""free"" mmorpg with some different mechanics to the usual regarding eidolons and such. However, what makes me not recommend this game is that after spending 50ish hours levelling my character and exploring the game, i came back after a 5 month break to find my character gone. Just gone, no warning, no e-mail to tell me to login to ensure it doesn't get deleted. Nothing. Based on the reviews of other players im guessing this was because i hadnt spent any money in game which basically makes me worthless in their eyes.

												I mean, if anime MMORPG are your thing you can't go wrong with Aura Kingdom.I played this game for a couple of months and I throughly enjoyed it, the questing never got boring even though it felt repetitive at times, the community is quite nice and willing to help, the art style is anime af, and overall it's really fun, but It  has several things that lacks.First of all, the combat. I'm not really a big fan of tab targeting but I'm not going to be biased and say the combat is bad just because it's not my style, I'm saying I don't like it because it isin't really imersive. You always will do the same combination of spell launch once you get all you spells and you won't change it unless some lvl 99 scrub says that he has a better spell chain. IMO Combat can use some improvement but it's not all bad, the game has a really interesting waif-- partner system. They're like summons which aid you in battle (some of which are women dressed in a well... anime style huehue). ALSO , you can equip two weapons, which is quite nice and quite (quite) original.Story is as you would expect from an anime MMORPG, personally I found the story OK at best, nothing I haven't seen in the other 86% of games.Characters/classes/beta males/waifus/whateveryouwanttocallthem Is something this game does nice, there's your typical guy (or loli) with the 10 ft Greatsword, your Legolas, your Aragon, you get it. But there are some few more classes that separate them from the rest of the MMORPGS that i've played in a while. As you would expect from a Asian rpg, you can customize the hell out of your character with all sorts of accesories (which some of them give boosts which I don't approve of tbh)Enjoyment, Even though I don't play AK anymore (i left because all my friends stop playing it FeelsBadMan) I really had fun playing it and I do recommend it if you enjoy anime style light hearted MMORPG with tab targeting combat... that being said I do wish they would improve a bit that combat, but overall solid game. I will give it a solid 7.5/10 on my IGNorance scale.			"

												It's a pretty solid MMORPG, but it could use some work.PROS:Graphics - Pretty adorable little anime graphics, everything is well modeled, especially for an MMO.Quests - If you do the quests, there's a fairly minimum outside grind needed, but of course it's faster just to grind, if you know the right places. Storyline - Unlike many other Anime-style RPGs, the story is very scarcely cringy. Character Options - There are numerous character options. First, you start out with a class (really just a weapon, but y'know), and a follower called an Eidolon. As you progress through the game, you can improve your starting Eidolon, or get ones that are way better. Each one has different skills and interacts with your character in various ways. At lvl 50, you can choose a second weapon, either one that makes your character way better at the niche that it has, or one that rounds it out better. CONS:Staffing - Pretty nil. Oftentimes, the serious reports aren't handled for a long time, while most things minor that happen when a staff is on will get handled right away, resulting in a ban. However, unlike most of the top reviews say, you won't likely get banned for the stupid stuff they say you are unless you are just doing it right in front of a mod, which is overall stupid. PvP - The game is advertised as PvE, and it really lives up to that. But if you like PvP, then you might be dissapointed by this game. TL;DR Good game, has good graphics and a decent story, but some of the people aspects could use some work.			"

												Alright, this is going to be a decently detailed review so bear with me here.For a TL;DR version: This game is a fun yet grindy instance-based themepark MMO. You will not enjoy this at all if you dislike any of the aforementioned. I have a love-hate relationship with this game. I have been playing since Chimera server release, and at first loved it dearly, as it was one of my first actual MMOs. Also, it was after watching Sword Art Online, which got me into this ""binge"" feeling for MMORPGs. Any new player to the MMORPG scene would probably enjoy this game a lot, as it provides a general experience of an MMORPG.Pros:Very friendly to newcomers. There are tutorials for just about everything - but oh sweet jeebuz, the voices.Graphics are beautiful; if you're into anime-styled characters with big boobs and badass swords - you'll probably enjoy this game.Many classes to choose from - you'll never get bored from the multitude of choices. I have levelled many characters to a certain point (50-60) and have enjoyed all but one. Sub-classes: Some MMORPGs do not provide this experience. You will use two classes as your setup, but can be hard deciding if you have never played the other classes, as there is such a wide variety.The first time through the game is crazy - it can be hard keeping up with all the skills you're offered, and all the different potential combat variation. Of course, you can set a 1-2-3 routine if that's how you like it - but I personally enjoy mixing it up a bit.Questing with friends can be fun as the points for killing X mob counts for the both of you. This can lead to faster questing, if you are both killing different mobs at a time.Gliding and mounts. Gliding is normalized unless you get enchantment cards of some sorts that provide faster gliding speed; however, the MOUNTS are the real pro here. Mounts are organized by 30%, 60%, and 90% speeds. There are no flying mounts, and they cannot be used in combat. Cosmetics! Probably my favorite part about this game is the variation in cosmetics. Most of it is only available through the cash shop or AP tiered spenders - however, you can easily obtain these costumes through gold usage on the Auction House. Do note that brand new costumes are extremely expensive and will not be available to a player making minimal amounts of money.More on the cosmetics - most of the ""orange"" items can be dyed different colors. This leads to lots of variation in one costume, having a multitude of colors to choose from on multiple locations of the costume.The community. For the most part, the community is actually pretty good in this game. There are a ton of guilds for players of all levels, and most veterans welcome newcomers with open arms. Possibly one of the better communities out of most MMOs I've played.Eidolons - I love how many there are, and that you can ""evolve"" them like Pokémon, so-to-speak. Collecting them is hard, and some are unobtainable (look at ""cons"" section).Cons:The cash shop. Do not let anyone fool you by saying this game is NOT pay-to-win. There ARE fortifications on the cash shop. There are many items on there that will make AP (their money/site currency) users much stronger than you.X-Legend is not known for their PvP in games. The PvP is very, very unbalanced - some classes are ridiculously overpowered and very little is changed (such as sleep timers - Sorcerer) to reduce some classes from being extremely overpowered.Bots are running about all over. It feels like they are slowly diminishing, but that could just be the fact I am used to seeing them everywhere. Then again, most MMOs in general have a lot of bots farming for in-game currencies to sell online.Very grindy. Themepark. If you dislike grinding the same dozen or so dungeons; I HIGHLY recommend you stay away. You will not like this game after levelling.Ahh; levelling. The quests are merely kill ___ mob ___ times; collect ___ from ___ mob; collect ___ plant ___ times. Very repetitive and tedious quests with the rare occurance of an actual plot.The story is... meh. This is not a game for people who want to be immersed whatsoever. The ""role-playing"" feel you got from Vanilla WoW - yea, that's not here.Patches are very slow. We get classes that the Taiwan version gets around 6-8 months later, and actual content comes in around the same pace.The translations aren't perfect, but if you aren't reading the story this is not a very big deal to you. Although, some of the skills have awkward wordings and can be rather confusing. Eidolons -  Many of them are unobtainable without the cash shop ""RNG"" boxes, or getting the key fragments from the AP tiered spenders. The drop rates on some of the eidolons are so ridiculously low that getting one without the cash shop/tiered spender is extremely rare (I'm looking at you, Tsubaki).OVERALL, I do recommend this MMORPG. I had a blast, and still come back to it every few months and go at it again. The instances are always fun to run through again and remembering old times. Just note that the game is a themepark and generally does not offer much else to do other than instances.I hope my review helped you as an individual decide on whether or not you are going to play this game or not Feel free to add me on Steam and message me any questions you may have about the game. I will give you the honest truth; not a biased opinion like some of the other reviews I have read on here.			"

How Kujo Not Recommend ""Aura Kingdom""?--(My playthrough consisted of solely the bard class)It's only fun for so long. The combat's servicable enough except there's no strategy in regards positioning in any non-ranged focused class. When executing an ability it locks you in place (and the animation) until it's finished. You can only move while auto-attacking. Many of the quests in the game consist of clicking on the objective to set a path you can auto-follow to just talk to NPCs, which is where more than half of your EXP comes from, not from combat quests. In a bizzare mechanic I noted, it's faster to glide to an objective than using mounts, even though it's not automatic. When you hit Level 35, which will take roughly 15 hours, and have access to trading there's no real incentive to truding to higher levels aside from the class progression.The soundtrack has one or two songs that stand out whilst the other's fufill their purpose, and the game fairs well enough graphically. The community's rather friendly and the customer support was relatively quickly when I needed my pass code to be reset, but I've had no experience with the paid aspect of the game. I suggest a title like Dragon's Nest instead.			"

												Don't take my hours here seriously, I have over 1500 hours via Aeria Ignite. I love this game. The graphic style is a lot different compared to the more cartoony style of other anime style mmorpgs. It has a decent story to go  with it as well. True, the game requires a ton of grinding, but I had my awesome guild friends to get me through that. Which brings us to community. The people I've encountered in my year and a half of playing the game are tremendously amazing. So, all in all,- it's a fun game- anime style is cool- story is good- soundtrack is good- classes are varied and fun to try out, animations are awesome- levelling up used to require a lot of grinding, but they fixed it with recent updates- materials still require grinding in order to get the top gear- no complaints on the game publisher's side, they have always responded and helped when needed- The Eidolons (pets) are awesome, getting the rare ones are a pain- community is great, made a lot of friends- mystery boxes for costumes might feel like they are stealing from you, but hey microtransactions, am I right?Give it a try, you might like it.

												So I played this game for week or two and usually I play MMO till they force you to grind for days or quest get to tough\boring\repeative and here list of things I liked and disliked.+Fishing minigame it was fun seeing how tiny frail girls cathes and rises above her head Fish three times her size.Monsters there are many of them they look diffirent some goofy, some cool and scary of course there also palette swaps.Loot\Leveling up at first it was fun plenty of treasure chest dropped from monsters grinding level was fast enoughat first I though I wouldn't be able to beat big miniboss elite monster but I was wrong.Costumes they look generic enough but liked them anyway.Quest: Game divided in location each one have a story at the end of each there usually Dungeon or minigame with stealh or diversion and big boss. There is also hidden quest that you find on your own and dailies.Glide ability I like to be able to double jump and fly around.-Fun: Stopped at lvl 50 quests became to boring, you already seen them 1000 times and nothing new just increased numbers, go there kill 10 monsters, go kill them again but this time get their specific quest item, go talk to this guy repeatX10, see that blacksmith? Go to talk to him he'll teach you some stuff and give you lvl apropriate accesory. Done& Go gather some stuff again.  Fishing: At first I said Fishing was fun, but when I wanted to get better gear I had to catch some fish and say for that fishing set I need 3 of of that fish items, I said to myself ""It's MMO so there will be some grinding but so far game was very kind"" and I went fishing I caught around 70 of those fishes out of those 70 I got only 1 item i needed,  that made me sad.  Quest: So screw fishing Lets go back to quests and another disappointment hit me. After reaching certain level scroll image appears annoying living hell out of you and  you can't abbandon them. By that time I alredy had problems with few bosses being able to hit you for like 50% of you HP but those rabbit just stamped big red cross on FUN. Why? Simple. They hitted to hard they swarmed you and healing sucks in this game, I cursed and sweared at them loudly, but while they are were managable event their bigger miniboss version. Long story short I barely managed to fight my way to the boss, threw everything I had at him and didn't even scratch him for 10% Also if monster losses aggro at you he recovers HP instantly, at least monster didn't respawn but that was last nail in the coffin for this game.End of the review I can reccomend this game for 10 to 20 hours.

												Aura Kingdom is almost a caricature or a deconstruction of the whole concept of a Massive Online JRPG. The character designs immediately call to mind Magic Knight Rayearth; fashion is pretty and elaborate with lots of frills on display, hair is long and available in a variety of fanciful colors, and all swords are huge. Combat is pretty easy to learn, each weapon type has some kind of small gimmick that helps to keep squashing the various adorable monsters roaming the world from becoming stale quickly. A similarly easy to learn fishing mini-game is also worked in, with its own equipment and interface. Cosmetic gear is entirely seperated from statistic-granting combat gear, leading to the situation whereby your character can look like pretty much whatever you want without impacting the ability to fight effectively.This is the kind of game where there's no dungeon finder, but 14 seperate dance emotes. Where new abilities are learned automatically on level up or are chosen for free, straight from the character info window, and are re-chosen with fairly minimal penalty the same way. It's a very soothing kind of game, great for mellow, casual players or people just getting acquainted with online games....In summary, if you spend most of your time foaming at the mouth and screaming into a headset mic about why your last raid wipe or lost ranked match was everyone else's fault, give this one a pass. Try chewing on some wood instead.			"

												So, this game is lots of fun when you first install it and run around and play for a while. I highly recommend it.But God forbid you walk away for a month or so and forget your password. Once you forget your password, you can never play again. There's no way to recover it, and you can't even log in without it. The game sends you to the website to fill out a ""Tech Support ticket"" to reset your password, but nobody responds when you do this. Short of starting a whole new steam account, you're just never playing this game again. Other than that, though, it was pretty fun if I recall from last year. Maybe some day, they'll actually hire some staff to help their customers.			"

												This game is cute and you get to pick a cute anime girl fairy who aid you in combat and gets treasure for you once in a while. Very cute anime game and all, but incredibly unpolished and unbalanced.You are incredibly overpowered against any normal enemy around your level, mostly because you get so powerful equipment really fast, much of it from area bosses you can easily solo. These respawn in just minutes and there are several of them even in the starting area. The drops are not level based either. I got some boots with a level requirement of 40 in a lvl 1 -> 10 zone, and several other pieces for players around lvl 15-20. It makes no sense!MANY quests seem broken or not even implemented. Where the quest text should be you have either nothing or just a string of numbers. I don't know if they can be completed, but how you would do so without ANY info whatsoever beyond me.It's cute, and although it seemed stable it is horribly unfinished. Don't play this, watch K-On! instead for cute.			"

												Pros:  Cutesy anime-style  Fast, neat-looking skills and lush, beautiful graphics Good soundtrack for most maps (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ Is F2P Many chances for gaining better items, or even costumes and mounts. Has opportunities for both PvP and PvE oriented people Guild customization and flexibility Moderate-high player base Nice overall community (when not agitated by below reasons)Cons: Too many repeatable/non-unique/daily quests Leveling gets painfully slow if you don't have enough boosters Bots galore (very annoying for newbies and all levelers in general) Is a grindfest after level 55 Can be too easy for some people (i.e. guided questing) Storyline degrades overtime  Slow to release new content Listening to the same soundtrack being repeated over and over again... Item mall and costume-showoffs may discourage you from playing Takes a while to get better eidolons and faster mounts are virtually unobtainable without paying (with some exceptions) A ton of lag when entering the major city Has a clunky UI that takes up too much unnecessary space Servers are typically slower for EU playersMy score: 3.5/10 Overall, my experience with this game was bad. I enjoyed it as a beginner and all, but what turned me off at the end was the lack of enthuiasm due to the slow leveling and bland repetitive questing. Heck, my main character barely reached level 60, and I'm sure that I will never get to level 80 without paying in bulk - nope, I don't want to go through all that sugar-coated hell all over again. This game has potential for improvement though, so not all hope is lost.			"

												Edited for 2016I received an e-mail about losing my character if I don't log in 11 days ago and saw it 5 days ago. The message said that my inactive characters will be deleted on 1st of September if I don't log in and ask support to restore my hidden characters (just imagine not being able to read an ""offer"" categoried gmail like this in 5 days).I contacted support and asked them to unhide both of my characters, but they only managed to restore the one with less progress overall. I thought it was fine because of the character being somewhat low level so I decided to try and continue playing the game.I noticed that every time the game loaded something, I'd get this ""choppy"" lag with every setting even though my computer is capable of running the game with highest settings (and could do so before this update). Now I can't play the game without choppy lag, so I'm uninstalling it.

												I've played this game before it even came to steam. This game is a good for casual gamers because the game is relatively easy and has great design. The gameplay is point and click based with some use of the usual wasd and 1-9 skills. Below is my opinion on what are the pros and cons of the game.Pros:-The game is free to play. (Seriously) \(>o<)/ -Eidolons, they're like summons that help you kill monsters and gives buffs or heal you.-The game is easy, this could go in either in pros or cons depending on the player. -The game mechanics are ( are or is? Dunno dunt care. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) easy to understand.-Friendly community and player base. ( except for the trolls （￣へ￣）)-Gears and Costumes concept. ( Your char's image are based on the costumes, and your char's stats are based on the gears)-The new loot system makes high level gear farming relatively easy.-Tiered spender. ( Free items which you can get if you spend cash on the game.)http://aurakingdom.aeriagames.com/itemmall/tiered-spender-Loyalty system. ( Loyalties are free which can be farmed and is used to buy items on the cash Item mall.)Cons:-Game is easy. -Highly pay to win, Ofc most game which are free are pay to win. But this game requires ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s amount of money to get annoyingly overpowered. Example of this is the forti scrolls in this game. +1-9 forti scroll is free. +10-20 <-- sh*tload $$-They often change the pricing of loyalty in the item mall. You know, for you to use $$. ノ( º _ ºノ)-No pvp gear bracket, Players with +9 gears dont have a match with players +20 gears. (THEY'LL 1 HIT YOU!!!1 HIT!!)-PVP which got  rankings time brackets. Practically annoying if its Working hours and Eerie hours. -World bosses are practically paper thin and weak as hell. ( Doesnt last 2 seconds is ya ask me.)-The freakin dungeons are freaking repitetive.-♥♥♥♥♥♥ maintenances. Doesnt even change a thing. ¯\_(=.=)_/¯-TOO MANY BOTS! (ノ ゜Д゜)ノ ︵ ┻━┻-MODS ARE TOO LAZY TO REMOVE BOTS!! (ノ ゜Д゜)ノ ︵ ︵ ┻━┻-CUSTOMER SUPPORT SUCKS!!! (ノ ゜Д゜)ノ ︵ ︵ ︵ ┻━┻ ( they took a month for me to read the ticket i send to them)-Online Gold sellers. -Cash item mall. Cash items usually are only essence pack which have a high chance to drop sh*tty items. ( you need to open 9 to get a sure good item from it. ) http://aurakingdom.aeriagames.com/itemmall-New♥♥♥♥ can't even triforce   ▲▲ ▲So there you go.. Oh ya heres the table.┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ)			"

												After a few days since i first time lay my eyes on this game, here is all of my opinions about it.-Pros:  Large world to explore.  Immersive :  +Gameplay  +Items  +Non-repeat quest system  +Pet  +Interesting storyGood graphic engineCute characters and NPCs-Cons:A bit of P2WStill have some glitchy like missing textAnimation bugLagAfter all, its a good game, i will update for more information, my character still pretty far from end-game condition.Updated-Pros :Ingame Events everyday such as Fish King, World Boss, Battlefield....Some costume items you dont need to pay money for it but you can earn it by doing some quests.Lots of secret features and referrences, try to find all of it if you can.Brings your friends and create your own guild, level it up and get your own guild hall.-Cons : Welcome to Freeze Aura of Crash Kingdom. Really, this game crashing and not responding a lot. Each week the server ingame maintenance once.The game swarmed with bots try to steal your farm ground and spam scam mail to you. The main reason for lagging ingame.The developer released uncompleted content as new patch.Some features that only avaiable for pay2play players.I was playing this game restless so i forgot to update it.

												Great Anime MMORPG.. Best one I've seen by far that is compatible with the english language. Meet real people of many races, cultures, nationalities and more! All players are welcoming and fun and many have a great sense of humor! I recommend for ages 9+ to be able to fully understand the game. As stated before, it is extremely fun and has that bit of challenge in it that keeps you interested all of the time. 9.5/10 I give it. Have Fun!  Best Anime Game Out There!  "

												Updated review content: After finally getting to level 60 I have to change my review to do not recommend.  Leveling to 60 wasn't too bad, but as I saw in my original review below, nothing special.  The problem is at level 60 quests that were giving you 10-15% of a level each now give about 0.1%.  The solo dungeons available give less than 1% to run the entire thing.  Doing dailies with level 65 mobs that are quite painful to push through give about 3% for 30-60 minutes of work.  But unfun work.  I literally beat on the same enemy for 10 minutes straight to take him down and he was only PART of that quest requirement.  The only way to level is to run party dungeons, but parties don't take people below level 65.  The game does not get better.  All reports indicate level 70+ is even worse.  If it's just grind grind grind and solo grind at that until 65... forget it.  Not the point of an MMO.It's a free to play MMO with decent graphics that doesn't seem to (I'm only mid 30s in level so far) nickle and dime you for every little think like so many other Asian free to play MMOs do.  There's nothing I've found exceedingly unique or special with this game than so many others.  It has nice convenience features like clicking a quest objective to take you there, easy party finding in most (low level at least) cases, and an active user base.  Again, shocked it doesn't nickle and dime.  There were a number of times I ran into in game things that were free I just KNEW would cost money, like item upgrading and inserting/removing stones that provide bonuses to items.  It's a good diversion for the price.  Nothing spectacular.			"

												This was my first MMORPG game on a PC. It wasn't bad, at least not in the beginning. It graducally became quite repititive as I made progress, spending hundreds of hours of non-stop grinding. It was fun if I had a good party to run dungeons with and like all other RPGs, it was all about getting a good gear either by crafting or buying items of various categories. The story of Gaia and its envoys was total crap and around 99.9% players skipped reading anything. The remainder 0.1% includes people like me who were stupid enough to go through each and every meaningless dialogue. The graphics were average and the gameplay was glitchy either due to server lag at certain times or due to some in-game bugs. The only thing that made me continue to play were my friends but they later moved on to better games like WoW or B&S even though most of them were P2W players. I still tried to play it without them beacuse I had spent a considerable amount of time (around 600 hours) in this game and I wasn't prepared to see all that go to waste but it turned out that I was doing nothing but playing house with a bunch of arrogant kids. It was tough but I had to make a judgment call and so I quit it for good. It's almost been three months since I stopped playing it and I must admit, I've never felt so good in my life before. I'm finally able to spend my time playing games that deserve to be played. My advice for all the new players is to look for other games in the same genre, there are much better options available than this. EDIT: I forgot to mention the bots! This game is literally crawling with bots.You can see them running around everywhere in almost every map. The devs (in an effort to solve this issue) have devised a system to ban accounts which wasn't much effective and have been reported to randomly ban even a legitimate player account as I've seen in several cases. You have been warned!(I used to launch the game directly from Aeria Ignite so my play time on Steam is not accurate)			"

As soon as I clicked on start button another small window pops up which says : Access Denied - you are not authorized to play. I was like what the F**k. why I wasted 4 GB on downloading and 500 MB on updation? Finally I submitted a ticket to their support for answers. Till this date I haven't received their reply. I am gonna wait some more time for their reply if that doesn't come then I am kicking this game out of my PC. In any case Dota is there on which I can fall back if bored.			"

												This is my first MMO and I’ve got to say i am impressed. Aura Kingdom is my all time favourite game and is the most played game in my library, you take on the role as a envoy of gaia –  a human with abilities far exceeding other humans. The envoy starts out as a regular human, working for a living, until a blue mysterious orb suddenly appears and follows the envoy around until transforming into its true form, an eidolon. After the public saw this they were reminded of a envoy like him who had supposedly gone crazy and hid in a cave this was because he had a desire for power and because of this his eidolon transformed into something sinister that caused the envoy to lose control and lash out at civilians. Because of this the envoy is scared that his destiny would end up like the other envoys destiny and would eventually go crazy, his solution, to use a ancient device to remove the eidolon before he loses control. There is more to the story but some prefer to find out for themselves. Pros-Beautiful world full of unique animals and creatures with an anime like visual style to it-Populated servers with friendly people-Free to play-Easy to understand  -Dungeons are interesting to complete by yourself or in a party and will keep you interested -Attention to detail is superb such as weapons, costumes, eidolons and mounts-A amazing combat system with smooth transitions between moves-Large areas full of quests and monsters to fight-Gliding through the air is awesome -Can run on crappy computers and crappy internet -Good storyline if you don't continuously press the skip button-Clever ways to involve companions (eidolon) which each have unique abilities, movesets, stats and even personalities (and there are many to choose from)-Remains fun even if you have finished the main quest-Pay to win doesn't really apply as long as you have perseverance-Game has plenty of replayability like fishing, digging, creating new characters to use new classes and movesets, participating in the sky tower and events, duelling or trading with strangers, joining or creating dungeon raiding parties, side quests, hidden quests, achievements and more -Game still receives updates so the game still has more to offer-Many classes to choose from and you gain a secondary class at level 40 creating interesting combinations of movesets and combos-Companions named eidolons are useful for fighting/buffs/healing and can be levelled up -Has events which happen every 3 to 4 hours-You can create your own guilds that can be levelled up with daily quests and achievements and will gain you additional perksCons-The game tends to use quests like pick up _ of this and kill _ of a little to often that but aside from that quests are amazing-Music is not exactly memorable but that doesn't really matter-You can't change your raceThis game is definitely worth picking up and playing and the best part is it's free I definitely recommend it to all who enjoy MMORPG			"

												I've played this game for only 2 hours and i gotta say its been a blast this game looks great and doesn't need a powerful gaming pc to run. The art style in this game is very much cute Japanese anime which I love. Combat is good but its very simple target enemy mash ability keys but I will forgive it on this point cause every ability has a awesome looking animation which is smooth. The game also has world bosses which is a nice addition to F2P MMO, my only other concern is how the map works and finding specific npc's I sometimes find to be a bit of a problem but apart from that great game rate it 8/10			"

												Normally I don't review games, normally I'm a pretty forgiving individual, but this one stood out as something that I kind of want to talk about.This game classifies itself as a MMORPG but the way I see it is it's just Habbo Hotel in 3D. The party system in this game isn't even that as I've read on the Aeria forums from another player that states that it's just there as an item distribution system. The gameplay mechanics are extremely simple but there is plenty of potential as it even allows you to hybridize the class system when you get to level 40. In fact it was that very idea that caught my attention (apart from the aesthetic appeal). However, my grief with this game starts when in a party. You don't share EXP for each kill you get with the rest of your party and when doing quests side by side, a party member's achievements, like killing a monster, doesn't count to the rest of the party's quest count. Someone please explain to me how games like this is still considered multiplayer? I look at this game and all I see is an online single player social game. If you like the anime style gameplay and playing solo online then for sure go check this game out as it's visually appealing and again, the game system itself isn't that bad. If you're looking for a massively multiplayer online role playing game? I wouldn't waste my time and bandwidth.			"

												Ignore the hours. I didn't play the game on Steam, but I've spent quite a bunch of hours on the game downloading it through their launcher (60-70 hours or so). Only downloaded it to write a review.Now let's get to the review:Aura Kingdom is nothing fancy. If you search for innovation you won't find it here (and anywhere to be fair, sadly the last game that really changed the genre was WoW). It's a solid and fun, WoW inspired, MMORPG with nice graphics. It's Free-mium, which means you CAN spend money on the game for cosmetics, but you don't have to. It doesn't give you an advantage but makes the game more attractive I suppose? (Never understood paying for cosmetics but some people really like it, look at LoL)It's no MMORPG were you'll spend 2k-3k hours like some others *cough* WoW *cough* (dark times, guys) but it's a really fun way to pass the time. You have lots of different classes to try out and re-try the game with. Every class is different and, thus, the way you experience the game is different. With some you tank and spank, with others you really have to position intelligently if you want to make things right.The game isn't frustrating by making you Grind the same monster for +50h but you can't really rush through it without grinding either (it mantains a good equilibrium with that).You can solo the game in case your friends dont play MMORPG's (♥♥♥♥ you, guys) or play it with a couple friends you'll be able to finish the game without mayor problems in either way.Of course it has some flaws. A few little bugs here and there (nothing game-breaking, really) and some people don't like that the game is rather short for a MMORPG as they normally require at least a few hundred hours to complete. Let's just say it isn't a deep MMORG but a little game to have fun with when you have nothing to do and/or want to relax a bit.Overall a really nice game and I recommend it to every fan of the genre. Polished, fun and Free2Win. Seems good enough, right?Damn, now I want to play the game again... Well, why not? I don't even need friends to play with (again, ♥♥♥♥ you, guys...)			"

												My account was banned for some ungodly reason yet they still felt it was okay to take money for a game I could no longer play. This is absolutely inexcusable and totally ridiculous. Where do you get off as a publisher thinking this is okay? Aeria games, you are a disgrace to honest game publishers and developers everywhere. It's disgusting that publishers like you still exist in these modern times that still exploit players and then shed a blanket of ignorance over yourselves. These are YOUR games, these are YOUR responsibility! If something happens with an account do you not think it would be wise to notify the player of the problem, and then maybe I don't know, STOP taking their money? Where does it make sense to decide that you no longer want a player in your community but it's still okay for said player to continue making payments to your asinine company and you continue to profit? What service are you exactly providing to that individual? Or are you just so godly that you think you deserve recompense for some imagined slight? You are disgusting and I will make sure to notify everyone and anyone of your underhanded tactics and exploitations of your playerbase. Thank you Aeria Games for being a shining example of everything wrong with the gaming world and FTP companies today. Thank you for setting back the evolution of the FTP model, and not progressing towards a more streamlined and player friendly model. May god have mercy on your despicable souls...I'm out.JaycePS: Your welcome for all the free money.			"

Posted: April 25, 2016
												I've only been playing this game for a small time now, but from the moment I actually got into the game I noticed a few things that I want to note about this game. Of course this is a limited view as of right now, and I'll probably right more on this game in the future, but there are just things from a new player that I'd like to discuss that are appealing and absolutely not.1. CAMERA DIRECTION. The camera is fixed, and not on the direction that your character is running, which is common in practically 99% of RPG games you and I could probably think of off the top of our heads. You have to hold down the right mouse button and manually steer around where your view is. This can be considered an infuriating experience at first. It also completely ruins the flow of the game, adventure, and just kinda sticks it more into your head that this is a program instead of your own cool anime adventure. Even when it feels like I've gotten used to it, I end up in situations where this absolute design flaw sticks out like a sore thumb.2. QUESTS OBJECTIVE TRACKING. While we're on the topic of that feeling of adventure that a lot of people would consider crucial for an RPG, myself included, the game has a function that can completely destroy the sense of adventure and exploration in quests. How? Well I'll start off by saying that any good RPG has a way to track the general destination or area that you have to go to for your quest, through just a little symbol that appears on the map or a symbol that appears generally on the top of the screen that points you where to go (note: in some games this can be executed poorly, however there are also games that can do this while still giving a lot of sense of adventure, Skyrim is a good example). This game, however, has a pop-up screen that displays the goals of the quest, and if you click on the sentences of these obective (e.g you have to kill 5 of a certain enemy), the game will not only lay out a sparkly trail on the ground that not only leads to your goal, but also automatically starts taking you there. If you needed to find people that you can tell are supposed to be hard to find, you can just click this and you'll just be taken to them. More hidden resources that needed to be found? No worry, you'll be taken to it instantly. For some, this is quite the positive, since a lot of people would find having to always look for the quest's objectives manually each time tedious and tiring; and it's a completely optional too. Honestly it's a pretty convenient function for people that just wanna blast through to get to the higher levels. Although the bad thing I'll have to say about it is that the icon on the mini-map in the top right-hand of the screen the icons were absolutely confusing. There is a lot going on, and the icon that displays the direction of the quest does not stand out as much as the other symbols. The good thing is, however, that if you go into the regional map there is a list of icons on the side that not only tell you what each is for, but also has an option to not display them! Very handy. I'd say these functions are honestly up to interpretation for whether they're good or bad. Personally, I find that it's very hard and not as clear as other RPG games in the showing of a more general direction and in frustration, can push you more to the option of just letting the game take you everywhere. I'm all about immersion and for me, even having that option takes away from the potential of the experience of adventure. 3. THE DESIGNS AND ITEMS. My god, everything is cool in this game. As an artist, aesthetics and the way colours and design catch the eye are very important to me for just about everything; especially in anything that's definitely more visual-based like games. But I've caught myself thinking quite a few times that it's overwhelming in this game, and even a bit 'too cool'. Generally when we start to play a new fantasy MMORPG we start off with these kinda mediocre and mundane gear. In some you can see how it's kinda cool, but it's definitely not awe-inspiring. Especially compared to high-level players that you see running around mounted on something crazy like a lion with a fire mane, and gear on them that is radiating with some awesome aura, with wings coming out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ back. We look to these players and start to idolize them in a sense for looking so rad. And when you start to reach up closer to the top, and start to collect your own cooler items, you definitely start to get a sense of pride and accomplishment in the hard work you've put into developing your character so much, especially if you paid money for it. This game off the bat gives you awesome items. For exmaple I choose the Scythe class for my first character, at a very early level I can summon not one, but THREE beautifully designed demons to accompany me; and the choice is out of six demons in total. Even if you didn't choose the Scythe class, under level 10 you are given a mount, which personally I've never witnessed in a fantasy MMORPG before.And to top it all off, the game itself is actually based around the lore of it's world that there are these people chosen by destiny, that are given little creature companions (which is a very stereotypical thing to see in anime) that help you fight with their special abilities. While in character creation you get to choose out of four which one you want. This trait in the game is also really up to interpretation just like the last one, too. On one hand, it's very rad that we all can have so many magnificent items, and can just look so fine. But on the other hand, it personally gives me less of an urgent want to progress fastly to be able to look good since I already am satisfied with my gear. Also on the more negative side, town centers were lots of players congregate can look completely ridiculous; like a hub for really over the top, overpowered original characters from deviantArt. And despite actually loving all the designs in this game, I still feel more neutral about it all. 4. LAG. The bane of all gamers out there, the insufferable force which destroys the natural flow and order in your gaming session - yes, ladies, gentlemen, and honoured guests - this game has so, so much lag. I don't believe I have to go into such extensive detail for this section, but it's so much that it DOES need to be noted. It's not so bad that it crashes my game or makes me lag for more then 10 seconds, but I do have a good laptop and internet. Why so much lag though? Honestly, blame the dirty weabs. All there for the designs, I swear. 5. POP-UP CONVERSATION SCENES. In this game when you talk to anyone that isn't a background character a pop-up screen with your character's and the npc's top half of the body show up. Dialogue, actions each character makes shown in text, intervention from not only your first mount, but also your little companion that's always given to you... it's all just like a visual novel. And it's very appealing, and even refreshing and unique to see in a fantasy MMORGP. It wouldn't be too much of a stretch that they put this in to appeal to those that are loyal anime fans, seeing as a lot of very popular games in Japan have these kinds of cut scenes that are very iconic in visual novels. They even give your character very over-exaggerated reactions that intergrate into the 'weaboo sub-popculture'. I can imagine some people would find this cringe-worthy, but I doubt anyone that would see it like that would be interested in a blantantly obvious anime-inspired game in the first place. 6. CLASSES. I was going to write about this extensively, but I ran out of space, so here's the basics. There are a wide range of classes, up to 13 classes in total. I'd recommend this game since most features that I see as note-worthy are more postive or up to interpretation, and therefore, worth giving a go and seeing if it's for yourself!			"

												Aura Kingdom is beautiful, which is generally not a surprise for a game whose basic art inspiration is clearly anime.  The color palette and many of the visual choices strongly reminded me of playing fighting games in the arcade back when I was a kid, especially during combat sequences. The initial leveling experience is fairly swift, comparable to the current starter zones in games such as Lord of the Rings Online or World of Warcraft.As for the gameplay - it's a game that's easy to get into but also easy to set down and forget in favor of more engrossing games.Like in all other MMORPGs, grinding is the theme of Aura Kingdom and the storyline can, at most of the times, be neglected.Overall, Aura Kingdom represents a welcome turn from Aeria Games to making a decent and family friendly MMORPG which manages to be a fun, polished, and addictive experience.

												Alright, So I've been a long time player of this game, though I hadn't played it a lot recently. Probably for several months. But The game itself is pretty darn fun. I'd reccomend at least giving it a try but there are some things you should probably know before jumping into it.Pros:-Dencent Gameplay-Fun animation Style-Pretty damn good guild system-Everything you can pay money for can be accquired in-game without needing to buy itCons:-The general chat is constantly spammed with bots telling you to go to X site and purchase gold. Personally it doesn't bug me too much as I mostly just ignore it, but it does need to be dealt with.-Apparently there's a good chance of getting banned for no reason if you ever use real money to buy something, so I'd reccomend not doing that.Other than that, it's pretty good, it's not Pay to win, more pay to look pretty. So if you're down for a good time killer, this is pretty good. Just don't spend real money. Ever.			"

												After playing and wanting to like it, I really just can't. Before starting why i should say i've played till level 26At first i saw the anime style and many classes. I liked the look of it. That really is the only reason I can think of to like this game.What can I say? It just feels like its designed for someone who doesn't really want to play. qeusting is pretty much one click to the objective, doing/killing one thing, and delivering it. Because of the auto-travel the world is not interesting and bland. To elaborate, this small area has creature type one, and this type 2. you don't even need to look at your surounding.When I went into the first real dungeon that required a team, it was only one room and had 3 enemies. They weren't that hard to beat. Compare it to other MMO's and it just feels really boring and uninspired. Outside of the dungeons there isn't any room for teamwork either.You level very fast, which just add to the idea that the game is for the lazy. Not even something like a mount is worth anything. You get handed your first mount during the first 10 levels of play, this game does not feel like making the player do something, You just go through the motions.I geuss you get what you pay for, which is in this case: Nothing!

												Man this has to be the best anime MMO i ever played. Its not like tradicional anime MMO were the worlds you visit have an anime themed but it looks more like a normal game , no cartoonish feel. But with this every city i go have... hmm cant describe it.. but it feels like im in an anime series (no joke). About the combat system , i found only one problem and its that since there is no ''power'' or ''mana'' for your skills u can spam like 10 in 5seconds and that for PvP its abit too much. Overhaul if u like anime MMOs u should really play this one.			"

(ノ ゜Д゜)ノ ︵ ︵ ┻━┻ *Gold Spammers are always spamming my mail (ノ ゜Д゜)ノ ︵ ︵ ┻━┻*Website goes down quite a lot and stops players from joining the game (ノ ゜Д゜)ノ ︵ ︵ ┻━┻*Group Questing can become a pain if one player doesn't hit the monster, as it doesn't give credit.*Profanity filter blocks the first part of some words ""♥♥♥♥♥umptions"".*Pets continuously jumping ontop of quest log or screen, no way to move where they appear.*Jumping / Gliding can become an issue depending on the distance you are from server. My case (Australia)  *After around level 49-50 the game becomes a lot more grindy and starts to lack quests. Aura Kingdom is definitely a recommended game by me, as I have quite a lot of hours played so far and plan on playing some more. I'd honestly suggest picking up the limited time AP Spender pack by purchasing a $5 AP Pack and spending even just 9 AP - It gives you some great rewards to get you started!			"

												Anime inspired 3D fantasy MMORPG where you, player, can form pacts with powerful spirits called Eidolons. Pet that helps you out in battle based on what he is supposed to do. World of Azuria is a bright and beautiful. Game that offers plenty of class and skill options. Playable classes with job advancements available at level 40 (Guardian, Duelist, Ravager, Wizard, Sorcerer, Bard, Grenadier, Gunslinger, Brawler, Ranger, Ronin, and Necromancer). Discover the world by completing hidden quests which can be particularly rewarding! Regular quests feature autopathing, but these special hidden quests do not, which makes them more rewarding. First couple days you go through the linear quests and doing what it tells you to do until you get to level 40, thats when most of the PVP, and Party Dungeons begin. Later on 60, you can get access to the Sky Tower. Most of the time in game you spend on grinding dungeons.I think that this game is targeted to casual MMO players, who just love the anime feeling and story.			"

												Yes this is gonna be a lengthy review of how awesome it is. No I will not put a TL;DR thing.I was looking for a free mmorpg to play on Steam...you know something different, and this game exceeded my expectations.Graphics:The graphics are downright gorgeous. They put care into the designing of costumes and the characters expressing emotions. Now I know graphics can't only make the game, but I have to applaud them for the details they put into characters and the buildings. They really captured the anime feel of this game.Customization of Character:There are many customization options to choose from: Gender, Hairstyle, Hair Color, Eye Color, Face Style, and Skin Color. Regret your decision in the future? No problem. They sell a kit to help you change that. There are various costumes out there that you can use to customize what your character wears. You get free ones by completing the main story quest, but the rest you will have to buy with real money or loyalty points(points you earn while playing the game). Basically, your armor does not change the appearance of your character. There are costume slots such as headgear, body, and back.Gameplay:The gameplay is more action style and not slow turned based. The stats are allocated differently. There are three attack stats and three defense stats. The three attack stats are DMG,Crit,and SPD. The three defense ones are HP,DEF,and EVA. Each level later on, you gain one attack and one defense stat. Depending on your class and weapon, you can attack while you're turned around and while running. Did I mention you can glide in the air? Well you can! Did I mention they give you a starting mount? Well you get one! Did I mention EIGHT different classes? I know...*faint*One key feature of the game is the game gives you a companion to use alongside your journey, more like a permanent two-person party. You have the option to summon or dismiss it whenever you like. At least you're not playing alone!Story:Fantasy and anime. The story is awesome so far for fantasy lovers. I could go on, but I think it's for the best to see it yourself.List of things to do:There are a ton of things. Hidden quests, achievements, and more where you can get different titles to boost your stats, or add some character to your character.Economy:Surprisingly with bots out there, the economy maintains its composure to be fair.Customer Service:They may ask you repetitive questions, but overall their service is kind and quick.Overall, this game is the next big thing. This can beat all the free-to-play mmorpgs out there.			"

												I love this game , tough i have 0.3 hours on steam played. Cause i got screwed over i messed up something i linked my main account with another steam account. And im gonna review with this one.If you love Anime that has Action / Fantasy ,  this game is for youWhat i like :- Graphic cause anime :3- Funny played with friends.- Not that easy to complete bosses after level 30-40.- Alot of funny / nice players.- Lots of Side quests.- You can earn some free cash from doing a daily quest even tough some part of quests require for you to add in someruby which u have to pay to get in game to get the bigger reward. You can also do a survey and get in some free Rubys..- Nice that u can have 2 classes at the same time.- Funny and cute events.- Can earn free Eidelons from keys.- Has bountys on monsters.- Fishing is good part of it so u can earn some Platnium / Gold coins.What i don't like :- Gets really hard on 40+ And u must be duo with someone to finish it.- Let's not talk about the Tradeing community. When u go to the main place i forgot what its called there are over 1 million players sitting on blankets and selling items like an actual Black Market. Or a public market.I recommend this game its amazing beautiful has alot of players. I really love this game , had alot of fun with players and my friends. Gotta love the music for some reason. Had some fun with Game Masters they were cool people too.			"

												TL;DR - Game is awesome, has some pretty neat features. Leveling is fast, skills are flashy, players are many, IT'S NOT P2W but you'll probably spend cash anyways since the costumes and mounts are awesome and yeah, read below if you want to find out more.I was a bit skeptical about this game at first since I read some stuff on the forums about it not receiving updates that often, devs being lazy and so on but I gave it a try nevertheless.So far I'm loving it. Even if it's like your usual get that / do that type of MMORPG the art-style, graphics and gameplay are what keep me going with it. At the moment, I'm Lv16 and from what I see there are lots of features unlocking at Lv20 and Lv25. Leveling is fairly easy, as of now I am leveling from like 3 quests which are easy to do, just go collect some things or kill some monsters.The story is somewhat interesting, I don't usually read quest logs and stuff like that but this game made me read them. There are some cliche things here but still, compared to how other MMOs cough up story it's awesome.This game has an interesting guild system as well. After you reach Lv10 you can join guilds by simply pressing G and searching for a guild that fits your liking. You instantly join them, no acceptance required. Now I'm not sure if this applies to every guild but still.Another cool feature that I noticed is the friends system. It has this Intimacy thing which categorizes how close you are to your in-game friends. If you spend a lot of time with them in parties and stuff the Intimacy level goes up.Skills are fancy, classes are awesome, mounts and the most important thing which I should have mentioned in the beginning, this game is not Pay-2-Win at all. At least from what info I managed to scrape so far.As of now that's all I can say about this game, I highly recommend it to anyone that loves MMORPGs and doesn't mind anime-like graphics.I'll update this once I get on a higher level and explore more of the content ! :)EDIT : I am now Lv42 and I just chose my second class since you can get another class at Lv40 and pretty much combine skills and stuff. So far I'm still loving this game, even more than before and I also found myself a nice guild.The dungeons are somewhat fun as well although I was used to dungeons like they were in WoW or CABAL Online but still, fun nevertheless. I also spent some cash on this after I learned about the Paragon Table thing (sort of like a gamble system where you can win costumes and stuff) so yeah.I'll make another edit on this review once I progress even further in the content.

												I was in Aura Kingdom from 1st CBT. And I'm still there. People who will write the game is ""boring"" are the ones that most of the times leaves the game because the boss 1 hit them in dungeons. So let's start with PROS:- Cute to the core ( And by that...I mean it, the official screenshot shows only like 10% of game cuteness)- PANTSU! ( Yes that also goes in pros >:) ALOT of pantsu in this game!)- Huge world with loads of zones and beautiful landscape you never seen in any mmorpg before- Music... soundtracks are pretty into the feeling of the world and dungeons- ALIVE game world ( This is not a game where you will see few players running around and all NPC's are standing in place. Game world is really alive, Npc's are walking around, talking to each others and doing stuff)- Rich playerbase, there are loads of players there in this game. Wherever you are, there will be someone near you most of the times- Really much to do: Main storyline quests (to the lvl 60 atm but they will exceed it soon), loads of sidequests that gives achivements, daily quests, Dungeons you can play Solo, in party or hell mode that is kinda hardcore, after lvl 60 you can register and enter Sky Tower (100 floors? dungeon) on weekends and do Otherworld dungeons in what you can find really rare and expensive gears or items- Eidolons... Pets that will heal you, deal damage and bring you stuff if you link them. There is ALOT of them to collect. Catch them all! :D- Blacksmiting and Alchemy, one word, Crafting- Paragon Table, like lootery with rich prizes- FREE 2 PLAY! And it is! Whoever will tell you game is P2W or P2P is an noob. You can basicaly get ANYTHING for ingame currency or for Loyalty Points. Loyalty points shop is like Item Mall (Item mall is for Cash only), but you get Loyalty points in game while doing sidequests and stuff...- Players can set up Stalls ( It's like players market stuff) and sell their loot that way, or they can deposit items in Auction- Level capacity is 75 and leveling becomes intense after lvl 50 ( I was thinking should i put this on Pros or Cons.. And i decided to put it in pros since when you reach max lvl... Well you should discover yourself why)- Rich character progression, Evony path, stats lvls, masteries and more- For paying players thwere is Tiered spender with rare and most expensive rewards- Guild levels, guilds have their own cities (guild halls) where their guild members can meet up. Guild system is made way better than in other mmo's- Costumes and acessories gives you stats boosts- You can recolor your custom costumes with loads of colors- Nice character customizationSo... thoose are PROS, I might have more of them but I can't remember all of them :D And now onCONS:- Bots... Oh yes~ The game is populated with thoose guys too. But they don't affect so much of your gameplay. Just running around...minding their own- Lag... This one is not much noticable but sometimes, if you're having slow internet you will feel it. It might result in disconnections sometimes and in damage delay that might result death of your char in fights.- PvP is really gear, class and armor and weapon fortification relied. Yes, If you are level 40 or 50 and thinking about going into PvP instances...Forget it. You will die by 1 hit from lvl 60 or higher players who are fully geared and their armors and weapons are fortificated. If you wanna be PvPer here, you will at least need to spend some time getting thoose gears and fortify armor that matches your class.Also there could be more CONS, you might like and dislike something and our oppinions might be different but remember, You are a new player and this is a review of someone who is in the game for a long time :) Long enough that can see why this game is actually 100% worth to play ^^ But make sure you go little over minimum system requirements because game will really test your PC hardcore :)			"

												Okay i've played this game for over 100 hours (In 3 weeks :O)  time for a simple review.First of all, this game has really beautiful graphics i just love the anime style ♪You can have a companion (in this game named eidolon) with you and fight alongside your companion!In the beginning this game is verry easy especially with leveling.But when you reach level 40 this game becomes more challanging, leveling will become harder and you have to choose a secondary class. If you are going PVP and you choose the wrong secondary class you're gonna have a baaaad time ;3If you think: oh i am so weak... i think i located my stats in the wrong way... No worries! you can re-locate them for some in-game money (not money where you need to pay for, but money you earn with quests like gold and silver)Futher! There are lots of dungeons with: solo mode, party mode (up to 5 players) and hell mode.For most dungeons, can you only enter a few times each day.Doing quests is pretty boring (but in what MMO are they actually not)There is a bulletin board where you can accept up to 5 quests each day, it are quests with dungeons! -yaaaaay o(＾∇＾)o -And then there is a Sky tower :O It's a big dungeon with lots of floors (for lvl 60 players) on each floor you'll find lots of monsters and bosses and the best of all: gold gear,costumes, hats and other awesome stuff :3And there is a Arena where you can do quizzes or fight to the death! You can check what time which gamemode will start.It's totally not a pay to win game all of the stuff where you need to pay real money for, are sold by other players for gold, it are almost always costumes, mounts and stuff like that + there are plenty of outfits that you can get without some payment. AND you can earn loyality points and get the costumes & mounts and stuff like that for free :3 you don't even need to pay to get them. paying with real money in this game will only speed things up.Everything in a nutshell (and some other things): It's not p2w, nothing is ugly everything is shaped gorgeous, Leveling is quite easy but overpowering someone is a challenge, the music on the background sounds great (in my opinion), fighting is pretty awesome there are lots of effects, you have a companion to take care of and get new ones on your journey, eidolons spawn random on the world as a boss and you'll need LOTS of ppl to beat it, there are lots of dungeons and hanging around with other ppl is quite fun!I just say try this game and see for yourself, the beginning can be boring but keep playing and you'll see all the great things (and less great things) for yourself! I hope you have a great time playing this game! (✿◠‿◠)  "

												I remember playing this game long ago, at the time like all MMO's Aura was something fresh for me to jump into and offered a different experience other mmorpgs couldn't give off. Aura Kingdom is a game that's simple to learn and grasp, I was able to get into it and learn a lot of things in a manner of minutes! The variety of classes allows a unique gameplay style for everyone, and the secondary weapon you can get later on just makes things even more challenging and fun. The biggest pros in my opinion are:-Variety of classes (more to come!)-Eidolon systems, you don't need to be a summoner class to get an epic companion to fight with you!-Awesome flashy skills-Epic dungeons to explore with friends and intense, challenging fights-Unique story and background, everything has a story-How well the game pulls you in, once you start, you really can't stop playingIn contrast however, the cons in my choice are:-You'll find yourself repeating fetch and kill quests, the occasional special quest with something else to it-Unable to skip boring cutscenes that last awhile-How unfair dueling systems can get, a level 70 can challenge a level 30 to a fight, seriously?-Servers can be unstable time to time-Leveling, becomes ridiculous in higher levels, quests only bump you up like 2%The thing fantastic about Aura, there's always something to do, regardless if gameplay becomes reptative. How you play Aura is up to you, but the biggest things you need to remember:-This is an MMO, if you understand the basics, you'll know long hours and patience go a long way and are needed to enjoy this game-People have the grinding style of leveling, but in Aura that method won't really work, espicially later on, just do your quests, it wont kill youI personally enjoy Aura, if you love MMORPG's and want to find one to kill time, have an awesome adventure with friends, or just flat out looking for something new, this is the game for you. I promise its worth every minute of gameplay.			"

												I'll keep this short. Aura Kingdom is by far one of the best MMORPGs I've played to date. I think my time playing is proof enough. I'll admit, I would make in-game purchases every now and then because I was pretty involved with the game. Then I go inactive for a period of time because of life. I come back to discover that my acoount, which I've spent quite a bit of time on, has been banned due to a TOS violation. As to why, they won't tell me. Keep in mind I'm an avid MMORPG player and most (if not all) consider me the opposite of toxic. So I know for a fact that's not it. I'm starting to lean towards Aeria banning me because I stopped buying their ""optional"" items. When I sent a reply email to them asking if this was the case, I never received a response. Kinda speaks for itself. Moral of the story: Aura Kingdom is an exceptional game; Aeria Games, however, needs some work.			"

												This is a typical MMORPG game, nothing special, but I have taken a liking to it! I've played MMORPG games like Dragon Nest, Maplestory, Vindictus, and a few others. The pros and the cons may alter from person to person depending on their preferences. By the way, people who like anime artwork will definitely like this game! I'm going to point out some pretty specific stuff in this game instead of just going broad or a general view of the game. The Pros:-Very Easy and Casual Gameplay-Cash currency is earnable in game-Progessing in the game is quick-Equipment is easily accessible -Not pay to be the best -Subclass system is great-Friendly society-Great artwork-Skill animations are fancy-A good amount of classes to select from The Cons:-Typical MMORPG -Slow paced battle systemThe cons are definitely something that would change someone's mind about playing this game, but if you ignore those two concepts of the game, you'll get to experience what Aura Kingdom truly has to offer.

												This game is quite good for solo players. For anyone who likes to play with friends move on. The party system is completely pointless. The only benefit of partying is you gain increased experience. Your allies killing something gives you no items or experience unless you were also attacking the same enemy.Being a solo player generally though I give it a recommendation.			"

												Having been playing this game for two weeks almost non-stop, I feel as if I can finally give a good review once the ""OMG, NEW GAME TO PLAY"" hype wore off.First things first, the story is no challenge. If you don't take your time, you can blow through about half the story in a day. This is both good and bad, seeing as how it's fun and easy to get into. Pros:EasyNot too system heavy (In my opinion, I run a rather low-end rig)Emphasizes teamwork, but doesn't shove it down your throatFunEasy to understand and grip the storyLots of classes to choose from, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Melee, ranged, magic, all sorts of goodies.KAWAII AS HELLNice art styleExplorable terrainDiverse (Somewhat) creatures and racesCons:Very little story progression per quest, gets too meticulous, tedious and repetitive.Emphasizes defeating creatures moreso than the actual story. (""Here, take this item, but I need you to collect 12 things that drop 1/4 times from a creature that's evenly matched to you"")The mail system is loaded with spammers, sending offers for sites that allow you to buy gold with real money.Too many bot characters, people who aren't even playing themselves in order to get gold. Easy, no real challengeCentral city LAGS EXCESSIVELY, and is required to pass through several times towards endgame.PVP is unbalanced. It's unlocked at level 20, but you should wait until you're level 65 to actually participate in the arenas.I'm both impressed AND disappointed in this game. I mean, yes, I have fun and will continue to play. I've come to rely on the guild system to have more fun than just the story alone. So if you're going to play, join a friendly guild, and spill your tails of anguish, raids, and loot.			"

												Great game that is for sure anyways I guess I'm gonna make a list, mane.--PROS--▲Great Visuals▲Great controls▲Great Cooldown, which allows for great PvE battle▲Plenty of quests to keep you occupied▲Great for anyone that likes anime or RPG. This game is kind of like GW.▲Good storyline (In my opinion)▲Balanced levelling syustem, which does not require much grinding if you do the right quests at the right times▲Guilds n' stuffs▲Can't really get too OP at start of game, which makes it fun.▲Awesome Cutscenes (very few so allows for more gameplay)--CONS--▲Controls can get glitchy if ypou do multiple things at once, such as going into chat and moving at the same time▲Lots of quests are go fetch! But still there are plenty worthy adventure quests to do that▲Takes SO MUCH TIME on FIRST LOAD, other than that it's fine.▲Never press the full scan button.▲Going on a different server can cause your character to not be on that server. Play on the server that you created your character on (if you made it on hydra, play on hydra)▲Alot of trade spammers. I would recommend turning trade off in general. Keep trade channel for trade only.I guess that's my review of this great game. If the developers read this, good job guys! I recommend this game for anyone who likes RPG and anime pretty much. "

												GOAT game. I played for one hour as ""LoliPrincess"", a very powerful pre-teen wizard. So far, the gameplay mechanics are awesome :Click on quest and the character goes directly to the quest, you don't even need to look for it !And the path finding is really good. You can use your chocobo ersatz to go even faster !Next thing to do is read the dialogue (get a life).Then kill 5 tanukis, because they do noise and the city people get annoyed (It's a bit extreme but hey, who cares)The fighting mechanics are some of the best i've seen : Mash the keys like a potato puree, and destroy thembad mofos. Mash it good. You can also use your cool combo thing that oneshot everybody.So, once you've done with fighting, report to the guy who gave you the quest, get your reward (some boots -you already have those, don't worry about it-) and get another quest.One other thing that i've found pretty good whilst playing, is the co-op gameplay. Brace yourself for some amazing multiplayer interaction : You can invite a friend to your party, and race the quest, to see who's the fastest at farming bunnyhops and collecting some bloke's crates on the ground.Did I mention that the graphisms were kawaii ? Man they are kawaii.In conclusion, you will probably want to play this game. It's the best in category (kawaii korean farming mmo).I'm totally hooked.			"

												DO NOT EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS GAME. IT IS SUCH A SCAM.I downloaded it a long time ago and i thought the art style was really cute, but i was on a laptop that didn't like it. so i had to uninstall it and didn't log in for a very long time. now i'm on a gaming computer, go to download it again, i have no idea what my secondary password is.to change or reitrieve that secondary password, you apparently have to send a support ticket. not only have a lot of people said the support has been inactive for months and nobody has been recieving replies, when you fill out a form it asks for your last purchase, transaction id, and method of purchase. this is a required field whetjher you've made any purchases or not, so if you haven't YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO SUBMIT A SUPPORT TICKET. THEY WILL ONLY HELP YOU IF YOU'VE GIVEN THEM MONEY. it uses your steam id to sign you on and once you use one email, you can't change those details! creating a new account will not work, you have to create a whole new steam account just to play this stupid game that has NO CUSTOMIZATION WHATSOEVER UNLESS YOU PAY THEM. i can't even ♥♥♥♥ing believe this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. go find something else, there has to be a better anime style mmo out there.

												This is my first time playing the game even though i heard about it before but I am glad it's on steam! If you are an Anime Freak like me, this game is absolutely for you! I just downloaded it and played 9 straight hours ! that's how addicting the game is! I got my character up 37 in one day so the leveling is really fast (of course if you keep doing the main quests). Aura Kingdom gives the atmosphere that you are inside the world. So first up you have the basic class choosing, customization, and tutorial. I am here to convince few people by telling my pros and cons i had so far from the game! HERE IT GOES! Pros: run smoothly even if you have a low graphics card (depends on your internet connection) lowest setting still looks greatmany classes to choose from and later in the game you can choose another class (lvl 40) it's not really p2w or pvp MMO The Music is soothing All classes are balancedYou get your own partner that will help you throughout the game that you can talk to! ( Like Digimon some sort of) Crowded Servers Very exciting Dungeons Not really a toxic player game Story is pretty good for a MMO Costumes are free by doing the main quests ( You get many costumes) Sharing monster kills for quests ( normally you have to kill your own target but not in this MMO) Automatic Healing potions usage at % health (you can turn it on or off and set it up at what % health you want to use it, IT'S VERY UNIQUE imo) IT'S TOTALLY F2P !!!! Unless you like to support the developers by buying at their Shop Mall Neg: The same quests as go talk to him than him or kill this, pick up this etc ... Pvp is restricted until later the game ( I Think) Crowded server might crash your game ( Not for mine) low internet connection is not recommended ( 25 mbps is recommended by me) Social or chat is mehh, couldn't figure out how to make a new tab to make like a guild chat only, party chat only etc ... ( I couldn't find how) Females are mostly males ( i have nothing wrong with it, but in an Anime MMORPG is creepy) everyone can have the same helpers (it bothers me, they at least could put some customization to our helper) Limited Bag Space that becomes annoying to clean up Overall i would give it 8/10! Since the neg are mostly on the small issues than the gameplay. THIS IS MY ANALYSIS! I play Age of Wushu(Only PVP)  therefore it makes Aura KIngdom so unique for me. Play with your friends or cooperate with a stranger rather killing him in public. It's more of the Piece full games! Sorry for the grammar but i wanted to help people by deciding to start or not! And give them general idea of the game! Well i hope my review helped some of you out there!  "

												I played this game in Open Beta.Steam account connected very easily to Aeria account. No issues at all.To my surprise when the game is loaded i see my old server and my previously used char. It was all there. Awesome... No need to make all the questing from the beginning. :DDon't see many differences from Open Beta. Even the good old bugs are there.Hooo... good times.>>> Now lets talk for real.This game is not for the hardcore players like i used to be in WoW times.This is a very easy and very casual game. If you want more than the casual questing, casual dungeon and casual PvP then go look somewhere else. This is not for you.If you are looking for a polished anime style gameplay. This is the game.The anime style graphics are very well done, the skills are gorgeous and you even have a pet/companion to help you.Do not compare this game to Dragon Nest. Totally different graphics styles and gameplay. Never compared an Action MMORPG to a regular MMORPG.If you like both games, install both and play both. They are both F2P.Yes, the game have bugs but they are minor and the big ones don't even interfere with the gameplay.PROS:- Free to Play.- Anime style- Customizable UI- Very easy gameplay- Polished gameplay- Beautifull graphics and animationsNEUTRAL:- Nothing new. Thats normal, anything really new in MMORPG's since WoW or Everquest.- Casual game, for casual players. The game was made like that. Don't like it, play something else.- Music. I don't really pay attention to Music and if i use TeamSpeak I even turn it off.- SoundFX. Polished sound effects.CONS:- No Mana, only cooldown system- Some bugs- Repetitive quests and dungeonsOverall, I like the game and will keep installed for when i want to play a easy, relaxing gorgeous anime style game.>>> Currently installed games for casual playing:- Team Fortress 2- Aura Kingdom			"

NEVER HAPPEN IN ANY OTHER GAME! so for u guys that wan to playing back after inactivity, no chance, they delete ur character.

												You need gold to pretty much do anything in this game if you want to succeed. Getting gold is the problem though since lvl 80 drops are way too rare and the only other way without spending money is to play the paragon table with ruby coins that you can get once a week with loyalty points. There are other ways that can get you gold basically instantly which is by purchasing ap (this requires real money) and selling ruby coins in the auction and getting the tiered spender items that would be worth the most gold. Some players are just lucky and know people who are rich in-game and get gold from them.The game is not pay to win but if you do pay you get things 100 times faster than you would without spendingOverall the game is pretty good though			"

												Glad this is finally on Steam. It really is a fun MMO, love the classes in this game and the general idea of Eidolons. Isn't overly as difficult as other MMOs I've played, but it still is pretty fun, especially the higher level you are. If you're looking for a more simple yet fun MMO with action, I suggest you play Aura Kingdom. :DAdd me if you want, on Hydra server and IGN is Varshmat. c:			"

												Good game, one of the truly Free to play MMO's out there. The overall design reminds me of IRIS onlinbe which I absolutely loved. The eidolons are a neat Idea, and so is chaining two classes together. It is kind of an ARPG in that you shoul dodge and jump out of AOEs but not really, as you can only jump or run out of the way. There is a lot to do every day, so it is diffcult to get bored.The downsides to this game though is that and this is my biggest one, is that every class, EVERY class is OP, especially if you get dual blades, or shield and sword then you break the game. Which this kind of takes a good chunk of fun out of it, when you can solo field bosses with zero difficulty. I reccomend it but if your looking for something more challenging, youll get bored quick.			"

It feels like WoW gameplay, with tons of gear/crafting progress, vanity items, mounts, pets, combat pets, gliding, housing system and lot of PvE and PvP content. F2P model looks decent enough and if you do spend a little money on the game, you will get lots of extra rewards for it :)IMO it's well worth checking out.			"

												Aura Kingdom is magical, a gem for RPG/MMORPG player who seek a good storyline, flawless gameplay and design. Because it's a server-based, you could found new things everyday, but also gives you a gameing problem sometimes.Anyway, this game tends to be more casual than hardcore, which don't serve hardcore gamers well enough, though, me, a  hardcore RPG dude, have a good time playing Aura Kingdom.8.5/10 (Buff for the anime style lover, the score can be-9.5/10!)

												i was really hyped about this game before it came out. but the trailers are bullsh*t because there is no combat what so ever. most of the monsters you fight are just reskins of each other. the fighting michanics are bland and the skill tree dont mean anything. theres no point of it being and online game because you cant even interact with  people in your party. you cant do dungeons or even quest. you just have your friends name on the screen. the story is nothing to go home about and the characters are so unlikable that id rather make friends with hitler. the quests are boring and half of the time exactly the same. character costomization is also poor but not as bad as other games. over all i dont recomend this game because its boring, has no story, and no good online interatcions.

												Aura Kingdom is a Korean MMORPG with anime-style graphics. It's set in Terra, a land between the titular heavenly Aura Kingdom populated by powerful Eidolons (How can I not think Final Fantasy?) and Hell, the place of demons. The player becomes one of the Envoys of Gaia, chosen ones by the Cube of Gaia, who can enlist the help of Eidolons for their own benefit. However, as it becomes apparent very quickly, this power can corrupt and turn an Envoy into a monster, so you and your Eidolon set out on a quest to sever the link between you and the Cube.You get to choose from 12 different ""weapons"" (classes - 5 melee, 3 ranged and 4 magic), each one possessing different stats and skills. However, all classes can use every piece of equipment except for their weapon. As you level up, you can customize your character via allocating points into stats, Masteries which give you either passive effects or power-up your combat skills, and Envoy's Path system where you can move through a ""tree"" to unlock passive and active skills, as well as late-game combo skills.As far as story goes, it's nothing really interesting. The dialogues are okay, but this is an MMORPG, so the story is usually weak in those.The graphics are to be honest quite beautiful. The location design is rich and it's basically eye candy. Of course, it all depends on whether or not you like the anime style, so if you someone doesn't like them then he's not going to really enjoy it.The music and sound effects are okay, however outside of the main city of Navea and the starter city of Port Skandia, no other music can be considered memorable.The combat is, at least at its core, interesting. You get a wide variety of skills and abilities to choose from during a fight, with different cooldown periods for each. Your chosen Eidolon also helps you in a fight by using his own skills. However, this is where it gets kinda bad. Since there is no MP system, you can basically just assault a mob with a wave of skills after skills, killing them before they can pose any bigger threat. This makes fighting any monster that isn't a boss a cakewalk. It's way too easy. Even bosses aren't much of a challenge, while they can hit you quite strong, especially if you don't take your time to move away from their powerful but telegraphed attacks, but they are basically damage sponges to be mowed down with your skills. It doesn't help that you also get a fairly powerful combo attack with your Eidolon which makes you invincible at the same time.The quests are - for the most part - boring. It's either ""kill X monsters"", ""get Twenty Bear Asses"" or ""collect a few items lying on the ground"", with added ""kill instance boss"" from time to time to keep things less stale. Even daily quests are visibly lazily done - you get a huge health boost to survive the incoming challenges, causing it to be completely effortless when it comes to actual challenge. It's just a way for you to earn a bit more exp by doing more busywork.This has got to be the fastest-progressing MMORPG I have ever played. You can very easily reach level 40 in just 15-20 hours, not even attempting to speedrun the game. While it does allow you to move quickly without things getting too boring, it's also kind of effortless.After reaching level 40, you can choose a secondary weapon (sub-class). While you are free to choose any of the other 11 weapons, you get to choose between maybe three if you want to be actually practical and be able to gain combo skills from Envoy's Path which are usually high-cooldown nukes that combine the power of both of your chosen weapons. You will also begin to gain the basic skills from chosen sub-class after level 40, but they will have triple the normal cooldown on them. Makes sense, considering you won't be as proficient with it as with your main weapon.However, here problems start to arise. After level 40 the level-up speed drops down quite drastically, so you'll have to spend quite a bit of time grinding the subsequent levels. It also doesn't help that your visible character progression basically stops after level 55, where your sub-class gains their ultimate skill (unless you're being late with Envoy's Path's combo skills), and after that all the grinding has only the purpose of increasing your stats and giving you additional Envoy's Path points to spend. The current level cap is 80 - that's 25 levels worth of pure stat grinding. Boring.I also have to mention one additional fact: the game as of now has a lot of bots, mostly Grenadiers, with random names, who grind the levels, then sit in towns and send phishing links to everyone who passes by. It's annoying, but also kind of amusing to see five identical-looking Grenadiers with gibberish names killing monsters in one area, tho.There is also an annoying glitch that sometimes disables your ability to do anything besides moving, which forces you to reset the game and go through the whole login process again. It's annoying and usually happens when using items. Also, the whole game quits if you lose your connection. Great.Overall, despite this game's cheerful atmosphere and cutesy graphics, I can't recommend it to anyone except maybe casual gamers who like to pop in and chill out for a few hours once a week or so. Others will quickly get bored out of their minds.			"

												Aura Kingdom review:PLATFORMWindowsDEVELOPERX-Legend EntertainmentSYNOPSISAura Kingdom is a new MMORPG that features detailed anime art style graphics to depict a sprawling fantasy world for players to journey through. In the game players are going to be accompanied by faithful interactive companions able to evolve and give support in battle.In Aura Kingdom players can choose between eight classes, fight with a dynamic action combat system, and customize their their haracters with elaborate skill trees.MAIN FEATURES    Detailed and Rich fantasy world    Stunning anime styled graphics    Huge selection of interactive companions    Unprecedented mobility    Dynamic and fast-paced action combat    Lots of customisation options regarding abilities and weapons    Completely free-to-playA VIBRANT WORLDAura Kingdom features a vast and vibrant fantasy world illustrated in highly detailed anime styled graphics. Players will trek across beautiful landscapes and charming towns, meeting its inhabitants while exploring mysterious dungeons and climbing massive towers.CLASSES & WEAPONSThe game presents rather than a usual class system, a system based on the weapon players may use, resulting in eight classes to choose from, but along the way they are able to select a secondary weapon normally wielded by one of the remaining classes. Each weapon provides unique skills that are unlocked automatically step by step upon reaching higher levels. With every new level, players are also able to put points into a passive skill tree that differs between classes.Currently available are the following weapons: axe, dual daggers, sword & shield, staff, harp, grimoire, dual pistols and cannon.COMPANIONSIn Aura Kingdom players are accompanied by companions which are far more than simple pets and an integral part of the game experience. These companions grow more formidable over the course of the game and gain powerful combat abilities-including joining with the player to initiate spectacular combo attacks.In addition these companions will remember your actions ingame, frequently conversing with the player about their past exploits and battles.COMBAT & MOBILITYIn the game players are going to have unprecedented mobility both in combat and out, offering unique movement techniques to traverse the terrain. Players may utilise double-jumps to scale heights and glide forward through the air at high speed to cover ground faster than they ever thought possible. Even for low level players, it’s already possible to climb on the back of an extensive array of mounts.This mobility allows for fast-paced and fluid battles. Position and quick thinking will enable them to dodge enemy attacks and stay on their feet. They can call in their companion to join them, granting access to powerful new abilities and spectacular combo attacks.CUSTOMISATIONIn Aura Kingdom the customisation is not limited to hair styles, costumes and accessories, but also allows adapting characters regarding their abilities and weapons. Players can choose which of their many abilities to power up to suit their play style, and change them around quickly and freely. They are encouraged to experiment with different setups often, as the right approach can mean the difference between victory and defeat.Aura Kingdom does not present the common stats, but attack and defence points instead. Attacks points can be used to improve the character’s attack to inflict a larger amount of damage, the chance to land a critical hit, and the attack speed. Defence points can be employed to increase health, health regeneration and the chance to avoid an attack, as well as to reduce the amount of damage received. "

												Why in every MMO you become a lab rat to drinking unstable potions. Is this what heroes do nowadays? put their life on the line to try out a potion instead of putting their lives on the line to protect innocent? no wonder dark forces are destroying the land, most the hero population are off killing themselves from unstable potions.""I ain't got time for demon lords! I got potions to drink and livers to destroy!""+ I must say I do like the art style of the game is quite lovely though.+ This does have a large variety of classes to choose from including a scythe class, I love scythes, I even get a companion around level 10.+ I enjoy the companion idea that you get to choose at the beginning of the game and her/his interface, she/he always greets you and says that she got lonely when you were offline, that kind of stuff does make me feel kinda warm inside and I do love the idea of putting a more indepth characteristic into your partner.= The storyline seems like it could be kind of good but it's hard to pay attention to it over the simple text dialogue, voice acting and such is always a good idea if you want to draw in a more indepth atmosphere. It could also do without it choosing what emotion your hero is going under, like crying at times and such, it's best to leave that kind of stuff out because it should be up to the players imagination to know what emotion your character should be going through.- Interface covering 70% of the screen annoys me but oh well.- This game includes the overly used quests in every other mmo, quite off putting, I need to see something new, spice it up a little.- I hate the fact that it has auto pathing for the quests, oh how original and unefforting, just click the text and the game plays itself, screw effort. - I also dislike that the gear you put on doesn't show up on you character it's all costume based.overall is this game good?there are both likes and dislikes about this game and some of the good points really do stand out... I just like having a companion XD, but the unoriginality and costume base weighs the game down alot and really prevents me from playing knowing the progress I make won't make me all the unique from any other player. I don't have much motivation in advancing further in the game and with that said I would give this game:4.5/10			"

												The game is very simple. Even the hidden quests have markers on the minimap with clues on the items you recieve. The only hidden thing is the conversations you can overhear, getting all of them in an area grants a bonus.I played 10 hours before I got stuck on a bug. I assume a relog would fix it but I quit the game instead at level 28. The game is simply too easy. I once dropped below 30 % in 10 hours. I used a total of 2 health potions.There was one forced group battle at level 20, nobody in our group dropped below 70% hp.Besides that it is a fun game with gliding fast over the terrain between quest and monster. Often able to glide up a cliff to report a quest within 20 s of it being done. It progresses fast and teaches you mechanics and systems as you go along if you do all the quests in the area. The equipment gets upgraded as well, with some sets needing to defeat instances multiple times for drops (longest time to complete one was 2 min for me).The biggest upside in the controls for this game is that you can click on the minimap and the character will go there. You can even click on characters to go up to them or enemies. Playing SW mmo you realise quickly how big this improvement is.			"

												Best game pay to win ever. I just came back 3/4 days ago and now i saw a event i think: *Redeem code for Welcome back.* I never got the code and i just downloaded this Aura kingdom from steam for the dlc winter pack and to get the title of ""Aura kingdom"" in steam. So, just check. This game has a event and is not f2p. it just buy to get it. That is the event. so now. Every sh*t so super expansive into the game. in-game I don't know how to get gold and the story is great but ends at lv60. The game updated to lv80 and experience rate sucks. I have almost 9 month with lv60 and now i do not know how the hell get more exp / gold without buy AP I pass more than 6 hours only fishing, I don't have a loooot of gold cuz the rate sux a lot. I'm starting to hate this game. I'm just killing time and waiting for Blade & Soul European/North American that come in this Fall.  I hate Aeria in general, that company sucks♥♥♥♥♥♥  "

												Well, after playing this game for less than two hours the server connection was interrupted and me being knocked off, I really did not enjoy this game.It might be okay for kids, but not for all ages, and really only for those who enjoy clicking through endless dialogue boxes, monotonously accepting and completing quests on command, having your hand held through most of the beginning of the game. You're already shown where to go for the quest by flowing a sparking trail, then you the ability to click on the quest and you can go there hands free, Not only that ut the entire time the onlly music I heard was ""epic"" battle music, especially when I was talking to non-threatening npcs in a village. I felt my brain cells withering. Oh, and if you hate pop-ups, be prepared for a whole crap load of them, such as the dialogue boxes. My experience: pop-up dialogue boxes,hitting continue, accepting quest and completing quest.NOTE: This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.			"

												Amazing game. Great combat, beautiful graphics, pretty good character creation system and an overall fun game to play. My main problem with this game is the lack of customization in terms of armor. I like MMOs that change your character when you equip armor. In this game you need costumes to change the look of your character (You can get costumes by comepleting a certain quest). There are also no barber or costume / clothing stores in the game sadly but other than that. I can't name any other quality about the game I don't like			"

												Honestly, this is one of the few Anime RPGs that is actually good that doesn't make you pay a cent.Pros :-Addictive gameplay-Beautiful and colourful world-Some awesome fighting animations-Lovely music-It's 100% free.Neutrals : -It's quite easy to level up.Cons : (THESE DO NOT MAKE IT A BAD GAME, I STILL LOVE IT)-Physics are very strange, as in invisible barriers sometimes, glitchy stair-walking, and some other things like phasing through rocks/tree trunks.-Players in the chat rarely try to roleplay (at least in my servers...), and usually just spam it with trade things.-You can't transfer a player to another server, but it's easy to level up so whatever.Overall, I found this game amazing. If you enjoy Anime and MMO RPGs, then you'll love this.9.6/10			"

												The game constantly crashes whilst being run through steam. It has severely crippling resolution issues as well. The gameplay is fun and casual, but the content is lacking late game. It is difficult to find those to play with during later stages and many fear the game is dead. If I could actually play without crashing, it would be great.			"

												This is an Anime style MMORPG. The world you play in is named Azuria, the best work of a deity called Gaia. Somewhere beyond the sky, you find Aura Kingdom. A realm of light and spirit. Beneath is Pandemonium, a hellish place filled with undead and destruction. You find yourself on Terra, where these two realms clash. Terra is a place of wonders guided by Gaia's cubes, conveniently named Cube of Gaia, the mortal's link to the creative force of the universe. Allowing the creative humans, the powerful and pride Makar, ... to use magic, grand them wisdom or power.The story of the game is (no spoilers) you start with the obligatory, short tutorial. After you've finished it, you wake up in a small town named Port Skandia, memoryless of your past or was the tutorial a glimps of the future, can you change it? During the game powers of good and evil clash and you find yourself in the middle of it. Your duty is, not to choose sides, but to safeguard the people, flora and fauna of Terra.The game itself is very noob friendly, the main story line exists out of an enormous series of quests, which you will basically follow to level up in a very fast fashion. As in every other MMORPG, there are dungeons, which the main quest line will teach you the basics about. You can also do side quests, which wont give you that much experience, but instead will provide you with supplies or titles to improve your gameplay. The early game, you'll be probably leveling solo, getting used to the more advanced mechanics, the numorous classes and finding friends. Which isn't hard because of the open guild system where everyone can freely join a guild.The game has a pet system where the pets, called Eidolons, are an extension of yourself. They aid you in battle, grand you passive stats and some can even buff and/or heal you. You get your first Eidolon on account creation and you get two more while doing the quest lines. The other ones you'll have to collect key fragments for to craft their summoning keys.In general, the game is very fun to play, it looks gorgeous and will never get boring as there is so much content to explore. I have literally played the game for hundreds of hours before linking it to Steam and I still love playing it because the community and the world are still growing and more content gets added every few months. I suggest finding the class best suited for you and referring to the guides found on the aura kingdom forums (link below)For more information about classes, eidolons or the game itself, please refer to following websites:http://aurakingdom.aeriagames.com/                                       (main website)http://www.portskandia.com/                                                    (item & eidolon database, tools such as dungeon timers, ...)http://www.aeriagames.com/forums/en/index.php?f=2110    (class information & guides)			"

												If you like mmos, you'll probably like this one even better! In a normal mmo, you only have to randomly press buttons and the game plays itself. In this one, you don't even have to explore because pressing the quest makes your char go there on his own, so you need even less brain power to play! Epic.			"

												This game is the kind that makes you want to sit down and play through it, with it's amazing anime style graphics and characters, it's infinite side quests, the attractive storyline, and the companionship between you and your Eidelon. The PvP is a great way to make friends in friendly competition, and hone your battle skills against other real people like yourself. Don't think your character looks good enough? During the game you will find and revieve many different Avatars to put on top of your Equipment, and if that isn't enough then you can always go to the Item Mall and purchase something of your own interest. Overall, this is a fantastic game. I've recomended it to all of my friends, and so should you. I'm always looking for people to play with, so if you'd like then shoot me a friend request here on Steam and I'll see what I can do. Hope this review helped ^^			"

												Having been a avid player of ""World of Warcraft"", I eventually got tired of having to pay a subscription to play a game, so I quit. Upon quitting, I looked up and down for free mmo's that would keep my attention. Some fell flat, some were pay to win, some were just not able to run on my computer. Then I found this game. At first, I shrugged it off, and kept looking for something different. I'm a big fan of anime style art, so I kept this open as sort of a ""last resort"" if you will. After searching and searching, I took one last look at this game, my finger resting on the X (close) button. I decided to google some game play and character design. After looking through that, I thought to myself ""You know what.. this seems like a game that I'd pass up just because it doesn't look like something my fiance' and I can play together, but I'm going to give it a shot, merely based on the fact that it IS something that I probably wouldn't think to try or download.""So, I went ahead and downloaded it and got to the character customization screen. I panicked because loading INTO the CAC screen, I was lagging hard core. I started to lose hope. I looked through the (limited) but cute customizations for your character, eventually found one that I liked and joined the world. Fortunately, the lag was no more, yay!! That would have been the kicker if it lagged during game play.  I played the introduction scenario and was hooked after that. The big test was...would my fiance like it?The answer was yes! He really enjoys it. He was a bit hesitent at first, but after playing he really enjoyed the art style, the vivid, bright colors of the game, and he REALLY enjoyed the fact that the armor didn't look like your typical, boring earth tone peasant armor that most mmo games give you as a ""noob"". There are a lot of features I could name off that are really cool, and a couple of things I don't really care for but I'll just name a few as to not make this longer than it already is, so here it goes!PROS:  Great art style, enjoyable fighting style, pretty spells (especially the bard with her rainbow magic powers!!), the random ""hidden quests"" you can find through out the land, recieving really pretty costumes instead of having to decide ""do I want to look stupid, or spend money on overpriced costumes?"" (That is also an option though, if you're interested in that kind of thing!)  Character designs are adorable as heck, and the ability to have a shared slot in your bank is GREAT!  Also, getting bags from quest is a nice feature. There are a lot of different classes to choose from as well which is great because I tend to get picky on classes. I believe there are 11 classes to choose from thus far, with another one on the way. You're pretty much bound to find a class you enjoy playing! CONS: BOTS! Ugh!! I really hope the bots die down, but they're everywhere! Since the game has an ""auto run to quest"" feature (which is great when you are on the phone or need to get up and do something :P) bots use that to their fullest potential and run around leveling up so they can make it to the first big city to spam you with mail for cheap gold. It's very unfortunate, but luckily the bots don't hinder the grinding because the enemies spawn back fairly fast.  Aside from the bots, I'd have to say I'd LOVE the feature to turn on and off the ""spell description"" where you hover over your spells and it pops up a huuugeeee box saying what the spell does. It's possible that this feature does in fact exist, and I just overlooked it during the 10 minutes that I searched for it, but if it does exist then it's called something else and I overlooked it. I am used to being what most people would call ""a clicker"" so the boxes covering my entire screen were kind of an eye sore. I don't click anymore in this game, but I kind of feel bad for people who do click because then it covers their character's while they fight and really takes away from the awesomeness of the epic monster battles.I'd have to say that I'd give this game at LEAST a 7/10. It's really, really fun and I enjoy the heck out of it, but it could definitely do without those bots.  I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys mmos, and anime art.  That, and some of the purchasable costumes are soooooooooooo cuuuuuttteeeee!!!! <3 <3 <3 I don't normally do this, but when I get some extra cash on hand I definitely want to buy a pair of glasses for my adorable bard! Keep up the great work with this game, Aura Kingdom devs. I appreciate the fun this game brings to my fiance and I :)			"

												This game is one of my favorites. I fell in love all over again when I first started to play. 2-3 months later I have a in-game tech issue and the GM only told me to redo the steps I've already taken prior to contacting them. All I got in reaspons from all the GMs online was ""You should stop playing the game..."" Really. Since all these high level players are so greedy and the GMs are of barely no help... this game is not worth it but it is. Even though I think about quitting. I can't bring myself to do so. This game is one of a kind heart stealer. I can't give it up now. At least not until Private server files are released. The let those greedy high level players have their stupid original server. Look into the aurakingdom.to private server. I bet it's much better then the mains. I've only been to their page a few times but since I don't want to ditch my characters I've worked so hard to build I havn't looked into it futhur. If you do check the AK.to p-server then come back an tell people what you experienced compared to the mains. I'd like to see what other think.			"

												I give the game a 9-10 olny reason to me that it is not a 10 is because that once you get 40+ its starts to get really slow beside that the game is amazing great beautiful graphics -if you love anime perfect game for you -good if your tired of maple story-it has a high player base -everyone for the most part is friendly -has Dugens which you can solo or do with a party of friends -they put a lot of detial into the enviorment  and into the monster that you face(postives) The bad parts of the game -it can get a little reptive -you go from A to B checkpiont -the dugens are the same thing just placed with differnt monster and bosses -the game might lack to keep you going once you are over 40-it is a point and attack game if you dont like thoses typs of games i recomend you do not play this (negatives)Beside all of that this a game worth trying to me i love it and i have not been dissapointed so far it is amazing game			"

												This game is beautiful, it's got great anime style graphics and an amazing set of armour and clothing choices.10/10 for graphics. 8/10 for game optimization5/10 for difficultyand 10/10 for gameplay.This game in a whole is worth playing, it's fun in short. It's a /Extremely/ easy game for all to play. I played it for 11 hours and got from level 1 - level 42, I had a create time conversing with the commuinity of the game and fighting my way through the typical sort of mmo questing sysetem. The dungeons are probably the best bit of this game, especially the bits of seen for hell-mode. The dungeons are insane, so much colours and things going on at once you really feel like you're controlling some sort of really OP anime character.Pro's--F2P and a very good F2P model at that.-Beautiful world to explore. -A great anime style; probably the best yet.-Fun gameplay.-A lot of the quests are completely opptional it won't /make/ you pay for anything to get along in the game.-Easy, this could be good or bad depending on your opinion.Con's-This is going to be the biggest thing I'm going to raise, because it's what made me stop playing.-The AP store, the place where you use real money to buy in game things, not important things that give you an advantage over anyone else, just mounts, costumes, random things...AND THE F**KING SUBCLASS CHANGE. That's right, being a ""Noob"" to this game I had know idea that you're supposed to take a certain subclass taht went well with the first class you had, it would be fine if this change costed in game currency or a small amount of loyalty points. BUT NO. it costs !!!£20!!!For something that small but still something so drastic and needed for the gameplay, for this single thing the developers get!0/10! EA STATUS.-The game is your typical mmo. Kill 9 of these, then hand in the quest. It's normally okay though since it's masked by the beautiful gameplay.-The music was♥♥♥♥♥♥ sorry people but yes. The same soundtrack...Over  & over...Just...ugh.-PvP is completely one sided, it's no wonder barley anyone does it, Gunslingers rule the battlefield.-Not much end game content. The extent of what you do is farm to get the best mounts and costumes.In short, this game is great. Just be careful of the choices you make sometimes...Because the developers are gonna make you pay big.This game get's 7/10			"

												I love this game. Although at around level 40 the game starts to make you grind for exp. Lots of ""Kill this"" quests, and ""Collect this"" quests. Killing monsters doesnt give enough exp, as around level 40 the only reliable source of exp is doing quests. Let me tell you, there arent many quests in the higher levels. I have a level 49 character and I still enjoy the game, as PVP gets quite intense sometimes :P. Pets or ""Eidolons"" as they are called in this game, are quite unique, and are a key part of the game's story. Overall, if you're looking for a game to kill time, chat with the very welcoming community, and look awesome, this is the game for you.			"

												This game is the kind that makes you want to sit down and play through it, with it's amazing anime style graphics and characters, it's infinite side quests, the attractive storyline, and the companionship between you and your Eidelon. The PvP is a great way to make friends in friendly competition, and hone your battle skills against other real people like yourself. Don't think your character looks good enough? During the game you will find and revieve many different Avatars to put on top of your Equipment, and if that isn't enough then you can always go to the Item Mall and purchase something of your own interest. Overall, this is a fantastic game. I've recomended it to all of my friends, and so should you. I'm always looking for people to play with, so if you'd like then shoot me a friend request here on Steam and I'll see what I can do. Hope this review helped ^^			"

												Having been a avid player of ""World of Warcraft"", I eventually got tired of having to pay a subscription to play a game, so I quit. Upon quitting, I looked up and down for free mmo's that would keep my attention. Some fell flat, some were pay to win, some were just not able to run on my computer. Then I found this game. At first, I shrugged it off, and kept looking for something different. I'm a big fan of anime style art, so I kept this open as sort of a ""last resort"" if you will. After searching and searching, I took one last look at this game, my finger resting on the X (close) button. I decided to google some game play and character design. After looking through that, I thought to myself ""You know what.. this seems like a game that I'd pass up just because it doesn't look like something my fiance' and I can play together, but I'm going to give it a shot, merely based on the fact that it IS something that I probably wouldn't think to try or download.""So, I went ahead and downloaded it and got to the character customization screen. I panicked because loading INTO the CAC screen, I was lagging hard core. I started to lose hope. I looked through the (limited) but cute customizations for your character, eventually found one that I liked and joined the world. Fortunately, the lag was no more, yay!! That would have been the kicker if it lagged during game play.  I played the introduction scenario and was hooked after that. The big test was...would my fiance like it?The answer was yes! He really enjoys it. He was a bit hesitent at first, but after playing he really enjoyed the art style, the vivid, bright colors of the game, and he REALLY enjoyed the fact that the armor didn't look like your typical, boring earth tone peasant armor that most mmo games give you as a ""noob"". There are a lot of features I could name off that are really cool, and a couple of things I don't really care for but I'll just name a few as to not make this longer than it already is, so here it goes!PROS:  Great art style, enjoyable fighting style, pretty spells (especially the bard with her rainbow magic powers!!), the random ""hidden quests"" you can find through out the land, recieving really pretty costumes instead of having to decide ""do I want to look stupid, or spend money on overpriced costumes?"" (That is also an option though, if you're interested in that kind of thing!)  Character designs are adorable as heck, and the ability to have a shared slot in your bank is GREAT!  Also, getting bags from quest is a nice feature. There are a lot of different classes to choose from as well which is great because I tend to get picky on classes. I believe there are 11 classes to choose from thus far, with another one on the way. You're pretty much bound to find a class you enjoy playing! CONS: BOTS! Ugh!! I really hope the bots die down, but they're everywhere! Since the game has an ""auto run to quest"" feature (which is great when you are on the phone or need to get up and do something :P) bots use that to their fullest potential and run around leveling up so they can make it to the first big city to spam you with mail for cheap gold. It's very unfortunate, but luckily the bots don't hinder the grinding because the enemies spawn back fairly fast.  Aside from the bots, I'd have to say I'd LOVE the feature to turn on and off the ""spell description"" where you hover over your spells and it pops up a huuugeeee box saying what the spell does. It's possible that this feature does in fact exist, and I just overlooked it during the 10 minutes that I searched for it, but if it does exist then it's called something else and I overlooked it. I am used to being what most people would call ""a clicker"" so the boxes covering my entire screen were kind of an eye sore. I don't click anymore in this game, but I kind of feel bad for people who do click because then it covers their character's while they fight and really takes away from the awesomeness of the epic monster battles.I'd have to say that I'd give this game at LEAST a 7/10. It's really, really fun and I enjoy the heck out of it, but it could definitely do without those bots.  I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys mmos, and anime art.  That, and some of the purchasable costumes are soooooooooooo cuuuuuttteeeee!!!! <3 <3 <3 I don't normally do this, but when I get some extra cash on hand I definitely want to buy a pair of glasses for my adorable bard! Keep up the great work with this game, Aura Kingdom devs. I appreciate the fun this game brings to my fiance and I :)			"

												I still don't understand why some guys gave some bad review for this game. This is the first time I really enjoy a MMORPG that I level up to 50 in 45+ hours of gameplay. It had a good balance with the story, gameplay, and graphics for a 'mainstream' MMO. I don't even need to spend real money to play, because the gameplay wasn't really all stats and expensive items. You need the skill and speed for executing the moves to win a PVP duel. The combat was also offers a very good experience. For example, you could miss a shot if the monsters move away or stand too far.I'll give it 8.5 out of 10. Not perfect/original, but it was worth playing.			"

												This game really impressed me, out of all the free to play mmorpg's on Steam, this one I recommend over all others. This game has a multitude of good aspects, for instance the classes. This game has a large amount of classes available immediately, and in addition at level 40 you can choose a second class. The game has absolutely no need to spend real money in, leveling is fairly well paced throughout the game (I've only had to grind for a level twice) and all items you can spend money on are either customisation, mounts (you get one for free before you even reach level 10), or items you can get by playing the game. The game also has a great guild system, which encourages members to aid their guild so it can level up to provide bonuses to all members of the guild. Graphically the game actually looks pretty good, with an anime inspired art design and some decently creative orginal monster designs. Gameplay is your standard hotkey system mmorpg style, while I have railed on this system multiple times in the past, this game did it well in my opinion. Unlike other games using the hotkey system, Aura Kingdom made it enjoyable by 1. Not requiring me to mash a button for my standard attack (I'm looking at you Star Wars the Old Republic) 2. Having enjoyably flashy ability animations and 3. providing a cool combo system with the second class (which with the correct combinations of weapons can lead to powerful special abilities). The only complaint I have with this game is the story, it's not bad and it's not the game's fault that I don't enjoy it. Due to the previously mentioned Star Wars the Old Republic I have a hard time enjoying mmorpg's that don't at least have voice acting, though as said it's my fault. If you enjoy games with an anime art style, mmorpg's, or mmo's in general, you will love this game and I can't recommend it enough. Other wise definitely give it a shot. Finally though, if you aren't a fan of any of the previously mentioned then admittedly this game won't change your mind on the genre.			"

												I enjoyed Eden Eternal (another game by Aeria Games). Aura Kingdomes is the inproved version of that game. It is stroy driven and you cna play it solo for the most part. It has a cooldown system, meaning there is no mana involved, which is a huge + for me, because i allways forget to pop the mana pots. The combat is fluid, fast and nice to watch. And all bosses and even some normal mobs have AOE moves that you can dodge by actually walking out of them. You can also fly at any time. You get upgraded mounts as the game progreses. You also get costumes that all look different every 5-10 levels (as quest items). In daily quests you get costumes aswell and they last foerever and aren't 3-day costumes (you can get those too tho). Overall i recommend the game and since i used to play mmo's a lot in the past this one is refreshing to play, because it's simply a blast to play.			"

												Played until 52 Guardian, and i cannot recommend it...Level 1-40 is easy they want to make the game look fun so you spend money you can do that levels within 5-6 hours if you really want it, after leve 40 it will take you 1 or 2 hours per level from now on, the bard is so powerful in that game that in dungeons there is no tank required ust for information if you try, and bards are pretty rare.Once you hit level 50 you can do ""pvp"" and whatever you see on youtube according to pvp is not like it is now maybe pvp was fun at release time but ppl now have so uber gear that you have no chance you die before you can cast 1 skill if you survive 5 Seconds youre pro but as a guard with all defense skills which make me invulnerable in pve im still a onehit, with upgradet gear im still a onehit its not fun. Ive seen really BAD pvp but this is the worst concept ever, if you still want to do it you have to farm for weeks some coins to get pvp equip that will reduce the player dmg for about 25% well, its your choice if you want to waste your time here. greets			"

												It has enjoyable combat with fun instances to do with your friends. Getting a collection of costumes is a game in itself with some many costumes in the game and trying to get thoughs high custome costumes. It is visually appealing if you like the bright color palet with some dark purples and blacks. With a nice community that many gildes are their just to help you get started. I give it a 9.5/10 for being a fun a enjoyable game with only a minimal amont of problems dealing with clipping but thats MMO RPG for you their is always thoughs small texter issues. And for it being so new I trust that they will fix them over time.			"

												I've started the game a few days before it was released on Steam. For any anime mmorpg fans that are looking for a good casual game to play, this would be it! For what it is, it's worth trying out to see if you like it or not. Each class is different, giving varities of characters to play as. The quest system in this game is farily easy since it has a tracking system as well whether you need trouble or just lazy to go to the area. You get a Eidolon which acts as your partner to help kill enemies as well as unlocking a special finisher, fancy animation for every class.All in all it's worthy game to try out.

												Well, this game is quite fun, the classes are decent and the ability to get a secondary class makes it very interesting as you have a wide variety of playstyle you can go for. some people might say its abit too easy but 1-60 is really just a build up, it shouldnt be too hard to level. its NOT Pay 2 win but the costume in AP store is quite stupid as everything is up to luck. The gameplay and community are very good in my opinion, really like the graphic style as well. There are however a few problems tho, one mainly is the sheer amount of bots inside the game.. i feel like aria is doing a poor job of trying to get rid of them, and also there are quite a few glitches when gliding and jumping as such.Overall good game but definitely has alot of rough edges that needs to be fixed.

												Playing a small amount of this game, I quite like it. Gameplay and combat is good and the game is well polished although there are a few major problems. The game auto sets resolution on first open to 800x600, there is too much hud and makes the game a little harder to concentrate and play on with hud crowding every edge of your screen completely, this hud needs to be simplified. Lastly the combat although good and interesting, it needs a tweak so you can lock onto targets if you wish and some other fixes. All in all though, its a good game. 7/10			"

Even when it comes to dueling people, it feels competitive, yet fun! Nothing feels impossible in this game, and that's what I love about it. This game has limits that seems limitless, which is something I never knew was possible. It's amazing and I've never had so much fun playing an MMORPG game in all my life. Easily earned: 10/10~*			"

												Pro cons1- For anyone that does not want spent any real cash on games, this mmorpg is a good for you.   There no unfair when come to PVP with big cash player , everyone could have same gear in the end.   Everyone get to max out their equitment and costume, doesn't care you spent any real cash or didn't spent any.If you ask Why?All the Cash item available, you able farm/get ingame with a system called ""Paragon"" with using ""loyalty points"".There many way to get loyalty points, by guild instance, daily quest, daily achievement, monster drop, fishing, etc.Myself get minimun 400 loyalty points per day, Highest can go 1500 above.Depend on how hardcore you are and how fast you grind ..2- you won't bored, there a lot mini game/battle field/arena/5 people dungeon/40 people raid    example:     card duel - challenge AI or other player like Yu gi oh :)		battleground - resource war	                arena - like dota map, tower push and base destroy(6-8hour per day for me still not able to complete everything i want, it's too many things to do ingame lol)Bad cons1- require good pc when party 40people  raid, there a system you could hide non-party member out of your screen but still didn't reduce much lag lol ...2- Exp for each level after lv65 are insane up, after lv74 madness.     Current Max lv80..The STEAM hour played recorded here short because i had played half year before STEAM take this game in.The different Install from STEAM or from AERIA official website is addition software require to install.The reason i use STEAM is to skip this ""install Aeria ignite software"", it take time loading before you can start AK game client too.

												Please take note that by the time i wrote this review i consumed 3000+ hours of my life in this gameINTRO:aura kingdom is an anime oriented point and click dress up game w/ dungeon crawling , resource gathering , questing and in depth customization. having eidolons that are either strong companions w/ massive awsomeness like dragons or virtual waifu like scantly clad F cup tanned skin angel w/ pigtails or a wihe haired nine tailed fox wearing a kimono and hakama. and make it an MMORPG.its a fun game with friends and rivals, more funny or sometimes annoying with some drama going on the world chat that added spice to the everyday life. here you take the role of an envoy of gaia , good tutorial , great auto move and quests are easy to do since its already there most of the time one click away. enemies are noted and you can see in their portrait icons to know their attack and drops. PROS: (in my opinion)Leveling and Questing> just by doing the quest you earn free costumes some tradable and wargear that are bound. you earn 4 of the 11 (IIRC ) guild house eidolons to accompany you permanently for all your char in that account. by completing the main story you can earn up to level 62+ just doing the main story alone and max is level 80 Currencies in game> there are a lot of currency in game that you cant trade and Most of them are not even attaiable in the item mall meaning P2W wallet warriors have to grind like you to attain those resorce. the basic is silver and 1k silver =1gold aside from that you have Tokens that you can trade for Skill masteries and items in navea, archeology tokens that can be traded for eidolon stat boost and upgrade material , war coins for Pvp gear , honnor for premium pvp weapons, Aeria points (your typical premium cash shop currency beloved by wallet warriors) , dragon points that you can trade to many usefull items like weapons,armor,mastery and costumes as well as mounts and LOYALTYLOYALTY> an in game currency that allows you to farm by doing daily quests and achivements. unlocking certain achievements and rewards from certain bosses. this is the cream of the crop for non wallet warriors. this allow you to purchase loyalty items from the item mall just the same as the regular item mall items just bound to your account. so you can work your way to expnding your inventory farming resources killing boss and doing daily quest to earn this. hell you can even use this to buy a 1 week limited to 1 transaction of 5k ruby coins for you to use on the premium item shop roullette that changes certain times a week or day depending on events. so you have a chance to earn some of the wallet warriors items as well or trade them for gold and but things you like in the auction house.Eidolons> they are no mere pets. they are summonable companions that help you buff you, heal you or grind enemies to chunks of meat or fine mist. there are all sorts of shapes sizes and personality. from pony unicorns , pokemons , bishonen , armored valkyrie , Mecha to Super Moe-tan loli or Half naked waifu. certain eidolons can be upgraded to change their appearance some losses more of their clothes. some gets more spikes in the armor. a good example you liked your Loli Sylph.... how about dress her in a maid costume w/ shimpan pantsu? you loved your nine tailed kitsune in kimono and hakama? how about you make the top exposing half the PLOT and the skirt to be trimmed to micro mini exposing the HEAVENS. better eye candy? what if you liked the armored knight of the sun but is curious why he covers his face , then upgrade him to remove that coif and get spiked armor. more or less you will find an eidolon that will suit you or your eyes. either for the PURE AWSOMENESS , the PLOT or the Moe factor.you have a chance to get their fragments if you fight and defeat them in certain instances or eidolon temple and guild hall. 10 fragments can be crafted into 1 key to allow you to summon that said eidolon into your account regardless of your characters.(PLEASE note that eidolon keys to aquire eidolon , eidlon fragments that refines to keys are ALL BOUND / NON TRADABLE ) Skill materies , Customization and in Depth Combination to meet your play style>you can change some of the masteries of some skill to tweak their behavior while some may give debuff some will do more damage or buff. you have stats to allocate and not like other games that are PRE-ALLOCATED so you can have a tanky healler you can have a battle tank, you can make a glass cannon tatchi weilding ronin , and the good thing about this is you can reset it EVERY TIME YOU WANT as long as you have the GOLD the basic resource or in game money. you have secret stones to allocate w/c skill to buff and w/c stats to buff. Instance Farming limitation:> this is the best way to earn rare drops , reseource , silvers items to sell and weapon and armor boxes as well as dragon points. so basically its something that has cool downs. relatively 2hrs for party , 3 hrs for hell , 6 hrs for dragons and eidolon temple. 8 hrs for the abyss.  to some who plays overly enthusiastic about it this is a negative since they play like 18+hrs a day in my case this is a way to ensure the proper allocation of resources from the market so it wont crash the prices. (NOTE: bot issues abuse these)Boosted EXP> you get them by just logging in a daily basis , some can be earned from leveling your friends intimacy levels , some are granted from armor like the said aura armor (full set gets 20% more exp.cash shop item) BUT its not limited to cash shops alone.craft your own blessed pieces of armor accesories and trophy and each set and get 5% more exp from each parts. they can be dropped from monster reward chests starting the 2nd map.just get into a party of 5 having 5% more exp w/ each other party member to a max of 20% more. exp can be boosted to 500% (IIRC) but i can earn as much as 280+% more w/ my friends and certain item setsthe AUCTION HOUSE> the more you save the more you have the more you check the auction house the more tendency you spend. this will be your friend to earn your gold. The tool for you to attain most of the basic way to earn your way to ""CAPITALISM HOOOOO!"" since most cash shop items are sold here given its not bound.Free to play = pay if you just want some shortcut but you have to grind like the others to get what you need>if you read about the loyalty , exp boost and archeology from earlier notes these are the long term things you need to keep in mind. and even wallet warriors may be amazed how you along with your friends level faster than them going solo.you can upgrade your set to max+ by slowly doing archeology from multiple characters daily to earn tokens to exchange for a chance to upgrade your gear and if they fail they will not break by default just add their potential and get the potential to 100% and it instantly upgrades.. The Dress up factor> do you want to be kirito in azunas clothes? dress as a scantly clad panty flashing magical girl,a female walking tank w/o fan service, a samurai,a kimono wearing fairy or a kemono mimi loli w/ backpack? this is the game for you. first there are basic costumes that cannot be dyed. then there are amazing custom costumes that can be dyed w/ 24 (IIRC) colors that suits your needs , wants , envy and desires . you have headgear, face gear, armor, back apparel and the mount. while they provide stats except the mount. custom gear gives additional +1% to all stats that are noticably better and can be dyed. eventually you can dress up like your favorite anime char like kirito,asuna,hatsune miku,mikasa,illiasveil/irisveil,saber -clones or create your own dress up avatar CROSSPLAY is limited due to girly boys since there are no options for battle scarred man sauce in the avatar listCons:BotsLAGtoo much repetitive if you have 4 lvl 60 chars and 3 lvl 73+ chars< ENVY >and my family and friends dont know me anymore			"

												Best Anime MMORPG game I've ever played. It gives you that sense and feeling OP as all heck and, even if there is grinding to do, so much fun. Even when it comes to dueling people, it feels competitive, yet fun! Nothing feels impossible in this game, and that's what I love about it. This game has limits that seems limitless, which is something I never knew was possible. It's amazing and I've never had so much fun playing an MMORPG game in all my life. Easily earned: 10/10~*			"

												Pro'sPlenty of playersExcellent customizationEasy to playFrequent updates (although often not significant) Beautiful GraphicsCon'sInstead of constantly expanding the world of Aura Kingdom, they instead recycle the same dungeons by making them longer and  the enemies more powerful. They don’t seem to be interested in expanding AK in a meaningful way until they see a decline in participation and revenue. After that, they'll simply add the update, which they already have on file, as there is a foreign version that is years ahead of the western model. Once again, nothing is holding them back from expanding the world of Aura Kingdom. But If players were to start dropping like flies tomorrow and revenue began to decline you would see a major expansion within a week; making you feel sorry you spent all those hours grinding for such a low rate of return. Indeed, you are being milked ever so slowly for both your time and your money. That brings me to my second point. WARNING: Do not expect to become competitive in this game without spending an insane amount of $$!!!  WARNING: Do not expect to become competitive in this game without spending an insane amount of $$!!! There ... I said it twice. The only legit way to get in game currency is to spend $$ for tradeables in the online store and sell them at the auction house once they hit your inventory. And let me tell you that is the ONLY way to gain in game currency. Sure, you could spend weeks grinding way 24/7 for a pittance, but the guy who just spent $20.00 made more in game currency at the auction house than you did in five months of grinding, and this assessment assumes you didnt sleep for that five months. Conclusion: This game is THE BEST anime based MMORPG on the market, however, it's a very small market (And the bar has been set so very very low). As soon as someone comes out with something equal or better I predict a mass exodus for no other reason that the folks behind AK simply refuse to create something new, opting instead of recycling old dungeons over and over again as they milk the $$ out of those waiting for something better. Don't get me wrong, I expect Free to Play games to exploit us to some extent, (I'm a realist) but Aura Kingdom takes the cake in the the Anime based western MMORPG realm. If this is the type of game you're looking for my best advice to you is to simply wait until they, or someone else, comes out with something better.  "

												So, let me start off by saying that while the game does have issues, It's still a great game.- The story is nice, the auto route system is great to have (I can't stand manually going to every place in every quest). - The gameplay is pretty good, but can get a bit repetitive at times. Most quest are kill this, find that, same thing.- However, the story kept it fun enough for me to keep playing. Now, let's move on to the issues.- Bots, Bots, and more bots. If you can ignore these, than you should be fine. However, the chat is flooded by spam bots.- Lag. The game suffers from server lag, Probably from all those bots. Changing channels to a channel with less people on it usually helps. - The game suffers from stutter while loading in things. That doesn't really surprise me though, as many games of this kind have that issue. The game's optimization isn't the best either. The system requirements are far off.- I played before the steam version came out, and even played in the closed beta. However, I ended up taking a long break from the game, maybe because of some repetitiveness. - Leveling at first is pretty easy, but once you hit the 40ish point, it gets harder. I currently have a Level 60, and I'm struggling to get even a single level. I would hate to see how hard it is at a higher level.- The games graphics are pretty good, and it most cases, the game looks beautiful, even without high end textures.If you're looking for an Anime style MMO, then try the game out. It's free, so you don't lose much by trying it.I will add more to this review in the future when I progress more.EDIT: So, I'm back into the game, and time to do a small update:Leveling is easier than before. I'm not sure what change they made, but whatever they did, it's much better. Before, over half a main area of quests gave me 25% exp at level 62. Now, one quest can give me about 7-10% exp (with XP cards, 20% XP boost). I'm now at 71, and will update this if I get further, and leveling becomes very hard again.Something I want to add though, even after a year and a half of being inactive, and even made a purchase at one point, I did not get banned. However, I did log in once in a while to keep one of my lower level characters from being deleted.			"

This may seem true is some stages, but only if you wnat to get to level 80 within a month or less and need loads of money in that time.YOU CAN PLAY FOR FREE AND ENJOY IT!There are systems where you can get loads of money, for instance like: fishing, farming and selling drops from dungeons. plus if you are moaning about leveling in this game, can I just say that leveling up fast will certainly bore you!Please give this game a go :D if you don't enoy it, that is fine! Just don't go putting it down because it is an ""Anime mmo"" or ""aeria forcing us to p2w"" or even ""I wnat to get to level 80 in a month""This game has potential :3 just give it a chance!			"

												This game is very.... W.O.W-like. That's all I can really discern. I know that there's probably more to it than just that, but I got bored of the combat very quickly. It's a shame too, 'cause from what I found with the art style, playable classes, and the unique secondary class system, I was really hoping this game would have more engaging gameplay. I guess if you like W.O.W., then you should give this a shot, but if you're like me and you prefer combat with more player input, I'd likely suggest Dragon Nest. It's not perfect, but it has better combat and more simple class creation.			"

												Excellent game, sure it's a free-mium game, but it's pretty much a free wow/mmorpg game. Best 3d mmorpg game I've ever played. Though, this game is most compatible with 32 bit operating systems, which is bad for me with windows 10. I experience crashes/freezing and extreme stuttering during gameplay, but this game is so good that I reload my laptop and play the game again anyway.			"

												This has to be one of the best anime mmorpg out there! (at this very moment)Some people say that this game is P2W. This may seem true is some stages, but only if you wnat to get to level 80 within a month or less and need loads of money in that time.YOU CAN PLAY FOR FREE AND ENJOY IT!There are systems where you can get loads of money, for instance like: fishing, farming and selling drops from dungeons. plus if you are moaning about leveling in this game, can I just say that leveling up fast will certainly bore you!Please give this game a go :D if you don't enoy it, that is fine! Just don't go putting it down because it is an ""Anime mmo"" or ""aeria forcing us to p2w"" or even ""I wnat to get to level 80 in a month""This game has potential :3 just give it a chance!			"

												I thought I'd put in my imput on this game. First off, when looking for an MMO with Anime Graphics and free-roam style... this is so far the only game that has hit the spot. I fell in love and I now have been playing it non-stop for three days, just short of 40 hours now.TRUE - Players are not overly friendly and do not go out of their way to say Hello or RolePlay (I come from World of Warcraft) so players NOT roleplaying was a little different.FALSE - Players only seek to use you. I've met some very nice people and have joined a guild that is actually reasonably social. Good players are out there, they are just hidden. Hah.TRUE - The Quests are mostly gathering and killing - basic MMO stuff. Still, I love them because if you listen to the story behind them, they actually make sense. In WoW - they say go get some candles. No explanation for why... just go get me some freaking candles. So you do. In this game, your goal is clear and everyone's quests are to help them help you. It makes sense why you go gather mushrooms or kill beetles.TRUE - The AI and BOT models are VERRRRRY overused, but I don't mind it much. As for player models, I haven't seen any close look-alikes and the character creation gives just enough imput.Other Things I Love?I love classifying in two specializations. So i can use guns and swords, etc. It's very cool and something I was sad they started taking away from World of Warcraft (its basically nonexistant).I love the dungeon system. Dungeons are completely solo-able or you can join up and do a party-version. This makes it easy for SOLO players (like myself) to get everything in the game accomplished without searching for people I don't even want to talk too.The game is easy. Not in the sense that it offers no thrill or excitement, but its not overly complicated. Everything is explained in words first and then (for visual people like myself), most everything has a little video to also explain how each element works. Using Gems is explained, creating armor and gear, and even fishing.Fishing is FUN. Its also one of the easiest places to get Gold (WInk WINk).I Love the Companions - they are fun and sooo helpful. I especially Love Merilee!!Costumes are great - no mismatched ugly gear while you're leveling. The best ones must be bought however (SIGH)What I Don't Like?No open world RolePlay - but thats ok. Hey, if you want to Look Me Up. I love RoleplayNot a whole lot of servers.Can only create 9 characters, but there are 12 classes [This isn't overly important since they have duel-classification at level 40, so you can make up for lost classes then.]Gold Farming is Slow. And I do mean SLOOOW. I've farmed gold for weeks in several games but I've never had so much difficulty as in this one.In-Game Real Money:: I've always had a problem with this in games. It bothers me that I can't buy nice things with Gold. They have implemented another Currency to get most of these Real Money items, but its a lot of work (almost too much). Still - despite adding this it is in no way PAY to WIN. You don't have to spend any money to be freaking amazing in this game.I don't if my review helped. But these are some things that I looked at, disliked, loved, and enjoyed.Overall. Get this Game. If you like RPGs with a GOOD Storyline (who doesnt?), Anime Graphics, and MMO, get this game. People say a lot of crap. But this game has been completely worth it for me. :) "

												As an Anime fan, but not a big MMO fan, i was in search of japanese created games and i stumbled upon this.I can't say much about this game yet becouse i am writing this review after 6 hours of gameplay.Well, first things first. This game is trully an Anime like game. This is the biggest plus in this game so far. NPCs are quite unique, though i sometimes feel a repetitive scene when fighting some mobs (especially humans, like pirates), but still creature mobs are so unique and interesting that i feel a pleasure just roaming and watching them pass me by.Bad thing is that quests are dull. Like, take that, bring that, kill that, collect that. It's pretty much repetitive. But its not a problem for a free game (most of the rpgs have same kind of quests anyway). There are many hidden quests, that start with the player checking some container or an item. And there are alot of bounties, side quests and stuff like that. It's all about numbers, not quality.There are 9 classes to choose from. The character creation is so loyal to anime/manga fans that most probably most of you will enjoy. There are some elements that are quite new to me (becouse i dont play MMO often). Like, none of the skills have mana requirements, only cooldowns. And there is no typical Strenght, Endurance, Energy leveling. You get ATK Points and DEF points. In ATK section you level damage, critical hit chance or attack speed, and in DEF section you level armor rating or evasion.You can have a pet here. Ranging from faries to ponies (Yes, MLP fans, this game is for you too!) That pet levels with you and it can get you presents every 10 minutes for some kind of energy points. To restore points, you need to talk with your pet. The dialogue is pretty solid, sometimes fun. So you need to take care not only about your character, but about your pet as well.Overall, this game is still in open beta stage. There are some bugs, sometimes server lags and that kind of stuff. This game isn't the perfect game ever, some things really bug me (like, why doesnt character look depend on a costume but not the armor?). But still, i had a pleasure playing it. So check that out, for a free game and for a beta stage, it's awesome.Pros: + Loyal to anime fans (even MLP?) + Beautiful world + Pretty much original + Nice soundtrack + Awesome Eidolon (Pet) system.Cons: - Bugs and freezes - Missing sounds for enemy mobs or ambience. - Only 10 hairstyles :( - This game begs you to find friends, becouse some quests can't be passed without a party. - Mini-games with you controling other NPCs feel unfinished and lousy. - Disguises just give you a model to wear, not a costume itself.Final Verdict: 7 hairstyles out of 10			"

												Not much skill needed in this game because there is no aiming, there are just a couple of abilitys that you can dash with or dodge. Its very lagy which doesnt make me so happy. Even dou my negative feelings about this game, there is something that makes this game fun, its kind of the most similar game to sword arts online, there are a lot of calsses to pick from, and there are A LOT of things to do in it to aquire strenght. This game has fishing, card dueling even archeologyc searching add it in it !!! and for those people who think this things are usleass, guess what, the higher level in card dueling / fishing / archeology you get more bonus stats, from the level range of 1 - 10. While the curent maximum level is level 85.The PVP isnt that much evolved because, as I already said, not much skill needed only good items.Even dou my negative coments  nothing in my review maters except my personal enjoyment, and I realy do enjoy playing this game.OH ~~~ and ~~~ the kinda main thing in this game is to collect pokemons and level em up XD (eidelons)			"

There 13 classes to choose from, and great character customization; not to mention the amazing animation, music, effects and creative story. Find yourself caught in the adventure alongside allies, friends and foes as you travel to different lands uncovering secrets and clues to defeat the darkness. As you level up, you are given the options to do amazingly fun ativities like:-fishing for the big one-finding ""the one""-set up shop-learn new skills-uncover hidden artifacts-become the greatest cook in all the land-concer battle towers-form guildsand much much more!!

												Overall fun game to play and is not very difficult to get into. Most the time your character will be auto walking to the next main objective, which is nice if you're out to play casually. I have yet to make it end game as i am lvl 44 and this review will be edited until then. Pros: -Class system that involves class combos with special skills as the result of it-Simple rewards system for doing sidequests which can give you some nice gear-Cash shop seems to be mostly cosmetic -Crafting your own consumables for dungeons!Cons:-Not all classes can be mixed, only certain class combos get special skills out of it which makes it feel like you would have to follow this combo only. Although it is somewhat understandable.-Cash shop points from buying seem to be really low...im kinda surprised at how much a character slot expansion costs.-Starts to get very repititive, after a while it just gets kinda boring auto walking. The quests range from ""kill these guys"" to ""kill these guys to get a certain item"" Conclusion: Like any other game it is definitely not perfect but it is fun to try out and i would recommend this game for someone who plays to play a laidback game. Playing with friends would make the experience a bit more enjoyable since most people you will run into will not be very chatty or you might just get recruited to a guild instead. I hope to give a full review once i reach endgame or if i dont then i will leave it here and give it another edit.			"

												Didn't know this was on steam but gonna review as an Aeriagames player anyway.Simple Summary:+Everyone have a partner: Eidolon, that assist in combat and give you diverse option of choose that small percentage of shared stats.-some can be accessed through immense effort while most latest can be easily obtained by pay2win, thats normal in a free MMO+every part of the world have the usual level range and quests, you can venture freely doing many immersive side quest-most character's combat are based on stomping keys+the skill tree and path for stats are diverse, a player can have 2 class specialization with more skills.-From the above 2 points, this contrast may fall on an ironic side for certain players+you can glide while travelling around the [field]world freely, or with a mount-It gets grindy like any other casual MMO, but for Aura Kingdom, you get to check through websites to find info about when bosses spawn and where, its like going to your part-time work and find lots of other people are there doing the same.+Efforts are tolerable in gear and level (thanks to being able to fly)-proffesions effort are intolerable (they're still rarely considered for most players to utilise)+gr8 music, tho short-endgame contents are short (as at 2014), which is probably why reaching max level from a few levels away is intensely hard.-changing instances is a 'skill' LEL-hardly noticeable craftings-Bots.... a shietload .__.Conclusion: 7.5/10 for those that likes free MMO, 4.5/10 for the others. #nohashtag			"

												It's a fun MMORPG with very thick PvE gameplay. So, for reference if you had played another MMORPG, Aura Kingdom might be similar to Luna Online for monster, enemy, and environment. Perfect World for its Quest Based Leveling (yes dungeon & quest are your primary source for level, farming & killing mobs are not necessary). But to top of it, Aura Kingdom compile the best part of MMORPG to date, not too keen for Pay To Win because most dependable item are available through ingame, and you may get items from item mall with Token (available to get) instead of Aeria Points.But every review must have its con, so in my opinion, this game is lack of support from developer and game provider Aeria itself, lack of update, bug fixing, and so on.TL;DRIf you're just a casual player that want some fun without any progressive playing and money-spending, this one suits you best. not necessary to P2W, decent gameplay with friends, and since it's PVE centered, no need of ++++weapon & armor that you should buy with money from other people or grinding too much.

												I might have just 48,9 hours into this but still i will make a review.The game is F2P and it looks cool i guess? Dont know what other people will say.The thing that got me into the MMORPG category is Sword Art Online ( I will probably trigger people beacuse of this)At the start i didnt understand anything neither the hud or how you play it... But as 1 hour passed by i was already level 20 and i understanded everything.People say you will have to grind the quest trough the story to get to a higher level and better items... Thats true bot honestly i like that.Good things :It maybe will seem like P2W but it actualy isn't.. The only thing you will maybe end up paying for is costume's , rubies, and some other things... but mostly if you want better weapons you will either have to craft/fuse them or buy them from the auction house which is only for gold and silver... the gold prices for items are high but as you farm you get it easily... (I fished a daimond fish so i got 50 gold :P )There is PVP for those who like it... I don't know how it works though since i only like PVE in team battels or being a solo player...Atributes system is good if you mess up you can reset them except for your main stats i think...The Difficulty in solo duengons is quite fair but you might end up dying once in a while when you get to level 40 and higher.A lot of class and build variety but there are a lot of classes that stand out beacuse of their damage...Bad things:Now honestly i didn't find anything bad about the game except few things... People never play party duengons.., This might just be a thing on Phoenix servers since i mostly play on those.Vault space... I understand that it should be small but they should atleast increase the personal storage room soo you can put anything that you might need inthere...Would i reccomend it?Certanly yes.It's a great MMORPG that isnt P2W based (some people might think it is but its their opinion) It's easy to master the controls and the HUD is somewhat good, But for the most part i would reccomend it to any person that wants to get into MMORPG's and dosent have a good computer.

												I personally enjoy Aura Kingdom because of th Log Horizon and SAO feel of the game. I love anime and I've been searching for a really well graphical anime mmo and thankfully I came across Aura Kingdom. I know some people who just find this game down right boring but if you grab even one person to join you in your adventure you will definitely have fun. My friend and I made new characters and everytime we learned a new skill we dueled one another, although I got obliterated by him it was still fun to get far into the game together. A lot of yelling and a lot of skipping quests that we regret skipping lol. If you wanna play a well designed anime mmo then Aura Kingdom is the one for you. I hope this helps and possibly convinces some of you. Pros:1. Dual class system at level 40. 2. Eidolon/Pet creativity3. Amazing cutscenes that you wouldn't want to missCons: 1. Although this may seem like a stupid con for some of you, leveling is to fast for my liking. In about one day my friend and I got to level 30 (no we didn't stay up the whole night). I like to take it decently slow and sometimes stop for amazing sights. Overall: I think this game is great besides the leveling system and don't worry it's not really pay to play unless you just want a cool mount, I think the free mount that you recieve is cool enough. I mean come on, who doesn't wanna run around exploring on a FREAKING OSTRICH?!Edit: I know I don't have many hours on this game but that is because I used to play it outside of steam and quit it since I got a bit seperated from the game and then when I saw it on steam it brought back good memories.

												Wow!.. A free to play anime MMORPG on steam. Great! lets check out (only to get disappointed and bored) Yup u read right one of the most boring games i've played till date. I'll explain you why.....1) Repetitive Mission design : Yaa I know it's a MMORPG, it'll be grindy, but this much? I literally felt sleepy while playing the game that too in broad day light. All the missions include talking to a random NPC then clicking on the mission info and the game takes you to the mission area (yup you don't need to steer the mount or the char game does that for you) Then fight some cute little animals, kill them(why to kill them? they look so cute :'X ) then again come back to the NPC for reward.2) Boring background music : You might not belive me but is true, only 2 or 3 sound generic sound tracks. I completely turned of the in game music (main reason for me to feel sleepy).3)Uninspiring combat : The tab targetting system from World of warcraft is here. But most of the times u don't need to worry because you are so overpowered that you won't be feeling any challenge.Some of the minor annoyances i had with the game are its an instanced mmo and ther is no voice acting for anything other than some tutorial videos.but the game is not all Bad. I really liked the art style. graphically it's not a ground breaker. But it looks good.The concept of Eidolons is too cool. It's just not a side charecter, it will also evlove, help, plays a main role in story.and from what i've seen the story looks interisting. The level cap is level 90, and contains 12 classes to choose from.with that much content it's really a huge game but the question is how much you want to play it?Even thouh the game has some cool ideas and art style with little intersting story, does not do enough to overcome all the negative aspects of the game. I am not recommending this game as I didnot enjoy the game as much as hoped for. But it is free to play. So no loss in trying once...			"

												So I played for roughly 2 hours. This game amazed me with its anime styled graphics and sounds right when I hopped into the game. I had a ton of fun slashin' through a bunch of weird creatures and completing quests which are pretty easy. I can already feel myself getting hooked to the game. The only negative I had was the co-op...I got a friend to hop on and it was hard to find each other as I had to ran half way across the area we were in. When you party up it does not pop up the quests for your party members so I had no way of knowing how to help my friend. Turns out he doesent like MMO's and he uninstalled :(. But I give this game an 8/10 and I look forward to the many hours that will come with Aura Kingdom!			"

												Just ignore the hours it says I have. I didn't initally have this game through Steam. I don't usually write reviews, but Aura Kingdom is different for me. I have played it since beta. Not constantly. I would start it, love it, play obsessively for a month, get bored, move on, come back, repeat. Now, I actually hate this game. It is a grind fest, the combat is awkward, and it is generally a really boring game. And yet despite this, I always come back to it. Why? Because it's a beautiful. Because I like getting to glide. I like having a free ostrich mount. The costumes are cute and the costimizations you can make to your character's apperance are endless. It is a grindfest, yes, but because of this, you can't really pay to win. You HAVE to put the work in to get good gear and level up and all that. My favorite thing about it, though, is how unique you can make your character with the skill points and tree. I also really love being able to get a secondary class. I've always hated being stuck to a singular class when combining some can help make you even greater. Basically, to enjoy this game you have to level up. You have to get past like, level 45-50ish to really start getting to the meat of the game. Getting to that point will require some serious patience. It is boring and dulls the mind but if you get past that, it's a pretty okay game.			"

												AK is a complete technical mess. In addition to numerous unaddressed launcher and login issues, you will be lucky to even make it to the login screen in this nightmare. The forums are filled with other users pleading for help that never comes. As a fairly popular MMO that has recently been added to steam, it makes you wonder what the team behind Aura Kingdom is doing with their time and money. That being said, the game itself is nothing special. The tacky writing in the tuturial is enough to make any self respecting gamer cringe. Combat is mind numbingly easy and thoughtless, offering little in terms of interesting gameplay. Movement is awkward unless you enjoy point and click styles you would find in any RTS. You play this game for the dressup, and only that.			"

												What is there to say about Aura Kingdom?Well, there's a whole lot I can say, I can't just say IGN 1/10 too much water to cover this beast.Aura Kingdom is a fine game, filled with the moe kawaii erm desu chan san senpai nani sore goodness you would expect from its charming aesthetics of course, but that's not all kids! Let's start with the gameplay. CLASS IS IN SESSION (lol puns am I right)!You got your Guardians, your Magicians, your Bards, your Ravagers... OH IT'S SIMPLY SPLENDID! Each class chooses a subclass at level 40! I always thought that your 40s were a time of crisis but not in this reality! Party up with a group of friends and you'll have a blast!Questing is super duper party snooper until you reach 50s which are still okay but then there's level 60 and KABLAMO! You're stuck at 60 years young for quite some time unless you got the skills and the will to survive...SOCIAL LINKS SOCIAL LINKS SOCIAL LINKS SOCIAL LINKS""How do I make friends?""Thanks for asking Jenny, before you get down to business to defeat the Huns you'll want a neato pateeto party of cutie patootie warriors! However many people give you the cold shoulder in this world. All three servers will have their share of antisocials, regulars and over the top bards with strange tendencies to touch your thighs and such. Chimera is the big boy, filled to the brim with peeps, but not a peep can be heard from many of them! Siren is my homeland, a middle ground where less people live but still a large enough amount, and then Hydra is a server full of jolly alts and such, a level 1 on Hydra could have 600 lvl 80 characters hidden away. Spooky? Loominarty confirmed lel jk don't get spooked now!A good way to really make chums is by joining a guild. Guilds grant a lovely exp bonus and plenty of fun events to bring your show and tell objects to. e.g. Guardian Angels (Shameless plug) or jimmies Wonderboys (might not be real). Guild members can form parties with ease, teach eachother techniques and all that bizzle AND THE BEST THING IS THAT IF YOU SPAM GUILD CHAT THEY'LL HAVE TO TALK TO YOU! HOORAY!GRAPHICSeyy der gud, if ya like animoo. Actually you don't need to like anime at all I suppose, the style is PRETTY FLY without straining a low end computer with the terrain deets. The monsters are pretty goofy sometimes but hey, what ya gonnas do about it tough guy? That's what I thought. If you like TF2 or Sanctum it's sort of along those lines! UNDERSTAND!? OKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!THE WARNINGListen here chap or chappete, don't touch the store, especially the paragon table if you value your life. The lucky packs, roulettes and all that goobertron can  get you addicted hardcore! Vegeta what does the scouter say about my spending spree? YOU SPENT OVER 9000 pounds on a hat! WHAT 9000? DARN YOU LUCKY PACKS! Overall I r8 8/8 k no memes involved I love this game despite the lack of middle ground between easy levelling and impossible levelling ya dig? Also yes I like cosmetics and such because I'm such a nerd when it comes to armour GEEZ get off my back, you're not my mamma!

												In my experience this game is actually pretty good. The characters are cute, the combat system is straight forward, and the quests and auto-routing makes this game, basically play itself. Now I'm not new to mmos, and I have played countless types of various styles and this one really caught my attention. What I like the most is that it's super easy to level up on your own, and you don't really have to rely on others. I've played other MMOs, where I simply couldn't progress on my own cause well, the character I made just wasn't fast/strong enough to gain the exp. Clerics suck, just saying but, I also can't play non-clerics/squishy characters. I also like how, you don't have to work as hard to level up to get those cooler looking skills, or in other words, you get to get those cool skills at the get go. Cause that's a major selling point for me, I'm all about the graphics and how flashy and cool you get to make your character. The edioleons are super cool, wish there was more of a way to pick which ones you get, or at least raise the chances of getting the one you want. If there is, well... I guess I haven't looked into it enough. But I'm also not the type to like grind for hours in the same dungeon to get something super rare however what I noticed from dungeoning it probably won't take too much time to get that shiny armour you want. Anyone willing to do that, super props to you. I never know how you do it. Other cool features are the gliding, the duel class option at level 40, dungeons and auto-loot pick up are super useful and that there is a pretty extensive fishing option. Armour and Weapon fortification is pretty simple too, making anyone able to upgrade their stuff; takes a lot of resources, but it's still fun and you're not likely going to loose your stuff if it fails. All of these I find super awesome cause these are stuff I wish was found in other games. TL;DR for pros: super easy to play on your own, has everything you can want in a game that you probably wouldn't have thought of. I barely scratched the surface of this game, and I bet it's even better when you dig deeper. Now what I don't like, and I don't know if this is just me, but I have played this game with a friend, and even though we were both playing the game, it didn't really feel like we played together. We were both just running about on our own, and talking in between when we were stuck. I'm super social when it comes to mmo games, but the fact that there isn't the shared loot pickup for quests, or that exp isn't shared between us, it really feels like a solo game. The best you can do is just stand around and kill stuff while waiting for your friend. And a lot of the quests are specifically solo anyways. What also bothered me is the mouse controls. You get used to them as you play (not really) but the two camera functions can really hinder you in a bind. Like one camera simply rotates around your character, and the other one actually makes your character turn with it. So like I know during boss fights, I turn my camera a lot to look at different angles, but I don't nessecarily need my character to be turnt around too cause some skills require them to be facing a monster. So with that, sometimes I would need to run away to get out of a red zone, and I find myself using the wrong camera move, and I just have my character running backwards super slowly, and usually on the verge of death now. (I'm not the type to click-to-move) And some mobs jump around a lot so you need that camera moving.And another is the skill keys hot-bar. There are waaaay too many skills to fit on one hot bar and it's inconvient how they only go up to 8. I used to it going up to the ""="" key. Plus with the eidoleon skills, mounts, glide features and other stuff I can't remember, you are't left with a lot of space, especially when the second class comes into play. So you're left with like maybe 4 of your favourite skills from each class.TL;DR for the cons:It doesn't feel as social of a game going by my standards. There isn't that sense of playing with friends, but just having them on the side (but thats not too bad). The mouse controls are super annoying and the hot-bars don't have enough space and can get pretty cluttered.Overall:I would totally recommend. There's a lot I complained about, but really they don't affect gameplay that much. If you know what you're doing it's pretty meaningless. 10/10			"

												This game is nice, fun, and has a good community. Though when you reach level 29, you are given a level 30 quest for the main story. It's common to recieve quests where the level is one above your own. However, the quest ""Enter the Alabastren Temple ruins"" is mostly unfair. As you are required to enter a dungeon alone (it specifically tells you to do it by yourself) and the dungeon, with friends at the same level as you when you recieve the quest, is still very difficult as all the enemies have high hp, defense, and do lots of damage. And you are forced to fight 4-5 enemies at a time, which is unbelievable difficult. As a guardian class, I have the most defense, and use all the defensive skills and still die while killing one. And any enemy you damage, when you die, they are fully healed while you have to respawn at the dungeon entrance, or wait 1 minute to revive there with minimal hp. Further more, grinding levels in the game is extremely difficult as you get very small amounts of xp from enemies and side quests also give small amounts of xp. I don't reccomend this game to you, unless you don't mind wasting hours doing this one quest required to advance the story which is unnecessarily annoying and extremely difficult.			"

												Aura Kingdom, Colourful, bright and fun graphics. This game feels and looks like an MMO but... you only need players to complete dungeons with you, the rest of the time you farm and farm and farm for more XP to level up. Once reached the required level you can start with dungeon, either play solo mode, party mode which is up to 3 players or Hellmode that requires at least 5 players. Dungeon crawling is really fun to play with a friend or random people but people will not join your party to start the dungeon with you, so that means going back to farm XP again. The game drags on with pointless quests and farming, farming can be very boring because there's no competition, you can farm solo and wont even need a party memeber. I recommend this game for the fun gameplay, cool character creation and the ability to fly.			"

Product received for free
												Looking for a game close enought ot SAO?Well you've come to the right place, cause Aura Kingdom is only one of those anime themed MMORPGs that is as close to SAO...Grindy, but worth it. Lots of players (Especially on channel 1 of your chosen server) and a very active community. Weapons are very stylish, but the costume is hard to come by without advancing to get at least a decent Forest Ambassador outfit. There is a currency called Loyalty Points (Accumulated by doing certain daily quests, returning monster bounties, or in valuable chests) and if you continuously do these quests, getting a costume without abiding to microtransaction's tempting offers for the best looking costumes, can be pretty satisfying, include the mounts too which are kinda affordable. Eidolons, the pets which is already registered in your account and can be used by multiple characters depending if they are active on the other character, is very convenient as you won't be grinding hard again if you decide to create a 2nd character, but instead the keys 9which are used to summon them) can be saved to do an evolution for your eidolon. And lastly, I would like to commend the very interesting and versatile sub skill system. In lvl 40, you will be given a quest where you can pick your sub, but worry not, as your sub can be replaced for free!Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who likes MMORPGs with anime theme and an active community and fun to play dungeons.

												Aura Kingdom, The Sweet Kick A_s and Adorable MMORPG !With over 200hr on playing is a bit late to write the review on thin game but still, I have something to say.This game is really well done in many case. The Graphic is Good, better than many game out there. Design in Anime style is so advantage to attract many players. Music is Nice. Storyline is pretty interesting and Finally, Battle is Outstanding. From skill to skill, you can serve your enemy with the Cool-Connecting Combo up on your style. Stack up DPS or Screw the enemy with 1st and 2nd Combination Ultimate Skill.Class Balance is Great. No MP or SP to worry because the cool down time is the only thing you must consider, to manage your fighting rhythm....The Best Combo System I ever play.Choose the Player Class and build up your own character, gender and face and Side Kick Eidolon. and Play out the DEJAVU opening style mission, Pretty interesting opening intro stage. So you can try out many class in the very first stage and change it if you want to try other play style.But if you climb up to Over 50Lv, things will go more harder in many way. That's mean if you put your effort fight all the way til Lv50, the real battle just begin from this place. (Some player quit, Some player continue)One of The Best F2P. You can use (Real) money to buy stuff if you want but basically, you can get almost of them by your effort....kinda hard but still has a chance.The Only annoying thing is BOT.....Just leave them alone or turn off the [other player invisible] button. (Or steal their kill count is the fast way to end the quest too)One Best thing and the last is [PANTIEs] ! Many type of girl and many kind of Pantie they put on (YES, SO ANIME). Go Sneaking them is one of the Entertaining thing (No Joke)			"

												I played a bit of Aura Kingdom during my WoW downtime. Thought I'd give a brief review of my experience.Played I would say for the last two weeks very casually. The game has an auto pathing system that take a lot of the running around(exploring) out of the game. I actually liked the system because it let's you pickup and play easily without having to really invest. It also got me to actually pay attention to the story not that is was mind blowing. The art is the games strongest point. It sort of reminds of the ""Tales of"" series. The costumes are also suuppperrr on point. Very cute, or very cool mounts, and Edilons(your fighting companion pets). The world isnt too bad and some of creature you fight are cool looking as well.The class system I didn't get to fully explore. I rolled a Bard which is the games only pure healing class. It can still easily solo from what I saw and I had a few duels with other players winning with superior healing. At level 40 they let you choose from any of sub classes, three of which offer additonal spells with the right off hand weapon equipped. The system allows for some super creative ways to play but ultimately some are clearly better than others as MMORPG's go.The community however is dead. Like there are people EVERYWHERE, but we can't talk. My entire time I spoke to no other players. You have to purchase an item from the store just to talk in /world chat and it has only so many uses. You may end up paying for an item just to have your message spammed out of sight. I was invited to a guild, no one was ever on. I never found a group for running dungeons either...The cash shop wasn't too bad. I purchaes 2500 Aeria Points for about 32$ CAN and got a very cool costume for my character, and some large 20 slot bags. They also give you a bunch of items with EXP and Drop rate buffs, and a free mount. Later on I found out that I get even more free stuff which was x3 more 20 slot bags, and two more Edilon pets one of which is worth 50.00$ in the cash shop.I found this game to be actually quite enjoyable. If I wasn't looking forward more so to WoW Legion I might consider giving it more time. I've never been a fan of ""Pay to Win"" but I am a fan of seeing how far you can take a free to play character. Even so the cash shop has some fair deals and most of the items in there are cosmetic in nature from what I saw. Do you like MMORPG's? Do you like Anime? Then you might like Aura Kingdom			"

												This game is nice, fun, and has a good community. Though when you reach level 29, you are given a level 30 quest for the main story. It's common to recieve quests where the level is one above your own. However, the quest ""Enter the Alabastren Temple ruins"" is mostly unfair. As you are required to enter a dungeon alone (it specifically tells you to do it by yourself) and the dungeon, with friends at the same level as you when you recieve the quest, is still very difficult as all the enemies have high hp, defense, and do lots of damage. And you are forced to fight 4-5 enemies at a time, which is unbelievable difficult. As a guardian class, I have the most defense, and use all the defensive skills and still die while killing one. And any enemy you damage, when you die, they are fully healed while you have to respawn at the dungeon entrance, or wait 1 minute to revive there with minimal hp. Further more, grinding levels in the game is extremely difficult as you get very small amounts of xp from enemies and side quests also give small amounts of xp. I don't reccomend this game to you, unless you don't mind wasting hours doing this one quest required to advance the story which is unnecessarily annoying and extremely difficult.			"

												Aura Kingdom, Colourful, bright and fun graphics. This game feels and looks like an MMO but... you only need players to complete dungeons with you, the rest of the time you farm and farm and farm for more XP to level up. Once reached the required level you can start with dungeon, either play solo mode, party mode which is up to 3 players or Hellmode that requires at least 5 players. Dungeon crawling is really fun to play with a friend or random people but people will not join your party to start the dungeon with you, so that means going back to farm XP again. The game drags on with pointless quests and farming, farming can be very boring because there's no competition, you can farm solo and wont even need a party memeber. I recommend this game for the fun gameplay, cool character creation and the ability to fly.			"

												Made an account like 2 years ago and I left it before the intro. Came back ""enter secondary password""ok I should be able to guess this *tries for an hour* alright nevermind ""Would you like to reset your password?"" sure *get directed to the website and logs in* alright wheres the reset secondary pass word?Looked for like 2 hours and could not find it. This is my fault but if you are gonna ask them if they want to reset the password but not direct them to it with a link that is supposed to do that I would suggest actually sending them to the right place. Just this alone makes me think that this might not be a good game.			"

												I can't run good games in my PC so I looked for a low spec one. Then I saw Aura Kingdom. My potato PC can run it fine, although it lags when I'm in crowdy places. Anyway, it has been one of the most fulfulling mmorpg that I had played.The only bad side is there are I see plenty of bots around. I really wish they'll do something about it.			"

												I've been playing a lot more than it says I have on Steam, but I recently downloaded it again from Steam because I'm weird like that and I like all my games to be in Steam if possible.Anyways, this is a real gem in an ocean of crap F2P games.  Good:--------------------------Awesome story that makes sense and is easy to followBeautiful world, amazing attention to detail and a real joy to just look aroundThe things you can buy from the store can also be earned (usually in several different ways) from in-game things as well or you can easily and *safely* earn free Aeria Points by installing and playing apps on your phone or watching a minute long video.Translation is spot on.  I haven't seen any issues and usually with games like this half the quest text makes 0 sense.As you progress you have several ways of changing and making yourself better.  From talent trees to mastering skills to adding gems, enchants and fortifying armor and weapons.Great sense of humor.A lot of classes to choose from which are not sex locked.Lots of different looks without even mentioning costumes and dyes and all of that, I'm just talking about character creation.Every day you log back in you are greeted with a free present and your Eidolon as well.Eidolons.  These are exceptionally well done ""battle pets"" (bascially) with stories and personalities all of their own.  They don't just level, you help them to level and to better themselves as you progress as well.  Not only are there several to choose from or earn but they all have their own way of speaking, seeing the world and battling.  Some are healers, others plain warriors and so on.  They can be evolved at certain levels with the right items, given items to up their stats permanently, you have conversations with them on a regular basis and they give you great gifts which can help both of you a lot in the long run.  This is by far, one of the most impressive battle pets systems I have ever seen in any game, and it's free to play!  Auto-route.  I have no idea why, some people see this as a bad thing but I don't understand that at all.  You can open the map up, find a specific NPC and just run to them without having to worry.  I don't see a problem with this and with all of the other types of games I have played, I just see it as it's own game mechanic.  You don't have an ""auto kill everything"" feature so it isn't game breaking in the least.  If you don't like it, just don't use it.  I see this as only a plus and will not name this as a con for any reason.The way they did quests is not only pretty clever, it's also very fun.  When you approach an NPC and click on them to start a quest a small box will take over your screen.  You can then watch the interaction between your character and the NPC as they engage in quest conversation.  It's really cute, allows you to cut off the rest of the MMO world for a moment to get into what you are doing and also lets you see the amount of emotions displayed in a really fun way.  I really like it.I've played four different classes, all of which had spells and attacks that were very different from one another.  Battle Bow looks nothing like another class, which some of these F2P MMOs do and it is very boring.  The attacks and spells in this game are vibrant, fun, fast-paced and well thought out.  You cannot just mash buttons either, which I really appreciate.  You have a global cooldown on all abilities.  Speaking of abilities, you can do a combo with your Eidolon.  It is unique to each one and does a ton of damage.  Even the healer types have one they can do with you.  Very fun, awesome to watch.Auto-potions.  I love this feature as well and will not say this is a con either, for any reason.  You don't like it don't use it.  I don't care, I think this is awesome.  What this does is allow you to place whatever type of potions you have in your bags in the Auto-potion slot.  You can then click it ""On"" and choose a percentage of health in which to have it switch to.  I have mine at 30% and it has seriously helped.  This allows you to focus on the action (you'd just be clicking it anyways, don't waste the global cooldown) while staying somewhat safe.  This does not gaurantee that you will stay alive.  This is not a 100% proof plan against death.  You can still die.  Don't kid yourself.  Some of the daily instances are just mean.  But this feature is just really awesome and I've never seen it before in any MMO.  That I remember.Lots and lots to do.  You have cooking done in a unique fashion, bring items you find randomly around the world to special cooks in the towns and they can help you fuse up something amazing.  Sometimes it's green, sometimes it's orange and you will get an achievement and exp for doing so.  Sometimes it's purple and helps specifically with PvP!  There are thousands of hidden quests and achievements in every area of the game.  From finding green question marked items and finishing the tasks lined up with them, to gathering loyalty points that you can also use in the item mall for lots of really cool items without spending a single penny.  Or chase down the 4-6 unique monsters in each area and turn in their pots to the city/village jailer for extra goodies and more achievements/titles.  Everything on the UI can be moved anywhere you want it.  The UI itself is great looking and you can even shrink or enlarge all of the elements.Lots of different ways of doing quests.  I have noticed some people saying it's the same as many other MMOs and there is a lot of grinding.  I don't think this is true at all.  Yes, you kill enemies and you collect items but there is a LOT more than just that going on.  Sometimes you are dodging the eyes of the bad guys trying to get through a dungeon or winning over the baddy in order to help you later on.  Planting bombs, fishing, sneaking through very dangerous areas.  There's more than just the normal amount of ""kill this"" and ""collect that"".  Plus, it actually makes 100% sense as to WHY you are doing it.  it isn't just ""my farm is in danger kill 5000 beetles"".  You are killing those things and collecting those items in order to help finish a much bigger picture which I think is really cool.  The kill quests and collection items aren't over done either.  At most I have been asked to kill 10 things at one time.  Not a big deal to me at all.Auto join a guild, get benefits and never be bothered.  Or bother them and start a conversation.  It's literally up to you.  I love this feature, I wish every game had something like this.  ----------------------Bad:Not a lot of character slots available, only three without paying.Bots.  They aren't a huge deal and literally only sit in one place of each zone that I have noticed, but it's really annoying.  They are always the guys with the big cannon looking things, I can't remember the name of the class.  They all look the exactg same and have ridiculous names.  Just annoying.Sometimes it is a little too easy.  You feel like you are just sweeping through everything.  This could be a good thing to some, I don't see it that way though so am only naming it as a con.  I would like there to be much more challenge.  The daily instances offer something more, but only rarely and for the most part they aren't too hard either.Bag space.  They will give you bags and stuff from time to time and all but really there isn't much at all.  Especially your bank.  It is TINY and I really hate that.  You have a shared bank which is awesome but it is just too small.Cooking things requires far too much money.  I don't spend my money on much else really.  I get items from dungeons and such and don't want to spend it on AH crap or personal sellers.  But fusing together some cooked chicken costs much too much.  You share Eidolons with your account.  This can be good and bad.			"

Infite Flying, like no sky limits to reach high ground for good view, just for relaxation purposes tho. :) And also, I hope they could fix the item mall problem. it seems that before the september update, you can simply buy AP via steam wallet, now it's just Payment UI preserved, hope you fix that problem guys, would like to spend on Steam Wallet to get AP's. Don't want to change my mode of payment to get AP. :) Thanks. That would be all, overall, nice game.			"

												A beautiful game! Instead of putting a whole paragraph on how I love it, I'll just put some points down on what I really liked about it. I will also put some kind of not-so-great things here as well, so you can see if this is the game for you!Pros:1. The scenery itself is very beautiful! Each town and area has their own little thing and you can explore all of the beautiful sights!2. The enemies are very adorable! Now this isn't much of a pro to the game since enemy style doesn't really tell how good a game is, but I thought to put it out there. I feel bad killing a lot of the enemies because of how cute they are.3. There are 3 servers in a game. Each server is seperate so you can make 3 characters per server. In total, you can have 9 characters. I am a person that likes to try a lot of different classes, so this is great for me! If you're like that too, you'll love this! I know from my experience of different MMORPGs that a lot of games don't really allow this kind of thing. The only one I can remember was Fiesta online did this. I know there are a couple more out there that I don't remember. But this one does that kind of thing, so I think it's great!4.  The character design for your character and the NPCs are so adorable! I really like the character customization on this game. While there isn't too much to the customization, it's enough to make nice characters, in my opionion! I wasn't expecting something like this to have PS2 Online super ultra customization, but I was surprised to how much there was in it. So overall, its a great player maker!5. There are so many quests! Many of them are not fighting-based either, so you won't always be running around doing the same thing over and over again. You set up traps, deliver things, make things, etc. Of course, though, there will always be more fighting than, lets say, delivery quests. But, the small difference in routine gives it a little more fun! It even has a stroy questline to it as well!6. You get an ostrich. That's right. You get to ride an ostrich. This also doesn't make a game 100% better, but I think it's pretty cool that your free mount is an ostrich. 7. Another thing I like about this game is it has such a friendly environment! Many times have I made a character and at a low-level, higher ups have me join their guild or party to help me out thinking I'm extremely new. I have not once gotten into an argument with anyone. The community is great in my opinion. I'm not sure if others would agree with me because everyone has their own experiences with other people in MMORPGs, but my experience has been good so far. I'm hoping it is like this for everyone!8. You can get something called ""loyalty points"" through out the game that you can use to ""buy"" costumes! Loyalty points are free, but a little difficult to get a lot. But if you're determined and do a lot of easedropping on NPCs, you'll rack up those loyalty points and get that cool costume you wanted! They also have another point system that you actually have to pay money to get, but I think that it's great that the game developers let the people who don't pay money on games have a chance to get something cool!---Cons:1. This game does get kind of repetitive. Even though they have different quests thats not all fighting, they are usually ""get __ amount of __"" kind of quests. My higher up is aroung level 36 if I remember, and it's getting a little boring aroung there. However I do sometimes continue to log on and play. They do have ""fame quests"" and ""daily quests"" that they put up if you don't feel like doing the same old quests. (<---maybe should have put that in pros?)2. It is a point-and-click stlyled fighting game. You do have hot keys for your abilities, but for the most part, it's a point-and-click. If you're not a fan of that style of fighting in an MMORPG, then you'll probably get bored very fast.3. Laggy a bit. This might just be for me and my dumb computer. But if you have just a general computer or laptop, you may experience some lag (not too much of it unless you're in a crowded area, but thats normal for every crowded MMORPG). The cutscenes don't work for me because of it. It may be different for you though! So don't stress over this point too much. 4. Some quests require you have a party of 3. If you are a solo player like me, that may serve a problem in trying to find and work the courage to work with people. There is a party finder so you can form parties for just the dungeon. However, for me, I like doing things alone and forming parties is awkward because then I have to figure out if I should leave the party or if they still want to work together, etc. So if you're a solo player, some of these moments might not be for you. 5. Very easy. This could be a pro as well if you like things easy. Bosses are not that hard, enemies are farley easy. (I've killed an enemy about 3 or 4 levels above me with not a problem). So if you like easy MMORPGs, this is for you. But if you like a challange, this may not be it. ---Overall, in my opinion, I really like this game and I think, despite the cons, I will continue to play this game. It's very beautiful and the scenery and characters are very well made. Even though quests become a routine, they have daily quests and fame quests that break the routine a little bit. If there was a 10 rating, i think it would go about 8.5/10. I would reccomend people to give this a try and see if it is their cup of tea.			"

												Looking for endless kill quest where you kill innocent camels, racoons, and other adorable creatures? WELL! You've come to the right place. This is an MMO that pretty much kills time. I go on it once and a while, when im bored, and none of my friends are on. You start off in a dream with the best gear in the game, then wake up and do the most IMPORTANT QUEST OF ALL TIME! Deliver jelly for a woman (... thats not a quest that like more of an errand...). Then you deliver a lunch, and get a job. Yep you literally go and get a job. You dont fall in a cave, find an enchanted blade, and go on a magical adventure. You pass out on the job, and when you wake theres an orb floating around your head. That turns out to be an Eidelon. A creature that really can't be killed and if you pick the healing one, it prevents you from dying. Ever. As the story progresses it gets better. Pirates, Robo gangs, uhhh... I dont remember much after that. OHH and you meet the person from your dream. Either way, this game isn't perfect, not by any means. I'd rate like a 5-6/10. But as a time passer? 10/10. Hours go by really quick.Final Rating: 6/10Game Itself: 5/10Story: 3/10Time Passer: 10/10Asthetics: 7/10Other important things....The weapons look cool, and they added a new class. You get vanity armor, but regular armor doesn't affect the way you look.			"

Product received for free
												Looking for a game close enought ot SAO?Well you've come to the right place, cause Aura Kingdom is only one of those anime themed MMORPGs that is as close to SAO...Grindy, but worth it. Lots of players (Especially on channel 1 of your chosen server) and a very active community. Weapons are very stylish, but the costume is hard to come by without advancing to get at least a decent Forest Ambassador outfit. There is a currency called Loyalty Points (Accumulated by doing certain daily quests, returning monster bounties, or in valuable chests) and if you continuously do these quests, getting a costume without abiding to microtransaction's tempting offers for the best looking costumes, can be pretty satisfying, include the mounts too which are kinda affordable. Eidolons, the pets which is already registered in your account and can be used by multiple characters depending if they are active on the other character, is very convenient as you won't be grinding hard again if you decide to create a 2nd character, but instead the keys 9which are used to summon them) can be saved to do an evolution for your eidolon. And lastly, I would like to commend the very interesting and versatile sub skill system. In lvl 40, you will be given a quest where you can pick your sub, but worry not, as your sub can be replaced for free!Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who likes MMORPGs with anime theme and an active community and fun to play dungeons.

												In my experience this game is actually pretty good. The characters are cute, the combat system is straight forward, and the quests and auto-routing makes this game, basically play itself. Now I'm not new to mmos, and I have played countless types of various styles and this one really caught my attention. What I like the most is that it's super easy to level up on your own, and you don't really have to rely on others. I've played other MMOs, where I simply couldn't progress on my own cause well, the character I made just wasn't fast/strong enough to gain the exp. Clerics suck, just saying but, I also can't play non-clerics/squishy characters. I also like how, you don't have to work as hard to level up to get those cooler looking skills, or in other words, you get to get those cool skills at the get go. Cause that's a major selling point for me, I'm all about the graphics and how flashy and cool you get to make your character. The edioleons are super cool, wish there was more of a way to pick which ones you get, or at least raise the chances of getting the one you want. If there is, well... I guess I haven't looked into it enough. But I'm also not the type to like grind for hours in the same dungeon to get something super rare however what I noticed from dungeoning it probably won't take too much time to get that shiny armour you want. Anyone willing to do that, super props to you. I never know how you do it. Other cool features are the gliding, the duel class option at level 40, dungeons and auto-loot pick up are super useful and that there is a pretty extensive fishing option. Armour and Weapon fortification is pretty simple too, making anyone able to upgrade their stuff; takes a lot of resources, but it's still fun and you're not likely going to loose your stuff if it fails. All of these I find super awesome cause these are stuff I wish was found in other games. TL;DR for pros: super easy to play on your own, has everything you can want in a game that you probably wouldn't have thought of. I barely scratched the surface of this game, and I bet it's even better when you dig deeper. Now what I don't like, and I don't know if this is just me, but I have played this game with a friend, and even though we were both playing the game, it didn't really feel like we played together. We were both just running about on our own, and talking in between when we were stuck. I'm super social when it comes to mmo games, but the fact that there isn't the shared loot pickup for quests, or that exp isn't shared between us, it really feels like a solo game. The best you can do is just stand around and kill stuff while waiting for your friend. And a lot of the quests are specifically solo anyways. What also bothered me is the mouse controls. You get used to them as you play (not really) but the two camera functions can really hinder you in a bind. Like one camera simply rotates around your character, and the other one actually makes your character turn with it. So like I know during boss fights, I turn my camera a lot to look at different angles, but I don't nessecarily need my character to be turnt around too cause some skills require them to be facing a monster. So with that, sometimes I would need to run away to get out of a red zone, and I find myself using the wrong camera move, and I just have my character running backwards super slowly, and usually on the verge of death now. (I'm not the type to click-to-move) And some mobs jump around a lot so you need that camera moving.And another is the skill keys hot-bar. There are waaaay too many skills to fit on one hot bar and it's inconvient how they only go up to 8. I used to it going up to the ""="" key. Plus with the eidoleon skills, mounts, glide features and other stuff I can't remember, you are't left with a lot of space, especially when the second class comes into play. So you're left with like maybe 4 of your favourite skills from each class.TL;DR for the cons:It doesn't feel as social of a game going by my standards. There isn't that sense of playing with friends, but just having them on the side (but thats not too bad). The mouse controls are super annoying and the hot-bars don't have enough space and can get pretty cluttered.Overall:I would totally recommend. There's a lot I complained about, but really they don't affect gameplay that much. If you know what you're doing it's pretty meaningless. 10/10			"

												At first, I really liked Aura Kingdom. It's bright, colorful, has very engaging combat, and is, just in general, fun.... but only for the first two levels (Or 'locations.') Later in the game, you start to wonder ""What the hell am I doing and what does any of this have to do with the story?"" This will happen A LOT.Here's an example from one of the earlier quests where such an instance first appears. You need to make medicen for your character because he/she passed out. Well, you need antilope blood. Okay, fine. But you need to kill six of the giant creatures for their blood. WHAT THE HELL? HOW MUCH BLOOD DOES THIS DOCTOR NEED FOR LITTLE OL' ME?! This is fine in those quests where the particular creature you're killing needs to be driven out of the area, but when you need to collect items from them? It's VERY monotonous. Another reason this sucks is that, when you're collecting items from creatures, there is a 20% chance that you will actually get the item you need. As a rough estimate, if you have to kill 4 fish to get scales, you'll probably have to kill 8 fish to get the four sets of scales. This becomes even worse when, in higher level areas, you have to kill 7 and 14 creatures to gather the specified number of itmes you need to complete a ""Main Quest"" that doesn't seem to have anything to do with the story. This makes playing the game the way your suppose to a chore. Another problem this game has is its dungeons. These are usually big cave-like areas where you fight large waves of monsters. Most Dungeons require the player to be in a party of three to actually activate it. This would be fine if players in this game were actually considerate. No one wants anything to do with you unless you wear expensive costumes and hats, or have the best mounts and weapons. It's like, if Team Fortress 2 met World of Warcraft in a very ill-considerate and rude way. This is most evident, unfortunatly, for players who speak english. My first language is english and my spanish is a little rusty (But little to no spanish speaking players play this game anyway) meaning I am stuck dealing with the ruder end of the player pool, which is the dominant end. The worst part is these dungeons are REQUIRED to finish the story. Which means you could be stuck for a LONG time on the same main quest, not because you cannot defeat the enemies because they, themselves, are quite easy, but because no one wants to join you. Making friends in this game is hard for the same reason, even if the player is a noob at the same time you are and has the first constume as well. This game is so pay to win it hurts.In all, Aura Kingdom is a game with lovely visuals, fun combat, a promising story, rude and selfish majority players, monotonus quests and pointless quests. Have fun.			"

												Do NOT spend money on this game. If you wish to get all the ""cool looking"" mounts, clothing, weapons, summons. Don't even waste your time spending money on this game, First of all the instant you buy their points they lock you out of even being able to purchase items. You have to go through a long painful proccess of sending them information through a ticket, which in set they take forever to reply to. Only for them to finally unlock that ascpect of your game so you can purchase things. Now, moving onto the problem. I was in the mindset of wasting my money getting the cool things I wanted in the game to make my character more personally appealing. I found that to be a utter joke with this company, not only did I waste money, but I found out they are scumbags. You go to buy the item, thinking you are going to get what you purchased and no wrong. Instead you click on the icon you obtained for the item and it becomes a treasure luck box pretty much in a sense. In this case you MAY obtain the item you were hoping for, instead I constantly got health pots. I think this is a utter joke, a rip off and a scam. Do NOT label your items as if you were to directly obtain said item, instead make it labeled a luck box and CLEARLY show that you can not be able to obtain the item. Instead of doing it after you buy the item and waste money.			"

												Played this up to about level 10 (which only took a couple hours at most) and hopped around to different characters trying them out, and the conclusion I've come to is .If you want a carebear game, where you can play the whole time without even touching the keyboard, this game is for you! It even takes you to quest destinations and npcs just by clicking on the quest tracker.  You get ""flying"" and a ground mount withing the first 3-5 levels.  I never got into crafting, so I can't say anything about that. As far as artwork goes, it's a very stylized anime type artwork, which looks pretty decent, and there weren't any real animation issues I noticed like other F2P games have.  Overall pretty smooth.  If you want a free game you can play with a friend/lover/neighbor's pet then this game is great for you.  I'm anticipating they add automated combat soon so they game will play itself for you while you watch.			"

												So far so good i currently have 71 hours, so not that much. There is quite a variety of events so you are basically never bored, the costumes, mounts wings etc, are very well desgined. Although i would like it if we get to dye our weapons and wings in the future. The community itself: for people that just started the game without knowing anyone else playing this game it will be hard to do dungeons, because most of the high level players dont join your party due to your level. But that does not mean that you dont have helpfull players, and that is also why joining a guild as soon as possible is highly recommended. BUt overall i would recommend this game if you are a fan of anime, or if you like MMORPS where you can look fancy.Pros; Lots of different costumes, mounts and etc. Variety of fun events. Although you can spend money for better looking costumes, it also gives the F2P a fair chance of getting items that p2p can get too. It also gives you the option to choose a subclass which is amazing, it gives your additional kit lots of extras.Cons: You will do alot of auto-pathing, The community is not always that friendly/helpfull for new players. (atleast that is my experience). Drop rates could be a bit higher in my opinion. BUt overall i really recommend this game 8.7/10			"

I guess it is pretty easy to reach around 55-60 (that is where main story ends). Now, this game is pretty easy to learn and it well designed (with the typical MMO controls). You better try it out with some friends because it will be a way better experience and will allow you to level up pretty fast.Overall, a cool game to play with friends 8/10. It is worth trying.			"

												Though I kinda agree with the few reviewers that AERIA indeed has quite slow and awful customer support. I would still recommend you to play this game. Although Aura Kingdom is kinda old and may not have the player base that it used to have. The game is still fun overall, it takes your mind off things should you play it. There are tons of things that you can do. From Archaeology all the way up to designing your House's interior ( which is a new implementation btw). And lets not forget about the fact, that Aura has a very friendly community. PS: I too came out from inactivity, their replies did indeed took quite a while, and even worse is that, if you try to reply them on email after they answered your ticket, your reply won't reach them. So, I recommend that you continue answering their questions through their website. And another thing, if you too, came out from the tempory ban due to inactivity and was required to answer a few questions. Some of your answers doesn't have to be that specific. I mean, no one actually remembers everything anyway. The few most important things that they actually need from you is the original email, a character name, and a server. And if you ever purchased AP, then a transaction #. And yes, I too did find it quite bothering that I would have to go through all of it. But if you really want to play it again, just be a little patient, it's not like you're gonna die from waiting anyway. "

												A fun anime mmorpg, but the cons outweigh the pros sadly. I played up to level 30ish with the Guardian class. Not entirely F2P, but most components can be played without irl money. 6/10Pros: - Cooking and Fishing minigames are a nice addition and feel refreshing imo- Always a fan of anime visuals for both monsters and people/NPCs- Environments are pretty- You can solo quests that require dungeon instances.- Tons of available quests throughout the world. Some include ""sneaking"" instances which was surprising to me.Cons:- Camera is clunky. Mouse cursor is not locked to game window.- Quests are too easy. You can click and your character will automatically run to quest givers, preventing exploration of levels.- Combat feels too easy. (or at least for Guardian class.) No mana or stamina encourages spamming buttons.- Certain quests require you to have irl cash on hand (cannot go F2P, but fortunately they are mainly side-quests)- Skill tree and mastery make little difference.- Eidolons pop-up too frequently, interrupting gameplay. (I haven't found a way to turn off eidolen notifications)- Cutscenes of just white text on a black background breaks immersion.			"

												I remember when i was younger i would spend hours on end with my friend or by myself playing and its great if you love anime. One of the best things is it always makes you crawl back for more and dont believe those reviews saying its pay to win or its glitchy or laggy bad graphics you get it. ITS YOUR COMPUTER FIX IT.			"

												Well my playtime says it all..... Literally after a level up a couple times, I stand there idle so I can use the bathroom or get some food and then my computer bluescreens. Only when I play this game. Doesn't happen with anything else... just this one. I only have one character and I am level 5.... If this game can't be trusted on my computer, I do not recommend it to anyone else.			"

												It is a good game (mostly for anime fans). There are bugs though that some times make you really angry. I only played the game for 2 hours and i am already level 21. I guess it is pretty easy to reach around 55-60 (that is where main story ends). Now, this game is pretty easy to learn and it well designed (with the typical MMO controls). You better try it out with some friends because it will be a way better experience and will allow you to level up pretty fast.Overall, a cool game to play with friends 8/10. It is worth trying.			"

												This is a very nice MMORPG, you have lots of skills and the option to get a second class further in the game makes it even more interesting. You also have companions which are called Eidolons that help you in your fightsThe kawaii anime design is great, the fishing system is actually fun, and ther is an interesting and not too hard crafting system. But the quests sometimes can be boring (slay monsters, get drops, talk to someone) and I don`t think the story is deep or anything, doesn`t look like that is the goal of the gameNevertheless I positively recommend this game, if you like the genre it`s really enjoyable and good source of fun, be you casual or hardcorePs: Note that I don`t play PvP so I have no opinion on the game being unbalanced or pay to win			"

												Ok, so after weeks of addiction, its about time I posted my thoughts on Aura Kingdom! :D The Game Ok so Aura Kingdom is an awesome Free 2 Play Fantasy/Anime MMO. Set in the semi-linear world of Azuria, you are an Envoy of Gaia, a human with special abilities and the power to summon powerful & mysterious partners called Eidolons to your aid, as you travel the world, defeating monsters, helping the towns, and defending against the ShadowKnights, a strange and powerful foe! Discover your Eidolons true potential by fighting alongside with them and leveling them up, into more powerful forms (somewhat like Pokemon :P ) and use their skills to aid you in battle with the upper-hand!12 awesome classes to choose from, including Ravager (High DMG), Scythe (Necromancer) & Grenadier (2-Handed Cannon Wielder), and blast, slice & shoot through the games many challenging dungeons and Main Quest line. Become a dual-class at Lvl40 with the ability to adopt a 2nd classes skills (for example a Tachi + Katar), and gain many more kickass skills and abilities!  Pro's - Very balanced classes (PvP can be won by any mix-up of classes)- Amazing soundtrack (very fitting for areas, a little repetitive, but fitting)- Great Group Events (including Battlefields, enhanced Dungeons, and special Party Quests)- Smooth Graphics (easy on the eyes, simple, but aestheticly pleasing)- Lots of backstory / lore (Simply read what people have to say, it will make sense)- Not Pay2Win (Can easily get to Max Lvl with High Quality gear, without spending a cent! (although you can get some cool looking apparel and mounts, etc for some cash if you wanna spend) Con's - Main Quests can be pretty repetitive (lots of Fetch Quests, Kill X Amount of Monsters, etc)- Hit Boxes is slightly Buggy (sometimes cannot target opponent until they hurt you first)- Sudden jump in EXP needed to Lvl after 45 (1-45 quick leveling, 45+ is grindy) OVERALL Overall, I love Aura Kingdom, its an amazing MMO that I would highly recommend trying, especially with friends (plus Bonus EXP in parties so Win-Win! XD) Give it a go, and if you don't enjoy it, no money was lost since F2P! :DOverall Score - 8.5/10			"

												A fun anime mmorpg, but the cons outweigh the pros sadly. I played up to level 30ish with the Guardian class. Not entirely F2P, but most components can be played without irl money. 6/10Pros: - Cooking and Fishing minigames are a nice addition and feel refreshing imo- Always a fan of anime visuals for both monsters and people/NPCs- Environments are pretty- You can solo quests that require dungeon instances.- Tons of available quests throughout the world. Some include ""sneaking"" instances which was surprising to me.Cons:- Camera is clunky. Mouse cursor is not locked to game window.- Quests are too easy. You can click and your character will automatically run to quest givers, preventing exploration of levels.- Combat feels too easy. (or at least for Guardian class.) No mana or stamina encourages spamming buttons.- Certain quests require you to have irl cash on hand (cannot go F2P, but fortunately they are mainly side-quests)- Skill tree and mastery make little difference.- Eidolons pop-up too frequently, interrupting gameplay. (I haven't found a way to turn off eidolen notifications)- Cutscenes of just white text on a black background breaks immersion.			"

												Though I kinda agree with the few reviewers that AERIA indeed has quite slow and awful customer support. I would still recommend you to play this game. Although Aura Kingdom is kinda old and may not have the player base that it used to have. The game is still fun overall, it takes your mind off things should you play it. There are tons of things that you can do. From Archaeology all the way up to designing your House's interior ( which is a new implementation btw). And lets not forget about the fact, that Aura has a very friendly community. PS: I too came out from inactivity, their replies did indeed took quite a while, and even worse is that, if you try to reply them on email after they answered your ticket, your reply won't reach them. So, I recommend that you continue answering their questions through their website. And another thing, if you too, came out from the tempory ban due to inactivity and was required to answer a few questions. Some of your answers doesn't have to be that specific. I mean, no one actually remembers everything anyway. The few most important things that they actually need from you is the original email, a character name, and a server. And if you ever purchased AP, then a transaction #. And yes, I too did find it quite bothering that I would have to go through all of it.

												bots everywhere, in my server you can see 10 bots in your screen ( especially grenadier ) at specific farm spot with same eidolon, same outfit , default look, and that's the fact. the chain of aura kingdom ( most of mmorpg actually )when you have reached level 60 , you need gold to buy stuffs , i heard a lot about dungeon grinding, but the drop rate really not good,  then i tried WB-ing at VV and BB, i saw many lv ??/80 people with their party and their guild. so if you want to WB-ing ( paragon table to get gold ) you have to join guild with good people , at least lv80, the problem is those guilds don't want to accept people like me ( newbie 60 ) with green set , and they only want to accept highly geared member. evil chain.pardon my english, and my hours on record , sry i download it on steam just want to review it, i don't play it on steam.but at last, i recommend this game because you know, it's aura kingdom ( with glitches and lag ofc ) good game with great system, gliding is fun ( i don't need 90% movespeed mount for show off in navea because you know i have glide boost my MSPD to 255% , show off is not good brother! )			"

												Always Always always been into the art style AND  the Game play itself isn't so bad. but if anyone can say much in its more faulty side, they need to cool it on the in game market, plus the inability to spend points you bought with irl cash. say, they wont let you spend points you bought a year ago, but its like, if you buy in game premium currency, wait around two weeks to spend it and the game will tell you its an item mall item code error 99/ which is an in game error preventing you to spend in game currency. clear this up. and the Damage glitch in PvP, clear that as those who know are spreading this glitch to everyone else and its causing widespread unfair competitive game play within the AK gaming community. also, make gold easier to obtain, over the years of playing this game ive seen the Dev's become more and more greedy, employing Tawdry and sleazy tactics to practically force players to buy hold, pay for the premium currency, or purchase gold from shady third party providers Via PayPal. it isn't right. other than these issues the game hits the spot with many a way. thank you for reading this post and i hope it provides assistance towards making AK a better place for people to come and game as they please.

Right click and press buttons in the same combo each time, dodge the red areas.-Lag from EU - could just be me, but I get a better connection to China from UK, so not really sure why my ping was so high.-Generic quests - Gather, kill X of this ETC.-Lack of customisation at the character creation screen.-Really really weird login - it took me sometime to actually get my old Aeria account working with it.Overall I'd only play this game casually - I don't think it'd be worth putting a lot of time into it.

												I liked this game up until an hour in and I recieved the message ""Your connection has been inturrupted."" I think ""okay, maybe a connection problem."" I log off for the night. Next morning I decide to log back in, no character. I created a new one and play, once again, an hour in I recieve the same message and am logged out. New character gone. I enjoyed the gameplay (What you would expect of an MMO) although the camera controls are a bit frustrating during a fight. Perhaps I will give it another try later but for now I think I will find a different MMO. (I am kind of a new player on PC so that also influences my opinion.)			"

It is easy to play, the controls aren't too bad, and there's lots of customization for your character, as well  as quests. It's a tad, repetitive however, but it's pretty fun to play.

												A cashgrab, plain and simple.  The only way to get gear is to spend real money, the only way to upgrade your gear is to spend real money.  Endgame content contains no drops other than cosmetic changes to your character.  Leveling requires your level 20/30/40/etc character to clear multiple zones all10-12+ levels below your character in order for you to ""progress"" in a story that has no place being in an MMORPG.  If you really want to play this garbage have someone else power level your character, do the Sky Tower raid once, then go back to WoW for $15/mo or go download TERA off Steam for free.  Both are far superior to this piece of trash.  I only wish I could go back and tell myself before installing this how much trash it was, so that I could get my playtime back and spend in on something more worthwhile... like watching paint dry or the grass grow.0/10Recommendation: DO NOT BUY and BURN IT WITH FIRE			"

												I've been playing Aura for nearly eight hours and just can't stop!!It's really a fantastic MMO RPG game with cute Anime-style character design, beautiful graphic, great weapon and costume system. The fusion and cast system are also worth trying!The only disappointment to me is that there's almost no character voice. The dialogues are just silent with only the background music and gestures, making me a little bored after frequent readings. I hope that Aeria games can add voices to this game.If you want to play it for fun, just choose the free version like I do. Sometimes, there're also official events that can grant you free but awesome stuff that deserves your attention. If you want to get much deeper into the game, you need to pay for equipments, weapons and other stuff. However...REALLY EXPENSIVE...So think twice before throwing money into it.Still, I strongly recommend this game to all players who love MMO.			"

												I'm still not sure if I'd say YES or NO for this game and it makes me wish that there's a MAYBE option for the reviews...Why I'd say YES is that the game nas a good story to it, nice mechanics and partly uses the old 'find the NPC you need' system. Sadly though, the story quests are fixed NPCs and you can walk there with auto-path (I even tried the game while knowing the feature is there).I'd say NO because the animations are very clunky and the game lags like hell. Though lag might also be caused for the servers to be located on the US West-coast while I play from Europe, I would certainly play more if it wasn't such an issue.Last but not least, the cash shop. I'm too low in the game to be able to judge Pay2Win or not, but it does look like it's Pay2Win. This while there's a lot of fluff cosmetic, mounts and eidalons (not sure how severe P2W those are) in it as well.In general said YES because I think the game is fun to play...			"

												It's no YGGDRASIL (haha Overlord reference), but it has a certain charm to it that keeps me coming back. Very nice for a free to play game. The controls were terrible to start with, but after heavy key-bind changing they became bearable. Also, for some weird reason the volume is muted by default, so look out for that. Anyway, the game is fun and the people are nice enough so I'd say give it a try. Just be prepared to deal with SAO fans...who even watches that garbage?

												Not gonna write too much, but I will say what I like and dislike about AK.PROS:-Graphics. One of the most beautiful MMOs I've ever played.-Gameplay. It's great that you don't need MP/Mana for attacks since they have cooldowns instead.-Classes. The classes are very diversed, in my opinion.-Eidolons. I love the eidolon system because it's definitely something new that has been brought to the table of MMOs.CONS:-Quests. Most of them are usually fetch or killing quests. But occasionally there are quests that let you take a new perspective on a situation.-A few translation errors. Very rare, but it does make it a little confusing to some players.-Grinding. Yes, it's gonna happen. No matter which MMO you're playing, it's gonna happen.-Like all games, glitches. It's not a rare sight to see a bug or glitch happening, despite how good a game is.That's all that I have to say. I might be nitpicking a little but that's just me. Overall, try AK out. It's definitely one of my favourite MMOs.			"

												I love this game, I think it's so fun. I'll admit, after you play 30+ hours the game can get a little repetitive (Go here, kill this amount of these), but that doesn't stop me from coming back and playing it more. I love the customization, and I think the anime style is very cute. I personally prefer PvE, so I don't know much about PvP in this game. But, I can tell you the PvE is very fun and will have you hooked. The quest line is good. There's always something for you to do, from any level. I have kept mostly to the main quest line, but I've done a side quest here and there (though personally I have found that you dont really need to do them, as your level should stay consistent with the difficulty). Overall I really like this game, and would give it a 9/10 (minus one star because of the repetition).			"

												Aura Kingdom is a good F2P game. I mainly say it's good because it's the very first time I play a MMORPG for over 100 hours! Anime-like style fits perfectly with the general atmosphere. Companions, pets and worlds are nicely designed. Other reasons to play this game are: fast and entertaining combat system, monthly updates, various minigames and the fact that every server won't ever be empty. Can't talk about the shop because I never bought anything, what I can say you is that you can buy cosmetics and stuff like that even with the game currency. There's litterally no reason to prevent you from playing this game.			"

												 An incredibly easy, yet charming experience. If you're into anime and gimmicky systems this is the game for you. For war ing though, I got extremely bored once I got to end game content. If you look past that the game is good enough to drop a few hours into.			"

												I love this game, I think it's so fun. I'll admit, after you play 30+ hours the game can get a little repetitive (Go here, kill this amount of these), but that doesn't stop me from coming back and playing it more. I love the customization, and I think the anime style is very cute. I personally prefer PvE, so I don't know much about PvP in this game. But, I can tell you the PvE is very fun and will have you hooked. The quest line is good. There's always something for you to do, from any level. I have kept mostly to the main quest line, but I've done a side quest here and there (though personally I have found that you dont really need to do them, as your level should stay consistent with the difficulty). Overall I really like this game, and would give it a 9/10 (minus one star because of the repetition).			"

												This is a very simple, yet very complex game. I find it difficult to stop playing and want to keep playing to ""just finish one more quest!"" The only issue i have is that it was not 100% clear how to fight. I found out through trial and error that it was the right-click on the mouse to attack as well as do other things. Despite that it is a very addicting game and i'm having so much fun playing it!Edit 30/12/2015: Since writing this review i have now gotten to level 58 and i'm currently working toward unlocking the sky tower at level 60. I stand by my comment that it's a game that you want to just keep playing to just ""finish one more quest"". As for the issue i mentioned about the controls i have since realised that all controls can be found here: http://aurakingdom.aeriagames.com/game/controls along with tips and all sorts of other bits of help for the game which makes it easier to both complete quests and to know what you are doing. The graphics are really good, the costumes are cute, the game is comples with several different main locations (almost like floors in a dungeon really) as well as several dungeons to play in as well. There are quests you can do on your own and quests you can do with others. I quite like the sound of the guardian knight feature as well - though i have yet to actually try it. In my opinion i would sy this game was definitely worth a play, you never know you might learn to love it!			"

												It's the best Anime MMORPG out there. Gather some friends and fly through the skies with your burning wings.There's 13 different classes. So there's plenty of spells and attacks. It's truly Amazing! It's not like any other.The creators of this game, Well Done son!  I'd rate 8.5/10 -- Hard to choose class, When you've chosen one you like, Then all good. -- All classes are good in their own way. Weak in damage? Maybe Op in healing instead!			"

												Hello, in this review, you will find every little detail you need to know about this game.So basically, you create your own warrior, and you complete quests throughout the game. I personally love leveling up, but i wish i can make some friends :(Okay, so what you need to know :This game is, of course, an MMORPG. You create your player with a selection of 12 classes. After you selected your character features, you have to choose your eidolon. Eidolons are basically partners that stay with you on your journey ( Pokemon-ish lol ). You begin the game in a dimensional belt or something. You fight your way to the boss. Somehow you end up in a small town next to the ocean. You have to complete some tasks for the people. After this, you move on to the next area, then the next and so on. The max level is 80 I believe, and once you reach over 70, your level turns into ??. I've been playing for a long time, and honestly, I love this game so much. If you would like to meet me in-game go ahead, but ofc you would have to be my friend, or if you already are, well you get the point. Okay well I hope this helped. And yes, I recommend this game DONT ASK ME QUESTIONS STEAM MY GOSH.......Sorry steam was asking me if i recommend this game. Well bye bye!It's kind of hard to list pros and cons since this game never ends. But everything for this game on a scale from 1-10, I say this game rates a 7. I'm very addicted to it.. Lol			"

												Ok lets be honest, a game like this is only as good as the community. Sadly the reviews on here talk alot about bots and the sad fact that people just keep to their guilds and such. It's all valid (Though i've had no problems with bots, i guess it's a end game majority problem), but where's the problem in that? Every game has bots, spammers and people playing multiple accounts. And people keeping to their guilds...? That's perfect, that's what makes for great guilds, the people being more social and having a better understanding of eachother.The game is cute, it's anime based and the pet system is awesome (Eidolon system). In all the game is great; a true gamer would understand that grind is life. Overall it's a good game that's been disliked by a small, viewed as majority for some reason, community of players that no longer play the game. They don't know if things have changed, they don't know if things are worse...Judge something with your own eyes, not based on the gossip of random strangers. Have a nice time playing and a nice life. Peace.			"

												What a great game. The grafix and clothing design are sick, but you have to spend money to get it like all the great mounts and extra clothing (so that sucks).  The battlegrounds are a waste to even try, you will just get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥even with full pvp gear. If you are lvl 50 they will still put you up with lvl 70 players they all one hit you, so its a shamefull 15min, its die spawn repeat or you just wait out the time and cant do anything.  This game you have to have lots of friends or you wont be able to do any party runs at your level, very hard getting people randomly to join you. For a anima fan the clothing you get visually makes this great eye candy and the spells and attacks animation are very well done. Overal not bad game but you will have to spend to look great and you need friends who can play with you at the same time lines. The worst part about this game is the timing of events, like the tower that only opens at certain times, if you cant be online you will never be able to do them.			"

												I love this game alot, and I used to play it before i moved to my new Mac (biggest mistake ever). I would love it if this game becomes available on Mac OSX but overall I would recommend playing this. It's really frustrating since mac cant play this game and I am having issues installing window OSX. Nevertheless I am coming back to this game no matter what.			"

												An Anime style MMO that I really wish I knew about sooner. I was surprised that when I gave this game a try (made a Scythe,) that it managed to pull me in very fast, with nothing but enjoyment. I haven't had an Anime style MMO do this to me in so long since Phantasy Star Online 2 when it was in Open Beta. I played Mabinogi for a solid two years, but I just lost any enjoyment I had with that game, because of how Pay to Win it was, along with how ignorant and elitist the Community is for all of Nexon's published Games.However, even though this game did pull me in, and I have enjoyed the almost 80 hours I have put into it, it definitely does have some flaws (All MMOs have flaws.)Pros:-Classes: I took a look at what each of the classes do before I decided to start my journey, and while they all performed pretty well in what I have seen from Youtube, I decided to go with the Scythe, because I love Ranged DPS (This will also be a Con,) and I love that the Pets you summon give you benefits depending on which 3 of the 6 demons are summoned.  It's definitely crazy how high your Crit and Speed gets along the way, especially around level 55.-Outfits: A lot of the outfits in this game are definitely what you would expect from an Anime-style MMO (Especially for Female characters, which I chose for my Scythe). I listed this as a Pro, because while you only get a certain amount of Costumes from doing the Main Storyline in each are, there are actually a lot of Outfits in this game that you can also get from other sources. There aren't that many Costumes on the Shop either, which is also a plus, because it isn't Pay to Dress up.-Fishing: Yes, Fishing. The bane of every one's existence in pretty much every MMO. The one skill that will leave you bored for hours. Believe it or not, but in Aura Kingdom, Fishing is actually VERY useful, and profitable. As you fish, you can come across Fish in your inventory that when opened, can give EXP, Items for your Eidilons to feed them, Fusion materials for Orange quality Fishing Gear, Weapon Chests, and for some very odd reason, Costumes. Yes. You can get Costumes from Fishing. Most of them are not worth selling, but if you get the Custom variants (Orange,) you're going to easily pocket 50+ Gold just by selling it on the Auction House. Fishing is very profitable because you can sell the Costumes you get (low chance to get them though,) and you can open the Weapon Chests to get Weapons that you can sell to Vendors for about 100 - 200 silver (especially when you get the Level 60 Weapon Chests in the 60 areas. It's actually one of your two main sources for making income at Level 60+, unless you run the end game dungeons and get lucky on drops.-Community: You don't know how incredibly hard it is for some one of my status to list the Community as a Pro for an MMO. I have been a part of the MMO Community since Everquest, and while every single one of them suffer from the typical cesspool players and elitists, Aura Kingdom so far has been very tame, and friendly. Other than the Dimensional Halls, I have not done any Party Dungeons at all while I was leveling, but every Dimensional Hall party I was in was just friendly in general.-Soundtrack: While the Soundtrack itself does get repetitive quick in-game, and some times reused in different areas (especially for the Daily Fame / Emergency Quests,) it definitely has some that you will probably like. Candeo Core's Soundtrack is so far my favorite.-Cash Shop: Other than Runescape's Cash Shop, and Phantasy Star Online 2's, this is one of the Cash Shops that contain VERY LITTLE Pay-to-win aspects to it. You can get Weapon / Armor Fortifications and Eidolons from the Cash Shop, but you will easily get Fortifications while questing, doing dungeons, or from doing the Dailies each and every day. The Eidolons on the other hand, is pretty much like Mabinogi's Gachapons. You have a chance to receive a certain Eidolon's Key in order to obtain them, or Fragments to combine a bunch later on into a Key. This isn't really Pay-to-Win because you can obtain Eidolons from doing the Eidolon Temple, Guild Hall, or Abyss / Otherworld dungeons when they reset.Cons:-Story: MMOs usually fall into one of two categories when it comes to Story. It either succeeds very well with it, and engages you, or you just want to hate it. Unfortunately, the Story in Aura Kingdom falls under this category. Other than the Tutorial area and Port Skandia, every Main Storyline in the rest of the areas is literally the same thing. This Town needs you to retrieve what was stolen. This town has a competition and needs you to help to get what you need. Alliances need to be formed. Yada yada. Pretty much when you are doing the quests in Aura Kingdom, you're better off just speeding through the Dialogue so you can get from one area to the next.-Generic Quests: You know those Kill / Collect quests you LOVE so much from other MMOs, especially World of Warcraft? That's literally around 95% of the questing you will do. If the Anime Style of this Game, the Soundtrack, or the classes don't keep you in the game, this most certainly won't.-Classes: ""But wait, Entro. You already put Classes in the Pros. Why is it in the Cons?"" The main reason why is it also listed as a Con, is because of the Dungeon aspect. I will be blunt when I say this: At level 60+, if you are ANY Melee Class that is not a Guardian, don't expect to find any Parties, unless you're running with a Guild. Bosses in the end-game dungeons are VERY unforgiving to those in Melee Range, and you will die incredibly fast unless you are a Guardian, which is the Tank Class of Aura Kingdom. -Telegraphed Attacks: Pretty much all you will notice from Dungeon Elites / Bosses in this game is that they have Telegraphed Attacks, and a lot of them at that. I like being able to go into a dungeon blind and expecting some thing difficult, and figuring out how to dodge after I learn a bosses' given moveset. What I don't like is when it colors the Ground to basically show you ""Don't stand here or you will get hit."" This kind of feature is what pushes me away from MMOs with it included, because it takes out most of the fun and learning of dungeons right out of the game. Granted, enemies and bosses can still melee, cast spells or ranged at you normally, along with debuffing, but for the most part, you'll mostly see Telegraphed Attacks.-Eidolons: While leveling, you will get a total of three Eidolons that will accompany you. You can have only one out at a time, which is fair considering how strong they are (mainly their Special which is on a 1 minute cooldown.) The problem though, is that unless you are extremely lucky and RNG plays in your favor, you won't get more than the three default Eidolons for a long time. When you do every thing I listed in the Pros, either killing the boss or fighting the Eidolon and succeeding gives you a chance (very low) that the Eidolon will acknowledge your skills and join your party. While that is a nice feature, your only focus is pretty much just to level up the stats and levels of one of your Eidolons, specifically Sigrun (the second Eidolon,) since she is tanky, and can keep most of the aggro on her, until you start hitting and critting like crazy.-Leveling and difficulty: If you tough out the quests and the dungeons, Leveling actually goes by very fast. It begins to slow down at 45, again at 55, and then 60 - 70 turns into every Korean MMOs' long grind. For me personally, it took me 40 hours of on and off play to level up to 60, which when you look at it, isn't actually a bad grind, but if you don't like how the quests are, it will draw you away quickly. I never died once while leveling either, which is a bummer because I was hoping for more difficulty.Final Verdict: 8/10. For me, I would still recommend it to my friends that like these kind of Anime-style MMOs.			"

												Monsters, Quests, a tale of Epic Adventures. An outstanding mmorpg when compared to the rest. An amazing experience.WhoCares.The most fun you can have in this game is stripping down to your underwear and dancing in the starter city to hypnotize the new players. Give it 5 minutes TOPS and you are in a random party with strangers also in their underwear all chatting ""XD"" and ""Lol Join us!"" You will be dancing half bare for quite some time. Eventually after an hour or so you get bored and then you do quests or fight monsters or some fancy jazz like that. Really its all irrelevent after your daily dance.			"

												Took me 15 minutes to get the options adjusted. especially that the sound started out muted, so had to exit game and restart, as the options are only accessable from the launcher?Once in game, there was only one race available (despite the cutscene shortly after intro quest showing other nonhuman races. Though there were many classes, there was no showcasing of their roles beyond a 3-star rating of things like attack, defense, single target, area damage, healing, & support. The intro is one that's been done before in a lot of games i've played were you get a few battles with your class at an absurd power level. SAdly in this game, it's just beefed up numbers, you don't get to play with advanced skills or anything, just the 2 starting abilities for the class i picked.Oh yeah, it's also packed with horridly obnoxious tutorial overlays that don't go away until you actually DO the thing they tell you to... and then they show up again to remind you to do that thing that way even after you've gotten rid of them once. and they flash too. This intro only BARELY covers game mechanics too.I'd rather play a game that throws you into it with no turorial, or a tutorial that's a full on hand-hold through ALL the game mechanics.The UI is horrendously clunky, and i didn't get the feelgin that character would stand out. Walking aroudn the starting town, i was presented with both quests and 'eavesdropping' spots. Where normalyl quests and their turnin places are yellow or gold or such, in this the actual quest indicators are silver, and the 'stand here and see NPCs talking"" parts are gold.i know every MMO out there is all about the 'endgame content' though, and that means they all suffer from the start of the stories and game getting little to no attention.

Its really easy too level in this game until you hit level 45 from 45 - 50 is the longest grind in the game by far because the level cap used to be 50 but Im pretty sure is now rasied to 80 this game is really enjoyable and is a great free 2 play subsitute to world of warcaft I HIGHLY recomend this game its really good			"

												I will rate this game on nthe basis of 3 different categories1.Gameplay2.Graphics3.Enjoyment1.Gameplay-9/10, This game is a semi real time action/mmorpg game and for a semi real time game, the combat system is really fluid, it's also fairly simple and does not suffer from any bugs, it also helps that all the moves are enjoyable to look at.2.Graphics-9/10-Great graphics, especially the anime art style, the models are all smooth and do not look weird, backgrounds are beautiful too, though needs better optimization.3.Enjoyment-8.5/10, it is pretty simple to play and really enjoyable, quests dont feel like chores and fighting the mobs are always fun, but the games needs to promote more team play, it just seems boring playing alone and PVP needs to be improved.Overall 9/10If you are a fan of anime you will love this game.

												This game is old but makes me nostalgic about other MMORPG related about anime.Have a lot of awesome cosmetics and cool weapons. Have a lot of daily quest for farming loyality points.Cool combination of skills for 2 jobs of choice. Can farm xp just by fishing and have a lot of king fish that spawns in different time and location. Bunch of usefull eidolons, either the basic eidolons nor the legendary eidolons.8.5/10			"

												Fails to catch you from the get-go, complain about my hours if you like but if a game fails to grab your attention within 60 minutes it's not worthy of your time. Part of game development is making sure a game is entertaining at all stages including the early stages. Just like you wouldn't expect a song to start with 20 seconds of fart noises you would expect the same of a game. Plenty of better free MMOs out there, try Tera, try Archeage.

												This game is great, it has unique mechanics, good graphics(unless you have a crappy computer like me), the story isn't important, all that's important is that you got to go out and kill some stuff to make yourself stronger that ever, and with the dual class mechanic, you can play in ways you simply can't normally do in MMOs. I only ever quit due to my impatience and screwups with character leveling. Play this game if you like Anime and MMOs. Since it's free, there's nothing to lose if you don't like it.			"

The combat system is great, there's really good diversity across all the different classes (There's a ton of them), and the anime art style looks amazing. If you get a friend or two to play this with, it makes the game way more fun, whether you're questing, dueling, or whatever. Just get this game, it's awesome.			"

General GameplayAura Kingdom can be a little grindy but in the end it's fun and easy to get most of the stuff, specially if you play with friends.The story is interesting but a little childish and predictable.Gameplay Rating: 4/5EngineGamebryoGraphics OptionsThe game has a good set of graphics options.Graphics QualityThe graphics are cel shaded, anime like, makes it all more interesting and different from the standard.PerformanceThe engine doesn't take advantage of modern hardware, and suffers because of that.Engine Rating: 3/5Overall Rating: 7/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and engine (how the game looks and runs).

												Ok, so I can agree. This game has a good fantasy feeling to it, unlike other MMORPGs that just make you bored in 5 minutes of gameplay. The game classes contain some awesome gear and interesting spells, especially when you're the new class.Here are my GOOD sides and my BAD sides:GOOD:1. Class selection is wide ranged, unlike other MMORPGs.2. Recieving free gifts each day and a free eidelon (an in-game pet for starters).3. Friendly players who communicate kindly (most other MMORPGs aren't like this due to ragers and racism).4. The new class is awesomely epic (sorry if awesomely isn't an existing word)5. Good gameplay to make a good hour of footage/streaming on.6. I've always wanted to see a good fantasy RPG that is like Perfect Worlds but got a better aspect to the gameplay.7. The review rating is very positive which means new players every minute.8. Noobies get a good teaching tutorial unlike others where they babble on forever.9. Last but not least, fantastic graphics and music.BAD:1. Unable to switch what gender the class is (most RPGs allow you to do this, make this an update please).2. Some people tend to break all the dungeons which usually crash the game servers. This means that people can't join       fast enough and sometimes can't join at all if they have a bad computer.3. Some advanced players will try to 'help' you in to levelling, instead, all they do is leave you in a high level place and you die. This can be annoying because these players are able to persuade with such good passion that loads of players usually get tricked into it and this CAAAN be pretty rageful towards those type of players...4. You know what I'm going to say, don't you? The graphics. Sometimes the graphics ARE a bit too powerful for some computers. I usually get gigantic lag spikes but at least I don't freeze like I've been saying with some players. 5. Some attacking animations are broken. Bad computers usually make the game crash. I've only had one crash for when I was in a guild dungeon raid and I was attempting to use my sorcerer skill which kind of crashed out my game because the attacking animation was broken. This is usually caused when the creator hasn't been bothered or forget to add an actual animation to that specific skill.6. Finally, FIX THE SERVERS!!! I'm sick of people messaging my on Steam about how the Aura Kingdom servers are not working and it's all cause of me just because I used this special software to boost up my Aura Kingdom. I message them back saying ""It's not my fault the servers ain't working. The software doesn't even affect the servers on Aura Kingdom so stop blaming it on me because it will most likely be a person scamming or exploiting the servers out"". Like, I know Aura Kingdom can't help all these problems due to the game is gettin really popular and sooo many people are trying to join at once-especially at night. Now, I'm never going to stop playing Aura Kingdom due to these problems (I'm going to have to write this quickly because I have a guild dungeon in like 7 minutes and I don't want to miss it because if I do, I'll be kicked out the guild). -  RKIDNB (YouTuber)			"

												being a pokemon fan, I highly anticipated this title, and though I do like it I cant reccommend it in the current shape.the controls just feel wrong like ed gien at the local park wrong and it can be unsettleing. the animations in the quest line although innovative are awkward as hell and can be creepy.the aformentioned are noticed from the get go, and just stick out to a seasoned mmo player.I honestly am just plain disappointed because this game can be so much better, like if they stuck with the plain old boreing quest font circa eq2/wow/every wow clone since with the monster tamer aspects the game would be worlds greater than it is right now.as for the controls, it seems like they couldnt pick tera mouse look or standard so they said ""why not gut the whole system, make it so r/l click isnt a thing and not give a reticle but also keep the cursor visable at all times and let it float while panning the camera stretch I know but Im trying to reason it out.rant over.

												I just started playing this game and I wasted 32 minutes :DHere is how I and my game experience got along:1. I start it up for the first time, it glitches my laptop out and crashes my whole computer2. I turned my laptop back on and I started it up again3. I start to enjoy the game-until the ""name your character"" comes along.4. I spend about 18 minutes trying to get a name to work. I got one... That was glitched out :)5. I select the Cheery Slyph and it says ""This name is used!"" Or something like that.6. I start to noobly search for a namebox for my companion... But I was a noob. Read 4. again for more details7. My name (GoldenHeart) says its not used, but it was actually so I just spammed a huge load of letters into my name :D8. I start the adventure (finally) and I stare at all the pose glitches there are... the girl with pink hair having her fingers in her head :)9. I start doing the quests... But all tabs and stuff (toolbox, map etc) was blocking my view :D10. I am on the quest to defeat 3 monsters, I only remember one name kinda... it was a greezly or something?...11. I find the first monster, the chat box blocks my move attacks and I can't attack while I was getting beat up :)12. I finally catch up to the chat box that was blocking my attack moves and I was able to kill the first monster :)13. On my second monster, the troll chat box comes back :D...14. I rage quit :)This was the best tutorial experience ever!!! 11/10 :)joking. Sorry. But. Yes. (The experience was true doe).			"

												The gameis ok for a free to play MMO but beware of who runs it. Aeria Games are scummy as all heck and will randomly decide to make you jump hoops in order to purchase AP (their cash shop currency). If you decide to sink money into this game be prepared for a possible fight with the dreaded customer service boss, a single man raid boss that can wipe you at any moment. Due to this I can not at this time recommend it.			"

Hell I didn't even know I 'had' an account, never mind having one banned. According to many sites I see, if you don't use your account for a while.So. This company BANS players who don't play for a while. From what I can gather, that time period is 2 weeks. So if you don't play for 2 weeks, you get banned.Yeah, not even wasting my time to try and get the account back.			"

												I really do like this game as an mmorpg. I love the combat the style, the fluid questing, fairly quick leveling (in my opinion) etc etc. My most major issue with this game is that you are extremely lucky if you make it out of the launcher into the game. I mean seriously aeria? maybe 3/10 times i actually get into the game and it is extremely annoying. I really hope they fix this issue because I really do love this game. My overall rating would have to be 8.5/10.			"

I started playing with my friends and whenever I was stuck or confused they could help me.It feels like the game holds your hand for a while, as in it's easy to complete quests because you just skip the AI conversation, accept the quest then click the quest and you go right to it.I do love the fighting in it though, would recommend!

												I'm a bit iffy on this one, to be honest.  Overall, it's a nice enough little game - the graphics are pretty (particularly once you figure out how to get them scaled back from 640x480 pixels) and the story, while linear as all get-out, is pretty easy to follow.  The community, such as I could see of it (bearing in mind I'm an Australian in time zone GMT+8, so I'm effectively about 8 hours out of synch with most of the English-speaking world) seemed friendly enough.  It's an MMO you can just as easily play solo - while there are some parts where you need to be part of a group, they're not compulsory.  All that said, it has one big problem - botting.  If you go into the game, you will see a lot of characters who look remarkably similar - all male, all wearing the first face, first hairstyle, and first hair colour (in other words, short purple hair) and all Grenadiers.  They'll all have the same guardian spirit (usually Sigrun, after about level 25) and they'll turn up at certain spots en masse.  Their names will be random strings of characters, because they're bots.  If you happen to be trying to level in a spot which has been botted, you're going to find yourself struggling to find the mob you're supposed to be killing, or the item you're supposed to be looking for, or the character you're supposed to be escorting, because the bots are there knee deep, and all you can do is wait for them to move on, and hope everything re-spawns before the next bot wave comes through.The game also suffers from what appears to be a common problem to many MMO  games - a single spawn point, a single storyline, and as a result the whole thing gets incredibly boring when you're running through the whole thing again in order to try out a different character class (really, though, the only MMOs I've run across which don't have this problem are World of Warcraft, and to a lesser extent, Dark Age of Camelot and City of Heroes).  This is only exacerbated by the highly linear storyline, which doesn't have many side quests available.Plus, of course, there's the standard anime problem of what the female characters are almost wearing.  One day a game design company is going to realise approximately 50% of the world's population isn't overwhelmingly interested in looking at characters with improbably bouncy breasts (either because breasts just don't do it for them, or because they have a set of breasts themselves, or both) and they're going to realise there's an un-tapped market for eye-candy just waiting to be exploited.  The designers of this game have got part of the way there - the male character models are very pretty, very bishie, and very cute to look at.  But quite frankly, when the female version of an outfit regularly comes to a packet of dental floss, three sequins and a cork (you figure out where each goes) while the male version of the same outfit covers the character from chin to toes, it gets a bit annoying.  Speak to the designers at Square Enix, for crying out loud - they at least accept there are more people playing games out there than just heterosexual men, and they provide some eye candy for the gay men and heterosexual women as well!Really, it isn't a bad game.  But then again, it doesn't really stand out in my mind as particularly good either.  If Steam had an option for ""eeeehhhh..."" I'd probably choose that.  But as it stands, it's getting approximately 4.99/10, and voted down.			"

												From the previews the game looked very cute and interesting with beautiful landscapes and character customization, but there is an obvious reason why there were no gameplay previews. The gameplay itself has a screen FULL of unwanted display. The chat function is right in the way of the entire screen and every time you happen to hover over it it fully pops up causing you to pause what you're doing to close it. The game upon lauch reduced the display of my laptop screen by HALF of what it's supposed to be, and it didn't fix with a restart. Save yourself the time and don't play this game it's honestly not worth it.			"

The combat is more of a target and auto attack style with aoe abilities that make it feel actiony. All in all combat is still refreashing in my opinion and there are quite a few classes to choose from (with another on the way from what I've read). I definately think this game is worth a shot.			"

This is only exacerbated by the highly linear storyline, which doesn't have many side quests available.Plus, of course, there's the standard anime problem of what the female characters are almost wearing.  One day a game design company is going to realise approximately 50% of the world's population isn't overwhelmingly interested in looking at characters with improbably bouncy breasts (either because breasts just don't do it for them, or because they have a set of breasts themselves, or both) and they're going to realise there's an un-tapped market for eye-candy just waiting to be exploited.  The designers of this game have got part of the way there - the male character models are very pretty, very bishie, and very cute to look at.  But quite frankly, when the female version of an outfit regularly comes to a packet of dental floss, three sequins and a cork (you figure out where each goes) while the male version of the same outfit covers the character from chin to toes, it gets a bit annoying.  Speak to the designers at Square Enix, for crying out loud - they at least accept there are more people playing games out there than just heterosexual men, and they provide some eye candy for the gay men and heterosexual women as well!Really, it isn't a bad game.  But then again, it doesn't really stand out in my mind as particularly good either.  If Steam had an option for ""eeeehhhh..."" I'd probably choose that.  But as it stands, it's getting approximately 4.99/10, and voted down.			"

												From the previews the game looked very cute and interesting with beautiful landscapes and character customization, but there is an obvious reason why there were no gameplay previews. The gameplay itself has a screen FULL of unwanted display. The chat function is right in the way of the entire screen and every time you happen to hover over it it fully pops up causing you to pause what you're doing to close it. The game upon lauch reduced the display of my laptop screen by HALF of what it's supposed to be, and it didn't fix with a restart. Save yourself the time and don't play this game it's honestly not worth it.			"

												Overall this is an awesome game! It has a slight learning curve with some of the aspects of the game, but once you get it down it's a lot of fun. You're able to create some cute and colorful characters, the one fall-back with the character creation is the lack of variety. You can pick between 9 faces and 10 hairstyles 12 hair colors and 4 skin tones. This is not really a SMALL amount, until you're in game and notice how many other characters that your same hair style. But the combos they have are very nice and very well done. I would love to see them expand on this in the future.It is one of those games that you click on the quest and your character starts running to it, making getting to and from your quest spots a breeze, almost too easy. But the combat system is really impressive and has some great animation work. You should put thought into how you're going to build up your character before you start adding attruibute points here or there. You can do a google search on some of the classes and get builds and guides on how to create and lvl your characters. Failure to fo this way will make you find yourself spending a lot of in game currency to reset your stats.In short, just download the game and jump in feet first....			"

												A very interesting Game thats for sure. It's a you either like it or hate it.Very Familiar to Perfect World Int. style of Travel and crafting.It took me about a week to start figuring stuff out but once you do its like activate all engines!Im lvl 50 so here are some of my thoughts on it so far:-Very flashy fighting and easy as heck to learn.-THE MASSIVE amout of pop culure refrencing in this game is halarious everything from David Bowie to Romeo and Julietand everything in between. the David Bowie movie refrence to Dance Magic Dance song made my day. power of the vodoo.-Super Mind numbing easy traveling. click and auto path is pretty dam good compared to PFI. - personal Stall so you can sell unwanted stuff or Auction House it.-Really cool looking Weapons and outfits.My irks about the game:INVISIBLE WALLS omg why does this still exist x_X really annoying sometimes when you GLIDE.BOTS BOTS BOTS BOTS!!!! but suprisling not alot of gold spammers theres a few but thats to be in any game.HACKERS / BUG abuser before Maintenance is FREAKING nightmare so I usally log off 1 hr before and no issues now.very very grindy... the biggest issues is Quest that make you kill 14 of this 14 of that to make you go back and collect 14 of what the mob drops AFTER you just killedc them.But aside all that its not a bad game if your an Anime fan or flashy combat and easy to learn combat.the crafting/Refining is a bit rought to learn but once you do its makes a HUGE diffrence in gameplay.DUNGEONS are freaking awesome!! but getting groups 2gether is a bit of a pain if your not in right Timezone server.What I really like is the AUTO pathing to Quest - click and AUTOdrive is great if you dont have time to sit around looking for NPC for Quest. and a journal on the side incase you lose or cant find one is super easy just click and go! :DGuilds are freaking handy as hell if you find a decent one that helps you understand the game if your serious.my Score: 7.5 out 0f 10  (as an Anime fan)6 out of 10 as Casual gamer.

												I liked this game more then I should.  Its not really that good, the character creation and customization is very limited, the gameplay is literally just the same quests rehashed over and over, and the combat gets pretty boring very quickly.  So why do I recommend this game?  Because I still liked playing it.  While its still a Free-to-Play MMORPG, it never makes you feel like you HAVE to pay for things to be good at it.  If it wasn't for Final Fantasy XIV filling my MMO spot, I might still be playing this from time to time.I recommend this to those looking for an alright F2P MMORPG.  For anyone else, I'd say not to bother, its not good enough to spend hours on.  The lore is uninteresting, the characters are forgettable, and, again, the quests are all rehashes of each other.  Kill 16 of these enemies, kill these enemies to obtain X item, and use X item on 5 enemies.			"

												I've only played this game for about 2-3 mins & I didn't enjoy all that much. First of all, the chat takes up 25% of the screen which makes it hard to actually play. The next negative is that the camera turns without a move of the mouse which leaves me facing the back of an enemy. Last negative, WHEN GETTING THE GAME, THE SCREEN IS SO FREAKING SMALL MAKING IT HARDER TO LOG IN THAN USUAL! If all of these problems are addressed, you might have a decent game... decent.			"

												After a few days of playing the game, here is what I could tell you, folks.1) Never ever EVER spend cash in this game, or your account will be banned for ""billing inactivity"" (well, that's what I heard from a lot of people).2)This game is basicly a copy of World of Warcraft (yeah, other classes, other story, anime graphics but still! Same point-and-click battles, and all you could find in WoW). The bad thing - Copy. A thing like this already exists. Good thing - it's FREE. You CAN donate into the game, but remember the difference between the words CAN and MUST. In WoW, you MUST pay EVERY MONTH! to play. Otherwise, you'll only have the starter pack (that's why I never played WoW over level 20). 3)Speaking of graphics, minding the fact that I love the oldstyle drawn anime and FREAKING HATE 3D ANIME, this is actually pretty wonderfull! And sill better then WoW. Can't compare with ESO (that even has a diferent gameplay), though.4)Gameplay. If you've ever played World of Warcraft, you won't have to read the tutorials, as the mechanics are pretty much all the same. Use WASD, or point on the ground to move, click someone to interact, click on your weapon icon to attack. Basic (and sometimes boring). Oh, why did I say that, now level [insert 99-digit number here] kids from WoW will hate me xD.5)My personal feelings about the game - WHAT THE HELL ARE CUSTUMES FOR AND HOW THE HELL DO THEY WORK??!?!! Sorry, had to burst out at some point... So, costumes. By default, you should have an adventurer's costume and some armour. Now look at this nonsence - I have armor on (yeah, found it out when got new armr, and wanted to see how it looks), so, I have armour on, I take off the costume and *pam the character is naked. W.T.F.? Maybe I don't understand how to take off the costume and leave the armour, and hope someone will help me out.At this point, I guess it's all I have to say.			"

I start it up for the first time, it glitches my laptop out and crashes my whole computer2. I turned my laptop back on and I started it up again3. I start to enjoy the game-until the ""name your character"" comes along.4. I spend about 18 minutes trying to get a name to work. I got one... That was glitched out :)5. I select the Cheery Slyph and it says ""This name is used!"" Or something like that.6. I start to noobly search for a namebox for my companion... But I was a noob. Read 4. again for more details7. My name (GoldenHeart) says its not used, but it was actually so I just spammed a huge load of letters into my name :D8. I start the adventure (finally) and I stare at all the pose glitches there are... the girl with pink hair having her fingers in her head :)9. I start doing the quests... But all tabs and stuff (toolbox, map etc) was blocking my view :D10. I am on the quest to defeat 3 monsters, I only remember one name kinda... it was a greezly or something?...11. I find the first monster, the chat box blocks my move attacks and I can't attack while I was getting beat up :)12. I finally catch up to the chat box that was blocking my attack moves and I was able to kill the first monster :)13. On my second monster, the troll chat box comes back :D...14. I rage quit :)This was the best tutorial experience ever!!! 11/10 :)joking. Sorry. But. Yes. (The experience was true doe).			"

												Its a good game, just not for any hardcore mmo players:I have played This before it came out on steam so here are some things that i think should be notedPros:No mana for an MMORPGCoolown is fast and you have a lot of skills at a low levelwont feel the urge of buying anything until finishing the main quests/ lvl 30 upgood for Casual players starting to get in to MMORPG'sIt's a free gameCute Dresses and costumes, yes this is a proyou can mount a unicorn, ostrich, dragon, Cindirella's pumpkin wagon etc etcyou get free pets and you get a free pet at the start ( Although you cant use it until lvl 10+)combat system is fairly simple to understandIN THE MIDDLE (CAN BE PROS OR CONS)Art style, I enjoy anime, but im not sure with everyone elselolis are abundant in the gameyou CAN solo most of the quests except for the ones that are mandatory to have a team mate up until lvl 45+, not sure about the quests above thatThere is a system in the game that automatically puts you in a route to a selected quest.CONS;Although the combat system is simple, and the cooldown are fast, i often see myself using the same skills over and over againPretty grindy after you reach lvl 20+, there are grind quests on levels lower than 20, but you will start to feel the repetativeness in lvl 20although there is a currency that the game gives away, the bulk of the cash grab is on things that upgrade armor and weapons.About that mount thing, most of those you'll need to buy, that includes the unicorn, but not the ostrich, you get a free ostrich.

												From the previews the game looked very cute and interesting with beautiful landscapes and character customization, but there is an obvious reason why there were no gameplay previews. The gameplay itself has a screen FULL of unwanted display. The chat function is right in the way of the entire screen and every time you happen to hover over it it fully pops up causing you to pause what you're doing to close it. The game upon lauch reduced the display of my laptop screen by HALF of what it's supposed to be, and it didn't fix with a restart. Save yourself the time and don't play this game it's honestly not worth it.			"

												A nice anime styled MMORPG that is heavily overlookedPros+Anime Style looks nice+Cutscene text rather than typical page text when talking to npcs+Simple Adventure story which feels refreshing from the mmos that try to be epic+Variety of Classes complimented by sub-class pairing(Lvl 40)+Gliding accross screen more fun that riding mount+Fishing aint impossibly boring in this unlike other mmos+Can Make My Character look like Rin Tohsaka from Fate/Stay Night(This really is the most important point for me)+Entertaining DailiesCons-No Dungeon Quene from what i saw(Thats pretty rudimentary)-Certain classes have much harder time than others-NPC's tend to recycle similar models making it a bit wierd (But understandable)-Only 1 kid model for boys and girls(Thats pretty bad)7.5/10 Play it to be Rin "

												Overall this is an awesome game! It has a slight learning curve with some of the aspects of the game, but once you get it down it's a lot of fun. You're able to create some cute and colorful characters, the one fall-back with the character creation is the lack of variety. You can pick between 9 faces and 10 hairstyles 12 hair colors and 4 skin tones. This is not really a SMALL amount, until you're in game and notice how many other characters that your same hair style. But the combos they have are very nice and very well done. I would love to see them expand on this in the future.It is one of those games that you click on the quest and your character starts running to it, making getting to and from your quest spots a breeze, almost too easy. But the combat system is really impressive and has some great animation work. You should put thought into how you're going to build up your character before you start adding attruibute points here or there. You can do a google search on some of the classes and get builds and guides on how to create and lvl your characters. Failure to fo this way will make you find yourself spending a lot of in game currency to reset your stats.In short, just download the game and jump in feet first....			"

												This is a pretty good game. I like the eidolon mechanic too, makes them feel like more then just some pet system. The combat is more of a target and auto attack style with aoe abilities that make it feel actiony. All in all combat is still refreashing in my opinion and there are quite a few classes to choose from (with another on the way from what I've read). I definately think this game is worth a shot.			"

												Laggy, buggy, bad music, gimmicky controls.Basically, what you can usually expect from any WoW-Like game. Hey, at least it's free. Download it and try it for youtself! But it will probably be a waste of time.			"

												After playing many MMOs, I have to say that this is the first MMO that I have loved strate from the start! I don't like most of the 'big' MMOs, however Aura Kingdom has that anime charm, and presents itself as an great anime MMO.This game is what I have been looking to play whilst watching 'Sword Art Online' (a must watch anime). If you are an anime lover, then I believe you will love this game as much as I do :D			"

												DO NOT PLAY ANY AERIA GAMES.Aeria Games is a selfish ignorant company. Not only AURA KINGDOM, after reviewing other discussions about aeria games, many players claimed that they were having the same problem.They simply ban players just because they did not spend money in the game. Once you got around 1k of gold without buying AP they would claim you for buying gold from third party, which is the BOTS all over the game. Even you tried to appeal by sending ticket but they would just notify that it is a final decision on the ban. When you ask for evidence they will happily ignore your request. THE METHOD FOR NOT GOING THROUGH THIS FRUSTRATING TIME IS TO NOT spend in the game , once you stop buying their AP they will randomly ban you PERMANENTLY WITHOUT WARNING.THE GAME IS FULL OF BOTS . LET IT BE A GHOST TOWN , DO NOT PLAY . THEY DID NOT GET RID OF THE BOTS ISSUE INSTEAD THEY BAN ACTIVE PLAYERS FOR NOT SPENDING.			"

												I just started playing this game and I wasted 32 minutes :DHere is how I and my game experience got along:1. I start it up for the first time, it glitches my laptop out and crashes my whole computer2. I turned my laptop back on and I started it up again3. I start to enjoy the game-until the ""name your character"" comes along.4. I spend about 18 minutes trying to get a name to work. I got one... That was glitched out :)5. I select the Cheery Slyph and it says ""This name is used!"" Or something like that.6. I start to noobly search for a namebox for my companion... But I was a noob. Read 4. again for more details7. My name (GoldenHeart) says its not used, but it was actually so I just spammed a huge load of letters into my name :D8. I start the adventure (finally) and I stare at all the pose glitches there are... the girl with pink hair having her fingers in her head :)9. I start doing the quests... But all tabs and stuff (toolbox, map etc) was blocking my view :D10. I am on the quest to defeat 3 monsters, I only remember one name kinda... it was a greezly or something?...11. I find the first monster, the chat box blocks my move attacks and I can't attack while I was getting beat up :)12. I finally catch up to the chat box that was blocking my attack moves and I was able to kill the first monster :)13. On my second monster, the troll chat box comes back :D...14. I rage quit :)This was the best tutorial experience ever!!! 11/10 :)joking. Sorry. But. Yes. (The experience was true doe).			"

												Honest Review:  Alright started  playing this game and never had questions on how to do something ,meaning the tutorials are great and easy for people to understand.    Things that annoyed me:1)To access higher level maps you have to do the main story line meaning you can do dungeons all the way to the max lvl 75 but if you havn't  done the quest line you will be stuck in a 1-30 lvl zone until  you do so. Why is this bad? Making a new character will be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥since you got to do the same questline over and over again, you are forced into doing the quest line.2)This game is very strict on censorship , there is no turn off swear filter button any typo that you do will be bleep by these annoying a** s**t.3)Auction houses - you know how you can put a price per unit on something your selling ? Well yea not in this f**king game you have to put a price on the whole thing meaning they have to buy your thing in bulk or you won't get any sales and get this you can only put the item in the auction for 1 day ,oh and it is also taxed.4)PvP blows - it is a type of event in the game meaning you have to get on a certain time of the day in order to join and i don't even reccomend joining if you aern't max level.You don't recieve bonus stats or game changing stats for that matter if your lvl 20 going up against a lvl 75 you will miss everything, your stuns won't even register and you will be a target by all players since you WILL get one shotted.Negative♥♥♥♥♥♥aside- The game allows you to respec your stats and masteries (not your class) for ingame currency ( The one you earn) you can also chose a sub-class at lvl 40 for example i make a gaurdian and at lvl 40 i get a quest in order to be a part bard to get its healing abilities.I reccomend this game though not bad when PvE gameplay is involved .

												Initial impressions; I've played about an hour so far, it's been a confusing experience for my brain, some aspects of the game I adore while some other parts are... meh. I'll leave it at that.The camera can be very clunky and the ""Click to move"" can impair combat on a certain level. I found myself very confused with the choices of keybinds the game gives you for default;""R to glide"" ""Double tapping S to suddenly stop gliding"". Those are 2 early examples and while the keybinds aren't the best; The glide ability is very appreciated, a neat way to get to places faster; although unrealistic for the most part.Back to movement, Click to move or WASD or Arrows; Your only source of camera  movement is by means of your mouse which means Arrows are a definite ""No"". When entering battle which contains elements of ""move out of red or be hit by massive damage"" it can be tricky for people new to computer gaming or those who aren't used to juggling mouse and keyboard, going from mouse to arrows or WASD while keeping your fingers on Tab for target and 1234 while keeping track of the enemy cast bar..... can be irritating and complicated at times. Especially if you play in a restricted place IE: A small desk.Apart from the clunky camera and movement controls the games runs great, it has a decent amount of classes but kind of lacking on the ""Character customization"" front. A bit sad since the art style is absolutely beautiful! Monster's are fairly diversified which is a welcome addition, since newly MMORPGs kind of stopped caring about the amount of different monsters and decided to start throwing in the same monsters with a different names and sizes (Cough cough FF14 cough cough Destiny cough cough)Skill system is neat so far you have your basic ""Spam"" attack, your core special attack on a low cooldown and a weird ""Ultimate"" attack which does INSANE amounts of damage even at low levels. Did I mention there's no mana, that's a damn great change, more games should take that route, basically means no waiting for Mana... Ever.Health regen is a bit of a complaint for me so far. Your health regens ""VERY SLOW"" outside of combat and since your potions are auto used in combat when you come close to death, it gets very tiresome to wait around for your health between engagements, a shame since Mana here isn't an issue.The story is quite ""RPG cliche"" and the quest are very repetitive, IE: Kill X number of Y to collect Z; Kill X mobs Y times or pick up X amount of Z resources off the ground.In conclusion; The game is great, runs smoothly even on a subpar gaming PC and the major variety of terrains/land/mobs/pets are welcomed. The community is generally friendly and enjoyable, the F2P doesn't seem to kill the game at lower levels (not sure about endgame). Quests will eventually be very grindy and repetitive but can be a nice alternative while relaxing and doing mindless tasks such as listening to music or a podcast of sort especially since the health regen times can be dreadful. Camera and movement controls are very clunky and I think that might be the biggest flaw, keeping the game from reaching it's full potential. The combat system is a very nice change of paste from most MMORPGs and is a welcome addition mixing in a bit of twist by removing mana and incorporating cool ""Ultimate"" abilities. In my honest opinion, I would rate this game a 7/10. Not a must play but a very decent title which is sadly held back by poor design decisions.			"

												Really fun game, enjoyable combat (slightly repettitve though). I'd sayyou should give it a go it's free after all, but I wouldn't say you should plan for end game cause it does seem like it suffers from the pay to win game model primarily in the pet system. This will probably only effect pvp and such so you could level up with no pay walls in theory.			"

												For 'otaku' out there, this game is for you.However, 1. The UI is not really friendly. I find it difficult for me throughout the game.2. The quests are straightforward, not much challenges at all. You can just click the quests and it will go the place for you, really?3. The graphic is okay, but personally I like graphic as in Torchlight 2, or Final Fantasy online.I just played for few hours (until Lvl 30 perhaps).			"

												Personally, I am loving this game. Reasons for the positives are:Very nice scenery, whether at high setting or low, this game still shines out on top.The characters are very kawaiii! Just make you want to hug'em. <3The point's tree for character upgrade is very simple and straight-forward and is very uniquw in terms of different classes needing different points in their skills.Very nice weapons (personal favourite)A very nice community as well, everyone is working together and there isn't very much arguing.Negatives for this game. ):Every game has it's negatives, but this fortunately has very little:Eventhough leveling is straightforward, it does take AGGGGEEESS to level up.Quests are very generic, such as ""Kill this many ....""The story isn't that in-depth, as in, you don't get to know you're character as much and it gets very boring.Overall rating: 9/10Concluding from all this, I will still enjoy this game and eventhough there are a couple of negatives about this game, they are made up by the enjoyment of the game.

												Good:- Interesting character development system. - Plenty of engaging activities to do.- Crafting system with reasonable economic integrity.- Friendly community (for the most part).- Robust gear systemBad:- Not explicitly pay to win, but pay for advantage.- Auction House effected by cash shop items.- Legions of gold spammers and bots.- Quite a few UI and gameplay bugs that need to be ironed out.- THE GAMBLING ELEMENTS ARE TOO STRONG IN THE CASH SHOP- Why can I fly over a chasm but not hop a 2-ft fenceBottom Line:- Craving a neat, stop-gap MMO? Looking for a casual MMO experience with a few hardcore elements? Not much time and not willing to commit to a AAA title? AK is right for you.- If you're willing to overlook the elements that make for a bad F2P experience (cash-shop crack junkies, unstable AH, goldbots) you'll have a blast.- Customer Service - on a scale from One to Comcast, Aeria Games are like an 8.

												Likely the best free to play mmorpg experience available at the moment   A great breath and depth to the game ensures the player is never bored. Hours upon hours of content comes through the form of missions and side quests that offer a variety from just the basic fetch quest or escort style staple of the genre.   The visuals is breathtaking and immersive. Exploration is fun as every region offers secret dungeons/areas/bosses. The soundtrack befits and complements the atmosphere of each unique zone.   PVP balancing may be an issue, but can be completely ignored until end game. The cash shop is mostly reliant on cosmetic items, which may provide a small but negligeable stat boost. You can earn cash shop cosmetic items anyways from loyalty points! Very little pay to win here!			"

												It's a fairly good MMO. The combat is addicting, but the game itself falls down to a drag at around level 50. I personally got bored of the story and did not find the graphics appealing after playing the game for as long as I did. There is plenty to do in the game for those who find the leveling after 50 to be tollerable.			"

												A great free-to-play RPG game and this is not a pay-to-win RPG game.The graphic is really smooth with a well designed world. Many job classes and we can change secondary job everytime we want ! The community here is very friendly and i can get along very well with people here :DSo many cute and cool costumes to try, so try it out!There are a lot of things to do beside grinding and leveling. Like fishing, cooking and another stuff!It is an ongoing game and I bet this game will become better in the future!Although sometimes you will find lag spikes in the server, it's still a great game to play !

That being said, if you realize that and you still want to play AK, it's suprisingly a decent game that can keep you entertained for hours if you're into the anime setting.			"

												What a huge mess this game has to offer. Why is that? Well let's just say this mmorpg is another bland and generic title that you would play for a few seconds before realizing that you have better things to do. (like studying or drawing something) Also, in this game for some reason has no sound and music!? I mean what is this madness I have face with this?! Plus, moving the camera....oh nooo. Like in WOW and some other mmorpg games I had no problem but this mess was a pain to deal with. Like I would try to move in the direction where my character would go but for some reason it moves awkawardly making me even more mad.The score I would give this game is 2/10. And do yourself a favor and please don't ever play this game. "

												Good game. But your screen resolution may differ after lauching the game, when i lauch this game,it failed to load and crashed. Next i try reload this game, my deskop got shrink 1/3 of size before lauch the game. I think is screen resolution  problem. Next, game performance is NOT guaranteed if your memory less than 6 GB i think. Easy gameplay, quest guide system help you to complete the quest easily. No mana cost skill and it only depends cooldown, you may enjoy skill spamming if you play sorcerer or wizard class. In a nutshell, i will not recommend this game because it was lag when you play this game. Plus, many oldest computer may not suitable to play this game due high-quality graphic and cause sluggish effect in gameplay. Compulsory set your secondary password for secure your game account if you new in this game, sounds good but very annnoying when you forget your secondary password and you can't login into this game(button position varies every open the password pad). Generally, many bug still need to fix. As well, you need to consider when you want to install and play this game, your computer may undergo UNSTABLE performance hen you open this game. That all.			"

Posted: January 11
												This is a anime MMORPG.You are a anime teen that gets a eidalon to help you save the world, but be carefull for if you fall into darkness then your mind will slip and you will become a mindless monster.The characters looks too much alike since there is not a rich character design pool.There is a 3 character limit for a server, but it can be expected. There is a delete character limit per day.You can only be a human male or female and there are no beards or wrinkles. You only have 1 starting area.There is a auto-walk-to-quest thing in this game so you should not be able to get lost. Daily quests, mini quests, dungeons with solo exist and forced party dungeons that you will need others to complete.You can pick between 4 eidalons in the start of the game. Eidalons are mosters that will help you in fights and they have alot of speech bubbles that will ask you about new friends and stuff going on. You can feed your eidalon with experiance and things that can give your eidalon better stats. Eidalons can be bought and be found in the quests. The eidalons can be sent out on quests that lasts 10 min and that will give you a item, but it will cost them some energy. You can give the eidalons more enegy back by asking them questions and getting to know them.The people does not seem to be online or sosial so if you are not entering the game with friends then it is going to be a kind of lonly experience. The party and group finding isen't userfriendly for people that has not joined the game with friends. NPCs look alike, so you will see the same npc skin with different names.Your character can have 3 different classes when you get to a high level. The extra classes can give you some extra skills that can help you.This is my honest opinions of the classes untill level 15:Bard is a support hero that is boring as all hell. With a Green and Red music meter.Dualist is a single target dps class that is fancy to use and kind of fun.Ranger is a ranged dps class. As this class a player actually talked to me and someone added her to the guild for no reason.Ravager is a melee dps/tank class that has a Rage-Meter and that is fun in a fighting-for-you-life kind of way. I didn't noticed that I was level 14 at first cause it felt so much more fun then almost all of the other previous classes.Reaper is a ranged dps/summoner class that can summon 3 demons out of 5 at a time to help kill the enemys. Not that much fun and the rotation is too slow so that you are autoattacking alot of the time.Shonobi is a ranged dps class that can summon a shadow person that seems to be a neko or something. You can summon 2 different once by attacking, but only 1 of them comes out and leaves after a short while. You do look fancy using this class and you kill creatures effectivly but it was not my ally.Ronin is a melee dps class that has a soul-meter. You can charge up it to use storm mode to use storm abilitys but you need to fight to recharge the soul-meter. The attack from it was kind of cool and it fits to take down enemy groupes infront of you.Gunslinger is a ranged dps class with some traps. You have 4 spesial shots that seems to be randomized. It takes about 7 seconds to reload the spesial bullets. This is a class that is hard to fight single targets with cause some of the skills have alot of aggro.Brawler is a melee dps class. This is a fast, intens and fun fighter. It has a small heal and is intense to use.Grenadier is a ranged dps aoe class. This is a slow, aoe, damage dealer that can summon a machinegun to help, even has a frost grenade.Wizard is a ranged dps class. This is a complicated one to use since it has a spell sync that you need to get some damage out of the spells with a spamable one, a healing one and a upgrader to 1 of your 4 elements.Guardian is a melee tank class. You have a shield that can take the hits and later a skill that can reflect and protect you. Shield bash for the stun.Holy Sword is a melee dmg/aoe/semi-tank class. You have a claymore and the light to kill enemys in an aoe. You have a Divine-Energy-Meter that automaticly fill that will make your skills do more damage for 1 attack, then recharge. Has skills that close gaps.Sorcerer is a ranged dps support class. You have a book and deal damage with spells, even some support skills. You have a Dark-Magic-Meter that is filled by some of your spells and it can have up to 3 spells. The spells can be casted with a higher effect and it seems random what you got.This character lasted until level 32 before I could not stand it anymore.The grenader is a ranged dps that was kind of op. I just mean it cause I defeated people 11 levels over me by using the stun shot and the frost grenade + have the turret up right before the dual starts.This is not the best or worst MMORPG out there. It is kind of mediocer in my opinion. So if you like having alot of classes to pick from and being only humans with eidalons that can help you fight and you have friends playing with you then this might be a game for you.Have fun, enjoy and cuddle your eidalon :)			"

Fans will say you can earn everything payers have in-game,  which is a lie -  I'd like to see non-paying players get highly fortified gear and the best costumes/mounts, after all - this is why most people play and this is where the wolf appears - AK is a free to play game, yes you can 'earn' some stuff if you play it enough, but don't expect rare eidolons, don't expect orange costumes, shiny weapons or epic mounts without either paying some serious cash, we're talking hundreds of dollars for the teired spenders PER MONTH, and lets not talk about the gambling boxes which have an extremely low chance for nice items,  so new players joining AK will have an even tougher time with the heavily bloated economy, it was bad back at launch and now its just stupid with some items costing 20,000g+ and gold isn't that easy to acquire unless you....buy the teired spenders and sell them for gold....and this is what Aura Kingdom is mostly about here, don't let anyone tell you otherwise because they are either lying, or naive. The problem is that with the P2W elements, or pay to 'show off' with the best looking gear/mounts - if you put all that aside, the actual game itself isn't bad, the anime styled graphics and characters look good, the combat flow is slick and there are some interesting storylines and locations,  the game has improved since Aeria was sold to ProSieben but the old dirty tricks and sheer excessive spender promotions is an abomination on MMo gaming.   Unfortunately, the real culprit is the developer X-Legend who are well known for creating these predatory anime styled MMos which lure many players in with ultra cute graphics and then fleece the customers for every penny they own. The other problem Aura Kingdom has had since launch, and that is bots and gold farmers,  Its near impossible to go 5 minutes without recieving automated gold spam.  And certain areas are filled with bots, this has been going on since launch - and unfortunately is a major problem. Overall.  Aura Kingdom is a fun game, nobody can really deny that.   But you  have to ask yourself, what do *you* want to get out of the experience,  playing with friends, raiding and creating cute or cool characters and don't care that'll you never get the best gear, the coolest looking pets or mounts then Aura Kingdom will keep you interested -  however, if your the type who is competitive, then be prepared to either be very disappointed, or open your wallet wide open.

												First impression review:Graphics are extremely cute, very well done animations, game runs smoothly on the highest settings.Aesthetics Um...Actually, almost exactly the same as Ragnarok Online 2, before RO2 became a steaming pile of poop and left us all to wonder why. Learning Curve None, you can pick it up and play and it might be the easiest game of all time to learn how to get started. Note, not the easiest MMORPG of all time to pick up and play, but the easiest GAME of all time to pick up and play. Plus it's free, which is a big plus! Soundtrack Totally throwaway soundtrack, which is to be expected from any MMORPG, or most games in general, really. Epic ambient music because you're a mega hero, or something like that. Overall:  Again, this is just written on my first impression. I've been looking for a new MMO to play around with, and I may have found it with this title. It works, it's Free to Play (Without any nastiness that I've seen thus far), it's well optimized, extremely nice to look at, and there seems to be a gigantic influx of SPAM. Ah, MMO's, how I've missed you. Honestly, this feels like it's going to be a great game to jump into for awhile - Like RO2 was, before they completely screwed it up by being jerks and making it near-impossible to play. Quests are very similar to everything else, so I have a strong feeling that they're trying to appeal to the RP crowd of people who have watched every anime on earth and want something to do while they listen to the soundtrack of Evangelion. I'm not talking badly about people who are into anime, because heck, I'm into it...to an extent. Seriously, this looks pretty cool and plays rather well, I just wish there was some sort of learning curve to it, which is often a complaint with MMO's. I don't mind having to learn a little bit to play a game, and the lack of needing to learn anything makes me seriously question its depth and longevity. The visuals are AWESOME. Maxed out, working great. Definitely an A+ for that. On the F2P MMO scale, 8/10, easily.			"

												Haven't played too much of it, but here's a small recap of what I think:Graphics; the graphics are alright, but I think that World of Warcraft in Vanilla was more appealing to the eye than this was.Gameplay; gameplay was decent, I grinded to level 10 but simply got bored because the mechanics seem a bit too easy and a bit clunky.Story; storyline was not really explained that well and wasn't really made well since as soon as you create your character and log in you are put set in some random location where you easily defeat 3 monsters then some 'Shadow Knight' defeats you very easily. I don't think the story should have been rushed like that.Sound; sound wasn't too bad but some parts of the sound were really loud and some were really quiet, I think the dialogue wasn't up to my expectations either as I expected the dialogue to be voiced over by an actor but to my surprise was not delighted.Character creation; the character creation was really well, there is many classes to choose from with well detailed descriptions with the classes you could choose from, the types of hair and eyes etc, wasn't too much of a variety but I think there could be more.Overall, the game isn't bad but I didn't really want to spend more time grinding on this game as I wasn't really interested in playing the game.If you like anime MMORPGs I would recommend just waiting for Lost Ark or playing a kind of similar styled game called Revelation Online which just finished its closed beta status.I would rate this game a 6.5/10 but if you have played games like Mabinogi, Fiesta Online, Eden Eternal, Aika Online, Archeblade or Dragon Nest and liked those types of games then go ahead and give this game a try!

												I was trying to log into my account after not accessing the game for a year (due to school and me having to uninstall the game) but couldn't cause apparently I used the wrong username and/or password. And when I went to check my ""Forgot my pass"" on Aeria, I found out that my account was blocked. And I'm honestly very taken aback and very disappointed. I have no idea why my account was disabled, but it makes me extremely unhappy cause I've dedicated plenty of time into the game, and to have my progress lost just angers me tremendously.Currently, I'm about to restart the game and hopefully access my account again. If I can't I may resort to the new account I just created for myself. If there is an extra large update that caused my progress to be lost, it is reasonable. But if my account was blocked and removed for NO REASON? That's just it. HOWEVER, if I catch something that's interesting, I may stick around again. But we'll see. If I go through the same ordeal - I'm not gonna get struck by the same thing twice. -_-			"

												So, i was asked to do a review for this game.   Quite Honestly its to weebo related, This is for those want to be japanese, chinese asian types. But with that said the game isnt that bad the story is fine an sound.A bit of work could be done to it.  This isnt close to a pay to win so that wins points in my opinion but there is more then free to play thats neededWhen you cant really edit your chars thats a start and when you are an open world you dont simple click an go to the mobs that defeats the point to explain.  Now do not take my opinions the wrong way i know many people will say BUT A MMO IS HARD!, and those people are right but thier meant to be.  Now the main reason i have an issue with the game is gender restrictions, and very little on market place, I can see why it seems to be dieing there is not enough items nore items in which would want to be baught most the items in the shop are for cosplay or weebo's as stated before.  If people want to be foxes they should play Tera,  If the game devs are aware of this an purposly dont add an animal race so people buy the ears an such then thats smart but also very poor behavior. Now there is many things i liked in this game mainly the Reaper Class, and its spell set which matched up perfectly  How ever the summons were weak an couldnt kill a level 1 even if thier crummy lives depended on it.  You end up doing the main damage an even that wasnt balanced at points you hit 20 an another same battle you peak to 800.  Now i know my Wep isnt suppose to do 1.4k but it doesnt get close to that. Pro's :completely free, Classes, / Side CompanionsQuest Helper / Map.cosplay,Cheap items in mall,Easy LevelingCon's : To much for weebos, Hardly Anything Aside from clothing an crummy Exp Potions / Box / Scrolls,None helpfull (aside from Stones Smithing)  Tutorials, And just Devs who wont add a race because the Accessory's in the shop make them money.Thanks for Reading this is my opinion and i know others wont agree, But its For weebo's			"

												An absolute joke of a game, and trust me im taking into account the model of it. This game is hardly a game, and it's not an experience either. MMORPG's are meant to be games where you build the character you want and live out their life (role-playing). It doesn't meet up to that. You can't build the character you want because you cant change the ""costume"" they wear. There are no more costumes for your class you choose than you can count with one hand, and they're spaced out along all the levels between noob 1 and veteran 1000. Maybe 5 hairstyles- I mean, seriously. I'm still not used to the way MMO's also love to make the genders drastically separated by making the females look like babies with massive♥♥♥♥♥♥and hips exposed for people to see- and the males look like lumberjacks 5 feet taller than the babygirls. Luckily, this is anime based so ALL the males just look like normal, average, typical, girls. (Which personally would be fine, im not trans but I sympathize with that♥♥♥♥♥♥ But there's no point in the male gender existing if 100% of them look either girly or just look like vikings.)But I didn't even tell you the big thing about this monstrosity. It's almost as bad of a grind as Destiny. There is no game, there is no experience. They tried to pack it full of storyline and cutscenes in small linear pathways of a map instead of creating a game or an experience and to put it simply, there are just a few steps to mastering this game:STEP 1. ACCEPT QUEST 1STEP 2: CLICK WHATEVER NOTIFICATION POPS UP SO THE GAME CAN AUTOPILOT YOUR CHARACTER WHEREVER THE QUEST IS TELLING YOU TO GO FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO- WAIT FOR THIS TO FINISH.STEP 3: UPON ARRIVAL OF WHEREVER THE ♥♥♥♥ LAND, I THINK A POKEMON STYLE DIALOGUE MENU POPS UP FOR WHOEVER THE GAME MADE YOU APPROACH. CLICK ""SKIP"" TO THE END.STEP 4: CLICK FINISH ON THE SAME MENU. YOU JUST BEAT A MISSIONSTEP 5: CLICK ACCEPT ON THE SAME MENU. NEW NOTIFICATION MENU POPS UP WITH A WAYPOINT FOR THE GAME TO AUTOPILOT YOUR CHARACTER. REPEAT THE PROCESS.The first 10 levels will be nothing but this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It doesn't take long but it's not very rewarding because there's no point in playing an MMORPG when you can't role play and it's the opposite of massive.I swear to ♥♥♥♥ing christ, I know absolutely nothing about this game because I click-grinded my way to level 12. After I ran out of missions entirely and started to wonder when I get to change the look of my character, I started to learn that there are 3 different maps and i've already been to 2 of them and they have names, and that there's people in a city and they have names. Apparently I had talked to almost every NPC and nobody's name rang a bell, nobody's appearance looked familiar, and I still know ♥♥♥♥ing jack about the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story. I paid ♥♥♥♥ of any attention to this Notification Simulator.And you know what kept me click-grinding through to level 12 and nothing to show for it?The whole time I thought I was still in the tutorial mode. Because there was nonstop popups from all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ quests and I still had no ability to customize my appearance.I was clicking through as fast as possible to get to the 'game' where I can play the role I wanted.

												So I installed this, and it wouldn't even work. So I uninstalled and reinstalled, fought with it for a day and finally got it to load me into the game. Then it freezes at the server selection. Fight with it for another day to fix that. Now its freezing at the character creation.... I in all honesty don't know what was going through their minds when they made something with so many things wrong with it. I have given up trying to even play this game to see if I like it and have come to hate it out of pure frustration at not being able to even play it. So no I do not recommend this game due to the ammount of misery, anger, frustration and false relief in fixing one problem to run into another.			"

Apparently I had talked to almost every NPC and nobody's name rang a bell, nobody's appearance looked familiar, and I still know ♥♥♥♥ing jack about the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story. I paid ♥♥♥♥ of any attention to this Notification Simulator.And you know what kept me click-grinding through to level 12 and nothing to show for it?The whole time I thought I was still in the tutorial mode. Because there was nonstop popups from all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ quests and I still had no ability to customize my appearance.I was clicking through as fast as possible to get to the 'game' where I can play the role I wanted.

												So I installed this, and it wouldn't even work. So I uninstalled and reinstalled, fought with it for a day and finally got it to load me into the game. Then it freezes at the server selection. Fight with it for another day to fix that. Now its freezing at the character creation.... I in all honesty don't know what was going through their minds when they made something with so many things wrong with it. I have given up trying to even play this game to see if I like it and have come to hate it out of pure frustration at not being able to even play it. So no I do not recommend this game due to the ammount of misery, anger, frustration and false relief in fixing one problem to run into another.			"

												Game erases characters on its own, and brings back other characters. 12/10 Would creep me out again.At first I made a Hunter. Fun at first, played with it for a while, then moved on to other games. After a while, I wanted to come back to play some more, but the game asked for a second password which I never set up.After talking with support, they ""fixed"" my problem by setting up a password themselves, so I logged in and changed it.There he was! My hunter! Sadly, I had grown tired of him already, so I erased him and made a new character, this time a gunslinger (big difference, huh).I got the gunslinger to around level 12, it was fun and all. Two days later, I try to log in to my account and find out that my gunslinger is gone. In his place, there's this damn hunter with his crappy bow, ready for some adventure.Guess I won't be playing this anymore.			"

												too repetitive and boring, you can take on any boss alone with some skills and because of that, there is no challenge. The world is too bland. It gets better when you're lvl 60-75 because that's when people're going for raids, but to get there you need to play through the bland and boring questline. Lastly, you're going to need money, lots of it to buy eidolons that will buff up your character, and there's some issues with the devs, like banned from billing, banned because of inactivity, and banned for no reason. Seeing the game right now, i can't recommend it to everyone. You could try to play the game, but you will get bored of it, fast. "

												too repetitive and boring, you can take on any boss alone with some skills and because of that, there is no challenge. The world is too bland. It gets better when you're lvl 60-75 because that's when people're going for raids, but to get there you need to play through the bland and boring questline. Lastly, you're going to need money, lots of it to buy eidolons that will buff up your character, and there's some issues with the devs, like banned from billing, banned because of inactivity, and banned for no reason. Seeing the game right now, i can't recommend it to everyone. You could try to play the game, but you will get bored of it, fast. "

												Aura Kingdom is a free-to-play Anime MMORPG featuring strong PVE elements, a uniquely detailed world, and an engaging, well-crafted story. Aura Kingdom empowers players as Envoys of Gaia, gifted individuals that take the role of one of nine classes. High-level players can also choose a secondary weapon, allowing for hundreds of possible weapon and skill combinations. You will also scour the world far and wide to collect the rarest and strongest Eidolons, loyal companions that fight alongside you in combat. Gather up some friends and take on the best of what Aura Kingdom has to offer!			"

												At very first I must say I enjoyed the game a lot.. for a while. I don't like anime at all but I was very bored and I decided to try a game outside of my comfort zone. The graphics is ok, music is bit of repetetive and story was ok. Although the missing voice acting makes this product feel like low budjet game.The game is extremely grindy. You can get levels quite fast at the beginning by doing quests but after level 45 things will change. The main quest ends about level 55 and after that you have to grind your level through dailies and dungeons. And that's really painful indeed.  Actually the one thing I liked was that you can run some of the dungeons on solo mode. So you actually had something to do while you waited your guildies to gather their group for 5 men dungeon run. I liked also the skill system and especially the thing that you can spend the attribute points like you really want. However there isn't too much options for effective character builds and that's the reason it feels very simple.Crafting is also typical Korean style click&pray function. You farm the materials, find/buy the blueprint and click the ""craft"" -button. I was quite surprised when I saw the dumbed down crafting system because even the fishing is one kind of mini game. There aren't any kind of level or skill system for crafting or fishing. Fishing ""skill"" is based on your fishing gear and crafting level is equal with your adventure level. Nothing special... or actually there is. The crafting is huge money sink because the challenge is replaced with carfting costs.Well, that was the game play in nut shell. Now I'm going to tell some things that I didn't like at all. The backpack size is very limited at the beginning. This encourages player to buy some more backpacks with APs. The AP is a game currency that you can only get with real money. Sure you can buy those backpacks with loyalty points later but you really have to play a lot to get enough points for 20 slots backpacks. Some people are sellng those through the AH but because of gold farmers the prices are very high.Aaaannd.. those gold farmers. Seriously! That's the biggest issue in game at the moment. There is hundreds.. or even thousands of bots those are questing, doing dailies and killing stuff. For example I was in Navea (capital city) and counted over 120 bots running in same loop in 30 minutes. Can you imagine? The similar looking red haired gunners had a long endless train from quest givers to another. It was insane! I played GW2 since the beta and I thought there was very large number of bots. But no.. the amount of bots is nothing to compare the number of bots in AK. There is more bots in game than actually real players and Arial Games just can't get rid of them. People are buying gold and gold farmers are making more bots. There is already some lag issues because of botting and reporting doesn't help at all. That's is the reason I quit this game and I just can't recommended this game to anyone. Oh, except if you need a good platform for bot or two. This game is definitely suitable for that.			"

""Autism Kingdom""This game has more autism than Reddit. Quite literally. Everyone's' username relates to Sword Art Online, also known as♥♥♥♥♥♥Autism Online. That and all the users name their character 'Something_Waifu_Something'. What's worse is the fact that the game features 12 year old girls that are barely clothed and apparently adult 'men'predominantly play this sorry excuse of a video game? The characters are thus catered to pedophiles, maybe the game developer's fathers should've sprayed on a tissue... At any rate, all story missions are repetitive as can be and offer no variety of any kind. 'Go speak to X to report on your mission progress, then proceed to kill 5 of X and make 5 of X and speak to X again to claim your reward.'  Yeah, very engaging story missions. In addition to that the music is also repetitive and the graphic is a massive let-down. But whatever, if weebs are too pre-occupied playing this pedo-bait then I am happy, it keeps them off games that require more than a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and a mommy to spoonfeed them.God bless the United States of America.

												People are gonna hate me for this review and probably get downvoted quick, but the team support and devs of this game suck♥♥♥♥♥ First of all, just to be clear the gameplay and game technicals are fine, its a generic MMO with anime style blend into it. But the problem is there is too much bot hakcs and people out for scamming, the biggest issue however is that you will randomly get banned or blocked if you are away for too long. The smartass or ""fanboy"" of this game will tell you that it's your fault for using bots etc, but i have never used any of those nor did i do anything against the term and services but i still got blocked. Why you ask? Simple, i bet the developers blocked or disabled any account that has been away for a while and that♥♥♥♥♥♥is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and sneaky corporate scam. ♥♥♥♥ this game and ♥♥♥♥ the aeria company. I have payed for this game using real money and what they did to me is banning my account without any reason.			"

												BORING... music is so repetitive, you would rather prefer to listen to your own music instead. Long dialogues, no voices, quests are all the same (kill 5 birds, kill 4 butterflies... blah blah, you level up, and thats it). Your invo is srly confusing... PLENTY of different stuff (skills, armo etc) and u barely use it actually... idk if you would at some point, but DUDE, this game makes u feel asleep after the first 10 minutes ... you should have a really boring life to play this more than one hour without realizing that this game is bad...

												This is one of the biggest disappointments I have faced in my life. I went into this game expecting a wonderful world where I can fantasize about being a loli princess and found myself bombarded by terrible UIs that take up the entire screen upon starting even the tutorial. The only method of playing this game is to play the number keys like a keyboard and mash out everything because there is nothing but a short cooldown for every single skill. I am almost positive that I have several viruses on my computer after installing this game.			"

												So the game just threw you into a fight and was like, UGH CONTROLS SUCK! Eff where your character is facing, YOU CONTROL THE CAMERA, cuz you know, pro gamers control cameras. And then like your characters armor/clothing is far beyond impractical, like they were looking at Final Fantasy and was like...Psh....yeah well...we can do that too! And so I'm running around, my char is quiet as a ninja, no footsteps, indications on screen suck, and this NPC says to equip my gun, by clicking on my backpack THERE IS NO BACKPACK ICON. So after clicking on EVERYTHING, I somehow equipped the weapon and im like how the fudge!? WHERE was the gun icon I dragged onto a weapons box to equip!? AND THEN they're like ""Btw you should meet this dude named Andre so you can immediately mess stuff up!"" and I'm like ""Serious? You call this a tutorial?"" So I talk to the guy, run up to a monster, capped him like itss a drive by and like it dies....easily...and the sound effects suck. no variation, no flame sounds where theres fire..no Batmans screamin ""WHERES RACHELS!?"" and I'm like wow..totally..non immersive experience			"

												Aura Kingdom? Pah. More like Awful Kingdom. Great pun, I know. This game, this very game, now going to be the first game that I give up on. I'm sure there will be more, that's a given, but this thing needs some major work until I consider it something worth my time. The first thing you'll notice when you open up the game is that horrible, horrible music. I'm not blowing things out of proportion when I say that it will make your ears bleed. Just mute it right off the bat and reserve your blood supply, I'm sure you'll put it to better use in the future.   The story was mediocore at best. I found myself clicking through the dialogue with boredom, opting to continue to level my character and explore more features than delve into the story, which is usually an important feature to me. The characters held no value, and I didn't grow attached to any of them. Most of them didn't hang around long, and disappeared soon after you talked to them. No replay value at all, either. The graphics were meh, and seemed as if no one had put any thought into it. Yeah, sure, just throw some anime girls around! I'm sure everyone will just love it even though they barely have any relevance to the game. Even the loading screens had me ticked off. Everything was just so...so...cutesy! Add that to the obvious neglect, and you've got something that I wouldn't go near even if my life depended on it. Really, you're lucky I even played two hours of this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Animations were a mess, I've got to tell you. They weren't specialized for each class, and oftentimes the weapons would phase into your character as you moved. This was especially apparent when trying the oh-so-nifty animation previews in the process of character creation, and everything just seems so sloppy and undone. I mean, if you're going to even add classes, at least make them unique! I didn't even recount the various other areas that needed some serious work, and this is already a problem that would turn many people off on the game. Going off of the previous paragraph, the classes were pretty underdeveloped as well. As said before, the animations for the character were everywhere. The classes had no distinguishing features besides cool weapons that barely had any relevance to fighting style. Really, you just spam the various powers and the monster goes down. To put an emphasis on weapons and such, you have to have some depth to it. This game felt empty, plastic. Imitation, you could say. You would think they would be catering to the little kids out there, as it most certainly feels childish compared to other games of this sort. I didn't like any of the things that were most unfortunately added to the game, and would rather just go to sleep then stay up all night playing this game, as you know all of us gamers love to do.This is a game that hides beneath the smooth cover. Don't even try playing this if you're in it for a good story or a unique combat or ranking system. Better to leave it alone, I say.			"

												The terrain doesn't work / you can walk over anything or clip into walls or buildings, except for places blocked by an invisible wall, they are everywhere. As for the graphics, it' old WoW style but in anime world, not 2015 next gen stuff, It'd be ok if it would be a game from 2008. The sound effects are poor, or nonexistent. The game often refuses to play sound while I talk over Skype. The whole thing is full of bugs. The actual gameplay is point and click with WASD movement, like any other classic mmo. You can progress quickly between the levels by completing the same sets of quests on different maps. It is really boring. You do get a ""pet"" at the start that you can talk to to some extent which is nice. This could be the sole reason to play this but getting the cool ones is impossible unless you have turbo luck(which you don't), a lot of cash(you could spend that on a better game) or you're planning on playing for like half a year(y u cereal?!).  For the first few hours the models were actually cute, all 20 of them. Later they get recolors or resizes to keep the game fresh and new.The Very Positive user reviews is a joke. Feel free to play this just for the cute anime style and silly fanboys. Just dont expect to get a satisfying gameplay experience.One more thing is that it's an Aeria Games title. That basically means that the content is years  behind the original (Frontier Online), the cash shop is expensive and the game urges you to spend cash for everything. For the small amount of PvP it has (no open pvp just arena and duel), you'll be flattened without a heavily buffed character, which you acquire the same way as eidolons(the pets). I reached level 60 in two days. I wasn't satisfied by the end of it. Decided to just drop this thing after reading guides on how to get them eidolons or even gold, because quests sure won't give you much(yes the market IS broken).So just don't play this if you want to play an MMO. Do it for the cute girls. I wouldn't recommend spending a cent of a jar of air for this and I'm pitiful for playing 5+ hours with it. Yeah...			"

I personally don't find it fun to click a quest title, and watch my character follow an invisible line, beat up enemies, and collect items all on its own. However, you CAN do this on your own, manually.-Art style is decent-Community seems fairly large-Cluttered UI and a confusing system overall			"

												Level 1:  100 missions of kill 14 Whatevers, Collect 20 Bear asses.Level 60: 100 missions of kill 14 Whatevers, Collect 20 Bear asses.EDIT:  Perhaps I wasn't being harsh enough with my review. ...Hold on :  Not my idea of fun. If you like wasting time with friends with an utterly unimpactful MMO footprint where nothing you do ingame matters. It's literally 450 fetch quests per region. (~15 NPCs//region * 30 quests each(15 ``kill 14 Whatevers``, 15 ``Collect Human Feces``)). - - - - - - 100% of enemies in this game are bullet-sponges. Let that slow-pacedness sink in for a moment  - - - - - -And you can't go to a new region until you've utterly rinsed your current one of the above fetch quests. Maybe if the fetch quests were skippable they wouldn't be so _readily apparent_ .  Maybe half(or more) of them should get replaced with things that are more interesting... Unless this game engine is too primitive for anything but fetch quests. :P-- -- -- -- --After a week and a half of _this_ . I decided I'd [[[refuse to do any endgame content]]]  as I assume it's just going to be as boring as the ~65,536 fetch quests I grinded. (First impressions are not something you screw with ^_^   )There is one good point though:This game is the rare exception where the [[[dialogue boxes are THEMED]]] instead of using the generic uncustomized ``unreal MMO`` layout.  The dialogue boxes put the characters front-and-center with large, easy to read text. ----Most MMOs decide to leave this GUI _COMPLETELY UNCUSTOMIZED AND UNTHEMED_ often with small, hard to read 6-pt font out in the corner. So hurray for Aura Kingdom ! !Utterly forgettable THOUSAND-PART storyline. Might as well not have one at all. .... Or try splitting it into ```one-day-of-gameplay``` episodes with chapters or even ending credits so that the story is easy to comprehend.this MMO also uses click-to-go quests, for shame. Even moving to quest-givers is automated			"

												well if one thing is certain then mmo designers certainly enjoy sticking to  formulae.this game lacks any originality and entirely relies on combat which somehow manages to be both clunky and unchallengingand left me feeling rather unsatisfied. the story adheres to that of every ATMMOJRPG (anime themed massive multiplayer online japanese role playing game) not so much in theme but more in that it's mainly dogshit.The one possible redeeming factor would be the ability to quickly skip through 90% of the early gameplay and story with mindless button mashing. and the ""vibrant"" were vibrant for sure but somehow managing to look less appealing than a month old quiche left down the back of the sofa .this does to the eye what a gimp does to a smaller gimp only this time the smaller gimp doesnt want to be ♥♥♥♥ed through every oraface imaginable .  i like anime in generali usually enjoy mmo'sbut this is genuinely worse than testicular cancer and i'll be glad to rid myself of it.0/10 wouldnt get ♥♥♥♥ed by again			"

												The game is unplayable. Can't play it in 1080 because it cuts off 2/3 of the screen, so it looks terrible. Game constantly crashes and keeps asking me to send error reports. Had to rebuild the game files due to corruption from crashes. Game used to be pretty cool (albeit a bit dated and amateurish....wish this was more like Tera). Not to mention, It deleted every character I had. Long story short...game is, for me, completely unplayable. Needs some fixes and I'll download it again...hopefully.			"

												Just barely getting into the game, I was not pleased with their organization. They had multiple windows that were all bashed up together in a single small screen. Just already being in the way. I have to try and go to settings to be able to remove some windows. However, even the chat log would become visible everytime my cursor would go by it, ending up being in the way anyways even after specifically going into the settings to present itself in not being in the way.Also, in the tutorial, it has me try and open a prize. Yet, he says 'You are not required to open it yet.' I don't understand that concept, when the arrows led me to show me how to open it, in not even experiencing the prize in the tutorial. Makes no sense.Just by barely playing it for about maybe 5 minutes, I already just went ahead and got out of it and already planning on uninstalling it. I couldn't play it, because of how specific things weren't corroperating and the organization wasn't very helpful either. There is good positives about the game. I like how they gave previews of the players actions and that there were extend of character choices, also the fact there is a mini sidekick. I liked the actions where they character could even dance during the character set up, that one was interestng. Although, in the character set up, there could maybe possibly have some sort of outfit of choice others could make.I just hope this game gets better in developing and fix things.

												I had high hopes for this game, but upon release I found that they were swiftly crushed.- The games movement mechanics are awkward, most of the times I left clicked to move, my character wouldn't stop if I clicked somewhere else or targeted a monster.- The skills are pretty but the leveling of skills is confusing, their level just seems to grow with no noticeable change in stats.- Like many others have stated, this game is pay-to-win, you can listen to npc conversations to get points for use in special shops, but you recieve so few points compared to prices of average shop items that you have to use real cash to purchase the ingame points. (Ex. one conversation gave 3 points / some shop items are in the 10k and 100k's)- Your character levels up and you get ATK points, which can increase damage, critical, or speed. The value changes every time you level, and the increase for the selected value is always minimal, about a 0.30% boost to attack speed, or a 0.15% boost to critical chance, or a 1 point damage boost. For now, horribly unbalanced.- Normal items like potions aren't too terribly expensive early on, but they do require a bit of grinding to get the coins.- I'll be honest, I had a lot more fun jumping on roof tops and sitting on the ocean floor taking screenshots than doing the quests or grinding. Your character doesn't say anything, you get narrative text that says what ""you"" did. (EX. ""You apologize and ask for any way to make it up to her."") More or less, the conversations are just silly, one guy says his toast was going naked without the Jam you brought him. (You're a true hero.)This game needs a lot of improvement in my opinion, and I may come back to it after a few patches, but for now I'm done with Aura Kingdom. The only real high point for me was the adorable starting monsters, and that's not really enough for me.			"

												I got this game becaus origonaly i thought ""sure, why not its free"" but now after have actualy played the game I can see this was a huge mistake. the first problem with the game is that It does not launch at the optimal settings for your computer like modern games normaly do, I had to go through the tutorial and character creation not being able to see anything because the game decided to launch in 800x600 resolution, causing the HUD to take up 99% of the screen also obstructing the tutorial and the initial dialouge which i missed because it was text only. The second thing wrong with the game is that you have almost no physical control over your character during missions, your character auto attacks and auto runs to the objective meaning if you are lazier than the nrmal video gamer you can sit thear eating popcorn whilel all you do is hit a button and watch your character play the game for you. The next thing that was wrong with this game was that I had picked a RANGED character, and the auto attack system made my character litteraly go up to the boss and stand 2 cm from it and start shooting while the boss sat there and slapped me in the face repeatedly. I attempted to manualy controll my character but my charcter wouldnt attack unless I pressed the ""do everything for me"" button and if I tried to maualy controll my character during combat he stopped attacking. Do not get this game it is a complete and utter waste of time.			"

												Do you enjoy jumbled text-heavy screens? How about reading bad dialogue during long and frequent cutscenes? Do you enjoy missing half of the events in a mission because your camera is facing the wrong way? How about ludicrously skimpy costumes on suppsedly fierce warriors? If not, don't bother with this. Even though it's free, it's still overpriced, and it's not worth the time it takes to download.			"

												""Fun, polished, and addictive experience - MMORPG""Fun, maybe if they did the other two. Ten minutes into the game I find myself frustrated with an intrustive UI that I cannot customize. The game does let you attempt to customize, but no matter what you do, all elements of the UI will remain on your screen. From the oversized chat box, to the microtransaction and reward-addiction pop ups.Polished not very well if it was. I had been given a first time log in gift. But I'm unable to use it for several levels. Why? Now its sitting in my inventory taking up space and I have to deal with log in pop ups every time I log in? No thanks. Character models were clipping their ""polished"" animations and costumes. On top of that you cannot move while attacking, you cannot move faster than a snails pace, and I had no interaction with the Eidelon pet that I was eager to meet. Instead I was thrust into a WoW clone quest event chain.In summary, I uninstalled this shoddy MMORPG wannabe before I wasted more of my time.			"

												My review:Anyone who DOES NOT LIKE ANIMEE or is coming to this from World Of Warcraft, then DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!...Your still here? Good, then let's discuss this great game.The Good Points:(Please note, if i need to explain something indepth, i will do at the bottom of the review... You will tell if i am explaining something in depth because it will be bracketed with [.]) It's animee (I lOVE animee)Fast leveling [in the begining]Eidlons [Battle companions] [Quick access to mount][Auto Route]SKill and stat heavy [could also be a bad point]Auto level system [if you wish]The Bad points:[Auto Route]Fast leveling [in the begining]Eidlons [Battle companions][Quick access to mount]Skill and stat heavy [could also be a good point]Auto level system [if you wish]Now the explinations...Why have i listed ever good point as a bad point? Because this game nis like *marmite* (literally) [Fast leveling explained]: Ok, someone coming from WoW or another famous MMO will play this game for 10-15 minutes and already be level 12 and feel over-powered... That all changes from level 20+... you will start to realise that it becomes a heavy grind after 25 (taking up to 45 minutes just to gain a single level... unless you have an exp booster, or exp heay gear) Where some might love the fast levels, other people wont... where some will love the long levels, other people wont.Eidlons [Battle companions]: ok, once you get to about level 4-5 you will have a blue orb follow you, this eventually turns into your battle companion (the one you chose to team up with at character creation)... This is good because depending on your class choice your Eidlon will complement it (THATS WHAT THEY ARE FOR so choose wisely... example: If your class doesn't have any stars (or very minimal stars) in health then choose the pink flying eidlon, as she will heal you over time... The bad points with eidlons is you HAVE TO LEVEL THEM UP (it wont do it for you).... some people think they are over-powered when they get to high levels (you fight a mob... you only get a single hit in before your eidlon does a *Smack-down* on it...), you have to interact with your eidlon (ask it things) for *Link Points*, (liks are good), if you link with your eidlon you have a % of recieveing eidlon food or upgradeable *stones* (please play the game for more info ;)[Quick access tgo mount]: THIS IS NOT WoW!!!!Ok... this is a double edged sword... you get your mount (every one in the game does) at about level 3-4... its an osterich!!! (lolz) the bad thing about this is the fact that its universal (everyone in the game gets it at the same level... you dont even have to work for it!(you get it from a quest)) Its also slow as hell!!! (maybe 5% faster than walking IMHO)... Good points? Its FREE and... it's a MOUNT :D[Auto Route]:Why is ths bad?/Why is this good?Ok its good for these reasons... You have a quest? You're lost in the wilderness/you have to go to the other side of the world to do it? WHY THE HELL ARE YOU COMPLAINING? just left click the quest you want on you quest list and ZING... Auto piolet!!!.. this means you can chat... roll a ciggy... look on google, download more games etc while you get to where you need to be.Why is this bad?Ok... i will list the reasons I think its bad:Its bad because it will speed you through tonnes of mobs that could give you exp... you can't explore on your own with it enabled, there is no option to turn it off (however, independant movement will cancel this feature... all you have to do is click the quest again and.... ZING!!!)[Skill and stat Heavy]:Not everyone's *Cup of tea*ok, let's say your a duelist... you need crit and speed/evasion above anything else?... That's ok, because every piece of armor that drops is 95% class apparent (most of the quests will only give you armour/weapons for your class) Go figure...When using the stat/power system you have to make sure that you spend 99% of it on crit/speed/evasion (in THAT ORDER) or you will fail as a duelist (that's my personal oppinion)Auto Leveling Sytem [If you wish]:This will not be for everyone!at least its a choice... when you are leveling up your stats you have a choice for it to do all the hard work for you (it will auto allocate stat points if you ask it to) or whether or not you want to be a confused *Nab* and fail with your class (you will only use this feature for about 5 levels, and then you will get the idea)My reveiew is almost done:Me personally, i got this game when i couldn't afford to pay for WoW once, and it got me hooked.I feel that almost everyone is on an even footing in this game (ofc there is going to be someone bigger/faster/stronger/betetr than you, its an MMO! But it doesn't penalize you for being a noob as much as WoW or any similar game would.I know my reveiw is very mixed, but thats the point... i am not telling you to * Buy/not buy* this game based on a one-sided/biased *This game is rubbish don't get it/ This game is amazing, get it now!!!* you deserve to know the truth when thinking about playing a game :DAll i will say in endorsing this game :D :D.... It's free to play!!! (but its also P2W... NOT HEAVILY btw!!!! But it is P2W... although you can do it as F2P but it is a grind... and that... IS THE POINT!)laters(End Note:)Why is this game not in my active library? its because i forgot my password and had to make a new account :Doverall i would give this game an easy 8.5/10			"

												Yes, yes and a thousand times YES. This game might not look like much at first glance but it is extremely fun.  The xp curve makes it enjoyable to quest and level up. No extensive points of mindless grinding to get to that next level. 55+ begins the challenge though and is the test of how well you pace yourself though. The community is amazing. Just about everyone you meet in the game is super nice and super helpful.  the character customization I will say could use a little sprucin up, give us more variety with hair and face, maybe even body styles. But their coming along with their costumes. People say this game is 'pay to win' which honestly is not the case. Yes, I've spent money on the game because I want to. You don't have to. The game offers you not only chances in game to earn cash shop items butthey make it insanely easy to earn what they call loyalty points which can be used to buy cash shop items from their loyalty shop. All in all, wonderful game.  Nice core gameplay, good community, and lots to do to keep you entertained.			"

												It's pretty much any generic MMO. Nothing new or crative. The story is meh, and any immersion there was would be gone just by making a character. Non-spoiler aleart, you don't get rid of your Eldion, since you picked it at character creation.Delve into a world where you're the hero (typical) and doing story after story quest chain. Better off being a single-player with co-op function game instead of a MMO.UI is clutterful, crafting hastingly shoves in your face while uncertain of how to get certain materials. Only thing that's different is fishing, which pretty much is the only thing that adds any difficulty in the game at all.It's good for a time killer once or twice but beyond that it's nothing to put several hours in...Also, bot infested.

												It crashed, and then it crashed, and then I lowered my settings to potato levels, and then it crashed.Honestly it looks like a bog standard MMORPG anyway so I'm not too upset, though once again that is a reason to just not bother, GW2 is free, failing that there are about 20 other anime styled MMOs out there on Steam alone.

												Uninstaled, ""Unable to connect to server"" for about 3 hours, I have no patience for games like these. Before you have any thoughts about my machine, I have heck of a high end laptop and never had any issues with any other games, I can run any game in highest setings and it is up to date with drivers etc. Seemed like a good fun game to pass time, but if am unable to play I might as well not keep it around occupying space in my laptop :)			"

												Can't get this game to even work.  Just installed in and keep getting server failed to connect (2).  My internet is fine I just downloaded the whole game.  My firewall I allowed this game through.  I patched it and even ran full software checks twice.  Checked for server maintenance...nope.  Yeah this game must be broke.  Game does in fact boot up and gives me full load bar but when it gets to the main screen it just shows me an error.  It's F2P so I will just uninstall it from my computer and promptly forget it exists.*Edit* 6/7/2015  Tried again many months (10) later to play this game.  The game loads up fine but gives me the same message that it did all those months ago.  Splash screen starts up fine.  A box pops up which is most likely a browser window and gives *success* green bar and then disappears.  The game itself loads and I see the intro game town and music.  At this point I would expect some sort of login but all I get is a box that says failed to  connect to server (2) and a button when clicked kills the game.  Even though it normally is a security risk, I disabled anything that might conflict with outgoing traffic including firewalls in the hopes that it is some blocked port setting or some such.  No luck.  I have swept my PC for any malware of any kind.  No issues.  My connectivity is solid and I can load up not only websites in any browser but also can play other MMO games with the exact same PC, no issues.  Just can't seem to get this game going.			"

												Autopilot : The Game.If you like an MMORPG where you can be a cute animu grill AND manage to not use your keyboard for a few hours, then this is the game for you! Seriously, though, when you get a quest, you can click the quest objective and the game literally takes you there; it holds your hand several steps beyond quest markers. Not just that, but it auto-mounts you too, so you don't even need to do that! Plus you have a companion that will wind up doing all the attacking for you!Honestly, if the game didn't need you to click the next quest objective once in a while, you could probably leave it running overnight and wake up as max level.That being said, the gameplay's alright. The story's awful and it plays like a generic MMORPG, but considering it's free...not bad.Still, though, I would suggest not wasting your time with this.			"

												I'm using Windows 7 and this game did run well at all. Constantly freezing and the character movement, mouse clicking etc was so jerky it distracted from the actual game play. I have not modified my computer to run specifically for games and don't plan on doing it. I tried my best to ignore it, to see what the game was all about. I was just looking for a nice rpg to play in my free time. I've played WOW before but didn't want the commitment that game requires. Still this just seemed like copy of that, painted pink for anime fans, with no skill required.   Played for about an hour before giving up. Was not impressed.  Uninstalled it.			"

Posted: July 4, 2014
												TL;DR: I uninstalled this game after an hour of playing.. or looking around for sources of sounds. Very buggy game that made me restart/launch many times. Nothing interesting or new in this game - click and kill. Weird beeping noises when you press buttons - makes you jump and think it's from real life. Once I thought it was coming from my PC because the sound is localized in one side of my headphones so it didn't sound like it was coming from the game... I honestly panicked and thought my PC was going to blow up. The second time, I thought it was my dog crying... it wasn't until 30 minutes later, I realised it was the game. When I first loaded the game, it had a white box with no ""exit"" button on the top corner. I had to exit the launcher 4 times before it finally loaded with my account. When I finally did get into it, half my interface was broken, could not see my xp bar, my bags, and when I did press the shortcuts for them, it made an ""error"" sound - which I happened to get a lot of during the entire hour I was in the game. The NPC chat boxes would pop up for a bit but once I moved my mouse, it would disappeared. I restarted the game and everything was fix cept the error noises and random beeping. I got to the first town, quests that required 'delievery' was quite confusing and had me stumped often. My map was still not showing up no matter how many times I pressed 'M'. Relaunched the game. Map finally decided to show up after 2 restarts.Combat, very subpar, just clicking and shooting, nothing interesting other than watching your projectiles fly and hit a monster and their HP bars goes down. The screenshots in the store looks very beautiful and has crisp artwork but the game didn't really have that aspect. I looked for it and I could not find anything as nice as the screenshots. I actually wanted to take screenshots myself of my own character and be proud that something so pretty was in my steam gallery. The characters, however, were very cute... I give them that. At this point, I thought that this game was probably made 10 years ago. I took a break and tried to give it another go since I was quite excited about the game and it took a chunk out of my data allowance to download, 10 minutes, I logged off and uninstalled.			"

												This is a very first impression, I managed to play the game for 30 minutes before I had seen enough.The game doesn't run smoothly on my 4 gb ram, 2nd gen i5 processor, and 2gb NVIDIA video card laptop, even with the video settings turned down. This is the result from poor game design as other higher-end MMORPG's like guild wars 2 run fine. The game feels unresponsive and clunky, the minimap icons jump around when you move, and the camera panning isn't alinged with the cursor speed, resulting in having to move your mouse back into position after you move the camera if your mouse sensitivity is any higher than default.The game itself looks nice enough if you can get over the standard kawaii boob-showing female characters that always tend to come with these kind of games. There is a wide variety of classes to pick from, ranging from your standard healers, buffers, tanks and dps that are designed for late-game PvE to several classes that focus on either melee or ranged AoE attacks that are likely designed for taking on larger groups of monsters to maximize leveling speeds.The microtransaction system seems to be very ariagames-like. You will get a daily reward consisting of xp boosts and the like that you can use fom lvl 20 and up, and if you require more than that, or other luxury items like extra fast mounts or armor upgrades (call this pay to win if you like), you will have to pay real money for this.

Do you like to be immersed in rich fantasy worlds? Do you like dynamic, well-written characters? Do you like to play video games? Then this isn't the game for you! Yes, this can hardly be called a game at all. Its the most useless fetch-quest production I've ever had the displeasure of wasting time on. I admittedly only got through the first 10 levels but if you don't believe me. Try it. Just the first hour. You will deeply regret everything about it. Everything is so pointless, I fell into an existential depression with my short time in this game. Everything is automated to the piont where you don't really have to participate, the art and animation is f*cking stupid and looks like an hd remake of a dreamcast game.  I reccommend this game to people who hate themselves, hate games, and weeb out over stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥ 10/10 best of its class.			"

												I did not play this game for very long. I mostly played it because it was free and I enjoy MMOs. It's pretty basic, a rather fast levelling system and an auto-move system that makes it even easier to get to where you need to go. It's like Eudemon's Online or the newer Mage Realm but in 3D.Just another Aeria game that they can add to their list. Semi-Japanese inspired RPGs that caters to the Western world. It doesn't really offer anything new other than a chibi artstyle. There are definitely many other MMOs that can top this game and especially MMOs that are now free.If you need something free to play for a little then go ahead and try this out. But, I would suggest something more prominent such as Tera or, Elder Scrolls Online, Secret World, or Guild Wars 2 if you have the money to purchase it initially.I mostly picked it up for a game to play for a short while to keep me busy and busty girl characters.

												AK does not allow steam in purchasing AP using steam wallet.[EDIT]So I googled this issue and guess what? I found out that area doesn't allow purchase from Steam Wallet or almost a year now and all they say is ""looking into it"" whenever you ask for support. If you do not have USD curency then you won't be able to buy their in game currency which is a huge advantage knowing that this game is heavily P2W! I will not recommend it for new players or old players that creaeting a new account.Also, I noticed that they only have less than 100 players everyday. Pretty much dead.			"

												I used to play this on aeria games years ago. I tried to relogin my level 50 Wizard/Sorcerer (what was it called again?) then I forgot the secondary password, bummer! Anyway I tried to create a new account with a rather hassle method. Tested a new class (Scythe) and wow, they have improved the game a lot in a way.As for a point and click RPG it was okay. I mean, you can evade your enemy attack. There is no MP/Mana/Stamina/Energy to use the magic/skills but there is cooldown, cooldown everywhere.TL;DR if you're into an anime MMO, mindless grinding, have a lot of luck, have a lot of money to spend for this game, then this one is just right for you. If you want a balance PvP, no just no! If this game was 5 years ago, I probably say yes to everything. Today? just no, no, and no.			"

												I really enjoyed it. I had some issues playing this on windows 8, but I still had fun. They are releasing plenty of good items and summons and give everyone a chance to get them. Most things in the item shop are pretty cheap, but some things are a bit overpriced. All in all, it's a pretty good game and I plan to play again.Edit: Supposedly, I got blocked after taking an extended break from the game. I played the game for quite a while so needed a break. I took time to play many other games I needed/wanted to beat, as well as concentraiting on things like my writing. Then, I go back to Aria Games website to login in, and couldn't. Thought I forgot my password after all this time. So, I go to try to reset password. That's when it says that my account is blocked. I've spent plenty of money on this game and find it rediculous that they'd find taking a break from the game as a reasonable excuse to block me.If they fix this issue of theirs, I will change back to a yes for recommendation. But until then, It will be staying a negative for me.Edit 2: Gave the thumbs up back. They replied quickly and reactivated my account.			"

												Aura kingdom is a great MMORPG that is full of adventures. The games variety of classes, bosses and characters make it a great gamewith lots of choices to be made. The game focuses over story and quests more than grinding your way to high levels and good stats.The major down side of this game, in my opinion, would be that there is no way you, and your friend, can venture through this massive world, limiting you to only being a loner in a giant world.However the game is still brilliant, with lots of fun to have!

												It's your standard fare anime MMO. Those familiar with this formula, and especially with X-Legend games will feel right at home. Whether or not this is your cup of tea is really on you, game is decent and fun enough if you're into grinding the WoWquest formula and don't feel like paying. On that note I feel I should mention that this is an Aeria game, expect blatant cashgrabs for simple things like inventory space.			"

												( It's ""K"" )I will begin with a few basic pros & cons,Pros :Good Graphics for what it is.Standard MMO universal controls. Story based with a more appealing story than most free to play mmos.It is NOT gender restricted. It is NOT pay2win.Every class gets a choice of various pets and said pets are actually very useful.Cons :Extremely grindy as with most free to play games.Quests are extremely repetitive.The Cash shop is completely RNG based. Server Latency issues.Limited number of dungeons. ( So far )Recap :If you're completely new to Mmo's in general, this ""might"" be for you. The game basically plays itself, you literally click on your current quest and off you go, your character automatically moves to it's destination point, it even mounts up. That itself is a Con for me, personally. However, I can understand the convenience. For a mature Mmo player such as myself, this ones an uninstall for me. In short, there are much better free to play games out there.This is of course one mans opinion. Everyone may not share my opinion of the game and that's fine. We are all entitled to our own opinions. It's free, so give it a shot.			"

												I only picked this up today and I can't seem to put it down. I've tried a few free-to-play MMOs in the past (even stuck around on one), but while this game's still got all the similar elements I'm used to in the genre, it's nevertheless the best one I've encountered so far. It's just so enjoyable that I mowed through several hours without realizing it; somehow the seeminly run of the mill repetitive questing wasn't even remotely tedious. But even without that in mind I find that even the battling feels different; it's just so smooth, and the characters are engaging enough to make me invested.Not only that, but as a customization drunkard I thrive off of the opportunity to dress up my character, and Aura delivers early on with costume alternatives available with in-game coin. There's that and the fact that there are so many classes to satisfy my needs for mulling over options for way too long.From what I've experienced so far gameplay-wise, it's like the MMOs I used to like--only polished, improved, and just generally more friendly. And I'm not talking about the community; the game itself just lets you play in whichever way makes you the most comfortable. That's not to say the community's bad, I just tend to solo due to shyness and the like, and the thing about several other games in this family is that keeping to yourself is indirectly frowned upon. You'll realize that it's harder, not as enjoyable--sometimes impossible--to play without teaming up at least once. So far, while still not holding my hand, Aura's given me free reigns to solo to my heart's content.Incidentally, that even led me to join guilds and initiate interactions, so go figure. All they had to do was to let me go at it if I wanted to, not because I had to, and suddenly it was more appealing and more enjoyable in equal measure.These thoughts are kind of all over the place, I realize, but I just have to say I'm glad I came across an MMORPG that's both relaxing, enjoyable and manageable for someone like me. Of course, I'm certain there are plenty of titles like it, but this is definitely the first for me that ended up being just right. It's a rare occasion for someone so bone-numbingly picky.			"

												Aura  Kingdom is a anime styled mmorpg which mixes 2 of my faviote things!Now i love how the dialouge is it's very explanitory on whats happening during the conversation and there are some pretty funny parts in there too.The combat system takes a bit to get warmed up to but is pretty cool.there are many abilitys inside or out of combat to use and not to mention when you hit level 40 you can pick subclasses.the community is really cool and ask everyone if they've watched sword art online im sure you'll love it. overall i give the game a solid 8/10 really good though i didn't gloss over the few problems[most of which involve the game crashing]it's worth a try!

												I used to play this on aeria games years ago. I tried to relogin my level 50 Wizard/Sorcerer (what was it called again?) then I forgot the secondary password, bummer! Anyway I tried to create a new account with a rather hassle method. Tested a new class (Scythe) and wow, they have improved the game a lot in a way.As for a point and click RPG it was okay. I mean, you can evade your enemy attack. There is no MP/Mana/Stamina/Energy to use the magic/skills but there is cooldown, cooldown everywhere.TL;DR if you're into an anime MMO, mindless grinding, have a lot of luck, have a lot of money to spend for this game, then this one is just right for you. If you want a balance PvP, no just no! If this game was 5 years ago, I probably say yes to everything. Today? just no, no, and no.			"

												I only picked this up today and I can't seem to put it down. I've tried a few free-to-play MMOs in the past (even stuck around on one), but while this game's still got all the similar elements I'm used to in the genre, it's nevertheless the best one I've encountered so far. It's just so enjoyable that I mowed through several hours without realizing it; somehow the seeminly run of the mill repetitive questing wasn't even remotely tedious. But even without that in mind I find that even the battling feels different; it's just so smooth, and the characters are engaging enough to make me invested.Not only that, but as a customization drunkard I thrive off of the opportunity to dress up my character, and Aura delivers early on with costume alternatives available with in-game coin. There's that and the fact that there are so many classes to satisfy my needs for mulling over options for way too long.From what I've experienced so far gameplay-wise, it's like the MMOs I used to like--only polished, improved, and just generally more friendly. And I'm not talking about the community; the game itself just lets you play in whichever way makes you the most comfortable. That's not to say the community's bad, I just tend to solo due to shyness and the like, and the thing about several other games in this family is that keeping to yourself is indirectly frowned upon. You'll realize that it's harder, not as enjoyable--sometimes impossible--to play without teaming up at least once. So far, while still not holding my hand, Aura's given me free reigns to solo to my heart's content.Incidentally, that even led me to join guilds and initiate interactions, so go figure. All they had to do was to let me go at it if I wanted to, not because I had to, and suddenly it was more appealing and more enjoyable in equal measure.These thoughts are kind of all over the place, I realize, but I just have to say I'm glad I came across an MMORPG that's both relaxing, enjoyable and manageable for someone like me.

												I've already played 111 hours. I'm not at max level in this game. This game is so damn vast and great, that it will take you to a new level of MMORPG experience. I as a very experienced MMO-Player who plays MMORPG's since 7 years, can say that Aura Kingdom makes you addicted as hell.  My main character is yet level 61. My second character is already 52 and my third one is currently 29.  This game gives you the opportunity to choose not only one class over a high number of available classes, but also to combine two of them into one. This kind of feature is almost non-existant in the world of MMORPG's. There was once Runes of Magic, which was (I have to say) more deeper in terms of primary and secondary jobclass, because no matter which classes you took, you could always create some hybrid skills only available to the combination class. In Aura Kingdom, you get for one class about 2-3 recommended classes in the passive skill tree. Once you have that recommend class, you can unlock some specific skills only available to the combination. If you take a different non-recommended class, you won't have such a special skill, but you surely will have fun nonetheless.Why? You ask? Because Aura Kingdom doesn't punish you for taking different classes. Furthermore, your choices have impact on your character. For example, I've chosen for my first character the class 'Tachi' (The name is kind of ironic, because a Tachi is a saber-like katana, but in fact the class Tachi uses a extremely long version of a Katana which is called Odachi/Otachi/Nodachi). The class Tachi is a great mid to close combat class that excels in bursts, fast attacks and AoE. For my secondary class, I didn't use the recommended classes (Wizard/Katar/Necromancer) because all three of them are not my style, atleast not in the style I wanted the character to be. So I used the Gunslinger. Why? The Gunslinger class is a great sub-class because he generates up to 5 different ammunition that can heal, reduce enemy target's damage, deal damage over time or reduce the target's armor and more. The Gunslinger class is also a great single-target focused class, with a few skills that can deal damage in a line of path. He also has some traps that can snare the target, which is great for the Tachi to set up his special skills. On top of that, the Tachi can dash multiple times, appear at the target and yet has only one ranged attack. With the Gunslinger, the Tachi becomes fearless in both close and ranged attack and I have met many situations where I couldn't go head-first into the fight and had to attack from afar.There's another example. I've chosen for my secondary character Ravager. The Ravager is a beast, with a ramping damage amplifier, he can deal tons of damage in short time. He also has two ranged skills, but the best thing on him is his durability. However, he has no real sustain and can be bested with damage over time and crowd control. So I've chosen as a secondary class the Sorcerer. The Sorcerer has great range capabilities and is similar to the Gunslinger, a great secondary class to build its special resource in the course of time. The Sorcerer can leech, heal and inflict a formidable stun. On top of that, he has a great AoE sleep skill and contributes very well with a debuff that he inflicts on the target, which heals the attacker everytime when the enemy target is hit.Aura Kingdom also offers a variety of dungeons, which can be attended fast with a dungeon finder plus teleport. Like in many MMORPG's, you find out that there is no connection between high level players and low level players. Mostly you'll encounter them only if you're a high levler yourself - Not in Aura Kingdom. You can encounter and fight with them already with level 45 and play with them in dungeons, because there are so many things you can do in this game and everything contributes to a goal.  This is my review. Most people wouldn't agree, as they see to many negative things in Aura Kingdom.  Yes, I've played 111 hours. Yes, I've tried to get a Eidolon (battle pet) about 50 times in the temple and only fragments of keys dropped. Yes, I know that you have only three character slots which can be unlocked with loyalty (obtained through questing and so on) or with real money. The focus on Aura Kingdom is to have fun, and for a long time I can agree with that. Since AION 2.1, Tera CBT, RoM GameForge and WoWotLK I didn't had so much fun and was so addicted to a MMORPG. I know this won't last forever, but I'll try to enjoy the game until it's dawnfall. And I hope you will find great joy in this game as well.			"

												The game is really easy to pick up, really fun to play, and easy to get the hang of. Personally, I've played a few MMOs, and I found that the usage of the skill bar is almost too easy to learn, thus making PVP fights all about gear/exp/skills rather than the mastery of the skill board and movementAll in all the game is very enjoyable, I love almost everything from the graphics, how they accomodate players who don't want to spend actual money on advancements and perks (via Loyalty Points , etc.), and how straightforward it is.

												Aura Kingdom pertains to a very specific demographic.Do you like MMORPGs?Do you like Anime?Do you not mind playing casual games?If you said yes to all of those questions, then you're probably going to be interested in this game. Whether or not its content is enough to keep you interested throughout the game however is another matter.While the game certainly does look really pretty with its environments, character models and overall visual style, the gameplay is something that a majority of people may find lacking. The quest system is comprised of the standard kill X this many times, talk to Y, and collect Z items in order to get from Area A to Area B. The gameplay's enjoyability itself depends on what class you're playing making it range from boring and generic to slightly tactical and rewarding. The sorcerer class for example is pretty much a ""spam whatever skill is off-cooldown which are mostly single-targetting skills""-class making their gameplay rather bland and uninspired. The sorcerer class does have a special system wherein whenever they cast a spell, they charge up a meter and whenever that meter gets full, a new random skill gets added to your 'temporary' skill slots which are skills that can only be accessed via this system. The disappointing detail about this however is that these skills are just stronger versions of your already existing skills, hence adding to their rather uninspired gameplay. The ranger class on the other hand allows you to charge up each of your skills before releasing them and depending on how much you charge them, you get varying effects making the gameplay a bit more strategic. The ranger class also comes with a variety of single target or AOE (linear, cone or circular AOE) attacks and multiple status-ailment-inducers making them one of the more interesting classes to play as. It is however possible to obtain a secondary weapon in addition to your class's main weapon allowing you to basically obtain the skills of another class once you reach a certain level. This does allow players to experiment with different class combinations which is pretty nice.Another comment that could be said about Aura Kingdom's gameplay is that it's very... easy. There is pretty much an auto-pilot function in the game letting you get from your current location to where you need to be for your quest which could be considered a positive by some while a negative by others.Aura Kingdom is by no means the type of game hardcore players would enjoy because it is very clear in how it caters to its niche audience as well as the younger generations. It is a casual game with extremely colorful and visually appealing graphics that makes good use of the anime style. How enjoyable the gameplay is will vary from player to player but I personally did enjoy the times I decide to play this game whenever I'm bored. Whether this game could be for you or not? Well, your mileage may vary.			"

												Apparently there is no skill whatsoever involved in the game, you just level up your equipments and after a certain level it's a grindfest revolving around smashing your face on the keyboard, even the pvp does not require any specific rotation for skills in order to beat your opponent. It's an extremely casual gaming experience, which may be a pro for a lot of people, however, it's what got me to stop playing. If you wanna play a game for mere time killing, perhaps this is the game for you and you can play it whenever you want it as quests are fairly simple. If you want something more challenging, then this game is definitely not what you're looking for.Despite being a friendly community and you get friend requests all over the place, it's also not a community for me. Half the population call themselves ""otakus"" and take pride on that, although I completely despise otakus and weaboos. Don't take me for my steam profile, owning kids after mischieving them is my pride and joy.			"

												Aura Kingdom's is a great MMO! The game has a cutesy feel to it, and a pretty cheesy story line, but I still can't help but to love it.  The charecter customization may not be the best, but it gets the job done.  The game has multiple classes, with my personal favorites being the magic based ones. In addition later on in the game you can have an extra second class which I think is a really nice feature.  I would recommend this game to anyone that is looks for a fun little MMORPG to play! c:			"
