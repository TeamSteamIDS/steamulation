												Just beat the first playthrough, and I have to say this game was totally up to my expectations. -Combat was different and tactical, yet enjoyable-Art Style was beautiful, especially on the cut-scenes-Story kept me glued to the screen -I took about 6 hours going through the first playthrough, that is with some time spend on the challenges-Totally looking forward to the Recursive Mode 2nd playthough Update After Recursive mode playthrough and 100% Achievements-Combat still hasn't gotten old, I love how you can drastically change up how you play by just swaping some skills around-Art is still spot on-Enjoyed the story the second time even more, helped me notice little things I didn't pick up the first time-Limters were a cool concept-The later challenges were perfectly hard without being unfair-This game was totally worth $20-Definate buy if this game is on sale!!Couldn't have asked for more.I totally recommend Transistor!Thanks Supergiant for making a fantastic game.

												I'm older than the rest of you yahoos.  Real life gets ... real.  Games don't catch you like they did as a kid.  Other worries vie for control of your mind even as you try to get away from them;  after they're dealt with the mental fatigue often prevents you from getting immersed in a game (or anything) like you did in yesteryear.For a year or so I've been eye-ing Transistor, trying to discern its worth.  It looked so flashy and neat, but experience has taught me that most such games nowadays have invested far too much in glitz and not enough in depth.  They're shallow and vapid, something you regret wasting your time on after an hour.  False promises and empty husks.   A time waster at best.Transistor  cut through all the old-age baggage and cobwebs-- all the accumulated life-experience that a younger me would just call cynicism-- and hit me in my gut.  Maybe my heart.    It sucked me in, keeping me up until 3 AM on workdays.  There is genuine ART in this game.  I'm thoroughly impressed, and wish I had bought it before.  Thank you, Supergiant Games.			"

												I feel like I need to set the record straight on Transistor. The biggest complaint I've heard about it is that the story is inscrutable and there isn't much of it. First of all, that is not true, but more importantly it just doesn't matter. Transistor is a masterpiece because you don't have to be a detective to enjoy the game. It is, at its very root, a simple love story. If you can appreciate that much and enjoy the beautiful art and incredible music, than you have a game well worth buying.Beyond that there is the mystery of Cloudbank to uncover, and the many philosophical questions to answer. We are taught to value the voices of each person and try to create a consensus that serves to make everyone happy. Transistor toys with the idea of a ""vote"" vs. a ""choice."" Transistor is not preaching any answers, and that's why I think the narrative may come off as weak. We have villains who could be heroes and a main character who reasonably and selfishly just wants to pursue her own life without getting embroiled in any political machinations.This is a supremely beautiful work of art and in so many ways that I will easily recommend it to everyone. Explore the world of Cloudbank for awhile and decide how much you want to discover. I promise that even a short trip will be a memorable one.			"

												Transistor is the second game from Supergiant Games, the developers of the critically acclaimed Bastion. Those who have doubts about whether this game lives up to Bastion's expectation can be at ease: Transistor delivers and more.Story:You play as Red, a famous singer in the city of Cloudbank. One night after a performance, a group of people, the Camerata, attempted to kill Red with a strange, green sword, but she was saved by someone. Waking up, she found herself next to the corpse of a man, stabbed by that same sword: the Transistor. The sword starts speaking, and not only that, but seems to know her. Urging her to pull it out of the corpse, the two start tracking the Camerata down, seeking answers, while fighting what seems to be robotic creatures sent to hunt them down.But things may not be as they seem.The story of Transistor seem simple and straight-forward on the surface, but most of it isn't handed down to the player, instead inferred and concluded from various hints noticed in the environment, character interaction and character profiles. It encourages the player to seek answers along the main character, and leaves a lot up for interpretation. That's something I like in a game.One downside to the story however, is how short it is. It's far too short, the game is far too short. You'll be left wanting more, even with ""recursion"", playing a second play through with your stats intact.Gameplay:The gameplay is a mix of Action RPG and traditional turn-based RPG, using the Turn() system that I will touch upon soon. Red is able to equip up to 4 slots of ""Functions"", essentially abilities, upgrade those functions with up to two functions a slot, and assign functions as passive abilities, for up to 4 passives.In battle, Red wields the Transistor. In Diablo style, she can use the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the keyboard to select an ability, then the right-mouse button to use that ability. Abilities can be offensive, such as shooting a long-range beam or a destructive shockwave, or supportive, such as turning invisible for a period of time or turning enemies friendly. The Turn() system adds a new depth to the action RPG. It allows Red to stop time momentarily in order to plan and input a certain number of commands: attacking, setting up traps, maneuvering around the map to escape enemy clusters or get behind obstacles, you can do all that. But once all commands are preformed and the Turn() bar is depleted, Red is left (almost) unable to attack until it recharges again; use Turn() at your own discretion, balancing attack and defense.The game offers the choice of ""limiters"", handicaps that increase the difficulty of the game in return for better EXP awards. There are achievements you can only get by using limiters, the hardest achieved with all 10 limiters. In addition, there is a ""sandbox"" unlocked in-game that allows you to tackle specific-themed challenges, like a speed challenge, or a Turn-planning challenge.Graphics:Transistor uses an isometric point of view, being able to go in all 2D directions. The sprites are smooth and look good, but the highpoint of the graphics is the artwork. The character portraits, whether in-game or in profiles, are drawn beautifully. The artist, Jen Zee, did a brilliant, detailed job, and it shows even on the OST cover.Sound:Here is where Transistor really shines. The game's OST is amazing. From Ashley Lynn Barrett's beautiful voice in The Spine, In Circles, and other songs, to Darren Korb setting up poignant, melancholic instrumentals that fit the mood perfectly. Tracks play hand-in-hand with gameplay, showing up at specific times for maximum impact, further heightening the experience. I highly recommend getting the OST along with the game, if you can. Well worth the extra bucks.Summary:Transistor is a beautiful, enjoyable game. It has a bittersweet, albeit short, story that forces the player to think. Brilliant soundtrack, and beautiful artwork. The gameplay won't last you long, but there is decent replayability in it. Try picking it up immediately whenever it's on sale.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Transistor Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: RPG; Isometric; Atmospheric; Excellent Soundscape; Sci-Fi My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 7-14 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWTransistor is a story-driven, linear experience that boasts a soulful blend of action-RPG and isometric hack-and-slash.  Beautiful graphics and the alluring, lullaby soundscape create a marvelously intriguing atmosphere that is sure to appeal to nearly any gamer.  The narrative is interesting, but doesn’t explain everything and leaves a lot of room for interpretation.  Together, these aspects create a very entertaining, albeit somewhat short, experience.Probably the first thing you will notice is how aesthetically pleasing this game is.  If you are someone who enjoys games with graphics that feel like interactive paintings, you will definitely enjoy the art-style in Transistor.  Complementing the beautiful art is the serenading, sing-song soundscape.  These elements are perfectly crafted and blended to create a truly inspired atmosphere.  The game drops you right into the thick of the narrative, and things are slowly explained as you progress through the story.  However, the explanations of things are far from “spoon-fed,” and much of the story is open to interpretation.  The tale unfolds during gameplay for the most part, so things stay lively rather than there being many plot-development inspired lulls in the action.  Be aware that because of this style of narrative gameplay, the game is very linear and it will continue to usher you from one spot to the next with little room for exploration.The combat and actual gameplay mechanics are an interesting blend of RPG elements, isometric hack-and-slash, and turn-based tactical planning.  You will gain experience as you play and can unlock new abilities which can then be combined in various ways to keep things fresh as you progress through the game.  A dynamic difficulty system, Limiters, is another appealing aspect of the game.  Using these, you can increase the difficulty of the game in various ways (more enemies, stronger enemies, less access to abilities, etc.) which allows you to customize the gameplay to your skill level.One downside is that the game is rather short.  However, you also can’t even unlock everything in a single playthrough no matter how thorough you are— so the game is clearly designed to be played through at least twice.  That said, I personally would have much preferred if the game was twice as long with the ability to unlock everything in one playthrough.In short, Transistor is a very well designed game that certainly has a very unique identity.  This underlying novelty combined with the charming atmosphere provides a truly enthralling gameplay experience.  I would say any all-around gamer will enjoy this game, and obviously fans of the genre(s) even more so.  Expect 8 to 15 hours depending on if you want to do everything and play through a second time.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												""Hey, Red... we're not gonna get away with this, are we?"" -Mr. Nobody[Spoiler Free]It's time I've finally reviewed Transistor, you know... the game with the talking sword and the mute lady? Yeah that one. Let's begin:Aesthetics: 10/10Well as you can CLEARLY see from the screenshots and the given link above, Transistor is absolutely breathtaking. The game takes the cake for visual and musical extravagance, as both mix so perfectly well with one another, that it become evidently difficult to express in objective terms the splendor that it creates in the brain, how so very atmospheric this game is, it's more of an emotional virtue than one being explainable through words alone. People have been coining the term 'art', which by no means is an understatement, the aesthetics of the game, voice acting (haha three actors, funny), music and graphics are as I rarely say, perfect.Story/Characters: 9.50/10Rarely does the medium of gaming (especially in this day & age) employ such precocious writing and superb storytelling, Transistor applies to this small margin of games. A game that truly respects the intellect and free thinking of it's players, requires an intelligent producer, no? Supergiant deserves an excellent applause for their creative usage of the mechanic of replayability. To truly cherise the game's universe, one must complete the game several times to unlock all of the information that is present. A truly cherishable quality Transistor has, is it's two characters which create a sense of dread and unknowingness with each other. Their relations throughout the game serve to state implicit subjectations on the world around them, Red through her interactions on the OVC and the Transistor's commentary. A huge contrast to each other which creates a sense of accepting lack, one without a body and one without a voice.Mechanics/Gameplay: 8.75/10As an RPG game, Transistor holds a creative candle in the rat saturated tunnel that is the RPG industry. Of recent years, the well known RPG's of it's time have begun to show how dated their mechanics hold up in our era (yes you, Final Fantasy). This is why the liberty to experiment and employ new ideas is so vital in our industry today. Transistor is unique in which that profiles become the tools of the trade. Transistor can be played as a turnbased game or as a free action one, which by the way, both work very well in concurse with another. You have 13 functions (abilities) to use in your kit, yeah I know that's a small amount, but guess what? for every function you have, you get the ability to fuse with another, and for every fusion you have with another function, you get to fuse with another! So this means there are roughly 22,283,705,698,113 combinations of Transistor functions. (Transistor Wiki, Cited) That's a lot of unique ways to fight your enemies. Final Verdict: 9.50/10It's hard to see why in this day and age producers don't want to experiment with their products given that the industry would absolutely kill for it, but then again, since when do producers even listen to the demands of the consumers? Transistor is a beacon of hope in the dark hallway that is the gaming industry, and hopefully you can agree with me, that this game is something special.			"

												(WARNING: LONG COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW, READ EDIT 4 FOR OVERALL SUMMARY)This game is created by the same makers as Bastion, which is one of my favorite games ever. Upon loading, Transistor is visually appealing, and Logan Cunningham (Rucks in Bastion) makes a reappearance which is exciting. Controls are fluid, music is amazing--I'm very excited to play through this game!EDIT 1: After playing for about an hour, I must say that I think all the expectations I have had for this game are met. Unlike Bastion, which was more of a go-get-em game, Transistor really makes you think and analyze your tactics in battle, especially with the new ""time stop"" system where you can plan out your actions (each move you make will cost part of your ""energy bar""). There are plentiful save points, and a nice level-up system to improve your skillset. The game is mysterious so far, and I think it really fits into the mood. However, some people might dislike how the story isn't really clear, and you're just following the path without much reason until (supposedly) later on in the game when things will be made more clear. My only qualms with the gameplay itself are the somewhat repetitive nature of the fights (although each fight calls for new tactics), and the somewhat tricky level-up system which seems a bit arbitrary. The upgrades arn't clearly defined as to what exactly they do. Overall, some parts of the game feel like I'm not sure what's going on or what I'm supposed to do to upgrade the Transistor with, but that just adds to the mysterious nature of the game at the beginning. EDIT 2: Having come across the first ""boss"" now, I really think that I can speak for all people when I say--wow. The way in which the ""characters"" speak is amazing. The fight had me on my toes, really making me consider the best way to defeat it without losing too much health. I was blown away at how the screen colors changed and blurred as I started to lose more and more health.  EDIT 3: After tinkering for a while at an Access Point (checkpoints basically), I think I figured out exactly how the upgrades work. The Transistor has four slots which hold a primary ability. Each primary ability has two secondary ""upgrade"" slots. In addition, you have four passive slots. You will collect ""cores"" which you can slot and re-slot at any Access point. For instance, I could socket Crash() into Ability 1, with Break() as its ""upgrade"" to have a medium-damaging medium-range attack that mini-stuns (opposed to the regular melee-ranged attack without the Break() upgrade). Or, (normally), you could leave Crash() as Primary Ability 1 (melee-range attack) and Break() as Primary Ability 2 (Long-Ranged attack). Or, you could put one into your passive once you get more cores. There are also ""Limiters"" which increase the power of the enemies you face (similar to Idols in Bastion), but reward you with more EXP. Indeed, the customization is insane in this game--I can foresee myself spending quite a bit of time customizing once I obtain more cores. Play how you want to play--fighter, stealth, assassin, long-range--just customize your cores to fit your playstyle! Extremely well done, albeit a little confusing at first to figure out the customizations. Only qualm might be (if any)...there are TOO MANY choices!EDIT 4: Finished the game, Steam says it took me ~5 hours overall, but this doesn't include the second playthrough (Recursion Mode) which I think I will be playing soon. Overall, I think this game is a worthy successor to Bastion. However, I still prefer Bastion. Why? Bastion was a bit more clear-cut and easier to process. The Calamity happened, fix it. In this game, it took until halfway through the game for me to actually realize most of the protagonist/antagonist/story arc. There were also quite a few ""did not expect that"" moments, which can be both seen as positive and negative overall. I personally was confused at the ending--in a way, for me, not much closure, but I accepted it. I could see it going over poorly with lots of people however. This game feels a lot darker than Bastion for sure, and I really thought that the narration in some parts was quite hefty and really tugged at my conscience. It definitely leaves you with a lot to think about and has more going on beneath the surface--you will want to play this game with a very open and sharp mind. Great to discuss as well. Also, remember to check out all the OVC Terminals--you definitely don't want to skip those as a fair portion of the story and development relies on you reading and filling in the blanks from the information given at them (Thanks to Dragonfire973 for reminding me!). Also, when you have time, make sure you socket all the functions into every slot (Primary/Secondary/Passive) and read up on all the information unlocked. Pros: Amazing Artwork, Beautiful Soundtrack, Superb Narration. I expected nothing less.Lots of customization for how you want to play the game. Story-arc similar to Bastion, so this story will feel somewhat similar.  Cons:Somewhat repetitive battles, but interesting nonetheless.Often confused as to what really was going on story-wise (not much explanation of what was going on), but this could be intended. Not much closure for the ending, but definitely lots to think about. Really made me think about the whole story after the credits had rolled. Score: 9/10A very nice game overall. The aesthetics of the game are unmatched. However, some people might feel like the game is a bit confusing to wrap your head around. I preferred Bastion's ending to Transistor's, because Bastion was more clear and provided some closure. Transistor left me wondering what really happened and left me with too many unanswered questions. However, it did leave me with a lot to think about, and I want to go through the game again to see if I pick up anything I missed the first time through. If you have any doubts on buying this game, your doubts should be dispelled--this game is worthy of your $20; a beautiful second game released by Supergiant Games.			"

												Transistor is a sci-fi themed RPG action game, developed and published by SuperGiant games (the same guys who brought us Bastion), releasing on PC in mid 2014, and then later in that year on PS4, and then got a further port to IOS in June of 2015. Game play in Transistor takes a lot of elements from Bastion. The camera angle is in an isometric point of view as you control the main character, Red. You traverse a series of locations fighting enemies, known as the ""Process"". A nice feature which has been added which is where Transistor differs from Bastion, is that you can either fight in real time, or in a planning phase. The real time plays very similar to how any isometric action game would play out, however the planning phase really adds an element of strategy to this title; you have a limited number of commands you can carry out before needing to recharge, these commands include moving around the scene and casting your various spells and abilities.As you progress through the story, you will come across other characters who have fallen victim to the Process, and you will take over their souls and learn new abilities and powers. You can either use these new abilities as straight up spells/attacks to use, or you can also enhance your current spells/attacks with the new abilities, granting unique effects, such as adding an area of effect technique on an ability. You can also have up to 2 of these abilities being used as a passive effect on Red, so are in effect all the time. Transistor is a stunningly gorgeous game. The art style on show here are some of the most perfect graphics I have seen. This game should be one of the front runners for people trying to get the media to understand that video games should be classed as a form of art. The story in this game almost had me tearing up at the end, it is one of the most heart wrenching endings to a game I have ever played. Along the way you come across a series of plot twists, and at one point you even think the  story is ending only for it to take a dramatic turn and continue. Words cannot fathom how gut wrenching I felt at the end, I encourage anyone who has already got Transistor, to play it and finish it just to experience the final scenes. Much like Bastion, the audio is one of, if not the best feature of this game. The narration whilst not as good as Bastion's (because that was pretty much perfect), it still sets the mood of the game, and carries the plot through to conclusion extremely well. There isn't much voice acting in the game, actually Red doesn't speak at all, until the end of the game. The sound track to Transistor has been released individually, has sold phenomenally well. Some of the songs actually remind me a lot of a sort of James Bond movie soundtrack. I have to admit, the lack of a tutorial in Transistor does knock it back a little bit, but once you actually are able to work out what all of the interface means, and how to properly carry out the fight scenes, the gameplay becomes second nature and you are able to blast through hoards of enemies without batting an eye lid. The end boss is something of a sufficient challenge as well, resulting in me having to replay it at least four times before I was able to succeed in beating it.  Another nice feature to be seen is, that you can actually implement your own difficulty barriers in game, such as allowing enemies to do more damage to you, BUT you get some sort of reward in return, such as more experience.  You are able to chop and change these ""barriers"" as and when you please in the same way you can with your spells abilities. Transistors levels are all extremely well fleshed out, allowing you every opportunity to venture off the main track and down alleyways and into buildings with no real specific plot line to it, letting you explore the gorgeous world this game is set in. You are also able to use terminal computers scattered around the world, allowing you to dig deeper into the lore, and some times interacting with them to complete surveys and sign petitions should you desire to. A full playthrough of Transistor will take you just under eight hours. This is one of the few games that I can say I have finished more than once, just because of how good it is. There isn't any side missions in the game, but they aren't needed, just because you will be so immersed in the main story that you wouldn't want to do them anyway. Even though the ending of the game is the same regardless of the route you take to get there, the gameplay is such a high quality, that the replay ability is still there, because you will just want to experience the sheer fun you have whilst playing. Sadly I did have a couple of issues getting Transistor to run properly; firstly the game does not support anything higher than 1080 resolutions, whilst this isn't a massive issue given that 1080 is still the standard, it would of still been nice to see it in there. Secondly, I had to delve into the registry of my PC to fix and issue with the game also not loading into full screen mode correctly - if you run into this issue, the fix can be found in this thread on the Steam forums. http://steamcommunity.com/app/237930/discussions/1/540743128801543513/Transistor is another absolutely stellar game by SuperGiant Games that everyone needs to play; some of the game's original ideas, the graphics and soundtrack are some of the best I have ever played in my fifteen years of gaming. Lord knows what else these guys have in the pipeline, it can only be amazing given their track record. For the low price of £14,99, you need to pick this game up. It has been known to go as low as £3 on Steam, which is I would almost class as day light robbery if you can get it for that price. Do not hesitate to pick this game up for the full price.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												First impression: fantastic sound and art direction, just as expected. Seriously, if you decide to buy this (and you probably should), make sure to crank up your volume, put on your best headset and maybe slap some glue on its speakers so you can never take 'em off again. Trust me, you're not gonna want to.So what do we have here? Let me just sum things up:- Logan Cunningham: check. The voice behind Rucks from Bastion is back, do I need to say more?- Story-telling through narration: check. This is done in almost the same manner as before, with one minor difference I won't mention for those who'd rather find out on their own.- Gorgeous, vibrant artwork by Jen Zee[jenzee.deviantart.com]: check, check and check. Jen is one of my favorite artists and she no doubt has outdone herself yet again.- Breathtaking musical score: no comment. If you're still not sold by words alone, check out the soundtrack on YouTube and draw your own conclusions.What's different from Bastion?- Combat mechanics: confusing at first as you'd probably be expecting action-packed hack n' slash, but in the end it boils down to being a curious hybrid of Frozen Synapse's tactical gameplay and some of Bastion's core mechanics, all mashed together into something I find difficult to describe. Personally, it also reminds me of The Bureau's ""Battle Focus"", just minus all the slo-mo. Powers and combos are there: as before in Bastion, you'll probably spend some time looking for a perfect skill combination to cater your own playstyle, which is a fun experience in its own right as there are quite a few options to pick from.-Game length: I finished it in under 7 hours with most of the challenges completed. While it IS a lot shorter than Bastion, you still get access to New Game+ upon completion so you can blast your way through it again. I still find game's length disappointing however, so if you're really concerned about that, I'd strongly advise you to wait for sale.In general, Transistor is still as charming, well-paced and beautiful as its predecessor: you can absolutely tell they're both cut from the same cloth. But, while Bastion was somewhat more experimental in terms of narration, Transistor takes a bold step forward and puts even more information at your disposal than before. Which is probably a good thing. That is, if you like reading. Well, you've come this far, so I'll just assume you do.Issues I ran into so far:- My only and the main gripe with this game: abnormal, seemingly random freezing. I'm not talking ""locking up at checkpoint saves"" kind of freezes, either. I had to ctrl+alt+del at least 6 times due to it completely freezing up on me, ""hl2.exe has stopped working""-style, with looping sound and everything. AFAIK this is a common problem at the moment of writing, so you've been warned.P.S. Hold TAB while you're in game. Don't ask, just do it. :)			"

												Transistor made me cry.Not okay.At all.The game may start slow, but as soon as you hit the first boss... boom- I couldn't stop. This game was so beautiful and entrancing that I played through twice, with 9 limiters my second run: it's the first steam game I've gotten every achievement for. The story is tragic and twists to dark areas I didn't know that the game could even consider twisting. The bosses are all interesting and fun to fight, though the first two become rather simple once you get their strategy down.Buy the game, play it, listen to the soundtrack, find all the news broadcast stations, and experience some major feels.9.5/10			"

												Played it. Cried. Played it again. Cried again. Story: You're Red, a woman who lost her voice. She gets a powerfull weapon after nearly being killed by it. You'll fight to found out who were these people trying to kill you and what this weapon is for. I'd like to tell more but I'm afraid to spoil so I won't :<Music: The ost is just beautiful. Like I can't even describe it. It adds so much..  to the game. There's about 4 songs with Red's voice and I literally love all of them. Graphics: You can judge them by the trailer I suppose, It's very colourful, detailled, pretty, awesome etc. Hnnnghhhhnnh.Gameplay: You basically enter a fight, have the time to think about what skills you're going to use and how, you need some strategy. You have 16 different skills, you can use them on an active/passive or upgrade slot  which means you can do a lot of fun and interesting combos, and have your own playstyle! Overall: I just got a crush on this game AND DAMN THAT END HOLY **** I really didn't expect it, so much feels fiuezgfugzfuiezuifgzugfzigfiz. Just. Play it. <3 "

												45 Minutes in, looks and feels like Bastion. Visuals are stunning, narration is one of a kind.  Great hack and slash, mouse controls are similar to Diablo 3, fighting style is like Fallout series, you can go Vats style or free hand it.  Game so far well worth the price.6 Hours in and it is beaten. All and all well worth the money. I did a full play through. As bastion there is a re play option at the end of the game were you can start over and keep your level and items etc.. I give it 7 / 10 i cant wait for DLC			"

												I am a huge fan of Supergiant Games' previous game, Bastion. Topping that game was a tall order, but I think they've managed to equal, if not better it, with Transistor... though I guess that depends on your personal tastes. First of all, if you have not yet played Bastion, I implore you to do so. If you have played it, and liked it, then I can definitely recommend checking out Transistor. Both games share some common fundamental elements: isometric action gameplay, a set of diverse weapons, amazing music and visuals, and stories moved forward by in-game voiceover. In the case of Bastion, the voiceover was provided by a narrator. In Transistor, the voice is that of the soul of a ""dead"" man within the main character's weapon (the Transistor). The other main difference is in the way combat is handled. While combat in Bastion plays out in real time, in Transistor you can pause the action at will (on a cooldown) and plan out a set of actions (or ""functions"" as they are called in game) that will play out in rapid sequence. So essentially, Transistor is more of a strategy game. The game takes place in a city called Cloudbank. You play as Red, a singer that's lost her voice after an attack by an organization called the Camerata. Red wields the Transistor, an object that can absorb the essence of people, who in turn, become ""functions"" that can be assigned to your combat loadout. The gameplay loop consists of clearing out groups of enemies, collecting new functions for the transistor, and then combining those functions in all sorts of different ways. There are 16 functions, each of which can be used in one of 3 ways: as a primary action, as an upgrade effect for a primary action, or as a passive effect for your overall loadout. With 4 passive slots, 4 action slots, and 8 upgrade slots available to assign your functions, you can imagine how many different possible combinations there are to experiment with. And man, is it ever fun. There's plenty of room for experimentation to find what works best for your play-style. It's a brilliant combat system. The only negative I would say about it is that it's a bit confusing to figure out at first, as the game offers little in the way of explanation. It doesn't take all that long to get your head wrapped around how things work, but the early going might be a bit confusing.Visually, the game is just absolutely stunning. The environments are so gorgeous that I would eat them up if I could. The story is somewhat inscrutable (which I've heard brought up by people as a negative on the game), but there is plenty of information available within the game to flesh things out if you put in the attention and effort required. But ultimately, I never felt any of that really mattered too much. At its heart, the main plot is simply a love story, and that's all that really matters in the end. The other highlight of the game for me was the music. As with Bastion, music has a huge impact on the game experience. The music is consistently outstanding throughout, perfectly setting the mood for each area you traverse. There are also a few vocal tracks spread throughout, which are particularly good, especially the ending song, which was the high point of the game for me. I guess my only disappointment with the game is that there just isn't more of it. The story can be completed in around 6-8 hours I would estimate. After that, the game allows you to ""recurse"" through the story again indefinitely, while keeping all of the upgrades you've acquired, and making the enemy encounters harder each time. This is nice, and worth playing through at least once, but really, there's only so much you can go through the same few areas and watch the same cutscenes, etc, no matter how much you enjoy the gameplay and visuals. But what is there is excellent and worth the asking price. So in summary, if you liked Bastion and the turn-planning combat of Transistor sounds interesting to you, definitely give this a look. Or just give it a look anyways. Games like this just don't come around every day, and need to be experienced. I can't wait to see what Supergiant does next...			"

												Uniting both action RPG mechanics and an engrossing world, Transistor isn’t just a spiritual successor to Bastion, it’s a full blown messianic triumph of beautiful art and sublime game design. Supergiant Games have exceeded their previous work with a game that marries fluent action RPG combat with sublime tactical planning & customisation. Yet that would be just half of Transistor's charm as the world, characters and narrative unfolds like an origami swan, leaving you to marvel at its gorgeous art design, intricate architecture and unique atmosphere.The story begins with you, Red, claiming the Transistor from the body of a dead man. From there you begin to uncover the city of Cloudbank, why everyone has gone and what The Process is - sentient machine aggressors within this fallen Rapture. That reference is deliberate as there’s a little touch of Bioshock within Transistor - a fallen city, the mystery of its unravelling and tragedy yours to discover if you’re willing to put in the work to unlock its true secrets. This is made all the more acute by how Transistor welcomes you into its world with no fanfare, no menu screen. Just a fade from black opening up on your journey with the Transistor, voiced by the rich tones of Logan Cunningham, against The Process and their mysterious overlords - The Camarata.To say any more would spoil the joy of discovering the details for yourself. Supergiant Games had deliberately kept details of Transistor to a minimum until release and it’s thanks to this blackout that’s made discovering the games systems, people and places a genuine joy.It’s difficult to review Transistor without referencing Supergiant Games previous work - Bastion. That’s because its influences are plain to see with the same isometric-style viewpoint, similar art-style and even the same narrator. While those similarities may appear as merely iterative steps on paper for Transistor, they are in practice the opposite. The art style has evolved to be not just gorgeous, moody and atmospheric, it now conveys the spirit of Cloudbank without ever explicitly showing it in such a way that you feel part of that city, not just an observer with a controller.Combat is real time action-RPG based with four main skills available at one time. You can freeze the action once your Turn() bar has filled at any time and then plan out your attacks methodically. Once done you can unfreeze the game and Red will perform her balletic combat attacks with the Transistor. This appears at first to just be a cool looking feature to break up combat scenarios but very soon it becomes essential to besting The Process.In this frozen state you can see the damage you are likely to cause, the effect different attacks can have in combination with each other and use it to quickly get behind enemies to deliver backstab moves. There’s nothing quite like positioning yourself correctly, freezing time and then delivering a quick series of moves to destroy everything. I’m not especially clever but by Jove, Transistor made me feel like a combat genius.As the story progresses you’ll acquire more skills and this is where the combat evolves from those mechanics set down originally by Bastion. Instead of just swapping out skills when you want a change, every skill can be slotted into a secondary or tertiary upgrade slot to augment an already installed ability.For instance, the basic attack move you start with is Crash(). You can then modify it with a skill like Bounce() which will chain attacks to multiple targets. Or with Cull() that sends enemies into the air. Or you could use either of those modifiers as one of the four main abilities. Cull(), a basic uppercut move and Bounce(), a skill that sends out pulses of energy.This enables you to define the combat system in any way you want it. Like aggressive frontal-assault tactics or stealthy concealment? Perhaps turning a few enemies on to your side floats your boat? Or maybe just a blend of different styles? Transistor allows you to do what you like with this combat system rather than force you down a particular road.The only restriction is if your health is reduced to zero in combat. Instead of death, one of your abilities is overloaded and will require at least two trips to an access point in order to recover. Then there are the Limiters - status effects that reduce your capability in combat but with the rewards of increased experience. As you can tell, what appears as a simple combat system in the beginning soon evolves into a complex and involving way to deal with The Process.The way that combat is combined with the narrative is just as intriguing. As you use these new abilities in different ways or combinations it unlocks more about the person you acquired them from in the first place. Slowly the pieces of this mysterious world start to come together as you become more adept at combat. It encourages creativity and a deeper understanding of the mechanics you're working with on order to unlock the secrets of Cloudbank. But It’s not all dark alleyways and moody lighting as you’ll have access to a ‘backdoor’ - a safe haven separated from the unrelenting assimilation of the Process. This serves as a menu to access the different challenge rooms Transistor offers. Here you can test and refine your combat skills and increase your level. Or you can just kick back and listen to the ridiculously awesome soundtrack while lounging in a hammock.This densely packed experience is made up of small touches like that. From the way Red drags around the weighty Transistor, to how she combs her hair with her fingertips when admiring a view, with the best of all being her ability, at the touch of a button, to hum along to the excellent soundtrack.Before playing I didn’t expect to be fully enraptured by Transistor, thinking the spectre of Bastion would haunt the experience too much. But neither did I expect Transistor to take that formula and evolve it into something so sublime and handcrafted that tears would roll down my cheek as the credits rolled. From its combat mechanics and customisation, to the narrative and the visually appealing art-style, this is an experience to be savoured, to lock yourself away in the confines of your gaming boudoir and revel in its luxurious design and perfection.A Must Play "

												I know, negative reviews on overwhelmingly recommended games won't win me any popularity points, but hear me out.It breaks my heart to not recommend this. I had really high hopes due to how amazing Bastion was, and I went into this knowing that it is nothing like Bastion, so my dissapointment doesn't stem from that. Let me start off by saying that the combat customization is pretty neat, the art is nice, and the music is really nice.- The story just isn't that good. Futuristic world is being destroyed by virus-type-invaders and your sword/companion is the key to beating it. The ending is very predictable and there isn't much character development at all. There is such little story that I can't even expand on that without spoilers because of how little story there actually is.- The atmosphere is pretty but has very little variation. I got really tired of seeing the same grey blocks over and over.- The enemies have very little variation. You have turrets that buff/heal, fast dogs, floating objects that shoot beams at you, a mortar, am aoe tank, and guys that spawn suicide bombers. Not much else, the listed enemies all look exactly the same throughout the game; the only difference being small buffs as you progress. There are three bosses, each more forgettable than the last.- The combat is very tedious, and because (as above mentioned) the enemies lack variation, every fight feels the same. There are some great ways to customize your skills and buffs, but everything just feels the same. Since your last shred of action bar can perform skills that would normally take a huge chunk of action bar, every turn you take is just skill stacking just the right way so you can get the big one in at the end for free. It just feels exploity. - The backdoor area (a special zone where you can access challenges): probably my least favorite thing about this game. The trials are all (save for one) time consuming, tedious and pretty pointless. I did all the trials with very little to show for it other than maybe a level and a half and music tracks unlocked, which as far as I can tell, can only be listened to in the backdoor area.. A place that quickly becomes chore zone. Every time I finished trials, I was more than ready to leave.- No replayability. There just isn't. Restarting with all your skills would be nice if the skills weren't so bland. It's just doing the exact same thing over and over again a second time.-The game is incredibly short. I have 7.7 hours logged and I even took my time. I explored thoroughly and didn't move between areas until I knew that I had explored the whole area. I read all the dialogue and accessed/read/listened to/replied to all the terminals and still only got 7.7 hours out of it with no interest in or reason to begin ng+.- One of the things that irritated me the most is this game has an amazing soundtrack.... but it is hardly utilized in the game. When your in combat, you spend most of your time in a pause-type attack planning phase.. during that phase, the music is replaced by the same humming.. so you spend a lot of time listening to that one track that is her humming the same tune over and over. When you're running around/exploring, the sword is talking the whole time (not a bad thing) and you cannot hear the music at all. The game was probably overhyped to me, which is probably why I feel as dissapointed as I do. If you love SuperGiant and love hearing Logan's voice (like me) I'd recommend getting it on sale. Otherwise, you might be dissapointed.			"

												[TL;DR at the bottom] The same quality shown in Bastion returned with an outstanding game called Transistor  Absolutely breathtaking artistry, soulful narration, phenomenal combat system, a brilliantly creative world and a unique story that unravels itself over time. - Just fantastic. And that's not even to mention the musical score that may be one of the best that's ever happened.You will be confused. You will be confused as to what's happening...where you are...who you are...what you are. You will be confused by the mechanics of the combat abilities, and as far as I'm concerned, that's perfect. The story and mechanics become more apparent as you play further into the game. Your understanding and revelation become an experience. Wanting to understand more drives you to keep the experience going.This game isn't just beautiful. It is curious...it inspires curiosity. Once you understand the weapons system it goes from confusing to interesting to absolutely brilliant.The only flaw in this game is that there isn't more of it.An absolutely tremendous accomplishment for a team of only 10 people. Simply wonderful. Graphics = 10/10Story = 8/10Characters = 10/10Game play = 10/10 loads of different style of playMusic = 10/10 Best Soundtrack ever in any game			"

												There is a legitimate argument to be made that Transistor is too short for its price.  I beat it in about 11 hours, although I'm only about halfway through with Achieves.  I think this is a bit of a silly metric, though.  The more key question to me is ""was it a good experience?""  I would say ""absolutely"".Transistor is a deeply beautiful and atmospheric game, with a bittersweet story told through powerful narration and themes.  It also effectively uses game mechanics to pull you 'into' the story and world.  It has a 'hum' button.  There are several scenes where the controls and gameplay shift to make the player 'feel' the scenes.  It is one of the best examples I've played of a game avoiding ludnarrative dissonance and in fact using gameplay as a narrative aid.Transistor left me with that same feeling of satisfaction I get after finishing a good book.  I like that feeling.  I liked Transistor.  Definitely recommended.			"

												Transistor is a brilliant 2D sci-fi action-indie RPG, brought to us by Supergiant games – as most of us know, are the creators of Bastion. While Transistor doesn’t exactly play like Bastion, I’ve still enjoyed my time with it. The hand-drawn visuals are fantastic and oozes style. Darren Korb composed the soundtrack and it's a delightful treat for the ears. The gameplay is fun & unique. The player takes control of Red (the main female protagonist), who has the ability to freeze time and plan out attacks – which is called a ""Turn()"". A well-played ""Turn()"" can be rewarding and its especially satisfying watching your attacks play out In motion.I know we’re all going to make this comparison, but Transistor plays more like an RPG than Bastion. You level up, gain new skills and can customize them to your liking. Fans of Bastion and newcomers who are unfamiliar with Supergiant games will without a doubt have a blast playing Transistor. I highly recommend this game!			"

												For all their hundred-million dollar budgets and hundreds strong development teams, it feels as if indie games have all but entirely eclipsed those of AAA developers. Transistor stands at the precipice of this phenomenon, an unprecedented achievement in artistic vision and game design that I hesitate to review for fear of not doing it justice. Supergiant Games, creators of the outstanding Bastion, have not been resting on their laurels, returning after three years with an experience that has completely toppled any expectations I previously had for it, leaving me stunned and in awe at the scope of their vision and the skill in which they execute it. Transistor is, simply put, a masterpiece.Transistor isn’t the story of a falling city; of the rebel group, Camerata, letting loose a viscous process to annihilate the city of Cloudbank to be rebuilt to their designs. It’s not the story of the many characters filling its voluminous backstory, fleshing out a fascinating futuristic dreamscape that is so similar yet different to our own world. No, it is the story of two people, or more accurately the relationship between a girl and her sword. The dynamic between Red, a singer who has had her voice stolen, and the Transistor, a talking sword now housing the soul of a deadman, is what drives the narrative. Despite Red’s inability to talk, the Transistor’s dialog creates a tangible connection between the two; an emotional tie that makes the continued suffering of Red, and the guilt expressed by the Transistor (who somehow feels responsible for what happened to Red), incredibly real and heartbreaking.It would be too easy to write Transistor off as using its many narrative tricks to hide the fact that its plot is fairly straightforward, because it’s not about what happens throughout the story, but the relationship between its two leads that makes it so compelling. All too often games will try to force characters to depend on each other, whether through arbitrary mechanics or cliched victim roles, but Transistor sidesteps this issue by having the two characters literally rely on each other to survive. They need each other, and its for this that the narrative manages to create such an effective emotional connection with these characters; similarly causing you to despise those that have put them through so much distress. As simple as it may sound, the nuance of every line and its delivery is no small feat, and a true testament to the writers and voice actors behind them.I could go on at end for how emotionally invested I became in the characters of Transistor, but it’s the finesse of its gameplay that truly astounded me. Aside from some mild exploration, the experience is entirely focused around its incredibly deep and rewarding combat system, which seems outwardly inaccessible but is shockingly intuitive once you get your hands on it.Combat can be broken down most easily into two phases: real time and the planning stage. During the former, you can use any of your abilities at will, but enemies in turn can also move and attack, which becomes an issue with the long build up required for most attacks. This is when you transition to the second phase, which then turns the game into a sort of strategy RPG, freezing time and allowing you to plan out your moves (which will then be executed near instantly when you leave the phase) with the only restraint being the action bar which is used up with each move you make. It's not an entirely unique formula, but Supergiant Games has carved out an incredibly fine tuned and complex niche for itself, with the sheer number of different ways you can approach an encounter.Every action you make is the result of a function you have slotted in, which in turn can then have additional functions slotted on top of themselves, as well as passive functions which give you boosts outside of individual moves. However, none of these are separated into classes or otherwise excluded from being assigned a specific role with the rest of your abilities. This creates an incredible amount of options for you to experiment with, with each function you unlock having three unique abilities onto itself (if not more when combined with other functions), and new functions being added regularly as you progress and level up. Supergiant has also found a brilliant incentive to getting players to try out new combinations they might otherwise never use, by tying every bit of backstory to a specific function, which then needs to be used in all three slots (technique, enhancement, and passive) in order to unlock all of a character's biography. It’s a fantastic way to almost entirely fix a common problem of getting stuck in a routine of the using the same abilities the entire game, and had me constantly swapping different functions in which kept the combat fresh the entire game (even after having beaten it I haven’t used every combination there is, creating a ton of replay value on top of the already included new game plus mode).Bastion was an undeniable artistic treat, but in comparison to Transistor it might as well be a rough prototype of a game. The art design of every single frame is unbelievably gorgeous, from amazing architecture and environmental designs, to characters and even the subtle yet beautiful sparks that spring forth from Red dragging the Transistor around. The dark color palette matches the somber mood of the narrative, but it does so without bringing you down with it, leaving enough brightness and pure beauty despite the events happening around you to make you feel like you’re on a vacation to a fantastical city in the sky. Darren Korb once again returns to deliver a soundtrack that surpasses what I even thought he was capable, with a layered and elaborate score that still feels as raw and personal as he's known for.Transistor left me floored. What Supergiant Games has accomplished is hard to properly put into words, as even with all I’ve said I can’t help but think I’ve barely scratched the surface of the praise I wish to heap upon the game. It’s vision is remarkable, stunningly consistent and inspired in every aspect, achieving a level of excellence that exceeded my already high expectations. It’s undoubtedly one of the best games I’ve played this, or possibly any year, and is an experience that cannot be overstated or should in any way be passed up. Brilliant; utterly and unbelievably brilliant!You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												Transistor is one of those rare, beautiful indie gem of an ARPG that every gamer should have played, even at least once. The game is developed by the people behind Bastion, but the 2 games have very few similarities, it's hard to compare them. Every aspect of Transistor is flawless, for now, no cons come to my mind. But I will try to review what I can.Pros: Stunning sci-fi cyberpunk art style and setting Amazing voice acting Wonderful, atmospheric soundtrack, one of the best I've heard in an indie game (purchasing the OST is very much worth it) Interesting and creative character designs (I can't go into detail here, might spoil it) All the things I have mentioned above go together so well to create the rich, detailed world of Cloudbank Innovative combat: you can switch from hack-n'-slash mode to a strategic, turn-based one, and you should still plan your moves very well Game has a way of letting you figure out the story and lore on your own: if you skip any OVCs, you'll barely have an idea of what's going on, and you'll lessen the great experience (Trying to avoid spoilers as much as I can here) The story is memorable, and leaves you at some moments in suspense, and other moments just thinking about what just happened - it is unique and far from those 'good vs evil' cliché RPG plots Lots of ways to customize your character build as well: you can combine up to 3 moves or 'Functions' and test how they work, you can add 'Limiters' that increase the challenge lvl but yield more rewards, etc Game is also strategic in a way that you should plan your battles wellCons: Game is linear and does not have too much room for exploration The story can be too short, and even vague for some peopleOverall Rating:9/10 - Transistor is more of an experience to me, than a game.

 Tron meets Kill Bill What do I have to say about  Transistor?  First of all,  wow.  I wasn't sure it was possible for Supergiant to top  Bastion,  but as it turns out, they could. What does Transistor actully have to offer? First of all, one of the most unique and challenging gaming experiences I have ever had. The combat system revolves around what the game calls a Turn() sequence--and yes, the partentheses are part of the word. Turn() allows you to freeze time and plan out your every move, but your enemies, a horde of machine-like entities known collectively as the Process, have ways of confounding you. A great deal of critical thinking goes into making your Turn() as effective as possible, especially considering that you get a fixed number of moves depending on the Functions (think spells, but with a cyberpunk twist) you employ.Next are the sensory experiences. Darren, Ashley, and Logan outdid themselves yet again.  Transistor  has a larger--and just as well-performed--voice cast than  Bastion,  the sound design is flawless, and if you loved the  Bastion  OST, you'll love the music in  Transistor  as well. The voice actors especially have my approval, particularly Logan Cunningham, the voice of the Transistor, who you may or may not know as Rucks (Bastion), Horatio Nullbuilt (Primordia) and the Archjustice (Pyre, the next Supergiant game). What about visuals? I've heard of eye candy, but  Transistor  is eye  crack.  Supergiant continues to appeal to my surreal sensibilities. Every environment is unique and beautiful, make sure to have a look around before moving on from each area.Finally, there is the story. Don't go in expecting a repeat of  Bastion.  Where  Bastion  was about repentance, redemption, and rebuilding,  Transistor  is more about loss, futility, and good intentions gone wrong. You play as Red, a former singer, who loses her voice as well as her lover after an attempt made on her life by the shadowy Camerata society. Lucky for Red, her unnamed lover sacrifced himself to save her life, but as a result his consciousness gets uploaded and trapped inside the Transistor. Wielding her sentient cybernetic greatsword, she sets out to track down the people who tried to kill her, and while she does that, she must find a way to stop the now-mindless Process from reducing the city of Cloudbank to its basest, most desolate form.I really enjoyed playing  Transistor.  While at times it made me exceptionally frustrated  heads up, you can lose your Functions if you run out of health, and the bosses and Process get steadily more difficult ,  the story, visuals, and sheer challenge it offered kept me hooked for hours at a time. I look forward to the many times I will play back through it. Worth every penny I payed for it.The only turn-off I see is that the story is very vague and complicated, even more so than  Bastion . You may have to watch a couple of videos or read a guide before you get it. As soon as you do, though, I believe you will better appreciate it within the context of your knowledge. Personally, I love when a story (be it game, book, or movie) doesn't explain everything to you. When you think about it more, you get drawn into the world, and your intimacy with the story grows.Like my review? Check out my  Curator  page!			"

												First of all: thank you SuperGiant Games, the game is another masterpiece.You play as Red, a popular singer in the Couldbank city, but for some reason one group called Camerata are hunting some influential people, and they try to get you. After that, it is up to you to find out what is going on and why they are doing it.The gameplay is great and it has a interesting and innovator turn-based combat system. In the combat you can try combine different weapons to test the best combination that works for you, but the game has a nice way to present some new combinations and help you to test every weapon available.The art, game design and the music is awesome. It will mesmerize you in every single moment of the game. I don't have word to describe, it is just beautiful.I'm in love with this game and I truly recommend it: great story, beautiful art design, incredible music and nice combat system.			"

												Transistor is a sci-fi action rpg from Indie studio Supergiant Games (The makers of Bastion).You play as Red, a famous singer from the city of Cloudbank. An incident occurs that leads you down a path of no return. In the process, you receive the mysterious weapon known as the Transistor and the powers that come along with it.Gameplay consists of real time combat mixed with an optional turn-based system. At anytime during normal combat, you can pause the game to plan and queue up attacks. This proves immensely helpful when you face large numbers of enemies at once.As you progress through the game, the Transistor gains new powers. These can be used in either active (attack), support (supplement attack), or passive modes. The level to which you can customise powers to complement your playstyle is one of the highlights of the game.The visuals of the game are another strong point. The artstyle is stunning. Great use of colours and imaginative design bring out the vibrancy and beauty of Cloudbank. This is a city you'd want to save.Voice acting and music is stellar. The soundtrack is atmospheric and easy on the ears, while the voice acting is filled with character.The plot can be ambiguous but if you pay attention it makes sense by the end of the game.The only downside is that a single playthrough lasts 6 hours or so. Some may find the $20 sgd pricepoint too high for that length, although there is a new game plus option that provides some replayability.tldr: A polished, unique Indie action rpg albeit a little short. Highly Recommended			"

												Like its predecessor Bastion, Transistor is a truly marvelous and outstanding title that everyone must play to completion. Transistor boasts a lively, beautiful, hand-painted world filled to the brim with thick atmosphere that harmonizes perfectly with Darren Korb's spectacular soundtrack and Logan Cunningham's once again superb voice acting. All this combines with a deep, sweet, and brilliant story, unique and entertaining gameplay, and overall excellence, rendering Supergiant's newest title a true masterpiece. 10/10			"

												So you've read the reviews praising Transistor for its amazing scenery, the detailed hand-drawn sprites, the phenomenal soundtrack and maybe even read a thing or two about the gameplay which included words such as ""time stop turn-based abilities"" or ""active and passive weapon functions"" and you're left wondering... Is it accessible? Beauty being in the eye of the beholder and all, can the layperson appreciate the final product?Answer: maybe not, but don't let that stop you from trying. New experiences build character and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is Transistor a new experience. It's just that Transistor is a game where the protagonist gains experience faster than the player behind the screen. Consider the following: you earn ""functions"" which can be used either in your weapon slot or as a passive buff to a function already in use, adding its properties to the active weapon. That's the active and the passive system! THAT'S HUGE! Do you realize how with four weapon slots (your four face buttons) and five functions, you already have twenty different configurations? Well hold on to your hats because there's a whole lot more than just five functions to play with. Try sixteen. Add to this secondary passive slots for player buffs, extra upgrade slots for weapons and a memory cost per function to manage and that's a lot to take in!There's more. The whole time-skip ability pauses the game and allows you to plan out multiple actions in advance, at the cost of a cooloff period wherein no function can be activated. It's something that can certainly bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥if abused, so you want to hold on to it like a panic button. Or spam it constantly what with the correct build and enemies. Really, you don't know and the game doesn't provide you with much opportunities for experimentation. Enemy encounters are fixed and unique in nature; and although the game provides you with a Practice Mode, it's more target practice than battle practice.Transistor's greatest flaw resides in its extraordinarily linear story mode. There are no collectables or side quests, so if the story mode has a reputation for being short, that's only because there aren't any branching paths anywhere. There's nothing to look out for, all unlockables are gained by leveling up and earning XP is done exclusively by defeating enemies. Whom do not respawn and appear at fixed intervals. So your whole adventure feels like riding a conveyor belt: move to enemy encounter, defeat enemies, save at conveniently nearby terminal, repeat with the occasional story break.Although we commonly hate repetition, human beings learn by doing the same thing over and over again. Adding THE OPTION to redo a segment would be welcome and giving players a minor incentive to do so would go a long way in getting them acclimated to the active/passive system. There's no lack of technical info as the configuration screen offers you all of the hard numbers for your functions, but you want practice in addition to theory. Bastion provided ""dreams"" which were just waves after waves of monsters to defeat for extra shards. Practice Mode offers no such incentives and the targets don't fight back. For all of their efforts at writing a story, it seems as if the developers have forgotten to build a playground.Thus I'll make my final verdict as simple as possible: buy Bastion first. That's a good game regardless of your sense of aesthetics (review available here). If you've enjoyed Bastion's stylistic direction, consider Transistor. Despite the change in setting, you'll recognize much of the artistic sensitivities that are the hallmark of Supergiant Games. Otherwise, you probably won't have the patience to appreciate Transistor. Regardless, you have to recognize the ambitiousness of what's ultimately a very simple concept at heart: make every weapon also act as a power-up. You can't fault that, and you want other game developers to crib the idea. So buy the game and encourage simple ideas that are complex in execution. We'll get more practice out from the other games.			"

												To describe Transistor in just a few words simply doesn't do it justice.When I first received Transistor as a gift, I was extremely picky with games. At the time, I thought I could never be immersed in a world that was isometric, and I'd never enjoy combat that was turned-based. I could never have been more wrong.The first thing you'll notice is how gorgeous the visuals are and how immersive the voiceover is. Not long after, you should also be able to hear the magnificent soundtrack which blends beautifully into the game. The controls are very easy to learn and the combat system is wonderfully executed. The combat system is very tactical while still managing to be very action-based so you're not left feeling bored. I also find it hard to become bored with the combat system because of how many Function combinations there are and with all the Limiters available. You'll find yourself pensive as you begin to uncover Transistor's memorable story, although it might leave you wanting to know more about the characters and their Functions, more specifically Breach() a.k.a. Subject Not Found.Overall, Transistor is a game I will always remember and cherish as I've found few other games to be comparable. I genuinely recommend this game to anyone looking for a bittersweet masterpiece. Thank you Supergiant Games, and I can't wait to try your next project, Pyre.Pyre @ PAX East 2016 Recap[www.supergiantgames.com]Pyre - Reveal Trailer "

 Short version: I had a lot of fun playing Transistor. It's one of those few games that manages to be respectable from both a technical and artistic perspective. While the presentation is stunning, one of Transistor's greatest gameplay strengths is that it greatly encourages taking your time and setting up fights. Customization of, and interaction between, abilities and attacks is a key feature here. The variety of ways to start and end an encounter is pretty amazing and there's always a new method to try. While not particularly new to the genre on their own, a lot of obvious features combine to make Transistor feel like a unique experince. My only real complaint is a few jarring difficulty spikes and drops.Overall, a great game that I loved start to finish. Not without a couple flaws of course, but I would say it accomplishes everything it sets out to do and sets a very strong example for the genre of strategy ARPGs. Less-short version: Transistor is a story-driven isometric ARPG from the makers of Bastion, which it has a fair share in common with. In my opinion, It's definetly a solid title. First of all, It throws you right into the action when you start it up. There's no real opening cutscene or exposition to speak of, which I loved. Instead, you learn about the weird, artsy world of Transistor as you play. An important thing to note is that this game requires the player's attention to be really good. Everything in Transistor wants you to think. If you try to blow through it or brush it off, you probably won't end up enjoying it.The combat system is the real selling point to me. It's fun and rewarding to fight, which is what an ARPG should be all about. It achieves this by including a freeze-time, turn based mechanic where you can take a breath and queue up attacks in the middle of a fight. Between that and the sheer variety of different moves, there's a lot of creative ways to kill something. The catch is that you can only equip four different functions (combat/movement abilities) at a time outside of a couple passive slots unlocked later. Because 'dying' disables one of the functions equiped, you have to prioritize certain functions over others. On top of all that, functions can be apllied to other functions to alter the way the original attack works. Add a dash move to your projectile to make it pierce enemies, add an explosive to your melee to make it AOE, etc. This rather complex system is not only great fun to mess around with, but works wonderfully in practice and makes Transistor a seemless ARPG/strategy game hybrid.To underline the functions and insentivise you to use them more, much of the game's lore is only acessible by completing levels with certain attacks or passives. You need to use every function in every slot to reveal the full story. This idea didn't always work for me. More often than not, the little flavor text given isn't worth scrambling your carefully crafted setup. Still, it was a nice break from the ""read a couple pages from a computer entry"" style of storytelling that most games use. Transistor doesn't have much voice acting, but what's there is certainly passable, if a little bit annoying toward the end of the game. The big problem I had with Transistor was the difficulty. While most of the levels were challenging but fair, the bosses were all over the place. Some were a cake walk; others were too frustrating. One in particular actually had me checking the Steam guides for optimal loadouts and stats. The out of place spikes in difficulty were jarring and removed me from the experience at some points. With all that said, I still give this issue a pass simply because I may have just not experimented enough or was using bad loadouts.One thing I really loved were the challenges/minigames you can play in the hub...beach? They're all fun and engaging. Sometimes I felt like I played them more than the main game! Although that wouldn't really suprise me, considering Transistor is unfortunately on the short side. The length isn't too bad, but definetly dissapointing. Another thing I didn't like was one of the plot twists near the end of the second act of the story. I won't spoil it, but it was kind of a let down for me. You'll know it when you see it. The ending itself was fine, though just a little cliche.The story may a bit hard to follow, and the difficulty might be a little wonky, but you can't review Transistor without mentioning the art and music. This game is nothing short of gorgeous. So much effort was put into making everything, from the backgrounds to the enemies and even the UI, look good. The music is my favorite part though. Once again, you can feel how much heart and soul was put into the music. Ashley Barrett nailed the atmosphere with her occasional vocals. If you want to see for yourself, the soundtrack is on Spotify. I highly reccomend giving it a listen if you're looking for something good.All in all, I would recommend the game to anyone interested.			"

												A heart-wrenching tragedy wrought with loss and sorrow, a bittersweet love story the likes of which are never seen in video games, an unbelievable experience that's as breathtaking as it is unforgettable——these are just a few of the things that Transistor has been for me. And don't think that I lavish the game with verbose and flattering descriptions idly either, this game swept me from my feet the moment I loaded it up and delved into the imaginative world it offered. Rarely have I been so immersed in a game and never before, not even in Supergiant Games' previous game Bastion, have I felt so emotionally involved in a game's story——it was refreshing to experience a game where I felt a surge of raw emotions... from frustration, to despair, to grief. And to add icing to the cake, this game's audio and visual presentation blows every other indie game out of the water... each time I step away from the game and come back to it, I'm still shocked to realize just how beautiful a game it truly is.Red, the character whose role you assume, finds herself in a strange and unsettling predicament after being attacked by a mysterious organization known as the Camerata. With the help of her companion, the Transistor (a.k.a. Breach()), she must seek answers from this mysterious group and fight the newly arrived threat of the Process. The Process comes in many forms, and Red with the Transistor in hand, must face off against them. The combat in this game is a hybrid between fast paced action and tactics. Red can be equipped with up to four active Functions and four passive Functions (essentially abilities). Each Function can also act as an upgrade for Function already equipped as an active ability. This allows for quite a lot of customization. Furthermore, there are Limiters, which act as a way of increasing the challenge within the game. Enable a handful of limiters and you'll easily find yourself tuning and customizing your Functions to overcome some of the harder encounters and challenges. There is definitely challenge to be had in this game if you seek it, and exploring all the customization options is one of the highlights of the game's combat system——some of the Function combos are ingenious and finding such a badass combo is always a joy.And while the game's combat system is superb, I'd probably rate it as the weakest feature simply because every other aspect of the game is so near perfection. The audio and visuals of the game are no exception. Anyone who has played Bastion should know from experience alone to expect something amazing when it comes to how a Supergiant Games' game should look and sound, and despite such high expectations they wouldn't be disappointed with Transistor. The game is just mesmerizingly stunning, to the point that it's hard to describe in words just how remarkable it is. It has to be played to be appreciated at the level it deserves. From gorgeous hand drawn scenery, to the hauntingly beautiful lighting, to art filled cutscenes... this game is beautiful. Audio is no exception either with solid voice acting (the voice of Rucks from Bastion voices the Transistor), perhaps the best original soundtrack in the entire industry which I could write an entire second review on alone, and don't forget Red's incredible humming prowess.Although the game presents perhaps the most extraordinary sensory experience in the indie scene, to me the true selling point of this game is the story and the way it is presented. There is a lot going on in this game and it's worth getting involved in. Read what's happening at the terminals, read the bios, listen to the audio logs——it pays off. But most importantly, listen to what Transistor says. Stop and listen. Pay attention. And when Red responds to Transistor via typing, just don't quickly read what she says but feel what she says. Following the connection between the two is what sucked me into the story and got me involved with it in a much more personal way. There is a lot of character depth for both Red and Transistor, and an equal depth in regards to the relationship between the two. Putting myself in the shoes (or heels, I suppose) of Red was a surreal experience, and feeling the pain, frustration, longing, and love through her perspective is what made this game something special.The developers put love and care into making this game. The story is strong, no doubt. But I think what makes it stand out is that the developers built this game bottoms up starting with the story. Scene by scene crafting the perfect medium to tell this story, at every point making critical decisions about what music to be playing, what visuals to show, what Transistor's monologue should be; at every cutscene and at every interlude, deciding how best to portray the story through artwork and song. And by my reckoning it worked, they took a story and found the best way——the perfect medium——to tell it, and the product is Transistor. I've seen people refer to video games as a form of art before, but Transistor joins a miniscule list of games that I have played and feel as if I can share such a sentiment having played it.			"

												One more nice game and story from Bastion creators. It provides you a dynamic gameplay, lovely music and a spellbinding plot. The only issue I found is replayability - after all I don't feel like pass it again. The game is short, it took 10 hours only to get the end, but, imho, it's better to play a good short game then a bad long one =) I can clearly recommend it to grab on sale and enjoy!			"

												Another banger by Supergiant Games. Let me start by saying that Transistor's music is absoultely fantastic. It's composed by Darren Korb (also did the soundtrack for Bastion) it has a futuristic feel to it with a little bit of Noir in there. It's also neatly integrated into the game and its story. The protagonist is a singer for crying out loud. Her name's Red, she's a singer, and her friend is now a talking sword. That's all you get at the begining of the game. Transistor's story is open ended, surprisingly heartfelt and imaginative. There are no clear-cut solutions or ideologies, the characters have their (sometimes questionable) motives, and it's hard to say what's what at times. The game is also very subtle about its themes. Very much like Bastion, you can speculate and fill in the gaps with your friends. Fun stuff. Much like the story, the gameplay is brilliantly crafted and also very much open ended. Every bit of it is customisable, and the game makes you feel like you're in control of its systems. To simplify it- it's a real time action RPG. By pressing the right trigger you change it to a turn based structure, but it's more of a special power. The ""turn"" lasts only a short while but you can trample over the enemies without consequences as they are frozen in time, and you have a bunch of tools that can do the trampling. Red has a large selection of abilities to chose from, each ability has three functions- active, powerup and passive. You can attach unused abilities as powerups for the ones that are active, or you can use them as passive powerups for your statistics. Some abilities deal damage, some persuade, some create distance between you and the enemy, which you will need, as the enemies are tricky to handle (when they're not frozen in time that is). You will have to mix and match, see what works best, and then change it again. The game encourages experimentation- change your character's presets as many times as you want, it's easy and free of charge. The game's too forgiving? Obliterating enemies left and right? You can make the enemies harder and gain more experience. It's all customisable. Supergiant Games definitely built upon the already well made systems seen in Bastion and greatly improved them.Heck, the whole thing's really well made. And, well, gosh darnit. Ain't this the prettiest darn game I have ever laid my blue eyes upon. This game's graphics are something special, tell you hwat. Inspired by Art Deco, its futuristic vistas are just... Just beautiful. A little bit confuisng to get through at times perhaps, but with these looks, hey, who's complaining.The only criticism I have is that its story is too short. Now don't get me wrong, the story is really well made and doesn't drag, but you can finish it in 5-6 hours. Now, that's great, I like a well made story, if it has to be around 6 hours to present itself the right way, the way the author intended, great. but you WILL want to play more of it after you've seen the ending, and it is a shame that you will have to start up New Game+ to do so. The good news is that the New Game+ mode is really well made and has some additional stuff in it. Everything transfers and the difficulty ramps up. Heck, they even change up the enemy spawns, so it's definitely worth a second playthrough. Plus- there's no way you're going to reach the level cap during your first run through Thransistor, so there's a bunch of new stuff you'll get to play with.Well, that's a minor gripe, this is A+ material for sure. It's obvious that these guys know what they're doing, and every part of this game has been meticulously crafted with much passion and hard work. Whatcha gonna do next Kasavin? Cause whatever it is, I'm listening.			"

												Transistor - a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals and electrical power.Indeed, this game centers around a device called the Transistor which amplifies the signals (intent) and power (emotion) of its user, the main protagonist in the story, Red.This sophomore title by Supergiant Games delivers not only a definitive OST, graphics, and mechanics, but storyline as well.If you played Bastion this is almost a required play, as the Transistor universe brings into question the very essence of existence and the universe, almost hinting at the possible creation of the Bastion universe itself if you read deeply enough between the lines.I recommend this game. 100%What I didn't like:For myself, I found certain Function() combinations almost necessary *especially* when more and more Limiter()s are enabled. I found this brought down the strategic planning involved with battles and increased the spamminess. Though I concede this may be due to my own play style in the first place.And I wish it was longer. This is such a detailed, charming, delightful world that I wish my stay was longer than it was.			"

												Yesterday, I finished Bastion, today, I felt like I need more from them so I played Transistor. It took me 5 hours to complete the story without doing anything else but the story, I also didint use and game-hardening effects that you can add while you play. I just wanted to see how it goes. So far, amazing. PROS:- Game is an eye-candy. Drawings, characters, enemies, everything is so beautiful I actually felt like using my old oil paints to paint something from this game and hang in my room. I'll just buy probably.- OST's. As I mentioned in Bastion, they're not just doing a great job but I'm actually going to put all of these songs in my phone, they're worth it.- Gameplay. I like isometric, but this is something else. I thought I'd be bothered with the turn-based playing but actually, It was on point and fun. Little calculations make it very easy.- Skill design = FOR THE MOTHER OF INDIES, I loved it. The design is so catchy, and the combination system means, you can play the game however you want! You can create 1-hit K.O. AOE's or if you like playing dodgy, you can create more agile stunner gameplay too. Its all yours.- Story. I cried. Seriously.CONS:- Level gaining. Level gaining itself isn't the bad part, the bad part is, I had to wait and watch how the character gained level after every single encounter, and I don't really like waiting for something so repetitive. It literally pauses the game, pops a little window, shows how many percentage of your character gained level, and then pops of. Still, It didin't ruined the game, It's something minor, and doesn't really bother you at some point because you're just so in the game.TL;DR: If you like Bastion, buy it. Being isometric, or different gameplay won't bother you in any way, this game's a little masterpiece.			"

												TL;DR Version: 10/10 srsly this game is freakin' stellarI can't recommend this game enough. It's seriously one of the most stunning games I've ever played. When I rank games in my head, listing them with all their faults in mind, all I can say is that Transistor is the ONLY game that I've played that has no faults.Where do I start? Gameplay. Transistor does a fantastic job at letting you customize your moves. The pacing is fantastic- it does a very good job at easing the mechanics for you early on. For example, you start with a quick jab, and a long charging shot. Eventually you get an attack that is like a weak AoE. Pretty simple stuff, yeah? But then it tells you you can apply similar properties of powers to another, like combining them. Now your long-charge shot can split into multiples. And THEN you can apply powers to yourself, and not your other powers, to change up gameplay. The flexibility in powers allows for such a massively open-ended way to play. It's a simple 3-choice system that really allows the player to pick how they choose to play.The story is pretty interesting. It's nothing fantastic enough to win awards, but the way that they present you the story makes it interesting. Cloudbank is a mysterious place, and their little terminals and hints in dialogue makes you keep guessing what it really is. The characters, though, are rather lackluster save for Red and the Transistor. There are only 3 voices in the game, and one of them is simple grunts and humming. The Transistor character, voiced by the same fantastic narrator from Bastion, is the main spotlight for his character. The other characters, the Camerata, aren't so fleshed out.The art and sound styles are fantastic. This shouldn't really be a point to deter anyone, as these are just aesthetics. But when something is so stellar and outstandish in a game, I need to point it out. This game has STYLE. It's a beautiful, artsy, cyberpunk experience that's complete with everything that you need to keep you immersed.There's really only one problem with this game. I want more. It's so good, but it's a straight-forward story game that won't take you longer than 10 hours. I want more of Cloudbank. I want more of the Transistor combat. I want more, more, more! The ending made me satisfied, but I was sad that it was over.Do yourself a favor. Buy this game. It's very, very good.			"

												The Bad:You have to play it twice.The Good:It gets even better the second time around.Let me say this, about 75% of the way through my first playthrough, I wasn't even sure if I really liked the game yet. There are some game breaking power combinations you can create that make it impossible to lose. The game is beautiful, the combat is interesting and what eventually really won me over, was the story. Towards the end of the game, you finally start understanding the story. It's not even that it is told to you, no, what happens is you get more and more of it via text in your powers, text in the limiters, just from everywhere. I didn't fully understand the impact of those until later.Once you are done with your first run, you kind of question some things, so what do you do, you play again. Suddenly the story becomes clear. You understand what happened. You understand how. You understand everything in a way that simply wasn't possible the first time around.It's like watching Fight Club the second time. You see it in a new light that you couldn't have before.Simply beautiful, well done. I have to applaud them for making another great game after Bastion. I didn't think it possible. I am so glad I picked this up on a whim. Literally because it was cheap at the time.			"

												It made me fall for for a faceless guy (more like a sword duh!) with super hot voice andit made me cry.The battle system is unique, battles aren't that hard, great soundtrack, amazing storyline, love the characters.""Sky looks blue cause we want it to"" - Farrah Yon-DaleBut too bad I can't compare it with Bastion since I haven't play it.Some said, the ending makes no sense, well I dont know which part but to me it is completely statisfying.There is no real bad guy, it just a matter of perspective and I really, really like that. But, what I like the most is the romance.I didn't bought this for the romance, I didn't even know! But it turned out to be simply amazing and beautiful. Without lot of words I can feel the connection/bond between Red and The Transistor,Players don't need a complete conversation to know they love each other, and I know it's not easy to do that.Especially, during the gameplay. Players don't know their history (yet) or what kind of relationship they had and Redonly stays silent, but, you can feel it that there is something between them like longing.When the game ends, I didn't expect it to be like that, I was surprised and it hit me with tears, the beautiful soundtrack makes it even worse.Definitely 10/10			"

												Wow. I just completed Transistor and honestly, it was one of the best games I've played this entire year. I was completely blown away by the soundtrack and the overall art style. - I felt that the gameplay was very unique by mixing two different types of combat styles into one. - Art style and atmosphere was really beautiful and unique. Throughout my 4 hours playthrough, never once did I feel that the map was bland. - Soundtrack. Just speechless. Darren Korb blew me away with the soundtrack in Bastion, and did it once again with Transistor.- The story was decent. It was simple enough and did not drag itself out for too long. - Took me 3.9 hours to complete the game. However, I did not do any challenges which would have extended the game by an hour or more. - The game's combat was not too easy and not too difficult. It never once made me feel like the game's combat was too easy to the point where it was basically cheating nor did it made me feel like the game's combat was too unfair and unforgiving. I felt that 3.9 hours was the sweet spot for me with this game. The soundtrack and atmosphere alone made the amount I paid for ($13.99) worthwhile. Supergiant Games outdid themselves this time again.			"

												Basically, this is Bastion with a ""software"" theme. The art and music are outstanding, though very similar to Bastion, as is the attention to detail.There are loads and loads of programming references, which I found absolutely delightful, being a software engineer.You don't have to be a software engineer to enjoy the game, though. Like Bastion, the game is perfectly accessible to anyone. It's been described as an RPG-lite, but there's plenty of gameplay complexity. The combat is a mix between ARPG and TBS.There are even a few ""puzzles"" (game calls them ""tests"") thrown in, where you are challenged to win a fight by utilizing your abilities in specific ways. These tests are a way of educating you on the combat mechanics.There's plenty of strategy involved, including the ability to make combat more difficult in exchange for a small exp bonus. I played at effectively the highest difficult setting and enjoyed the challenge. I'm probably going to continue through the second playthrough for additional challenge.The first playthrough is fairly short, but never feels tedious, either. The second playthrough can be taken to extend play time by quite a bit. I like the game length. Some might complain about the price point, but I think it's fair for a quality indie title like this.There are stability issues at the moment, but they are rapidly being patched, so I expect those to mostly be resolved soon. I mainly encountered problems with the optional ""tests"" deadlocking (?) and requiring manual process termination. Glancing at the forums, this seems to be related to the online features, which are understandably more difficult to test prior to release, so it's not exactly fair to ask ""don't these people test their game?""Also, there's not much character development and no real character interaction (though there's plenty of good voiceover). Some might miss that, but it didn't bother me. The focus is on atmosphere. I liked the way the game slowly revealed the backstory and made you work for some of it - revealing character biographies if you used your abilities in different ways.I liked the story, though I may be biased given the theme :)In conclusion, I highly recommend this.Disclaimer: I only played 30 minutes into Bastion so far, so I'm not very qualified to compare the two titles. (Yeah, I know, I'll get around to finishing it eventually)			"

												Big fan of Bastion and the same developers made Transistor, so I gave it a try...sadly, a bit disappointed.So, is Transistor a bad game?  No.  However, it's a somewhat flawed game, at least from a gameplay standpoint.  First, the good.  The story is...largely unimportant/boring, but the characters and the world built in are amazing.  You feel very much drawn in with our silent heroine, Red, and her chatty admirer trapped in a cybernetic sword.  It creates a narrative experience where you are there more for how the characters and world interact than the story.Graphically, the game is quite distinctive.  Think Bastion meets Cyberpunk 2020 or Shadowrun.  It's very much a detective noir cyber punk world and feels dark, gothic, but also futuristic and techno.  The effects onscreen can be quite a sight to behold as well and the art style itself is quite beautiful, using 2-d hand drawn in conjunction with the sprites and 3-d action in combat.Sound design is where the game shines.  An amazing voice cast, beautiful music which fits the mood perfectly, and relatively satisfying combat sounds make it a joy to listen to.  The tracks are good, but the vocal pieces in the beginning and end of the game are probably the best part of it.One thing I will say about Transistor that I love and wish more games would do is it feels organic.  You have, for example, several areas that are completely unnecessary, not story related, and which you can skip, but not skipping them builds the world and the characters, feeling like we get to know them through their actions and choices.  Like ordering a pizza after trying to be murdered.  I'm dead serious and it actually ends up being a nice quiet moment between heroine and sword.  Also, Red can hum or flourish the sword, if for no other reason than because that's what the character would do, even if the gamer chooses not to.  Feels very much alive.  The world itself is very distinctive, even if it draws heavily from noir and cyberpunk.Now, the bad.  Like Bastion, it seems to go for an action RPG route where you can choose your moves in real time, with the option of a system freeze time, string together combos, and plan your battle more strategically.  This is where the game starts to suffer.  You cannot play one or the other.  Largely, the game requires you to use this ""turn"" system and when you use it, you are left vulnerable for up 5 seconds while a bar recharges.  You cannot attack and are slower than all the enemies and their projectiles, so the game is VERY frustrating at times in this regard.  Also, your health drains at an insane rate, even on the easy setting, and when it drains to zero, you lose one of the four moves you can map to the face buttons until you die.  At times, this will happen multiple amounts in battle and it takes several battles to recharge, as you can only recharge the lost abilities at specific points.  So, you may not die, but the game is very unbalanced in terms of what you can do and how much damage you take compared to the enemies.  It has an option to increase difficulty in exchange for more experience, like in Bastion, but honestly, the game feels not hard, but frustrating enough without it.There is also an area like the Bastion which is meant to be a training/cooldown place, but...unlike the Bastion it feels kinda shoe horned in.  There seem to be several features, like the added difficulty, thrown in because ""hey, we did it in Bastion and people liked that.""  Standing on its own, without comparisons, it's...unnecessary, but inoffensive.On the whole, I liked Transistor, despite the story not gripping me as much as the characters did and the gameplay being often very frustrating.  I'd say play Bastion first, because Bastion is just a better game, but if you're looking to kill 4-6 hours and the issues I mentioned with gameplay can be overlooked, the experience is well worthwhile.Transistor is flawed, but still a gem.

												Now that I've recently returned to 100% the game, I feel that I can finally review it. (And don't worry, no spoilers.)First off, if you've not played Bastion, you don't need to in order to play this one. They aren't connected in the least besides gameplay and artstyle/music. Of course, I'd recommend playing that game too; it's a good one. If you have played Bastion, then I'd still highly recommend playing Transistor. Though it doesn't have the multiple endings that Bastion does, the story is still quite satisfying.Transistor is a great game, and I enjoyed it even more than I enjoyed Bastion. Its gameplay, though similar to its predecessor, feels a lot more polished and varied, with Red's many attacks having much use as you go along. What's nice is that a little ways in you get a way to attack even during your cooldowns (if you choose to use Turn()), which mixes up the fun even more. The story is just vague enough to keep you interested in its mystery (as Bastion did as well), and as minimal as it is, it works quite well. It's a really nice tale of love and loss (cheesy, I know), and the characters and world that it builds are very imaginative. It's short, it's fairly action-packed, and it's heartrending.The theme at its core - the potential imperfections of paradise - is touched upon tastefully and openly enough for the player to form their own opinions on how such would work (if it could). The game contains a couple of anticlimaxes that are done in an intentional manner to add to the mood and storytelling, and while for a game that's generally not the best idea, I found that it made sense for the most part here. That is still, of course, a flaw, but it's a justifiable one.As for the ending, without spoiling anything, I found it beautiful. The art, the music, the circumstances... they all blend together so well to make an impactful ending. It's amazing in its simplicity, and it is, for the most part, a logical conclusion to the story. I suppose there could maybe have been a choice as there was in Bastion (though only one choice and two options here), but that's just a very small piece of missed potential. The ending that the developers chose works, and it works well.The art in the game is awesome, and I figured I might as well give it a brief mention. The whole game looks great, and every time you get to see full art in its glory, it really does feel like a treat. The artist is http://jenzee.deviantart.com/ in case you want to see more of her work. Anyway...Finally, I get to gush about the music! I highly recommend buying the soundtrack, because it is phenomenal. It has some powerful songs (especially the vocal tracks - if you've not heard Paper Boats before, please don't listen to it until the end of the game. It just adds so much to the ending.) as well as many intense or atmospheric ones. A while back I made a review for the soundtrack itself, so check that out if for some reason you're interested in my favorite tracks. Anyway, all of the songs fit the game, and they add a lot to how artsy and beautiful it is.That's about it for this review - it turned out a little longer than I'd expected! For a rather short game, Transistor is one of the best; like any Steam game, it's in your best interest to buy it on sale, but to me it's worth the full price. Even after fully completing it I can see myself going back to it in the future. I don't really like giving numerical scores to games in general, so I'll just say that while it isn't perfect, it's really great and most certainly worth picking up if you can.			"

												Transistor is a pretty interesting game, though definitely confusing. You begin the game ""in media res,"" with things falling apart and jumping into some uncertain combat with some creatures known as The Process. Your character, Red, seems to have lost her voice, which is odd, and I will get to that later as a criticism related to Supergiant Games. The only thing that speaks to you (as the character and player) for most of the game is actually your weapon, the Transistor itself.The story is not all given to you. In fact, you must piece a lot of it together - what the world is, where the people in it are, who the people you meet along your journey are, and what you are actually doing in the first place, among many other questions. Supergiant was very lightweight on what they give you, as you only learn small pieces here and there, with a few side details as you explore and find items such as terminals, which have news posts or recorded audio.Other story details revolve around your powers in combat. As you go along in the game, you earn new attack skills for the Transistor, and you can map out which skills you have at a time. There are 4 active skill slots you can hold at any one moment. Each skill can be upgraded with a max of 2 other skills at a single time. And further, there are 4 passive skill slots that you can hold, which will cause certain effects during combat. Each new skill will give you 3 pieces of story information revolving around a singular character. To unlock the information, you must use each skill as Active, Upgrade, and Passive. Doing so will give you new blocks of text about each character's background.Note that there is Memory that you have in the game, and equipping each skill uses up the Memory. Its purpose is to limit the amount of active, passive, and upgrade skills you have at any time. Further, you gain experience to level up in combat, common to RPG-style games. Leveling up is how you unlock certain new skills, and also how you unlock the usage of the new slots for active/passive/upgrade.A very heavy piece of combat, which is basically a requirement to survive the game, is something called Turn(). Essentially, it stalls combat (freezes time) and gives you a limited energy bar to plan out what you want to do. Moving around and using skills will eat up the energy, though you can undo moves and keep changing your plan until you finalize it by ending Turn(). Doing so will trigger everything you chose in faster than usual speed, with most enemies barely moving while it all happens. Turn() is a way to increase damage against enemies, escape bad areas of battle, or even just a way to look around the area to figure out what to do.While I do think that the usage of such a system was pretty efficient, and the fact that using skills in those 3 different ways allows for good customization, I do not think that Turn() necessarily blew the game away. A big reason why it is not all that is the fact that it really must be used a ton, or else you simply die. Many enemies cannot be efficiently beaten without it. Some of them are even chasing and attacking you every single second, as if they are in their own Turn() mode the whole battle, such as these dog enemies called ""Fetch."" While you find certain skills to hide or run away, most battle areas end up being relatively small and having large amounts of enemies, meaning that no place is exactly a safe spot.In fact, the later into the game I got (and during my second playthrough in ""Recursion""), I ended up using the exact same set of skills and spamming Turn() in order to get through. The game had certain side battles called Tests, one of which is called Performance Tests. In them, you must fight waves of enemies with randomly generated skills, as a means to get associated with more skills than just a few you like. However, most of those were simply not possible with certain skills and required many retries to get stronger ones, showing that not every skill is enough to beat the game.The graphics of the game are pretty good, though I found way too many areas to be extremely bright/to have high contrast to where things were blending together. I could not find a good reason for this, because my computer and the game settings were nothing abnormal. No such brightness/contrast issues exist for any other games I have played, or for any applications I have used.As for the sound, most of the effects are nothing too special, while some of the music and voice acting were done well, with limitations. In total, you only hear about 4 characters in the entire game, with 3 of them being for very short periods of time. Supergiant Games seems to not get many people acting as characters, and in both of their popular games so far, that minimalism exists. The other game is Bastion, of course, a game which many people compare Transistor to, as Bastion came out a few years before in a similar vein. Both games have very little voice besides one main character talking as a semi-narrator, and one or two songs made for the games.Now, as just mentioned, Supergiant has the other big hit Bastion. As has seemed to be a large topic for players of these games, many people question and answer which of the two hits are better. A majority of people I've seen so far say Bastion - and in my opinion, I would agree with them.While Transistor is definitely strong and I still recommend playing it, I feel like Bastion has more charm and better setup than Transistor does. I enjoy the gameplay setup of Bastion more, with a hub that you return to, a map that you traverse to specific areas with vastly different styles, and a purely active combat style. I also enjoyed the story and characters of Bastion more, with you getting to learn more about them and the world.Supergiant made Bastion with very tight-knit story and gameplay, while Transistor has more breadth. Bastion gives you almost every single background detail possible, which I would not say Transistor needs to do - but I still think that Transistor did not go as deep as it should have. A lot of the story just feels like it is randomly pieced together, while Bastion feels very connected. Further, Transistor is a rather shorter game in comparison to Bastion.Despite the above, I think Transistor is definitely a game worth trying out, as it is a nice experience overall. However, I believe that Bastion has a higher replayability as well, and I do not see myself returning to Transistor much.			"

												Made by the creators of Bastion and set in a unique setting. Being a sci-fi fan this game was a thrill to play. It made me wish more games like it would get made. Enjoyed my time with the game and listening to the soundtrack as I played.Pros Good Story , though I would of liked more detail on the world setting Artistic Visuals Sci-Fi themed Great Music Real time & Tactical Combat Unique Setting Fun Boss Fights Interesting Skills & Skill system An ending that will leave you either satisfied or wanting multiple New Game + mode and difficulty modifiers for those who want a greator challenge(like Bastions)Cons 5-10hr playtime maybe a con for some (not me) so I will just list it on the top for your descretion Linear (Not a Con for me but others might find it to be) Narration & Story: I would of loved to had seen more narration to explain the kind of world you were in and such. It was not as thorough as in Bastion which had better narration and more story.In all the game was fun and I hope their next game does just as well.			"

 I love this game! Now, the story is quite deep for a seemingly simple game (to be honest I didn't get it all until I checked it online) but I'll give you a spoiler-free, rough idea of what this game is about.A city called Cloudbank is attacked by the Camerata which is a group of individuals who intend to change the city using Processes which are basically robotic creatures. You play as Red, a female singer who fights these creatures with the Transistor, a weapon that can also speak to you.Throughout the game, you will receive new abilities called Functions for the Transistor which can be combined differently to produce different effects on your attack and defence. You will be able to change and combine the Functions together at terminals called Access Points to help you fight different foes with different abilities. There are also Sandbox areas for you to test and experiment with the Functions.Armed with the Transistor, you will fight your way through beautiful locations, unlocking new Functions and facing new enemies. Your talking, sword-like weapon will keep you company and help you make sense of what is happening. Gameplay: 9/10  RPG style. Countless combinations for attack and defence. Real-time fighting and planning mode available. Very fun to play. Story: 9/10 Very unique and interesting story. Graphics: 9/10  Beautiful atmospheric locations and cutscenes. Sound Effects & Music: 10/10  Incredible music. Game comes with optional Soundtrack. Voice Acting: 8/10  Good voice acting which adds to the tone of the game Overall Score: 9/10  Recommendation: Very highly recommended. Play with a controller. Play at night in a dimly-lit room because... ambience. Buy the soundtrack. "

												Supergiant came out of nowhere with Bastion, and it was amazing.  Would they be able to recapture the magic with their sophomore release?  In short:  mostly.What made Bastion memorable to me was the music and atmosphere.  Mechanically solid, but aurally and visually delightful.  With Transistor they flip this a bit.  The real hook, the most fully formed part of the game, is the combat mechanics.Make no mistake, the audio is still miles ahead of most competitors.  Darren Korb does superb work with the music, though admittedly my tastes favor the folk blues of Bastion to the synth jazz of Transistor.  Logan Cunningham once again able to run laps around most voice acting in games.  Overall the entire atmosphere and audio portions of the game fall secondary to Bastion, but there is no shame in taking second to a game as strong as that.The mechanics are the area where it stands on it's own.  They use a unique system of abilities, with each function able to take either the form of an ability, modifier for another ability, or passive support role.  The myriad ways these interact can lead to many tactical situation.  The game also strongly encourages mixing and experimentation, as the narrative is largely unlocked by using an ability in each of the 3 roles.  There doesn't seem to be any overpowering combo, though each can feel that way when used correctly.  Many games feature a wide array of abilities you can equip, but few do as good of a job encouraging you to experiment and resist using the same strategy throughout.Overall, a hearty recommendation.  While I rate it slightly lower than Bastion, their idea of a sophomore slump is still to embarrass the competition in writing and audio.			"

												From the creators of the beloved Bastion comes Transistor, a game in which you take on the role of Red, a musician living in the city of Cloudbank, whose voice has just been stolen during an attempt on her life. Red finds herself pulling a greatsword, Transistor, from the body of an acquaintance, whose consciousness has been transferred into it and can actively communicate with her through it. Transistor proceeds to serve as the narrator of the game and a contrast to the now-voiceless Red.Transistor is set in a technological era where pretty much everything can be digital, even one’s entire being, and disturbingly easy to take ownership of, manipulate or destroy. This technology has also brought certain comforts, and citizens find themselves voting on the weather and what color they’d prefer for the evening’s sunset. Cloudbank seems on its way to being a utopian society for its citizens until, one day, influential figures begin to disappear, one after another. An army of intelligent robots that serve as the city’s defense has been activated and begins… processing people. Red must fight her way through the Process to stop it, find who's causing the trouble and recover her voice.The real stars of Transistor—sorry Red—are the function system and the hybrid battle system, where you can use abilities in real time and/or pause and plan your actions step by step on a tactical grid, then unpause to watch them unfold. Abilities, or functions as they’re called in the game, are absorbed by Transistor from the bodies of citizens you encounter as well as through leveling up. The function system is modular and synergistic, allowing you to mix and match and change your skills freely at checkpoints, with hundreds of potential combinations and effects. A simple attack function, such as Crash(), can be augmented with other functions so that it chains to additional enemies, charms them, has an added area of effect, fires more quickly, is more powerful, pulls enemies toward you, or becomes available for use in real time while your tactical turn is recovering. Each function may be used as an active skill, support for an active skill, and/or a passive skill. If, at some point, you attempt to research the strongest function combinations, you will find that almost every player has a different opinion; so many viable combinations is a hallmark of great design that doesn’t pigeonhole you into using cookie-cutter ability combinations throughout the entire game. This is where Transistor truly excels and the new game+ rewards you with additional copies of each function to play around with and more challenging encounters to test them out on. Self-imposed penalties called limiters, similar to the idols in Bastion, provide the option to challenge yourself further.Everything else in Transistor plays a supporting role to the combat system: The art is beautiful, but the locations are not very memorable and only serve to funnel you from one combat encounter to another; the soundtrack is solid but lacks a single track remotely as memorable as Bastion's vocal tracks; the narration takes a backseat because, although Transistor talks a lot, he really doesn’t have much of importance to say; characters other than Red and Transistor are never really fleshed out or present in the game other than to have their lives summarized in three-paragraph text dumps on the ability screen, where you’re left to decide their overall relevance and whether they should mean anything to you at all. The developers left a lot of holes for the player to fill and, whether this was intentional or not, for every player who manages to make sense where there seems none, another will be left scratching his head. Unlike in Bastion, additional narration of story elements does not take place during the optional challenges, which I feel is a missed opportunity to rectify this.For me, Transistor was ultimately the story of two individuals amidst chaos and despair; everything else was incidental and incohesive, and I was unable to appreciate the story much at all until I looked at it this way. Confined to these two characters and their story, it was touching, with a powerful conclusion. Regardless of whether you come away from the story with anything meaningful, Transistor is still worth playing for the excellent combat.			"

												I would give this game an 9/10. The graphics are very good.The gameplay is very good, I\'ve been using a PS3 controller for controls.The sound is pretty good. The content is pretty good.I especially love the fact that it uses programming functions, visually, to create your weapon inputs and everything.The only thing that hinders it a point, and I was going to say 8/10, is I don\'t really get into the storyline. I don\'t feel connected to it. It is kind of just happening. Others might, so I gave it an extra point. Overall this is a great game.I also like that now-adays games seem to be smaller, so when I thought I beat the game, I ended up going hours longer. So far I have about 8 hours played, and I \""think\"" I\'m close to beating it. All in all, great job! I\'d recommend it. Still unsure what the singing button is for, and the jumping for the sword button. I\'d imagine they are just for looks.			"

												Transistor is all I ever wanted it to be. And that's inspiring and wonderful. Gameplay is varied and barely annoying, it serves as a vessel to tell a pretty story, in a very remarkable way. I had no problems with the game whatsoever, the varied attacks are all pretty interesting to see, though some are rather less useful than others. Regardless, the soundtrack helps a lot to build a decent atmosphere, and that's the highest bit about this game. I got it on a sale a while ago for 4-5 dollars, it's been a while since i got to play it, but it was worth every dollar spent, and wouldn't mind paying the full price for a game such as this one. Kudos to the team behind this, all the best in the future.			"

  Transistor has beautifully done artwork, amazing colour contrasts(most likely picked every single colour to create this game tbh) and an Action-RPG game of sci-fi futuristic metropolis that includes the story of gorgeous influential singer, a female protagonist called Red and the remarkable sword, the Transistor.  Game begins as Red wields the sword(transistor) stabbed in deadman and ventures deep into the metropolis to discover and resolve some mysteries. The story reveals in bits and pieces, its our job to put them all together to find out whats really happening and it was a bit difficult to figure that out.The game is mostly about two characters, the guy trapped in transistor after being stabbed and the girl Red, which is more like romance between these two and to keep each other safe rather than saving the city.Together they go after the group belongs to Camerata organization which, for no good reason, turns against Red to kill her but failed in process. As the game goes on we discover that the man trapped in transistor was the one who gave up his life to save Red from dying and at the same time Red lost her voice and couldn't communite at all. The sword talks all the time and is the actual narrator in this game. He/it never stops talking to Red which at times annoyed me because i couln't concentrate on the story during the fight.The ending is quite emotional and sad nevertheless sort of satisfying.As for me, i liked the combat and gaining the new functions for the sword on every Level-up. I enjoyed destroying the machines and robots by combining various functions which come out as new combos to deal greater damage to finish them off. I always enjoy stories and hate killing but the phenomena was totally oppoiste in this game(idk if someone agrees with me on this but i must say combat and combos were awesome for me). The game also has the Planning mode which makes it alot easier to make combos and attack afterwards. Planning mode has always been my fav!This game is very beautifully designed, capital city, Cloudbank is the major place where the whole story lies. The atmosphere was really pretty! i loved it.I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtracks and music throughout the game. More music and songs could be unlocked by completing the side actvities and various tests. All of the songs were really amazing, i must say Supergiant  put really good effort creating them! Some of the songs were also sung by Red, she had pretty good voice and really nice songs.To the verdicts! Well the game is masterpiece of artwork! amazing soundtracks, well drawn art characters and a nice story.Pretty much worthy of 19.99$ but its nice to have it on sale. I Profoundly recommend it!!! "

												Transistor is like candy, in that it gives you a rush but ultimately leaves you feeling a bit empty.Initial impressions are fantastic - the first few minutes of the game has genuine emotional punch, voice acting is great, graphics are vibrant and evocative, and the game’s soundtrack is arguably one of the best ever released for a computer game (I’ve purchased it). The game is set in a unique and engaging world, and a range of intriguing characters are regularly hinted at.Disappointingly, the story remains surprisingly lightweight given the cracker start, and the game finishes with both the world and the characters remaining enigmatic and unexplored.Gameplay is primarily combat in a modified “real time with pause” style, which suits me great and has a ton of potential. You have the ability to combine a large number of different powers and effects, creating some genuinely interesting combinations. Unfortunately there is little variety in enemies, and consequently, combat lacks depth and replayability.I feel bad being critical about a game this good, but for a game only a few steps away from having been a genuine classic I can’t help but reflect on what might have been. If only the developers had explored the intriguing world and characters they have created in a little more detail.Regardless, Transistor is undeniably a top-shelf game by any measure, and a worthy (though not essential) addition to anyone’s game catalogue.I like candy.

Product received for free
												I received Transistor as a part of a between-friends Secret Santa gift swap and it took me around five and a half hours to get to the end once.  I used the Xbox 360 controller the whole time.  A singer without a voice and a talking sword.  This duo has a front-row seat for what looks like the end of the world...  Transistor should feel familiar to those who played Bastion before since it too is an action RPG with an isometric angle.  Instead of landmasses floating in the sky, the setting is a city in the process of uncontrolled change.  And instead of a young man with an ever-growing arsenal of weapons, our heroine instead drags the titular Transistor behind her, and she uses that for a variety of attacks.  ""Red, we're not gonna get away with this, are we?"" is the line that starts the game, spoken by the sword sticking out of a man to the woman standing over the two.  No backstory, no introductory cutscene, just this scene and cutting to gameplay as she takes the sword with her.  The sword knows where to go, so you move on...and then the cubes come and with them, enemies.  You start with two attacks and four slots to put them in to start, and you get more attacks through the story and as you level up.  Combat's interesting because of the ""Turn()"" feature.  You can fight enemies in real time, but Red is no warrior and several attacks have windup times that leave her open.  Using Turn() stops time and allows you to queue movement and attacks that eat up your ""planning"" bar.  When you confirm your setup, Red will zip along and do all of the attacks at lightning speed as the enemies move at a snail's pace.  The tradeoff is that then you can't use any attacks until the planning bar refills, though you can move.  Red only has one movement speed, so using Turn() to approach, strike, and retreat is always a good idea.  Another neat thing about the combat is how your unused attacks can buff your other attacks or even Red herself.  Crash() is one of the starting moves, a basic melee-range attack that can stun enemies.  Applying it as an upgrade to another move makes that move stun.  Applying it as a passive reduces the damage Red takes as well as renders her immune to slowdown.  You eventually unlock two upgrade slots for your attacks and four passives for Red, but you have to mind the MEM limit taken up by your powers, each of which eats 1 to 4 MEM.  There are quite a few combinations to try out, and you can get interesting combos like a ranged AoE that charms and poisons anything it hits, or a summon that spawns two helpers that slowly heal you.  Another interesting thing is that all of the powers are tied to character bios and you unlock information as you use the power in the active, upgrade, and passive slots, though this is completely optional.  You get some background info as well as circumstances leading to their disappearances in the wake of the chaos going on, so the game indirectly pushes you to try new combinations.  The game also takes a different approach to lives.  You have a health bar that naturally depletes as you get hurt, and when it empties, you get fully recovered at the cost of losing access to the move that used the most MEM, and it won't come back until you visit a few save points.  Lose all four of your set powers and game over.  I really liked the game's visual style, art deco mixed with digital aesthetic, giving it a weird retro-futuristic vibe.  The enemies are mostly white robotic constructs that attack you with lasers, there are white cubes that pop up to show an upcoming fight and to be used as cover, and you drag a big green sword behind you that looks a bit like a circuit board (which also leaves behind circuity sparks as you move).  The game feels like it could take place entirely in cyberspace, especially considering some of the prompts (finding the Transistor stuck in the man's chest reads ""User: Logged Out""), but it's left ambiguous.  The music is great too, though I really took notice in a couple of places that play songs that Red wrote and performed in-universe, like ""The Spine"" playing when fighting the first Younglady at the big poster or ""In Circles"" gradually getting corrupted during the first boss fight.  Given Red is currently mute, the Transistor makes comments about the situation or the things you interact with.  I know the narrator in Bastion was pretty love it or hate it, but I didn't mind him and I never would've guessed it was the same guy voicing both characters.  As far as difficulty went, I found the game on the easy side, but that might've been due to the power combinations I used or prior experience with these kinds of games.  YMMV of course, but I only lost my health to the first boss once and the last one twice, though I came close a few other times.  If you know what you're doing and have a good setup of powers, you can probably handle anything.  The game slowly introduces you to new mooks to fight and their upgrades, at least.  The game is pretty short, as in, ""one night of gaming"" short.  It doesn't overstay its welcome, but I honestly wanted more.  There are optional challenges that give you a preset list of powers and tasks you with a mission such as ""survive for 90 seconds"" or ""kill all enemies in one Turn()"".  There's a New Game Plus feature where you go back through the story, fighting mooks in their strongest forms, and you can opt into the Limiters you unlock by leveling up which increase the enemy's powers in exchange for you getting more EXP out of fights, to the maximum level of 30.  You get another set of the same powers you earned the first time through, so you can really mix things up on the second loop.  Short but sweet.  Transistor is a bit more than just Bastion: Cyberpunk, but those familiar with Bastion should find this a great fit.  It's pretty light on the RPG even though you level up, as you don't allocate stats and the biggest choices are which of the options you go for when you level up, not that you permanently lose anything you skipped.  It's pretty appealing for those who like customizing since there are 16 powers and you can combine any unique power together twice, so there are a lot of combinations to try out--and the game tracks which ones you've used at that!  Kinda wish the story was longer, but it wraps itself up nicely even if it's short.  There's some replay value but a lot of it comes from the optional challenges or just trying new combos to decimate your foes.  You'd probably like this one.			"

												Oh holy ham sandwiches, this game is absurd. First of all, the art style is simply amazing. I mean did ya look at it? It's fabulous. Secondly, the soundtrack is WHOASH. You might end up not enjoying the game but still love it because of how good the music is. It's off the chain man.The gameplay. Let's just say that it's a real sauce ball platter when it comes to this aspect. Transistor uses a battle system that is both unique and delicious to the stomach. It allows you to attack enemies in real time or using the neato ""Turn"" ability to plan out your attacks. Both options are viable and they are both quite satisfying.Transistor is not without it's flaws however. The game is pretty short only taking me around 7 hours to beat. The game is also extremely linear offering no sense of exploration. The game will keep you going on the path of destruction without much say. HOWEVER, transistor's replay value is boosted thanks to it's wide selection of weapons which allows you to experiment and find tons of different strategies and slam dunk homeruns to use throughout the game. So you don't get to explore the world much but you do get to explore your vast arsenal of abilities. Making different loadouts was pretty fun, and that's where a lot of the replay value was found for me.For those of you who played Supergiant's last game Bastion, you should be right at home with the new role that voice actor Logan Cunningham plays in this game as the voice inside the transistor.  Similar to Bastion, the main character is silent and the voice in the transistor will speak for her as she journeys through the city of Cloudbank. It is a slightly different role compared to the role of the narrator from Bastion, but it is executed very well and at the end of the day I was just as impressed. The story is also one of the biggest dunks this game has to offer. I found it very interesting and engaging, however once the game had ended, I was left with many unanswered questions that were never resolved.  This may annoy some players, but I actually found it refreshing that the game challenges you to think about these questions and come up with interpretations for yourself.At the end of the day, this game is GODLIKE.  For those of you who are looking for a large amount of content in this game, the 20$ price tag may be too steep. And that is okay, but I believe that this game is such an awesome experience that the price tag is justified even if it doesn't last you as long as most games.So yeah, Transistor gets a rating of ""11/10 reverse gorilla dunk"". Thank you for your time.			"

												It's another great atmospheric game. I love the visual style, and the music is great.The action is a bit slower paced than Bastion, and you have a 'strategy mode' where you can line up actions for an instant attack stream. You also pick up new skills here'n there, which you can combine to upgrade others, or use directly. It's quite interesting how it's put together. So far it's pretty amazing game.			"

												This is the most beautiful game I've played in my twenty six years. Besides the visual appeal and the music being leagues ahead of any game I've ever seen, the game mechanics are amazing as well. You can make so many different abilities because all of the functions are interchangeable between passive, actives and mods. The amount of work that had to go into this game is incredible. The story hooked me right from the start. I literary downloaded this game, played nonstop and finished in a little over five hours. Now I am still awake at 3AM feeling compelled to write a review about how much I loved this game. I really do not have any words that will do any justice to this unique and beautiful world that I completely fell in love with. This will, hands down, be the best buy of the 2014 Steam Summer Sale.

												Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.First of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.Other than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.I would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.If you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.			"

												When I first looked at Transistor I thought it would be somewhat similar to Bastion. It had the same graphic style, an isometric view and a narrator (which is actually a 'character' this time; in the form of a talking sword). But, I'm happy to say that I couldn't be more wrong.Yes, it has all of the features I just mentioned but it's not just a simple copy. There's so much more going on here. Transistor has a deep (and a little bit confusing) story and a combat system that as equally deep. The lore reminded me of Dark Souls where you have to piece things together yourself and not everything is trying to be explained.The graphics are amazing, but are, unfortunately, this time limited to full HD resolutions and not anything higher. Despite that it all still looks like art, and it really is eye candy. Absolutely wonderful.The narrator is doing a great job as far as the voice acting goes, even if it's a bit stiff and sometimes feels unemotional. The music and sounds are all excellent as well.Let's get back to the combat system for a minute. Like pretty much any RPG out there, your character will level up after several battles and once you level up you're allowed to choose a certain skill and passive upgrade. When you first start it's just that, a skill. But level up a few times more and you'll have several skills. This time, however, skills can be combined to make an even more effective/deadly combination. So, for example, let's say that you chose the skill to teleport in an instant. Combine it with Charm (which temporarily transforms an enemy into an ally) and you'll be zipping across the map converting enemies, making your battles much easier. This was just a poor example, by the way (blame my memory !). Of course, this also works the other way around, resulting in entirely different skills every time. It's a blast to play with and it's even more fun to experiment with these new skills on real enemies. You'll see that certain combinations will do ridiculous amounts of damage and that others, while still being useful, need some slight tweaking in order to be effective. It's pure brilliance.Transistor is on the short side, however, and it can easily be finished in 5-6 hours. I think I explored every area carefully in my playthrough, but I didn't do most of the (optional) challenges. So I think you can add another 2 hours to my numbers if you want to do all of those. And after that, you can start New Game+ with all your current skills intact (which will make the battles more fun right from the start).In the end Transistor is nothing but a brilliant, deep little game. If you call yourself a serious gamer you should absolutely play this. I liked it even better than Bastion, and that's definitely saying something.[Rating: 91/100]			"

												A really loveable game filled with music, art, and all around good characterization and story writing. From the intro to the credits, the scenes are immersed in art and colors. To draw a parallel--much like Bastion, the many UI aids are still present (Subtitles, non-intrusive graphics, and despite the seemingly 'light filled' gameplay, it's not garish at all!), which in gameplay terms also includes a difficulty scaler (purely the player's choice) that modifies every aspect of combat alongside full control over what you bring into battle, covering around four major battle skills and their own (maximum of two) modifiers each, coupled with passive bonus modifier slots overall--all of whom you gain from the world...and its people, that writing about it in a review may downplay how much is actually possible. Every power and skill is configured to work with any other setting that given the simple battle system, would occur a mixture of primary and secondary effects (The skill would be thematically the same, but modified by the secondary add-on). All four 'major' skills can be modified dynamically given that setting, which makes the combat system able to be tailored to one's custom playstyle.While not visible in the above screenshots, Transistor has subtitles for everything (sans the song notes and chords for when the protagonist is singing herself) alongside an engaging storyline that somewhat tells itself in media res, with snippets to what was and is happening collected along the way.It also works on rather 'low-end' PCs which, coupled with wonderful graphics and an also wonderful storyline (and gameplay), creates an immersive setting that performs very well through several hours of playtime with importance given to the lore and writing. Personally, when I played this, the utter smoothness and immersion as if I was playing one of those 1080p quality videos I can hardly load on Youtube made me feel a lot better about how inclusive games are being (both to those with disabilities--given my hearing--and to those who are hard-up in affording 'better' PCs for games).Edit: While I may not look it--I've played a playthrough and beyond despite the current time showing it. The achievements record per-save basis (and with a stable online connection, of course), so it may not be that obvious. :P			"

			We take a look at Transistor from indie darling Supergiant Games. While the game might invoke feelings of Bastion at first glance, in a good way, there's definitely a lot more going on here that sets...

												pros - - gorgeous soundtrack and visuals- narration > bastion's narration, in my opinion- emotionally stirring, thought-provoking story with roots in science fiction - solid length, and the nature of the game's story-telling makes it to where replaying at least once is still enjoyable - turn-based, strategy-based almost MOBA-esque combat is really fresh and fun, and can be infuriatingly difficult- seriously one of the beautiful all around games i've ever playedcons - - the story is not presented in the most cohesive way (deliberately) so i can see why someone may not fully understand the breadth of what is actually happening- that's literally it			"

												Wonderful game, if you played and liked Bastion, you will definitely like this one.Pros :1. Solid story and characters2. Interesting and well-presented idea (futuristic ""techno world"")3. Both design and music are amazing4. Great level of customisation, wide variety of abilities the main protagonist can use and quite a few enhancements to make the gameplay a bit more challengingCons :1. The game itself is a bit short, I wish it was longer ( it took me ~5h to finish it )- to get all the achievements, you need to replay it, but it still feels good, because of the atmospheric style and customisation2. After completing the game, I felt like the story was missing something, it could definitely develop into something more or offer a bit more advanced character development Overall 9/10 "

Transistor is like a beautiful woman with whom you somehow land on a date. She has attracted you with her mysteriousness, but you still do not listen to what she says, by falling in her eyes and in the lingering sound of her voice. After all, great memories remain, though you are not sure exactly what happened there.			"

												That was one hell of a ride...I cannot believe that there aren't many people that know about this game, as it is simple amazing. It is a more than worthy successer to Supergiant's first game Bastion and its story is suprisingly hard hitting.Pros:- The game's soundtrack is phenomenal, and teh game's ability to allow the main character, Red, to hum along when out of combat helps the soundtrack shine.- The game is beautiful, but runs very well, even for my 3 year old laptop, which isn't at all built for gaming.- The combat system is simple, yet very fun, somewhat challenging (but not too challenging) and is very creative, making it a breath of fresh air.- Speaking of difficulty of the game, there are limitations, much like Bastion's panthenion system, which allow you to make the game harder if you feel that it is currently too easy for you.- The story respects you by allowing you to figure out and put pieces of the puzzle together, instead of constantly guiding you through the story, adding to the mystery of the game, which Bastion also had.- The world and level design is very good and certain interactions that you can have with the world help to flesh out the world that the game is set in.- There are extra challenged in the game and the game's story is replayable, if you would like to play the game with a different combination of powers.Cons:- The game is a little on the short side, with its main story coming to around 6 hours.- There aren't any section within the game that allow you to make choice which will affect the story, and - despite Bastion only having a few of these - I feel that they are missed. In all honesty the cons are really only nickpicks, and don't really affect the game too much, and I feel that Transistor is a step up from Bastion. I also feel like it could have been acknowledged as one of the best games of 2014, if it had been given its rightful attention as its stylistic gameplay and world, combined with the beautiful soundtrack and mysterious story, make it on of my personnal favourites.

												Supergiant Games does it again with Transistor. The game has everything I adored about Bastion with a deeper disposition.The game's combat system features both real time and tactical elements which I feel does wonders for varied playstyles. The function combination system also gives you a ton of choices seeing as you can mix and match 16 different functions as actives, passives, and upgrades. The musical quality of the game is also quite excellent. It goes beyond what you would expect as far as ear candy goes. I also noticed that compared to Bastion, the songs in this game have a more direct message. They're not just catchy, they really fit into the story. If you think the soundtrack for this game is stellar, wait until you hear the humming added in!Here's a sample:

			Transistor is a science fiction action RPG video game by Supergiant Games. It is released on May 20, 2014 on Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 platforms, with other platforms possible in the future.		

As far as the story goes, Transistor really runs it deep. There are large gaps in the game that I still don't understand even after completing everything (while reading/listening to all interactables). I feel these gaps (some of which are open to interpretation) should at least be partially expanded on. Despite this, the game did not disappoint. I just wish they had alternate endings like they had with Bastion.10/10 - Everything about the game was very good, but the 10 rating comes from the insanely captivating music. I'm the type of gamer who values my audio experience just as much as the gameplay (if not more) so these things are very important to me. All in all this has been a great impulse buy.			"

												Wow, Transistor is one of those beautiful games that gives you great satisfaction while playing it <3. I enjoyed this game A LOT, no wait, I mean I love it. I'm glad I gave it a try. Definitely one of my all time favorites after finishing. The soundtrack is simply AMAZING, combat is fun and diverse with many moves + turn based strategy, story is told well as you progress and the voice acting is excellent. Not to forget the reeeeally cool artwork and characters too like Red and her companion <(^_^)>...I have yet to play Bastion, Supergiant's earlier game, but after this I need to try it some day.If you enjoy stuff like sci-fi, great music, story and cool action/rpg, then give this superb game a try. Highly recommended. Thank you  Supergiant Games for this beauty <(^_^<)!			"

												Play this if you love music and art; if you think that videogames are much more than just easy entertainment; if you want another one of those unforgettable experiences in your life. And finally, play this if you thought those thing I've said about Bastion.I recommend to beat it twice in order to complete all the achievements and unlock all the info of the characters. The story has a clear simbolism and opens a long debate about existentialism. If you are able to see this, then you can give this game a 10/10 because it really deserves it. And about the soundtrack. Wow. Much more than videogame music if you ask me. One of the best indie games of all time, and actually the best of 2014. ""See you in the country, Mr. Bike.""			"

												Summer-Rain looks over your shoulder witha few blinks, expecting an answer, which youdo not give. The screen flashes with shadesof sea green, white and orange, as the titlescreen greets the both you.TRANSISTOR.Bugging you after she heard a group of herfriends fangirl over the sheer *awesome* ofthis particular game, Summer-Rain pesteredyou into spending an evening at her houseshowing her the game and whether it wasreally as good as all her friends said it was.It is.Simply put, and as you soon discover withSummer-Rain gasping with the introductionof each new enemy type, Transistor is aneffective blend of Diablo's isometric 2.5-Dengine and a profound story which givesBioshock Infinite a run for its money.The mysterious narrator of the game givesexposition in dulcet tones that makes Summer-Rain swoon dreamily. Trapped asa disembodied consciousness after savingthe player character, a starlet known as'Red', you embark on a quest to recoverRed's stolen voice and bring to justicethose who murdered her boyfriend.Along the way, the titular sword whereRed's dead number 1 fan and boyfriend,the Transistor; can be outfitted withvarious upgrades, upgrades which areavailable as more characters die aroundyou and more bosses are vanquished.Summer-Rain holds your arm as youhelp Red avoid a gigantic, nanite-basedsuperweapon-gone-wrong known simplyas 'The Spine', a metaphor and referenceto Transistor's world lore of  'The Spineof the World' and one of Red's own solonumbers, 'The Spine'.""Don't die."" Summer-Rain says, lookingat you with a mix of fear and desperation.""The story is so good. I want to- I need tosee the end, Starboy."" You nod once.""Don't worry, Summer. I won't. Andwhatever you do... don't let go."" Summer-Rain catches the Transistor'sdialogue reference and smirks slightly before leaning her head against your shoulders, and you enter one of the different stages to battle The Spineitself. You manage a small smile inreturn, both of you feeling just like howRed and the Transistor feel, togetheralways, back-to-back against the world.When all is said and done and the storyends, both you and Summer-Rain feelthe tears run down both your cheeks.The world is saved, at terrible cost, butall that transpired in Transistor madeabsolute sense and nothing felt forcedor left-field. Extensive enemy stagesand 'Danger Room'-eque scenarios,along with varying difficulty levelsand damage multipliers allow for ahealthy amount of replay value. You look back at Summer-Rain andsee that your mouth is partially agape,before she smiles sheepishly and closesyour own mouth too. Blinking the tearsaway from the touching ending and theemotional roller-coaster that disguiseditself as a game, you turn off the PCand have a quick shower before bed,Summer-Rain joining you.""You know..."" Summer-Rain starts,clad in nothing but a towel with her hairwet and shining as she dries you off. ""That was one of the best games I'veever seen you play."" You turn back toSummer-Rain, putting your hands onher hips. ""But you didn't play..."" Youanswer, tugging away at the towelwrapping Summer-Rain's form.She smiles her signature smile,before gesturing you to dim the lightswhile undoing her towel. ""SometimesStarboy... sometimes you're just content with watching.""TRANSISTOR. "

												This is a Sci-Fi Tactical RPG set in the luxurious neighborhood of a city. The RPG part is the usual leveling and acquiring of various attacks and abilities. The tactical side has you planning your moves and attacks during your 'turn' and during 'their turn' you run away. An interesting aspect in this game is that any ability can be used as an active ability, A passive ability or as an enhancement to an active ability. Gives a lot of different combinations to play with and the game encourages you to try them all out. It's also the main reason I'm considering playing again immediately. Something I rarely do. Story wise, You're Red, A super pop star, and something bad happens. Fortunately your over-sized all-purpose weapon talks to you and fills you in on what's going on. Well, The talking stick doesn't tell you everything. A lot of background is given through text and I found the setting it painted compelling. So much so that I wanted to explore and experience more of the city. I kind of interpreted that as a reflection of Reds' yearning for a part of her life that has been interrupted. I saw the fatalistic vibe as Reds' also.Visually the city is pleasing, clean and precise. While the more personal moments are done in a nice watercolor style. The music, Except for one stand out song, seems mostly ambient. Though there are some excellent subtle things done to the music, I wished it wasn't so subtle. Something to save for the next game perhaps.Overall, While the gameplay is excellent, The narrative seems more like an interesting experiment if not entirely successful. But I'll be there for SuperGiants next game sight unseen.			"

												I've been thinking for some time that cinema is leaving the spot open for new ways of storytelling. Videogames have tried to take that spot over the years, ofering now a great tool for writers and devs to reach their audience in ways movies can't. This level of inmersion is often used to put the player in other character's shoes, offering experiences with more or less background. Transistor favours the storytelling in spite of some of this inmersion, making the player an observer, not giving you absolute control, getting carried by the events, giving  you a broader view of what it has to deliver. And what a way to deliver it.Transistor executes flawlessly everything it attempts. It doesn't offer you the latest in graphics, the best music or the most action-packed gameplay, but it makes sure you enjoy every last bit of it. Don't take me wrong, the hand drawn graphics look gorgeous, the music is great and the gameplay is very, very enjoyable, but it's the way it delivers it to the player, what makes Transistor one of the very best games I've ever played. And I've been around since the 80's.The game takes all the good things from Bastion, all kinds of influences from our day, and builds a vivid, original world, so full of life and personality it makes everything else look so run-of-the-mill, so old and used. It tells the oldest Story ever told, a Tragedy. But it's the characters, the world they inhabit, the references to our world, the little details, the pauses, the many readings anyone can take from this story... It's more than just a game, just a story. It's an interactive piece of art.To sum it all up, don't miss this experience if you're looking for something else than quick, mindless fun in a game, because you'll be missing a classic. This game is gonna be high up in the history of videogames, at least as one of those ""hidden gems"", and will bring you memories (and probably a smile) when you stumble upon it in some years. Indie games are offering new, fresh, great ideas and masterpieces like Transistor only proves that it's a very good time to be a gamer, enjoy it while it lasts.			"

												This game proves that games can be art and at the same time have great gameplay that keeps you wanting to play it more and more. The only downside of Transistor is the length of the game. Recommended to everyone who loves games with great storylines, awesome voiceacting and tactical combat with various skill builds.			"

												I've barely started playing this game, and I'm already feeling sorry that I will finish it soon -- game's THAT good.Simply put, it's an upgraded version of the Bastion -- with even better graphics, sounds (and music too!) and script.The core gameplay is decent too, one can describe it as ""platformer meets hack'n'slash meets Final Fantasy"". UI has some issues, though -- you'll encounter them when you'll be trying to customize your loadout. But nevertheless, game is extremely good -- must have, if you ask me.I'd rate the game 9.5 out of 10.0, a must buy.			"

												I...I don't really know where to start with this so I'll try to keep it short. When the discussion of ""games as art"" comes up, this should be at or near the start of the conversation. Transistor is breathtakingly beautiful. It's one of the most realized and striking art directions I have ever seen in a game. The gameplay is rewarding and the story is fantastic if you're want to learn more about it.I loved Bastion, but this may beat it in my eyes. Transistor deserves all the accolades it has recieved and should be experienced by everyone. An all-time great for me.			"

												I was pretty excited for this game.  It's an action RPG.  developed by the same guys who developed Bastion.  Nice art style.  So, when it went on sale, I snatched it up right away.Overall, I was pretty disappointed.  I found the gameplay very repetitive, the action very underwhelming, the story bland and  on the whole very short and unchallenging.  There was a lack of enemy variety, and no real strategy needed to get by them.  Bosses were kind of a pushover too.  Even tho I found this game disappointing, I'll likely give future games from the developer a shot.  Despite my complaints listed above, I enjoyed the actual gameplay mechanics.  The upgrade system was kinda neat and I liked testing out different combinations of attacks you get.  Controls were decently responsive and fluid enough for purpose.  Some other pros are the art style and music.  But, graphics and music don't make a game.  I feel it's more or less wasted here.To wrap it up.   While the gameplay mechanics, art and music were great.  The repetition, weak challenge, and bland story (no real character development either?) dragged it all down to create a forgettable experience.  One little unrelated complaint too.  The guy trapped in the transistor just never shuts up.  I get it's supposed to be a narrative.   But, holy hell..  a line between narrative and constant irritating rambling blurred together here. "

												Listen, I loved Bastion to no end and I was extremely hyped for this game. I'll start with the pros for this game:- Incredible ost. It's so damn good I bought it here on steam, because I want to listen it again and again- Great art style. Character design and lighting in particular are fantastic, but even the transition drawings used as cutscenes are a wonder to look at- Really fun to play around with your skills. There are plenty of different skills and all can be active, passive or secondary, which means lots of combinations and lots of possibilities- Great sense of atmosphere and overall interesting charactersNow for the cons:- Even though I've said the characters are interesting, I've completed the game in 3,7 hours (reading the steam stats of what I've played in the past week, when I decided to make a proper run of the game, not knowing I was already halfway through) That's ridicolously short... I mean, not only it ended quite abruptly, but there really wasn't any time for character development or anything else.- It's fun to play around with skills, but I guess balancing them was really tough. I mean, there are some combos that will make this game so easy it will stop being fun. Example: go to the final boss, select purge as active skill and put the two skills you have from the beginning in its passive slots (breach and pulse I think are the names) Then just spam the skill button. Done.- There's virtually nothing to do beside the main story. Yeah, there's a ""beach"" where you can go and have trials (something similar to the trials in Bastion) but you can unlock only songs in here... that you can only listen to if you stay on the beach. I completed three or four trials and then never went back there.Honestly, if it's on sale, buy it and see by yourself. To me, it was very disappointing			"

												If you liked Bastion, you should buy Transistor.If you like heartrendingly beautiful games, you should buy Transistor.If you like games that constantly force you to adapt and reevaluate how you're approaching a challenge, you should buy Transistor.If you're a human being, you should buy Transistor.In all seriousness, coming to Transistor from Bastion, I was a little worried. Bastion had extremely tight and hugely enjoyable gameplay, and it seemed like Transistor was discarding that for a slowed down, more strategic approach. I could not have been any more wrong. Transistor provides a system that is pretty easy to learn and grows in complexity and versatility as you progress, allowing you to really tailor your abilities to how you want to play. Unused abilities become modifiers for your equipped abilities or modifiers for your character herself, allowing you to constantly alter your playstyle. You pick the pace at which you fight, choosing whether to focus on fighting in real time, or relying more on using the “time freeze” mechanic to stop time and allow you to plan a whole flurry of attacks in quick succession.Regardless of this flexibility in playstyle, if your health hits zero, instead of dying and starting over, you lose one of your abilities randomly. This serves an elegant two fold purpose. On one hand, it provides punishment for the player who failed to stay alive, removing an ability that that player specifically wanted to use. On the other hand, because that ability is now removed from the game for a while, the player is forced to mix and match and experiment with whatever abilities are left in the ability pool. To stay alive, the player must adapt.And there is some satisfaction to be had from being forced to adapt. By forcing your hand, Transistor challenges your creativity, your willingness to change the way you think or to try something new. It sits on the precipice of balancing hugely gratifying gameplay with a breathtaking world and a resonating story, and does not disappoint.You should probably go buy it.			"

												The first thing I did once I played 10-20 mins wasTab out → click on store → search for: Transistor Soundtrack → tab back to game →   continue playing.for real, the soundtrack is one of the best things I've ever had the pleasure to listen to in my life.(you can unlock most of the soundtrack for free inside the game if you beat some optional tests)The art and textures of the game are just divine, no words.The combat system is pretty unique since you can do a mix of going for ''turn based'' combat or free combat.the skills you unlock are also optional and there's an ''unlimited'' combinations since every skill you unlock you can use it as a passive skill or as a passive skill for skill.and the last thingThe Story, the story is more more deep than it looks like, and I encorage you that once you ''end'' the game, search it up and look it from a different point of view.It's been a long since a game didnt make me feel like this, being more clear since I end Portal 2 (wich was 2 years ago).the chills were racing all over me....while playing Transistor.

												tldr I  cant recommend enough both bastion and transistor-they are @ 80% off for the weekend and they re  a steal for that price---I just finished transistor twice, and i loved it-fantastic art awesome soundtrack and unique setting--it feels alot like its bastions dark alter ego.at first mechanics may seem bit strange, but make sense after a while. sidenote- achievements in both games are very fun and challenging and actually add to the experience- so dont rush these games, do your 2 playthroughs (you retain level and gear for the 2nd) ) and  grab them all-- PS i used controller so i have no idea how they play with k/b + mouse			"

												This game was an unbelievably vast piece of coolness at first, and quietly escalated to an emotional blast throughout the process.Narrator sounds like a piece of perfect bacon telling how it was sweetly grilled. Music was good, the kinds that made me jealous, which by the end, becomes something so strong that it has its own voice, watches you play, takes care of the characters.No need to describe the graphics with words. You heard of it. You can see it for yourself. All of the elements are so tremendously glued together that even thinking about there were these talented human beans working in a small team makes me want to bang my head to the wall because apparently I've been living in hell.

												I'm not good at reviews, but I felt that I should write something because I loved this game and I love the people behind Supergiant.  <3Supergiant games did it again!  ^_^ After having fallen in love with Bastion and Supergiant Games, I could not wait for their next release.The only similarities between Bastion and Transistor, however, are.. obviously the art-style, the immersive narration and story, and yet again the amazing soundtrack.  Woot woot, the same narrator from Bastion!The difference: the combat system is not quite the same as Bastion's. It's not so much a hack & slash, as much as it is a *tactical* combat-system game.  Ahh how to explain this..? It's quite unique.There is a 'time-stop' system which allows you to literally -pause- to analyze and plan out your combat moves in advance. Each ability and number of steps you take around the ""field"" require a certain amount of 'energy' - so you are limited by an energy bar and its refresh system.  Therefore, you have to be efficient in not only the abilities you choose, but your movements across the ""combat field"", etc.  It's remniscent of other games to me that I had enjoyed very much.. so that was not an issue for me, personally! -- it was quite a delight. :)What I especially enjoyed was the way that you can experiment with and mix up all the different abilities you pick through leveling up. Each combination results in something different, and you can only have 4 active ones in combat. You can literally mix 2-3 learned abilities together for one unique ability / result - so there are multiple possiblities.  You also have passive ability-slots which you can use those ability cards for, as well, and they play a completely different role.  There is quite a flexible customization system. :)  Also, if / everytime your HP goes to '0' in combat, you lose and are disabled from one of your 4 abilities; which you can only recover at a later time. :o Additionally, if you want to challenge yourself further, you are able to raise the difficulty by implementing an in-game system called ""limiters"" -- a very similar system to Bastion.  The more limiters you use, the more rewards (more xp). Funfun!All in all, I loved the game so much that I took my time with it and did not want to rush through it.  I recommend that you don't either to enjoy the narration, soundtrack, and immersiveness for the total experience. Luckily, there is an option for a second playthrough so you can have the opportunity to level up some more and unlock abilities you had missed out on before and try different combinations! :)			"

												Well... I'm not very good at writing reviews, but here we go...When had my first touch with Transistor i already heard some good reviews about this game. But when i started to play, and i was going deeper and deeper, i knew that this game deserve for those good opinions.But let's start from the begining. Transistor is a typical arkade RPG, where we will try to find a previous users of the sword (Transistor) and try to discover the true Transistor's destiny. To do that we will have to defeat a whole armies of enemies which we will have to stand and fight with them. Yeah, fight system in this game is just great! We have a lot of various skills that we can combine with each other to gain a brand new skill! Isn't it just great? But let's go forward. Through the game i have made a lot of screen shots, more than i'm usualy making during a game, becouse this game have an awesome audiovisual layer, it's more like an art not a game. I love the songs composed by Darren Korb and Ashleu Barrett it just fit great in the game, i literaly can lisen a soundtrack a whole hours. The storyline is also a strong part of Transisotr, i remember that when i was finishing the game it felt like - WHAT? WHAAAT? Wow, this game is awesome! Well... after all, do i recomend the game? Definitly - yes! One of my fav game so far. 10/10			"

												If you played Bastion, I guess you already own Transistor. What? Not yet! Well it is not too late. You will enjoy listening to the narrator voice again and the music is once again wonderful. The gameplay is slightly different this time but very interesting, though a bit repetitive on your second playthrough. Supergiant managed to create just what you need as a gamer. No superficial introduction. You just press a button and the game begins. You slowly level up and become stronger but the limiters keep the game balanced. The configuration of the buttons is up to you and let you adapt your play style according to what you want to do or your enemies.Just come and experience Red's story...			"

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingFor Deaf/hoh gamers, I rate this game a 10/10!Overall GameSupergiant knocked it out of the park again.  In Transistor, you play as Red, a lady whose voice was stolen by a group who intended to kill her.  Obviously that's a bit odd, but the game takes place inside of a computer-ish environment.  Telling more would be giving things away for those who, for some reason, have yet to play it.Since this review is largely oriented toward acciessibility for deaf/hoh gamers, I will stop there and just say that it is a great game with a great story that has significant replay value both in terms of further understanding the story and additional challenges, as the game gets harder on additional playthroughs.My overall rating for gameplay experience is 10/10. :DGeneral AccessibilityThis game has been called semi-isometric.  Basically, you control Red in an angled-down view using WASD, Q for a 'flourish,' and the number keys 1-4.  In place of WASD, you can left click to have Red go somewhere.For mobility-related issues, you have the option of keyboard/mouse OR a controller, and the game can realistically be played using real-time combat and the Turn() function or just through Turn(), though it is slightly harder, since the enemies will still attack outside of your Turn() actions.  Further, all keys can be rebound.Turn() basically pauses combat so that you can plan and execute an attack using 'movement points.'For overall accessibility, I give Transistor a 10/10.Subtitles & CaptionsTransistor starts with subtitles turned off, so make sure you enable them before playing.  As the game has no opening cinematics prior to the start menu, you will not miss any of the story.Subtitles appear at the top of the screen in very large, clear, outlined text.  No concerns with white-on-white or otherwise unreadable subtitles.  Further, subs are colored according to who is talking and images accompany the voices to indicate the speaker.  In scenes with multiple speakers, nobody is shown actually talking on screen, so there are no concerns with differentiating on-screen vs off-screen subtitles.Although I was confused when I first started playing, when you see off-white captions with no indication of the speaker, pay attention to the sword glowing.  Since Red has no voice, the sword is the speaker, and it acts as a narrator-in-being in the game, pushing the story along by talking to Red.Red actually uses the OVC terminals to talk back to the sword via typing, so you can consider that a shoutout to TTYs or using text/notepad on a smartphone to communicate.For its effective use of subtitles that leaves no confusion about the speaker or the story, I rate this category a 10/10.Chatting/CommunicatingTransistor is a single-player game.  No chatting or voice comms exist.No rating!			"

YouTube™ Video: Transistor: Impressions 

			Views: 335		

			Transistor: Impressions Transistor is Super Giant Game's 2nd game, and their first game being Bastion, it has a lot of live upto.		

The above is my impressions of the game. Transistor is Super Giant's 2nd game. The first one being Bastion, this game has big shoes to fill. Lucky for us, Transistor is every thing we expected from the creators of Bastion, with a few nuggets of surprise thrown in.Transistor, like Bastion, is a top down isometric RPG, that features amazing visuals and audio. Unlike Bastion, Transistor is a pseudo-Turn based RPG, the melds turn based mechanics with real time combat. The combat system overall feels familiar, but fresh, and original at the same time.I think it goes with out saying, that this game is gorgeous in every was possible. Amazing illustrations, backgrounds, composition, color pallet, and the sound design matches the visual in quality. It's just a top shelf experience that you won't find in other games.All this is great, but keep in mind that Transistor is fairly short, and there's not a lot of incentive to come back to the game other than the possibility that you'll like it enough for a 2nd play through. So for those who are feature, or length centric, consider this your warning. But do keep in mind, when approaching games like Transistor, you're not paying for the amount of game you get, but the quality of game you'll get to experience. Pros:- Incredible quality in visual and audio- Unique blend of game mechanics- Piles of attention to detail- An experience all gamer's should haveCons:- A little short- Very light on content			"

												Supergiant Games is back to challenge anybody who thinks this medium isn't ready to be called art.This is a beautiful, engrossing game. The oversaturated, colorful art style combined with the ethereal soundtrack provide an incredible feel for the game. The art is incredibly colorful, ranging from extremely warm to extremely cool, and it's all hand-painted. The ""cutscenes"" (if you can refer to them as that) are incredibly beautiful, and prompted me to take several screenshots in order to preserve them. Red's character design is excellent, and the enemy models and city are both really creative and interesting. A lot of cyberpunk art is cool, hard, metallic; you don't see that here. There's a lot of blur, a lot of soft edges, a ton of bloom. It's a game bursting with color.If you've read any of my other reviews, you already know that music and sound design play a big part in shaping the experience for me. This game has both in spades. The excellent soundtrack ranges from jazzy and uptempo, to soft and bluesy, to straight downtempo ambient. The sound design is utterly phenomenal. When paused, the game continues playing the background music, but at a slower tempo, and muffled, as if  it were being played inside a car next to you with all of the windows and doors sealed tightly. Click out of the game's window, and you get a very quiet, bassy hum in the background. I've got the game paused in another window as I type this review, and I feel the quiet bass rattling on and off in the cans even now. It's a really phenomenal effect. Whoever worked sound on this title definitely earned their wages. There's also an extremely simple, yet very likeable feature that causes Red to hum along to the background music merely by holding down a button. This is just as simple as it sounds, yet I found myself sitting for minutes on end with the left bumper on my controller compressed; mesmerized and staring into my screen as my focus slowly deteriorated.I feel like I'm floating in a hot tub while on drugs when I play Transistor. It's that kind of game.As someone with an overclocked 1440p display the lone criticism I have with the game is the lack of 1440p support, but this qualm is rendered moot by the fact that these are hand-painted designs. It's difficult to justify creating these designs with a 1440p resolution in mind considering how small of a userbase it is, so I can forgive Supergiant for locking the display at 1080p. That's what the art looks best at, and I experienced the game at this resolution in windowed mode.It has a voice acting schtick similar to the narrator in Bastion, though in Transistor it takes the form of a speaking sword rather than a narrator. So if you liked that kind of thing in Bastion, you'll like it here. The voice acting is very well-done, but it rubs me a bit wrongly; about half of the lines feel like they're jammed into the game in a very hamfisted manner. I seem to be the only one who felt that way about Bastion, though, so take this criticism of Transistor for what it's worth.The core gameplay is your basic isometric action RPG stuff with a couple of neat concepts thrown in. The ability to pause the game and plot out your next actions -- which happen extremely quickly and automatically once you unpause -- is a key aspect in what keeps the combat from becoming a bit stale. There were plenty of times when I felt I didn't have enough control over where my attacks were headed. Certain ""functions"", as the game calls your attacking skills, felt like they were a bit too hard to properly line up, and as a result I frequently missed some enemies I should have been hitting. But the nifty pausing function takes care of most of it, and it looks really cool. It makes you feel like the badass that Red is supposed to be.The other thing I really liked, and the thing that kept me playing most, was the ability to junction functions into each other in order to modify their actions. You have a set amount of function attack and actions and only four slots in which to place them. Each function has an active ability that becomes usable when placed, but they also have a specific modifying ability when junctioned into another active function. This all seems complicated when I write it out, but it's really fairly easy to understand in the game; no tutorial is really necessary after a few minutes of tinkering with it. The combinations are almost literally endless, and I found myself constantly resetting them in order to try new ones. It really adds some meat and some depth to a game that I felt would have easily succeeded on its artistic merits without these systems.In conclusion, I'd say this game is worth a few hours of play simply for the art style and the soundtrack. But the neat combat and function features here will keep you coming back for far longer than that. This is a very worthwhile experience and Supergiant Games continues to offer some really unique, polished, artistic gaming experiences.			"

												I feel like I just started this game and it's already over. Not because it was a magical journey full of adventure but because it was so short and I saw so little. Most of the gameplay was in the little sandbox area with the progressively more difficult challenges. Carries a lot of the more subtle aspects from Bastion (one chocolate velvet voice talks to you, similar artstyle and music, similar storytelling mechanics). The narration is a bit more creepy though since it's your sword talking and it's hitting on you, not even in an overtly hilarious machismo way either. Imagine swinging groose around as he yelled ""THE GROOSE IS LOOSE""  and other hilarious one liners while you pummeled your enemies. Also the protagonist needed to be more attractive. You can't depict a futuristic pop idol without making her look F-I-N-E, but the devs were probably ♥♥♥♥♥whipped into making her look normal as to not offend the types of idiots who get pissy at spiderman alt cover comics. Gameplay. Isometric hack and slash with an ever increasing number of attacks and methods for combining aspects of said attacks with others. Difficulty enables you to make the enemies arbitrarily more challenging to dispatch (rewarding you with more exp). This part was wonderful in that you weren't constantly just using the one newly acquired better-than-what-you-had-before weapon like in Bastion (you would pretty much never want to use the early weps end game but here they're still useful in tandem with other weapons). It's pretty good but there's an underlying tone that has me wanting to avoid starting this game up. Once it's going I naturally progress but just starting it is so trying.			"

												This is one of those games that you play with your heart, you feel the characters you feel the dev's hard work that they made in this incredible game, you just feel it.Transistor is the bastion successor as some said, and man i love both games.It is quite similar to bastion in a lot of aspects, but this game is more dark and relies on strategy and planning more than action and slashing ( bastion) A very beautiful heartbreaking teardropping story with an outstanding voice performance, honestly could not expect less from the same team that made Bastion with that amazing narrating style...I like that how in this game the narrator is talking with you, all the game staying by your-side, and the ending was .. lets just say i cried and no spoilers..Amazing graphics and artwork just look at that its like an animated master piece put together with codes to make it into the beautiful game it is now.... its like plugging your Keyboard+mouse or controller into a painting... very beautiful it moves me.This is the ONLY game in my entire steam library that i just HAD to buy the Soundtrack... it is so incredible i love it, i listen to it all the time while doing everything its so relaxing and soothing it made the game much more perfect it hit the roof.Amazing character designs each with its own background story that you keep playing to unlock, outstanding details all over it.Very unique 2-ways battle system, planning turns and using spells real-time.A great set of Abilities ( Functions ) that unlocks as you play and level up, each can be used as a main or inserted in another to upgrade it or used as a passive effect, and in each of those 3 it gets a different ability and status changes, it is really well-done  you can customize the functions to get the most of your abilities and to strategies your movements and make turns to kill the enemies.Like bastion this game can get harder ( in bastion you use Invokes in this game you use Limiters ) Giving more exp and making the game much harder, giving monsters perks and so on.Just circle around the screenshots on this page, and just look at them, the game's price is too low for this kind of art .... you go deep through it and experience it all as you play it is a very beautiful experience to have this game like my friend said "" You're in for a treat"" when i said i got the game, and boy as he so rightTL;DRAn outstanding Action adventure with perfect atmospheres and soundtracks and customize able abilities set that grows bigger as you play and more advanced, with great strategy battle system and a very challenging gameplayPros : 1 - Perfect soundtracks and atmosphere 10/10.2 - A very beautiful story and narrator style 9/10.3 - A set of abilities that can be customized and set as upgrades of passive effects with in-depth planning 10/104 - Beautiful artwork and character designs and backgrounds 10/105 - Unique game-play and unlockables all over the game with good achievements 9/106 - Many called this short game but it took me 7 hours to finish the game with 36% achievements, and it will take another 7 hours to get the NG+ and other unlockables.Cons : 1 - Not a con in the game itself but in the gamers, no i'm not offending them at all no, its just many assumed that the game's story is deluded, But it can be explained a lot by unlocking the characters background stories and reading them, just listen and read and you will understand a lot and it has some plot-twists that left for the gamer to find out.2 - Several friends had some performance issues and complained that the game does not have any graphics settings just resolution, i kinda agree although i had no problems with a low-end laptop but i can see their point.If you liked bastion i highly recommend this game.This game's story is darker than bastion, and you need to unlock stuff to figure out the missing pieces and put them together to get it all as a whole picture.I am really glad i picked this game, had a wonderful time playing it over-all rating 9/10			"

You might like if: You enjoyed, not only the gameplay, but the story and experience of Bastion (Supergiant Games' much acclaimed title before this one). I'd recommend checking that one out first if you haven't.This is an artistic experience more than a game.I know, I know... what the heck does that even mean...Transistor's strength lies in the way the story unfolds. The plot (and its twists) are excellent, the characters brilliantly designed and the visuals are outstanding (pretty much what we've come to expect from Supergiant games after Bastion). The combat is clever and good fun... but not ultimately what you keep coming back for.And therein lies the one downside... the story is a bit short. It's not the fastest game to get into, and by the time you're hooked and going ""hey, y'know what... this is getting pretty good"" - It's actually drawing to a close. Slight shame, but still 10 very worthwhile hours (There is technically newgame+, but that has less appeal for me)On the plus-side, at least the enemies also get stronger in NG+, so it's not like Bastion where you replay and just stomp everything flat with super-powered weapons. If you like the combat and challenge, that at least continues to deliver through the second iteration.The combat itself is refreshingly unique. It's essentially about using Fallout-esque 'planning' time to compile devestating combos - combining strategy to an otherwise innocuous hack-and-slash. Throughout the game you acquire 'functions' which can basically be applied in one of three ways... as a 'move', to provide an added-effect to a move, or to apply a passive bonus. Bear in mind, you can only apply a function once and are limited to how many are in play - so there's a lot of variety to be had. You're encouraged to try out different combos (by unlocking backstory as you do) and the game is thankfully forgiving enough to let you experiment (i.e. there is no single 'correct' combo). It's fun enough but, as mentioned before, only goes so far in keeping the game interesting.The gem is really the narrator again. Combining authorititive guidance with human touches of humour, emotion and vulnerability; it adds warmth to an otherwise (intentionally) structured, robotic setting. The part where he's spaced out is particularly entertaining (I lost it at ""hey... that's not a bike..."" and was too busy chuckling to realise I was dangerously low on HP).If you enjoyed the experience of Bastion (not just the gameplay) - This should be well worth checking out			"

												So, the most asked question first - Is this Bastion 2? Absolutely not!Transistor has a few things in common with Bastion - Great voiceover, compelling world and story that reveals itself through the narrative, the solitude of the main character, interesting art style and unique enemies and the combat is similar (yet at the same time completely different).Transistor is beautiful (if you like this animation style), the music of the game is simply fantastic and the story flows well towards the inevitable conclution. The fighting is innovative and clever and makes you want to try out all the combinations.The game is not without flaws though - it is highly linear and constantly pushes you through the quite short story arc. Exploration is not really present so if you want to rush through the game you can do so quite fast.Is the game worth buying? Yes! Especially for the price point of this game I highly recommend it!

												Transistor is a game developed by Supergiant Games, who are well known for their stylistic action game Bastion.  Transistor definitely borrows from Bastion's strongest suits; notably it is brilliantly compsed and absolutely beautiful.  The story is extremely esoteric (certainly moreso than Bastion), but not unsatisifying.  Where it differs from Bastion is mostly in gameplay; Transistor still is still an action/RPG where you traverse levels, attack bad guys, and level up, but the game plays much slower almost as a strategy game would.  Enemy encounters are isolated and you can use a ""Turn"" to essentially stop time and plan out your attacks, which will then carry out in nearly zero time.  Just like Bastion, you're offered a plethora of ways to deal with enemies.  Instead of weapons, you use ""functions"", which are essentially castable spells and abilities   Each ability can combo with other abilities to alter them, or can be used in a passive slot to provide a permanent buff.  The result is an insane amount of combinations, and you are incentivied to explore them because using abilities in different ways unlocks more information about the story and the characters which are a part of it.  In Bastion I found myself finding a weapon that I really liked and sticking with it for the rest of the game (even though many weapons are equally viable).  The story mechanic in Transistor subtlely pushes you to try different combinations, and in doing so, you often stumble into even better combinations that you probably wouldn't have realized existed otherwise.All in all, I highly recommend Transistor.  Most fans of Bastion should enjoy it -- although the amazing art and music is immediately noticable, it is definitely a slower burn in terms of gameplay and the early parts of the game take a little while to get into.  As more abilities and the true nature of the game unveils itself though, it is very well executed and an absolute joy.			"

												This game surprised me to hell and back. Seriously.Word of Note: At the time of writing, I have not beaten the game. This ""Review"" is more of a ""First Impressions"" than a proper review, so please keep in mind that the game may have a few more surprises down the line that may completely change the gameplay or atleast alter it drastically! Review will be updated accordingly after I beat the game if anything new pops up. *I also won't summarize the Premise of the Game's Story as the game itself starts you out completely in the Blank and shows you what happened. Visual-wise, pretty dang amazing, albeit a few scaling issues with buildings and such. This game is the epitome of low-poly modeling and hand painted textures. The enemy models and landscapes are very simple looking as far as modeling goes, but the assets/textures used on everything gives the world life even if the places are deserted, it invokes a tone of lonelyness and helps you figure out somewhat, what exactly happened that there's not a single soul around. When Red moves around and drags the Transistor (Sword) it leaves a trail on the ground that disappears shortly after, but helps mark direction, additionally, some moves can leave holes in the ground depending, and won't disappear until it's replaced by the same ""break' textures elsewhere. Enemies themselves are presented as robotic creatures and are reminiscent of Kingdom Heart's Nobodies in that same way - as creatures sent to hunt your player character, but are mindless in nature. The Soundtrack is also quite a treat! Boasting pretty impressive Lyrical compositions that gives it a bit of a Noire feeling and are pretty well varied. Additionally, Red can hum alongside any given track, effectively making a sort of ""remix"" to that particular song. Soundwork is also pretty well done, the Transistor does it's charging noises, it clings and clangs when slamed unto the ground, there's a subtle noise for steps, for the trail the sword leaves and enemies make their odd creature like noises when they're going after you. Voices are also excellently done. Red doesn't speak, but you can hear her sing in some flashbacks, the Transistor also serves as a sort of narrator to help divulge neat little extras. Something the game does, that I really dig, is that the way he speaks to Red, sort of feels like he's talking to the player aswell, giving it a 4th wall kinda feeling. It's all amazing.The game also fares pretty well, if a little slow and methodical. This is the part that may make or break the game for a lot of people, for sure. Red moves VERY slow, it's done on purpose though, as areas in general are subdivided via ""zones"" and they aren't very large in scale either. The game's Battle Structuring is simple, but feels a tad linear in execution (atleast at the start) where enemies ambush you in certain parts of a Zone but won't respawn after a battle ends and you walk back into the area.Combat is where the gameplay really shines. The battles play out sort of like Crisis Core, once you enter combat mode, you're trapped inside the zone until enemies are defeated. Enemies will be mercilessly going after you, and you have just the one Health Bar to tide you over the entire battle, if your health bar depletes, you will lose a ""Function"" instead of dying. During combat, your attacks depend solely on the Functions you have picked out and set up. Each function, obtained either through finding people that died or leveling has multiple functions. This gives the game a LOT of depth as far as building your character goes. You have 4 main slots to assign a Function too, and those slots have 2 extra slots that you can assign more functions to to power up that function - * * * example: You can have a function that shoots out grenade like particles in an area, you have another function that, by itself, creates a bomb in place that needs to be self detonated, however, you can add that function to the previously mentioned function to add, let's say explosive attributes which come via the way of damage buffs, range buffs, etc * * * You can continously build more and more powerful functions to use to kill your foes, move faster, avoid attacks while dealing damage, etc, there's I believe, TONS of ways to build the character you want and fight the way you want. When fighting, the Combat Areas have little grey squares, these serve as your main method of avoiding attacks. You can destroy these squares yourself or the enemy can. During Major Boss battles, this is very important to keep track of, as bosses can deal a TON of damage and are very patternized. You also have the ""Turn"" Command, which freezes the entire battle field and let's you plan out attacks ahead of time, this can also be used to avoid attacks. The Turn command works via a queing system - Imagine you have a time slider and you're editing it with the stuff you want Red to do, wether it is move away or closer to an enemy, use specific Functions to continously attack an enemy, avoid an enemy, or both. It is, however, not 100% accurate, as while you're in turn mode you continously set Red to Attack the enemy in a specific area, but the enemy CAN still move when combat resumes and avoid your attacks, thus giving the combat a ton of strategic aspects to it. Turn mode is balanced due to the way you're forced to wait until the turn slider returns to normal, when you deplete the Turn Bar, you CANNOT attack or use any function, so keep that in mind always, and don't use Turn Mode haphazardly as it can leave you VERY vulnerable after usage.Pros:+Amazing Soundtrack+Amazing Hand Painted/Digital looking world+Amazing looking Particle effects to compliment the already awesome looking world+Expansive and Deep ""Functions"" System+Amazing Voice Work and Sound Effects.+Surprisingly deep combat with a large strategic element to it.+Communicates it's Atmosphere amazingly.+Great enemy designs help the atmosphere even further.+Surprisingly well designed and written Main Character. Cons-Minor Scaling issues with Buildings and structures-Red moves a little methodical and slow-Combat Structure feels a little linear (At time of Writing)			"

This review is created for  My Curation Page.  Skip to the bottom for my Final ThoughtsTransistor is an isometric hack and slash RPG from the creators of Bastion. You play as a famous singer who lost her voice, and it's all the Process' fault.GraphicsTransistor is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played to date. Everything in the game feels so... alive... Everything is hand painted and looks spectacular, you can really feel the artist's motivation and power. The cutscenes are amazingly well done and really helps you connect with Red, the main character. Everything from the enemies, levels, and even ambient background objects are incredibly detailed. Kudos to the artist(s) for the job well done.Audio & SoundtrackOne of the featured tags on Transistor's store page is Great Soundtrack, and, well, it does indeed have a great soundtrack. Actually, scratch that. It has an incredible soundtrack unmatched by other indie titles. You are Red, a famous singer that actually sings in the soundtrack. The soundtrack is mesmerizing, and the singer for Red did a fabulous job. Sometimes you just have to take a moment and listen to the breathtaking tracks. The voice acting for the Transistor is marvelous as well. You can really hear the passion in the voice of a sentient sword. My favourite line spoken by the Transistor is ""Don't let me go"". The voice actor has a lot of meaning and soft power behind his lines.My only problem with the soundtrack is they didn't use the amazing vocals of Red enough, which makes since if you tie it in with the story.Favourite Track: In CirclesStorylineTransistor is very story rich and deep. You play as Red, a once famous singer with a vengeance against those who stripped her of her beautiful singing voice, and, as I mentioned previously, one that you can actually hear in the soundtrack. You are accompanied by Transistor, a sword that embodies you with the power of a thousand suns as you rain hellfire upon those who wronged you. The cutscenes and news stories supply the perfect amount of exposition for you to understand just what is going on, what happened to Red, and why you have to take your sweet, sweet revenge. GameplayI love the combat in Transistor. You can choose between turn based combat and real time hack and slash. You can carefully plan out your moves in the turn based combat system but you can also fully enjoy your power in the hack and slash mode. You can change out each ability and you can also modify them. There are endless possibilities you can use to exact your revenge. There is a lot of strategy that goes into Transistor. The turn based combat system has a cooldown that leaves you vulnerable to enemies. You have to plan out what abilities and modifiers you use to exploit your enemies weaknesses. Everything, including the realtime hack and slash, has to be planned out in a way that keeps you entertained.Final ThoughtsTransistor is one of my favourite indie games ever with an amazing soundtrack that is incredibly moving. Seriously. Listen to In Circles, which is the best track in my humble opinion. If you enjoy turn based combat, real time hack and slash, deep storylines, and extreme customization, Transistor is definitely for you.Rating:Graphics: 9.2/10Audio: 9.7/10Gameplay: 8.9/10Overall: 9.3/10Enjoy the review?

												Transistor...The next perfect game by Supergiant Games.This time the developers put some more effort into the gameplay than in the story I personally think, but that's no problem at all! Maybe I shouldn't even compare Bastion and Transistor because Supergiant Games might wanted do something different... Anyways. You start right away in middle of the game and the story. The setting is a Sci-Fi world, more precisely I guess it's something like an online world.In Transistor you experience the story chronologically. In the beginning there are some minor gaps, which get filled soon. The story catches you and you want to know what happens next. Nevertheless, to be honest I have to say that I liked the story of Bastion better but the story of this game is not bad at all!The gameplay is quite cool. Transistor's gameplay contain some nice features that underline the story and the atmosphere. That includes electing something on a terminal or some breaks for the protagonist. These breaks are implemented as beautiful pictures.What I liked the most is the combat system.Time to time you get more attacks and can combine these like you want. This mixing provides a great variety to fighting in Transistor. Also, there is a ""plan mode"" in which you can plan moves and then perform then fast. That looks very cool and is fun too.Lastly, you can, as well as in Bastion, increase the difficulty on your own.Supergiant Games games always catch you with their atmosphere so I didn't write anything about the atmosphere here.Okay, I can not write this review without mentioning Darren Korb and his great job on composing marvellous songs for this game. The music matches perfectly to the game and is an essential part of it, just like in Bastion.I come to the conclusion that Transistor is another awesome game by Supergiant Games. It's a perfect game that doesn't need improvements at all! If you liked Bastion or you want to play something different but brilliant buy Transistor now!			"

												Wonderful game. Very nicely done.Never played the previous game ""Bastion"", but after playing this I may have to pick it up, too.Well in this game you are controlling Red. Explore the cloudbank and fight against evil process using functions. You can and have to combine your various functions to get the best from your character.Story is not too hard, the first level are challenging, because you don't have many functions. You can even start a NG+ to start over with more functions.During your visit, you can do some ""tests"". Basicly they are challenges to teach you a better way to use your abilities. They are easy, except the performance tests. If you want to 100% the game you will need some time to practice those :DCan recommend it to everybody. Oh and almost forget: The soundtrack is awesome.

												Oh, Transistor. I went into this game assuming it was, like so many have said, a mere 6 hour jaunt. The impression often given is that that's all there is to Transistor; sure, it's visually and musically stunning, and its narrative is engaging, but ultimately many will say that 6 hours (give or take an hour) is all there is to it. I disagree, and not just because subjective, arbitrarily determined gameplay durations are generally a poor gauge of quality game content in the first place.My first playthrough took me about 11 hours, 12 if you count my various AFK'ing and tabbing out pauses. However, I didn't just play through the story from start to finish. I completed the extra challenge ""tests"" that introduced me to abilities I may not have realized were useful otherwise; I explored every area, read news terminals, and unlocked some of the additional ""function"" (ability) file details. All of these served to greatly expand my understanding of the game's setting and characters. It is this that gets me to the point of my review. There is more to Transistor than just the story that's on the surface. Just getting to the ""end"" of the game will not give you an explicit understanding of its story.Meticulously placed throughout the beautiful environments, the well-voiced dialogue, the amazing music -- even some of the function names -- are subtle hints, easter eggs, and pointers to details about the game's setting, story and characters that are often not addressed directly anywhere else. This game is very much about (subtly) showing you, NOT outright telling you. Days after I had first beaten the game, I was still going through my screenshots, still pondering the meaning behind some of the music's lyrics, and still reading others' interpretations. This was all in an attempt to absorb more of what the game has to offer, to gain even more insight into perhaps the best, most enjoyable and satisfying aspect of the game for me -- what was NOT said, what was NOT blatantly pointed out, and was instead left there for me to find on my own or to speculate about later. And my second playthrough... well. I don't think I've ever jumped right back into a game for a new playthrough so soon after finishing it. And then even the fact that the game's ""new game+"" option was instead referred to as a ""recursion"" turned out to have some significance.So yes, the game's art style is gorgeous. Its soundtrack is one of the best game soundtracks I've ever listened to. Its combat system is intricate and greatly rewards planning ahead and experimenting. It is all of these things, and you can go through a straight start-to-finish playthrough and enjoy every bit of that. But if you're the type of player who likes to ask a lot of questions about the specifics of a game's plot or characters, who isn't always merely satisfied with the obvious, and who appreciates a game that lets you connect some of the dots on your own, you'll very likely get even more out of Transistor than you thought you would. P.S.: Yes, the soundtrack is absolutely worth purchasing. Do it!			"

												You're probably aware that this is a beautiful game (nobody reads reviews before watching the trailer, right?), and it is BEAUTIFUL, the art and the songs. I see that most reviewers mention that and that the story is cool, but not so many people emphasize this enough:This is one of the best combat systems you'll find aroundDuring combat you use your skills (therein called ""functions""), run around and etc... but you also have a ""turn bar"" that when fills up, allows you to ""pause"" the fight; it sort of allows you to ""script"" what you're going to do next. You have a certain number of ""turn points"" to spend on using skills and moving around. Once you're done, you ""unpause"" and your character will ""run the script"".That idea in itself is worth the game, really. But there is more.The skills are AWESOME. There are 16 ""only"", but they are VERY DIFFERENT. ""Bounce"" hits the target and ricochets around; ""Breach"" has a long range and pierces the target and walls. ""Crash"" causes little damage, but stuns the target, which increases the next damage; ""Void"" does not cause any damage, but increase the damage for the next few seconds. Now, these are their Active function; skills can be used in Passive mode as well - which give you some bonus or protection - or be Combined (in the game its called ""upgrade"") e.g. Breach + (Bounce + Crash) will pierce through targets in a straight line, but also ricochet and stun. Mind you, Bounce + (Breach + Crash) is not the same thing, nor is Crash + (Breach +  Bounce).The combinations and possibilities for combos are so overhelming that I've finished the game twice and never settled down for one single combo line, always changing. The combat system is just plain amazing.Finally, another reason to buy this game: it is a Supergiant Game. These guys are one of the best small studio I've seen around, professional products released in mature state, also customer support was great when I needed. Back these guys as much as you can, they deserve it.			"

												The Transistor is a story about love, melancholy and genuine grief. It's about a man and a woman who are in love, and who readily sacrifice for their feelings. This is immensely appealing. If you are looking for an escape to a dark and gloomy world, which can suprisingly be also dangerously calm and rumanitive, then you might have just found your thing. Highly recommended. 4/5			"

												Transistor is a good game, and it is worth playing. I beat it in around ~5 hours.It is truly beautiful, both for the ears, and for the eyes. It really sucks you into a fantastic looking world, that leaves you silently thinking back on it once you've finished it. Artistically, the game is amazing.However, the combat is just average. It's interesting, and kind of unique, mixing real time combat with some turn based element (being able to freeze everything to plan a move), but it gets repetitive, as the enemies don't feel that varied, and you end up mostly running in circles while your action bar is recharging. Also, you often have to wait a few seconds extra after each fight is done just so one of your skills comes off cool down, so that you can grab the monster EXP that's shield protected. If there were more fights like the final boss, it would feel more rewarding to play it.The story is vaguely interesting, and unique - but not thrilling. I feel that if the combat and story were just a bit better, the game would be a masterpiece, instead of simply being a good game.Still, Transistor is a unique experience that is worth living :steamhappy:			"

												This game is sick, I personally enjoyed it.  Graphics, gameplay, controls are very good.  I would rate the game 9/10 because its kinda short, 4-5 hours but if you play the extra challenges and go for a second run then it will be more hours, no duhhh.Like the idea of mixing your power up perks, not really a based turn game in a way.  You got limited mobility (dont get me wrong you can still move, but when planning your attack you have limited time) which you should take advantage and plan your attack, you cant spam your power ups.  Each power up has different abilities, it can serve straight up as a power up or serve as an attachment or as a passive perk.  Mixing your power ups is part of the fun, you can become badass if you used them well.  ""With power, comes great responsibility.""Overall game is very balance, kinda short (hoping future DLC can change that), OST is amazing, graphics are great.  Final rating 9/10, would highly recommend.			"

												Transistor is one of those few games that feel unique. The last few years I have only got this feeling from two games, the first one was The Banner Saga, and now Transistor. This is a game that when I sit down playing it I don't wanna stop, but I dont really want to continue either, because i'm thinking: The game is probably quite short.However, for this story the amount of time was perfect, not to short and definitely not to long. This is a very interesting RPG-game with a deep love story, in a city where very weird things are going on. I must say that at first I was very confused, but the longer I played it the longer I was drawn into the story and into the world of Transistor. Together with the exellent art-style and magnificent soundtrack this game made made me more immersed than what I usually get in games, atleast since I got older. I remember that I as a kid more often got this feeling, the feeling I got from Banner saga and now Transistor. I guess that is because I get used to it, to the way games play and the way a gaming story most often adapts. Romance or more rather love is a huge part of the story, or it basically is and I don't feel many games use that as their spine. More games should, since it's a powerful tool to usurp our feelings. I want my feelings to get usurped by games, I really do. This game has two main characters, one is Red, a strong female character who are fighting to get back her voice, which was stolen from her by Camerata, which is a group you don't know much about, but their intentions were at first good, but power might have corrupted them. The other protagonist is ""the"" Transistor, the weapon Red uses. who throughout the game is trying to help you as much as possible. The fighting is very interesting, as you play you will find more and more moves, or attacks that you can use during these fights. You can fight as time goes, or you can enter this... ""V.A.T.S"" system (If you know Fallout 3 & NV) where you get to plan your moves ahead of you and then fire them all at once without the enemy having the time to respond. However that leads to a cooldown so you can't attack for a few seconds after. I found this system very usable at times, but mostly I tend to... forget it? Or maybe I just don't appriciate it enough. It has helped me sure, but I want to kill the enemy ""myself"" If that makes sence. Whenever you get beaten enough you'll lose some attacks, which will return later on when another cooldown has counted down to zero. The most interesting part with the attacks are that you can put them together, you can strenghen one by adding the others, that however cost a few points so at the same time you have to look at a bar that show you how much points you've spend on this. While leveling up you can choose to increase that bar, or add another support slot for your weapon, etc. I would dearly recommend this game to anyone who would like to try something different, but still very beautiful and worthwhile.

												Got it on fall sale. This game is very good, it's the same developer who created bastion years ago. But the gameplay is very different. You need to plan your move and then execute them, Bastion is basically hack and slash, so if you are expecting bastion-ish game here, I don't think it has that similarity in core-gameplaypro:- great music- great voice acting- great environtment- great battle systemcon:- i don't get the story.. it's more surreal than bastion, sci-fi fantasy thing that I don't understand the time and place- short.. really short if you see my playtime, I've been idle for like 10 hours, so only ~8 hours of playing. I wished they add place as HQ and we could choose place to add replay factor- too linear. you play FFXIII? the gameplay is similar before you reach grand pulse, just beat those things and move forwardthe dev implement challenge that somehow reminds me with bastion, the game doesn't ask you to play easy, normal hard like other games, but they give you perks to you could choose to boost your exp but make the gameplay harder.spoiler:I like part of the game that the ending scene is similar to beginning scene! reminds me of brother tale of two sons I recommended this game, better to wait when it's 50% off. It's winter sale when I'm writing this			"

												Transistor is a smart action-RPG gameplay that uses your intelligence and tactics of how you play, fight and move on the battlefield when the enemies spawn. If you played Bastion, then you will find that this game visual graphic will be similar of it’s heavily influenced by the expressive character design of classic anime. Its a very beautiful visual art for a science fiction world. Music is absolutely beautiful with its Jazz smooth feeling. If you have bought the Soundtrack, don't listen to it 1st before playing the game as you might ruin your experience when going though the game. The story is also very interesting as you play as ""Red"" who lost her voice and its up to you to get it back. The game has a lot of replay value with New Game+ as when in combat, you get to experiment of how you will take to the field. Lving up will get you to choose different abilities and at one point the ability to fully respec your character at any checkpoint.			"

												The first playthrough for me took about 7.3 hours, despite the fact that I skipped the last challenge room. The whole atmosphere constructed by the art and soundtrack is very immersive. The whole story came together beautifully.Gameplay:	It's an interesting take on giving players a choice between etiher real-time womanliness combat (which I'm not woman enough to do) or ""halting time"" so you can plan out a series of executions (use a skill, move, use a skill, use a skill, move, etc.), and even a mix of both. Have to admit though, the controls on the keyboard aren't too great, and while it isn't a huge issue, I am more inclinded to use the plan-it-out option in fights just to make sure I hit the right things.Art:What can I say? It's beautiful. It's breathtaking. It looks like it was a hell-of-lot of work to do, so kudos to the art team. It's really amazing.Soundtrack:For me, the fantastic song ""We All Become"" featured in the reveal trailer stands out the most. Yet, it and every soundtrack/song mixed into the Transistor experience are all really, really well done.Storyline/Immersion:I have yet to complete the storyline, but the whole game comes together well. The world is given life and the characters given silent voices. While the story isn't told in a straightforward manner, having the player piece it together on her/his own is a nice variation.Transistor is a phenomal work of art that everyone should experience. 10/10.

												The age-old argument as to whether games can be justly referred to as art has already been won, and any gamer would defend the industry in that respect. However, it's always nice to see games release that further enforce that ideal, and no other game released in 2014 embraces that ideal more than Transistor. Supergiant hit it out of the park with this title, and once again proved that games can be more than just pure entertainment. They can challenge us intellectually and philosophically. They can inspire spiritual debates, and even make us question our own existence as much as any other medium can, and in some cases, even more so.On its surface, Transistor is a game about survival and revenge. Surviving the coming onslaught of the Process, a mindless virus destroying the virtual world of Cloudbank, and avenging the loss of your voice, not to mention the death of your one true love. Peel back that layer however, and just like any other great work of art, there are many more layers to be discovered. The depth and careful attention to detail in this masterpiece is there for those who pay attention, and if they do, they will experience something truly spectacular that will change the way they approach video games in the future.As the name suggests, Cloudbank is a virtual city, one ruled by its citizens. Just like any other city, there are scientists, musicians, artists, and sports players. All significant decisions that affect the citizens are put to a vote at kiosks. Changes in aesthetics, buildings, weather, even the color of the sky itself, are all decided in this manner. This is an issue for a handful of usurpers scheming in the shadows however, claiming with conviction, that when everything changes, nothing changes.You play as Red, a famous musician in Cloudbank, who unfortunately for her, is also a popular voice in the social hierarchy of the city. It seems that there is a group of people who are unhappy with the current state of Cloudbank, and they want to change it, by resetting it. The Camerata, as they call themselves, seek out the popular voices to assimilate them into a Transistor so that they can give the citizens what they don't even know they want. This will be useful once the Process finishes destroying the current version of the city, and the Camerata take control of version 2.0. Of course, this brings about interesting questions concerning what the collective thinks versus the individual, and the merits of socialism.The Camerata's plans hit a snag when Red's lover sacrifices himself to protect her, which results in the terrorist group losing the Transistor. Thus, the primary weapon of the enemy becomes a tool of self expression for Red, something a mute desperately needs. With it, Red is able to collect the consciousness of citizens who have already fallen victim to the Process, and unlock Functions for her to use to protect herself from the same fate.These Functions are the foundation of the attack system. Each one has a primary attack, secondary attack, and a passive attribute to be strategically utilized in battle. Combining them in different ways provides you with an almost unlimited amount of customized attacks at your disposal. Experimenting with these Functions feels like a practice in programming, with the names mimicking those in existing development frameworks. The attacks can be triggered in real time easily enough, but the real fun is entering a Turn state, which essentially pauses the action long enough for you to plan out your moves in advance, and then ending the Turn state will allow you to watch them play out. One of my absolute favorite functions provides a passive ability that gives you a small chance to evolve into a 'Super User' when entering a Turn state. If this occurs, you can basically nuke the Process into oblivion, de-rezzing them TRON style. The developers encourage you to try out as many combinations as possible by unlocking more background information on the citizens of Cloudbank for using the Functions in different ways.You will have plenty of opportunities to research these Functions by locating a 'Back Door', which grants you access to an administrative area of Cloudbank, which is full of challenges for you to complete. I recommend you take the time to complete these, since they will improve your skills exponentially. Practice makes perfect, and you can never have too much of it. You can also listen to Transistor's soundtrack here, which is absolutely brilliant, and I cannot stress that enough.As great as the primary game mechanics are, the little details are what makes Transistor really shine. The commentary from your lover coming from the Transistor, for example. Character development is hard enough, but when the protagonist is mute, it's even harder. Supergiant did a fantastic job of pulling it off nonetheless. There's a flourish control that makes Red throw the Transistor up into the air and catch it before coming back down, which serves no purpose except for looking cool. You can also stop what you're doing at anytime and hum, which allows Red to dance with her lover's new shell and hum to the tune of the soundtrack currently playing. The backgrounds you unlock by experimenting with the Functions give you details on the lost citizens of Cloudbank, some of which are subtly implied to be LGBT is some way, which is not central to the story, and is entirely optional. It's nice that these kinds of details were considered, and every game would improve with such features.Transistor never overstays it's welcome, and if the first playthrough wasn't enough time to spend in this amazing world, a game+ mode is available as well as difficulty modifiers similar to those found in Bastion, providing plenty of excuses to return to Cloudbank.The story takes multiple turns before you reach the climax, which will hit you square in the gut to great effect. All the while exploring themes such as socialism, religion, death, love, revenge, sacrifice, and the afterlife in a postmodern cyberpunk setting. College level dissertations can be written using Transistor as a focal point, and that is an incredible accomplishment by the developers. Every time you play this game you'll discover a new layer you may have missed the last time through. Everything about this game is subtle, the story, the characters, and the themes, allowing the players to decide what to take away from their time in this world. It never feels as if Supergiant is using Transistor as a soapbox to shove their own agendas down our throats, which games this deep tend to do.Not only is Transistor one of my favorite games of all time, I would go as far as to say it is my personal pick for Independent Game of the Year, if not decade. I would have gladly paid three times what they are charging for this game without regret, so if you're on the fence about spending $20, don't be. The soundtrack is also available on Steam for $10, which is easily worth it. The tracks carry some emotional weight though, so the developers have explicitly stated that experiencing them in the game first is ideal, and I would have to agree.			"

												I guess I might as well make the inevitable comparisons to Bastion first. It doesn't (and couldn't) have the ""amazing thing out of nowhere"" quality of Bastion. But the art direction, narration, and setting of Transistor are more to my taste.The story has a cryptic in medias res presentation and requires a lot of digging to uncover and properly arrange what is actually going on, but that was OK with me.I also was happy trying out tons of different loadouts and combinations of the combat powers -- the motivation of unlocking story/background bits, and tackling the different challenge rooms, was enough to push me into that experimental approach. And I think that made for a more enjoyable playthrough. Transistor strikes me as being a little analogous to Bioshock in that way; it's tempting to just wrench and electrobolt your way through Bioshock, and you couldn't really be blamed for doing that, but you might have had more fun intentionally trying other weapons/plasmids.Transistor definitely is flawed as a combat-heavy game with nuanced but poorly tutorialized mechanics that are also hard to visually ""read"", so I imagine many people will bounce off of it. For various reasons I stuck with it though and ended up having a very good time. I even fired up NG+ immediately and played about halfway through it again. It's a beautiful game that attempts some interesting things, and I'm glad I played it.			"

												A brilliant, immersive, tactical game with a neat story that gives you a kick in the feels every now and then. One of the best aspects of the game is its soundtrack; it, along with the use of colours in the game's mesmerizing aesthetic, serves you an experience you may forget in time, but you will never forget how it made you feel. Hell yes recommended.			"

												A stylish, smart, and sexy game from start to finish.The game begins by tantalizing you with a bit of it's story, and drags you in and doesn't let you go, being vague but telling you what you need to know to get you thinking. Every moment of playing Transistor I was wondering where it would take me next, and I was never disappointed by what followed my anticipation. It has a very intereting take on a futuristic politics landscape, and has very well-thought out characters and developement.The combat is fluid and tactical, while somehow having an elegance about it. It utilizes such simple mechanics, however that does't mean it won't push your understanding of these mechanics to the limit as the difficulty definitely does ramp up as the game proceeds. The game will follow exactly what you want, and it is all up to your skill and cunning to successfully defeat all foes that come your way. The game mixes many genres but with flawless results as you level up and collect new abilities and powers a la an RPG, while you switch into turn-based strategy, and then into a fast-paced action game. The game keeps you on your toes and always tries to throw something new at you, but never going overboard and bringing you a challenge that is impassible.However the show-stopping point of this game, as similar to other Supergiant success, Bastion, is the art direction. The voice over by Logan Cunningham, and the tunes sung by Ashley Lynn Barrett seal the deal of the package as they drive home the emotion, setting, and character of the game without eveer seeming forced or clunky. The look of Transistor is sleek and futuristic and as you delve deeper into the story the surroundings transition perfectly. Near the conclusion of the game you return to where you had started but the setting has changed drastically,  and the score has been remixed. This point really displayed the kind of talent the creators have, and how powerful an indie developer can be.Transistor is a marvel to look at, a blast to play, and has a story dripping in charm and intrigue. If you were a fan of Bastion, it will not disappoint you, and I highly reccomend it.			"

												A gorgeous and fairly short adventure that is probably more enjoyable on a second playthrough once you fully understand the mechanics and world that the game exhibits. By the time I properly had a grasp on the combat and began to learn its ins-and-outs, I was only a couple hours off from the ending. I also didn't do many of the optional challenge rooms, as I figured I should save them for a second or third playthrough. Through a fantastic use of colour, light and music, Transistor's aesthetics wonderfully inform its narrative for a climactic and bittersweet final chapter that made my opinion of the game increase dramatically. I bought this on sale for $5 and certainly do not regret it. It's great to see games that not only have a good story and good gameplay, but can combine the two effortlessly for an interactive experience.			"

Posted: May 25, 2014
												I was looking forward to this game for a long time, and have a lot to say about it, but I'll do a super TL;DR list precursor.PROS:+Amazing artwork+Particular songs of the soundtrack+Interesting upgrade systemCONS:-Plothole laden story-Combat-Short-Repetitive-Crashes-BugsFrom this point on, spoilers will be present.Transistor is something of a tactical RPG by Supergiant Games. The player is thrust into a vague situation as the famous singer Red, whom has had her voice ""stolen"" from her, as she removes a sword-like object from a corpse. It's insinuated that you knew this person, Mr. Nobody, and they protected you. The sword acts as the narrator of the story and as the majority of the player's insight into the world.Red uses the sword, the titular ""Transistor"", to fight off mysterious white invaders known as ""The Process"". The sword begins with a few attacks and has the ability to stop time (called ""turn) to plan attacks, and then execute the qued attacks. This can only be done once every few seconds, depending on how many actions were lined up, and this is the main method of playing. The player can attack outside of combat when they aren't regenerating their ""turn"" ability or when an ability is upgraded with a specific augment, but it's very slow and inaccurate. There's a multitude of skills (called ""functions""- 18 in total) which can also be used to augment other skills or Red herself. Functions are multi-purpose: not only do they act as Red's skills system, but they also unlock fragments of backstory for the game while using them in one of the three different capacities (ability, ability upgrade, personal upgrade), but the backstories are focused on the person related to the ability.The skill system is very interesting and can lead to some creative builds, but ultimately the goal is still to do gross amounts of damage, and there's only a handful of skills that will help you reach those levels. While many of these functions have interesting properties and uses, Transistor's combat doesn't really lend to using some of them more than once to unlock background story. An example of this is the function ""Get"", which pulls an enemy toward you. Due to the nature of combat, Get often is redundant or, at worst, a detriment. When executing a turn, time isn't stopped anymore- it's slowed. Faster creatures will begin to move away from your planned abilities and Get can sometimes miss or pull the wrong one. This doesn't require faster enemies to mess up, either, as the game's readout of potential damage often is misleading. When stacking attacks, the game will caculate how much damage will occur to enemies. Often it'll drop out enemies if there's too much information on the screen, but it also poorly handles damage over time and momentum knocking enemies out of range. Some monsters, like Jerk 3.0's, are able to rotate so quickly that by the time you're done buffing and debuffing, they have rotated and you can no longer backstab. This is frustrating considering that the two most simple solutions are: A, stop time entirely for the turn function, or B, remove the damage readout.Despite being flawed on many fronts on its own, the mediocre combat isn't the only thing to blame. Enemies in Transistor focus on ten different enemies. These enemies start out basic, and get ""upgrades"" as the player continues through the story. These upgrades are denoted by a 2.0 or higher designation beside the name. Despite the intent that the player needs to deal with these enemies in different ways, none of these enemies force the player to think differently. The answer is always the same: use a turn and do as much damage as possible in one go, preferably by way of AoE damage. This is absolutely true for every enemy, from hulking Jerks to artillery Cluckers. There are some attempts to break this up, such as the Snapshot's obscuring effect, but many of the abilities in the game already force the player into melee combat, so they are often inconsequential. In the later stages of the game, the player merely need to wait until an enemy is no longer stealthed to unleash flurry of void debuffs and a final cull swing.The game is rather short, and it takes somewhere in between two to six hours for a playthrough, depending on if the player does everything (interacting with spots and terminals, doing challenges, etc) or not. The player is thrust into the story as soon as they start the game for the first time, and it really never becomes much clearer. Transistor takes something of a ""Dark Souls"" approach to telling a story by having it dispersed through strings of text on functions and difficulty increasing ""limiters"". The Transistor, whom is inhabited by someone Red knows that remains nameless, is the main source of off-hand information during the game, usually to excess. The problem with this story is that nothing is ever divulged, nothing is ever expanded upon, and most information presented through functions are about people that either aren't important to the story or provide nothing concurrent that puts things into context. The game is absolutely full of plot holes to an incredible degree and it's presented in a way that would be lost on a lot of people, as it expects the player to use all abilities in all capacities and sift through the text. It's terrible storytelling, which is a shame. The story is interesting, but inaccessible unless subtitles (for Sybil, Royce and Mr. Nobody) and with some extra reading and conjecture. Conjecture is not a basis for storytelling, though; you're just witnessing an event without any context. It's like if you've witnessed a UFO beaming up some farm animals in the distance. Without the rest of the story, the game focuses on Red and Mr. Nobody's extremely obvious relationship as lovers, and Mr. Nobody talks at great length in regards to this when he's not busy filling your ears full of nonsense otherwise. ""Sea Monster's the only real choice here,"" indeed. The relationship stands somewhere around ""puppy love"" on the devotion spectrum until the end of the game, but there's really no development at all. There's no back story, outside of a few obscure references and some images during the credits.The majority of the game is spent trying to get to the Camerata in their tower, and then backtracking through some of the early areas to an M.C. Escher area (which contrasts to the Gustav Klimt inspired ""golds and shapes"" artwork through the rest of the game). The areas, while beautiful, are exceptionally similar and the game's areas bleed into each other. While there's plenty of polish, there's plenty of little things I wouldn't expect at this level of polish, like how OVC terminals are pretty much just inverted when facing the other way, including the giant ""OVC"" markings. These things become very apparent when the environments aren't differentiated, and when you're doing the same things over and over.Supergiant Games had a lot to live up to for their second game, and I can't really hold them to those expectations; they were just astronomical considering Bastion was their first fare, which was both refreshing, innovative, and honed in just about every category. Something about Transistor feels rushed, or hollow. It's hard not to compare Transistor to Bastion with all the similarities and outright references to it; a silent protagonist with a narrator voiced by Logan Cunningham battles to save what's left of their city using a deus ex machina device, all whilst encountering a few survivors and an eventual ""betrayal"" that leads the character to seek greener pastures. The only differences here are story elements, which are even more vague in this offering, and the well meaning but ultimately poor combat. I'm pressed to say that this game would be amazing for a first entry as a studio, but, it's not.Transistor is an okay game plagued with self-plagiarizing of old concepts and poor execution of new ones.

Good, but less than the sum of its parts.Transistor could be lauded for many things. It's a beautiful game with a great soundtrack and wonderful voice acting. The vast array of combat options that open up as you progress allow for a staggering degree of customization. Unfortunately, it is also held back by several areas of weakness. The story, while featuring some interesting characters and an imaginative setting, ultimately felt small, like something that could have been condensed into just a short story or short film. The visually vibrant world you travel through feels somehow empty, devoid of life aside from the enemies you encounter. Finally, the combat never quite develops a pleasing sense of flow to it.Supergiant Games has again raised the bar on weaving a soundtrack into a game. This time it feels even more personal to the story since the main character, Red, is the singer. Just know before you choose to buy the soundtrack that only a handful of the songs have vocals, not counting the extended soundtrack which features a lot of Red humming. Numerous of the purely instrumental tracks have found their way into my music library, but they're not the main attraction.Similarly top notch is the voice acting. Fans of Bastion will recognize the way that it is utilized. It adds atmosphere and brings these characters to life. I must, however, disagree with the decision to have Red's voice ""taken away"" right at the start of the game. She is a fully fleshed out character, not some blank slate for players to project themselves into. Yet some of that is lost by not letting her speak. It also reduces other characters in the game to mostly talking at you in monologues where there could have been conversations. I get why it was an appealing option for the developers though. It's interesting to consider how a singer would feel and react to having one of her most valuable faculties taken away. The world surely feels more bleak and lonely this way too. You even get to hear her through the songs and occasionally in written form. However, as it is I would say more was lost than gained by muting her.While avoiding spoilers, I will say that I would have liked to have seen more out of the story. A lot of the right ingredients were there, but for the most part I would say the quantity wasn't enough or things were left too vague. I liked the characters that were there, but it could have used a couple more of them, particularly ones not affiliated with The Camerata (you're introduced to them early on). I was intrigued by the city of Cloudbank, was TOLD about some of its neat features and people, but I never SAW them. The game never fully convinced me that the place you spend most of your time in was ever lived in by everyday people. This may be a futuristic city where things like trash don't exist, but there has to have been more evidence of life left behind that could have been put into the visuals.Finally, it seems that Transistor's most divisive aspect is its combat system. I was definitely in the camp disappointed with it at first but it does get better as you unlock more options. You have several primary ""Active"" attack slots that can each be significantly altered by two secondary upgrade slots. You also have passive buff slots. Every ability, or Function as the game calls them, can only be used once until you are in New Game+ and begin getting multiples. You have to decide how you want to utilize each function: Active, Upgrade or Passive? You rarely are able to use all your functions at once.It is in the action of battle that things start to falter. The Active functions you bring into the fight and a unique ability to briefly stop time are the only tools ever at your disposal. There is no blocking or dodging aside from normal movement. In stopping time, you have an action bar that is depleted with each action you take. Once you unpause, all the actions you just planned play out at super speed. Obviously this is extremely powerful and it is counterbalanced by disabling all actions besides movement for a time based on how much of the action bar you depleted.The problem is that it is unsatisfying to use. It doesn't take skill to stop time and wail on an unmoving target and it's not fun to run around waiting on a timer afterward. If you forgo this superpower then you're left with, at most, four Active functions to use, and that usually breaks down to spamming one or two of them. If the game had any form of defensive maneuver, I think the developers knew you'd be far less likely to use the time stop. Yet that is the gimmick they went with. The most joy I found in combat was in frequently trying out new builds, including ones others suggested online.Transistor teeters on the edge of whether I'd recommend it or not, but ultimately a couple of its strengths are SO strong that it belongs in the thumbs up category. I will add that if you haven't played Bastion, that is the better game to start with and to get a feel for if you enjoy how Supergiant Games crafts their products.			"

												Oh I really enjoyed Transistor. I finished the regular and NG+ playthroughs of the game across a span of about 3-4 days. One could probably rush through the story in as little as 3 hours, or take time unlocking all the lore, doing the side challenges for extra xp and game knowledge, listening to the catchy music, and stopping to smell all the roses along the way and end up taking easily triple or quadruple that.The game and combat mechanics are pretty fun, with a number of subroutines that you unlock or add to your Transistor weapon as you level up. You form actual skills with those subroutines, using a combination of active slots, support slots (that you slot subroutines into to improve active slots), and four passive slots (buffs to improve your character as a whole). Each subroutine does a different, but thematically similar, thing depending on whether it's currently in an active, passive, or support slot.There are thus many different possible and valid skill combinations and loadouts, and I found myself constantly swapping back and forth between them as I went through the game, especially once I started doing the side challenges where constraints force you to experiment and find new and efficient (or slow and steady) ways of killing things. In addition, each subroutine represents a character within the game's lore and to unlock the full lore for a character, if so desired, requires you to use their subroutine in each of the three slot types for at least one battle, each slot type unlocking about 1/3 of their character bio.Combat itself is a combination of real time and planning mode, and is split up largely into a number of self-contained encounters. Planning mode pauses the map and allows you to preview, queue, and execute in quick succession a number of attacks at once in an interface similar to Xcom or Shadowrun Returns, except that you can preview and rewind options before finally committing. There is no miss chance, or random skill damage, damage is constant but modified by variables depending on if the enemy is stunned or backstabbed, for example.Carrying out actions in the planning mode enables them all to be done in less than a game time second, so it become a power play of sorts whenever planning mode is up, but each ability used in planning mode has a cost which is subtracted from the remaining amount of action points you have in that round of planning. Once you leave planning mode, however, you cannot use most skills until the cooldown for the next planning round is up, leaving you with a few seconds of vulnerability between planning rounds. However, skills used during real time do not trigger a cooldown, and so in some cases it is very beneficial to fight things in real time (or a combination of the two) instead of always in planning mode.An interesting mechanic that I did not figure out until I was into NG+, was that while you have a certain number of action points to spend per round, not actually spending them all allows your downtime before you next skill use to be proportionally smaller, which is critical versus a certain enemy in the game. On the flip side, spending ""over"" what you normally have in planning mode locks your skills for that much longer before you can use them again!The story in the game was pretty neat, if a little on the short side, with a narration style similar to Bastion, but this time the narrator is also the Transistor and with you from the start. Like Bastion, you are dumped right into the plot to start off, and the story is revealed in pieces as you go along. The narration is touching in places, boring in others, but overall quite well done. That ending though. It came unexpected to me the first time, as I didn't think that was the end of the game yet, but hit harder the second time through for me when I knew what was coming. I didn't want to end the game. I did love the ambience though! A combination of the music and the dystopian steampunk background scenery. I am a sucker for night-time big city skylines, and the art in this game evoked so many wistful memories.A couple cons of the game: It's very easy to miss certain lore terminals and the game often doesn't let you back up if you went a little too far in one direction. It is often not obvious which way is ""onward"" and which way is a dead end with a lore piece. Your only options then are to load back from the last save (and you can only save at certain locations, though there is pretty much one before or after nearly every fight) or wait until NG+ to see what you missed. Or YouTube. The narrator is also overly talkative at times, though I guess that's a personality trait. There are also several plot holes in the story to me still, like *why* the Transistor's ownership got passed over to Red, and several other things I feel are little plot holes here and there that are not adequately explained.

												The music... The atmosphere... The visual… The recipe is here to make Transistor a very good game. Except one thing:  it is a bit repetitive. However, it’s a true journey into a cyberpunk city along a quite sad but a gripping story and truly immersive.Woah. One of my favorite games of 2014.A must have.			"

After so many hours staring at my game library, I couldn't believe that a game could offer me the satisfaction I was looking for.I thought this was an entirely tactics-based game - I was wong. This is an action packed game with a strategic function akin to fallout 3. The art style and level setup in this game is truly masterful.The combo system for ""functions"" is amazing. I love being able to combine my ""Switch()"" move with my ""Load()"" move. Each move (as an upgrade, passive, or active skill) has its own charm. The combinations are fun to explore and really add to the overall experience.""Limitors"" are a way to make the game harder (and more fun). By adding ""limitors"" you add to the enemy difficulty and experience bonus after each battle.

												Supergiant's new game Transistor is perhaps the best singleplayer RPG game I've played in the past few years. This game has it all - Outstanding story, amazing music, breathtaking artwork, and great gameplay to go along with it. In particular the fact that you could control the difficulty as the game went on with limiters made the game insanely fun, and the story that you could really only fully understand by taking your time to read the OVC terminals and function archives made it that much more interesting. I would recommend this game in an instant to anyone who was looking for nice, laid back singleplayer adventure. 10/10, 4 stars, 2 thumbs up. It's an amazing game.			"

												I remember when I first saw Bastion for XBLA a long while ago. I was first introduced to it by a show (that might be canceled) Called Reviews on The Run where they reviewed Video Games and Movies. A near perfect is what they gave it.A year or so after Bastion was now coming to Steam. I bought it and I loved it. I loved it more than any game I had ever played before. It was amazing.I'm glad to say that I feel the same about this game except I feel NOTHING SuperGiant makes will ever Compare to Bastion. People are saying that it's a mix of Action and Stratagy and it came be either one if you want it to. I disagree. You have a function called Turn() Using this lets you plan out attacks ahead of time causing a stategic plan to be made. If you run in not using your Turn() like some psychopathic manic then yes, you will die. You can't just fight. You must plan.The Soundtrack is just amazing. It takes classic Jazzy music and mixes in some more electric bounce music. That's pretty much all I have to say about the Soundtrack.When originally seeing the art style in the first trailer from Pax Prime 2013 (I think...) I fell in love with it. When I got into actual gameplay I wasn't a huge fan at first. Now this is me being all picky just because I didn't like Red's face. Soon I got into it and it seemed fine and natural.Overall this is a magnificant title that I recomened everyone should at least give a chance and see if you're a fan2016-01-09: After revisiting the game I believe that this game is a true masterpiece that everyone should try. From the upbeat soundtrack to the rage inducing gameplay, Transistor is truly the best game ever made. Even over Bastion.10/10 - Masterpiece			"

												Supergiant Games have done it again. This game is as beautiful, if not even more beautiful than Bastion. However, before I go on with the rest of my review, I should say that even if you loved Bastion, you may not love this game. A lot of people fell in love with Bastion, not just because of the gameplay and music, but because of the storyline and the narrator that made you feel like you were part of the story.Now, that's not to say that Transistor doesn't have an interesting storyline, it's just that the storyline isn't as clear as it was in Bastion. That's not necessarily a bad thing either, some people like these sort of stories, I'm one of them. Transistor's story is a little more open to interpretation, whereas Bastion's was straightforward, so in this regard, some Bastion lovers may be disappointed. It's also a little hard to understand the story, even after two playthroughs, I mean, I get what's going on, but I'm left with a why at the end of the game. It's explained why in the game, but the reason just seems a bit flawed, I can't talk much more about it without spoiling things, so I'll leave it at that.As for the narrator, Logan Cunningham, I'm really glad to see that he's back in this game. The only issue I had, was that his impact on the game felt like it fell short in comparison to Bastion. The reasoning behind that, is because in Bastion, he actually played a bit more of an important role, in Transistor, however, he just seems like a big question mark the entire time. Now, while he is considered a main character, I mean, he's with you the entire time after all, it's just that they never really give much information on him. His lines in the games were mostly reactionary as well, instead of in Bastion where it felt like he was telling the story, in this game, it just feels like he's living through the story along with us.With all of that said, I still love Transistor more than Bastion.While Transistor might not be as good as Bastion on the storytelling side, the story of Transistor is still rather interesting in it's own way. Bastion was really clear cut with it's story, and that's fine, but I love the way Transistor is a lot more open with it's own story. It takes awhile to figure all of out, but I find it to be more interesting that way. The soundtrack of this game is just amazing. I don't know how Supergiant Games did it again, I usually don't keep in-game music/sounds on, unless if they're really good, and I kept mine on the entire time while playing Transistor. I'm even listening to it now while writing this review, I'll probably end up buying the soundtrack on Steam later on. The music just matches so perfectly with the game itself, it doesn't feel like a distraction, it only enhances the experience. The gameplay of Transistor is a bit more interesting than Bastion as well. Though I should warn you to look up some videos on youtube of the gameplay before buying Transistor. Personally though, I love the mix of using the turn-based system, along with just attacking without the turn system. It's a pretty interesting way to play, a good mix of both is the best way to go, in my opinion. The ability to use your functions (skills) as actives, passives or upgrades is a pretty cool concept as well. A bit limiting in some cases, but that just adds a bit more to the challenge.In terms of achievements, this is rather easy to perfect in comparison to Bastion and perhaps most games in general. There isn't much difficulty involved in many of the achievements, they're more time consuming than anything. However, since the game is rather short, it only takes like 6-7 hours for your first playthrough and then perhaps 4-5 more for your second playthrough. I finished both of my playthroughs in a little over 11 hours and got all of the achievements, so it's definitely a bit shorter than Bastion.To conclude, Transistor is a beautiful and wonderful game on it's own. If you think it'll be exactly the same as Bastion however, you may be a bit disappointed. However, Transistor is my favorite game so far this year, it did not disappoint me one bit and it only surpassed the expectations I had. I am merely warning those who think this is almost an exact copy of Bastion, it is not. Pros: + Interesting gameplay+ Beautiful art style+ Wonderful music+ Decent replay value+ Lots of different combinations for functions (skills)Cons:- A bit on the short side (6 Hours for first playthrough)- Some parts of the story could use a bit more explaining			"

												A lovingly crafted game, dripping with Deco, Art Nouveau, and the Vienna Secession (Those similar to Klimt). Every element of this game is gorgeous, from the music, the art assets, and characters. It's a beautiful, romantic story, wrapped up in a golden box of a game. The combat, and how skills can be mixed, is remarkable. Skills will change depending on being a passive, active, or modifier to an active skill. You learn more about the story doing so, as well-so make sure to try all the combinations!I can't really say in words how lovely this little game has been, and I'm just very appreciative to have been able to play it.

												A very stylish Sci-Fi Noire-ish game about a strange and somewhat utopian city, ""Cloudbank"", falling to an epidemic/invasion of some kind, ""The Process"". The protagonist, a famous musician of the city called ""Red"", vanishes after one of her stage acts and finds herself right in the middle of the city's demise. The game drops you into a scene with Red pulling a tool resembling an oversized sword from someone's body, which is accompanying and talking to her and which narrates many of her actions and compensates for the city having ""taken"" Red's voice, who herself is mostly silent. With this tool, the ""Transistor"", you fight your way through the declining urban environment to the source of this epidemic trying to save the city.The game is short, but very impressive. The art design feels special and there is some pretty cool music. Cloudbank is a rather mysterious city/town, the game isn't straightforward with what world, place or time you are exactly finding yourself in. The ""traces"" of former certain city inhabitants absorbed by the Transistor to power your abilites while handling it in combat (fitting to their stories and roles within the city) give you hints to events predating Red's disappearance and are interesting to read - but overall the game loves leaving you in a wondering position for many parts, which (in a good, engrossing way) mystifies the whole experience and leaves room for own interpretations, possibly even for pre-/sequels or novels or other things that would build on the strong lore pieces which are there (I believe I have noticed this in the devs previous title ""Bastion"" to some degree too, but to my knowledge it was never worked out further, whether that is good or bad I'm not sure).Like ""Bastion"" this is a rather ""soft"" strategy action RPG in the way that you need to fight with some brains but not by being confused by millions of units and possible actions. You engage enemies with selective combat options organized at check-/savepoints, either in real-time or by utilizing a limited time-stopping/slowing planning feature. There are minor leveling elements and rather trivial but curious choices planted selectively throughout the city circling around some of its former daily routines and design questions (voting on things was popular among Cloudbank's citizens, it seems). Apparently, as a neat gimmick, the choices and a few other stats of the playerbase (like the kill count for each enemy type) are woven into this (or the game at least made me believe so). Maybe this could have been something to expend more, as it is effectively working into Cloudbank's digital and scientific ambience. You see the city through various stages of decline but without the levels building themselves up just before you (which I found somewhat irritating in Bastion), and without the ""hit and run"" concept of Bastion where you would often have a sanctuary to return to and select new levels to start from. This makes your journey feel a bit more like a real series of events rather than a level clearing maze, the city more persistent and you to be ""actually there (as much as that is possible in this mysterious world). The narrator doesn't feel as annoying as the one in Bastion sometimes does, but maybe too distant - or even lethargic - at times. But this could be the idea of his role within the story. In general I was thankful to have him as my - or Red's - companion. However I would have loved to hear Red being properly voiced too I think. I'm not exactly the biggest fan of this ""silent protagonist"" concept. Here it feels rather fitting though as the whole game is strange in a good kind of way, and it allows some certain love of detail to shine more for example when Red is answering to news feeds and polls on public terminals and correcting her own sentences while being in the middle of typing them to the point where she may even give up hope for the city herself - a subtle but strong way of projecting the protagonist's emotions despite her voicelessness.There is a little sandbox-like place in which you can practice combat and take part in some challenges. It's not as big as in Bastion, but I don't think it needs to be as it would probably only distract from the main experience. A new game will retain your level and abilites and ramp up the strength of the enemies accordingly. There are modifiers too - ""limiters"" - to make your enemies stronger and you level up faster, for an added challenge to whoever seeks it. That aside there doesn't seem any significant replay value, whether there are multiple endings I don't know yet. But the initial experience is an engaging and memoreable one, the game feels bold, thoughtful and determined and it's just impressive to see an apparent great vision turned so seemingly smoothly and confidently into a finished product that would very well deserve to be called a work of art.

												TL;DR: 1st game I've given a perfect score of 100Everything in this game is perfect except for the part where you need to rename the folders of x86 and x64 to fix a crash. Other than that, I can't fault anything on this game.Very unique gamestyle, I think this is the first time I've seen a game like these. Combining turn based combat to real time one as well as most importantly the RPG skill mix and match. It is really a ingenious design. If there are similar games (most importantly the skills system), please do let me knowPerfect pacing: Skills are slowly introduced to you same with the scaling of enemies, there are no difficulty spikes. Bosses are an exception because they should be an automatic difficulty spike. The unlocks per level feels very beneficial so every level-up counts. The game's length is also perfect based on how much they have to offer to discover all skill combination (talking about finishing the story after recursion). You can set your own difficulty by using limiters especially once you find OP skill combinations.Amazing storytelling: They kept you blinded for the story and even tries to make you think that there is going to be a plot twist with the relationship with the sword. Same with the pacing on the gameplay, the pacing on the story is also perfect. I absolutely love the ending, it was presented very simple but if you think about it, the reasoning behind it is very sweet.Technical: Graphics are top notch and fits best with the setting. OST, absolutely love it. Nothing wrong about the performance.Overall Score: 100/100			"

												Transistor. Wow. I'm consistently blown away by the visuals and music.You can get by decently by not exploring the depths of the combat system, but taking it in all in real time detracts much of the beauty of the well thought out executions you can maneuver. And the different combinations between your loadouts are interesting and I can only imagine get more creative. The story has kept me glued to the screen and my only pause was to write this brief review. The voice acting is amazing and holds up extraordinarily well with the narration. Definitely a must buy. If only for the soundtrack alone!			"

												After playing and loving Bastion, I had high hopes for Transistor.  Unfortunately, several glaring issues wth the gameplay just kept me from enjoying the game.  The story seems fine, if rather tough to piece together, so I will not cover that here.Obviously Transistor will be compared to Bastion, so I will do that as well.  The pros to Bastion's gameplay are-Wide range of weapons that can be used in combinations for different playstyles-Upgrade system that adds noticable benefits to both your character and his weapons-Strong core gameplay (dodging, blocking, attacking, etc.) that rewards skill and timing and prevents overreliance on healing items-No unnecessarily punishing elements (i.e. undodgeable/unblockable attacks), so deaths are almost always your faultTransistor on the other hand, seems to go directly against what worked in Bastion for core gameplay.-No natural block or dodge ability (aside from the teleport dash and invisibility functions), so there is no way to mitigate damage-Slow-moving character that tends to get caught on obstacles, exacerbated by the lack of a natural dodge-No healing aside from a late-game function, so some fights become battles of attrition-Several enemies whose attacks are unavoidable (dogs, creeps, jerks), even with the aforementioned functions, so fights involving these enemies are unnecessarily punishing-Environments that offer little room for maneuveringAll of this combined results in a gameplay experience that is a chore to endure, particularly later on when high-health enemies with unavoidable attacks appear in numbers.  The teleport dash function can help, but even when dashing away in a straight line enemies can still catch and damage you.  And the environments' cramped design means that you end up dashing in circles trailing enemies that keep picking away at your health in between dashes.  Fights become a race to see if you can kill these enemies before you lose a critical function.It is a shame that I could not enjoy the game due to these awful design choices.  The function system is an intriguing feature with great depth that could have enabled a wide range of playstyles.  Unfortunately the poorly-designed basic  gameplay means that this system cannot be used to its full potential.			"

												Transistor brings more of the amazing atmosphere and ongoing narration that people loved in Bastion, with an even more incredible soundtrack. The combination real-time/turn-based combat allows for deep strategy and will keep you switching up your selected functions (and the functions that modify them) to find a play style that suits you best. It is sadly quite linear: all battle encounters are static locations (though the enemies can change based on your level) and there are only one or two very small optional areas. And, unless you missed a few corners of interaction or side rooms with static art (like the opening image,) the only reason to play again is for the sake of achievements; there's not even minor alternate endings like Bastion. (And, when you see the ending, you'll probably wish there was.)That said, the positives of combat, music, and story vastly outweight the negatives of linearity and low-replay value, and I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a short, strategic brawler or just more of what they loved from Bastion. The soundtrack itself is excellent all its own, so even if you don't go for the game you should pick up the soundtrack.			"

Everything about this game is magnificant, perhaps even perfect - The artwork is gorgeous, the storyline is elegant and, in the end, bittersweet. The gameplay is smooth and intuitive, and the music is heavenly and, quite honestly, breathtaking (as such, perhaps unsurprisingly, I firmly recommend purchasing the SoundTrack, too). This is a game that should be experienced by as many people as possible. It's a masterpiece.(EDIT: This game got my vote for the: The “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award in the 2016 Steam Awards, which shoudl give you an idea of my emotional investment).

It's amazing. And now that it's on sale??? BUY IT IMMEDIATELY You will never be gifted something so amazing as this game. You played Bastion? Well you know how awesome the story telling will be and how the combat plays out a bit. BUT THATS NOT THE WHOLE STORY! The combat is a mixed of real time and turn based, blended flawlessly to be for anyone looking for a challege or who wants to have everything calculated down to the letter. Remember the sound track I mentioned? FLAWLESS, it creates the most calming atmosphere when it's needed AND THEN GETS INTENSE WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE, THE MUSIC NEVER FEELS OUT OF PLACE. And dont even get me started on the art, even not at max graphics this game is the prettiest thing you can let your eye sockets behold, a majestic blend of colors it's a feast for the eyes. If anything now that it's on sale you gotta at least try it out!			"

												The main reason that this game is so fun and original is the wonderful battle mode it applies for fighting the bad guys. Somewhat similar to Fallout's ""VATS"" system, you can choose to fight in real time, or pause then plan your moves to attack the enemies, restart the game and hit them. Wait a few seconds for your powers to recharge and then you can go again.But that is just the half of it. Each ""power"" has three different uses. A main use, a backup use and a passive use. So depending on where (or how) you choose to use each power (or combine it with others) you can get a huge of array of attacks, each different from the last. It really gives the player a wide choice of playing styles.And of course there is the story and the art style... and the shortness of the game, but heck, it is really worth a download.			"

												It was suspicious enough after Bastion that the guys at Supergiant know something. This game has ambience, immense fun, fine-grained control of difficulty implemented as an in-game feature, different play styles and combos, etc.It might sound weird but this game is exactly what  I need after a long day of coding. #D~ A brilliant piece of work. I would really want to spend an afternoon in the Sandbox() with the developers just talking. "

												I really loved this game. The gameplay starts off confusing, but as you play more and more you get a feel for the attacks and abilities that work well together (AKA Void+Anything). As I started my NG+ run, I felt I knew what I was doing, but still had hard fights. By the time I 100%ed the game everything was melting with the combo I used. I really liked the challenge maps. They changed up your normal gameplay by setting limits, such as time or skills. People claimed the story was confusing, I claim these people are dumb.  If you listen and read everything it is made pretty clear what is/was going on. Only thing that isn't super clear is how Red lost her voice, which isn't a big part of the overall story if you think about it.			"

Only possible criticism is how short the story is, and I wouldn't say I sped through it - though I did miss a few collectibles and didn't bother with much of the side-challenges. Great customization options for making a build, the limiters providing an interesting adjustable difficulty.Highly recommend Transistor and I'd suggest giving it a go when you've an evening where you can commit to playing it from start to finish!

												Wow, this game...The gameplay was kind of boring to me, it mainly consists of combat, and combat can be interesting and tactical, but it can also pretty dull and repetitive. On the other hand, the story, the world design, the art style and the music is simply amazing. So all in all, I liked it, though after you finish the story(about 6 hours), there's not much reason to come back to it. Still, I think that it's worth the money.			"

												I love this game. A while after finishing Bastion, a game made by the same developers, I found out about Transistor and could not wait to try it out. I went into this game blind, so I wouldn't have any high expectations. The only thing I knew about this game was that this game was going to be awesome and pretty. So after actually playing the game, I felt like it was worth every penny and even more than that.The game has a beautiful storyline. I love the characters and the amazing voice acting, and the character development will make you love the protoganists or even the antagonists for sure. Fitting with the beautiful storyline comes the amazing graphics that the developers brought to you. Every stage, every fight, every moment is basically a breathtaking piece of art, hand-painted. Not to forget the beautiful soundtracks that each fit in their respective part in the game, keeping the atmosphere intact like you're stuck in another universe.But don't let the radiance of the graphics and the fluent tunes distract you, because the combat mechanics are something to keep your attention on. It's original and not repetitive at all. You can unlock new abilities on the go, making you change your strategy from time to time because you keep getting more to play with. If you don't, you'll have a hard time beating the game.In the end, if the game still hasn't gotten you in their grasp with their story, character development, graphics or music then it will try with the replayability that's available in this game. Finishing the game does not mean being done with it, because of the ""Recursion"" option, introducing procedural battle after finishing the end boss.If you love a pretty game with a nice story, I definitely recommend buying it. If it's on a sale, then don't hesitate to buy it because it will definitely be worth it.			"

												Having just finished this, all I can really say is:Transistor is an experience, that everyone needs to try.The visuals are amazing.The soundtrack is beautiful.The gameplay is diverse, theres so many ways to suit it to your playstyle, as you can basically augment and change your attacks/abilities. Flitting around between styles was fun, albeit very challenging at times, as some enemies... are kind of unfair, at times.The story is left intentionally vauge mostly, but gives enough to leave a strong plot. The detatched storytelling used works well, and the ending is... something.The main appeal of the game has to be the story and the graphics, but yet theres still some replayability, as new game+ is a thing. On top of this, there are optional limiters to add challenge, if you so wish.The only potential weak points I can think of are:- Recharge from Turn() is very annoying, to be frank, as most of your abilities are offline. This can be partially removed by augmenting with an ability called Jaunt(), but its still a pain, especially in a very risky scenario.- The final boss is... frankly, underwhelming? It seemd rather gimmicked and just a spamfest, with no real difficulty. I dont know if thats because I found a combination able to completely demolish it, but still.Overall, Transistor is a downright gorgeous game that has to be at least tried at some point.			"

												Short, yet very sweet. Everything about this game is art, from the music to the graphics to the story.Transistor is a sci-fi action adventure game with a combat system that's a mix of hack & slash and turn-based. You get about 20 ""functions"" which can each be used in three roles: firstly as a combat skill, secondly as an upgrade for skills, and thirdly as a passive that effects all skills and combat. You can install and uninstall these functions as much as you like, giving you lots of flexibility. As you level up you also get the choice to use limiters, which buff your enemies. These are optional, so you can challenge yourself however you see fit.The only thing this game needs is more content. However, you can replay the game retaining all your skills and level from the previous playthrough, and there are special arenas that test your skill.Definitely worth checking out.			"

												This game is fantastic. Beautiful art style, fun combat and gameplay, and boasts strong replay value (a rarity for me).  Instead of the weapon choices of Bastion, you have four separate slots in which you can make different and unique combinations of three different programs each, in addition to four passive slots.  The variety will keep you playing without a doubt. ""Dying"" removes one of your slots and the program within it until you reach a checkpoint, which forces you to experiment with new combinations if you aren't careful. Soundtrack is breathtaking and truly draws you into the game with the ""hummed"" overlay when you go into VATS / planning mode. Finally, it's all wrapped up with a cute love story featuring a Narrator™.Cons: - Mildly short, but the side content and the replay value does make up for it quite a bit. - UI is unintuitive and unfriendly (actually a rather large downside considering how much time you spent mixing and matching different programs), but can be navigated once you get used to it.Please buy this game it is sexy and awesome.

												Though i love this game, be warned - it's rather short - a playthrough takes about 6 hours. What the game lacks in length it makes up for in unique gameplay and amazing atmosphere. (Also the soundtrack, the music is fantastic. Seriously. )I never really got around to playing it for a second time. It's worth a mention that it does have quite a bit of replayability because you get to continue playing around with different ability combinations in new game +. Since you get to keep your levels you can just keep discovering great combinations and fniding creative approaches to combat. Im glad indie game development companies like Supergiant Games get to exist, be successful and innovate within the industry like this.I really enjoyed my expirience with the game. This is my personal Best Game of 2014. The game plays in a really interesting manner and i strongly recommend it to anyone looking for new interesting and engaging gameplay mechanics to play around with. Also if you loved Bastion you will love this for a lot of the same reasons. :)			"

												It's a great game. no doubt. It has a futuristic setting which brings forth many innovative and cool design concepts. Pity the story is abit too short. Overlooking that, the storyline is great. It has a touching ending, one that hits harder than bioshock infinite's ending. It brings forth questions that we must ask ourselves - Do we have to rely on technology? And to what extend? What is the worth of life, and the consequences that follow in the name of fame? How far do we go for our loved ones?Other than the story, the gameplay is absolutely fantastic. It allows you to customize your spells in all sorts of manner, promoting creativity and encourages people to keep grinding against the same enemies with different approaches. It also buffs the enemies as you progress further into the game, making it much more of a challenge then just a simple hack-and-slash game. What I like most about the game is definitely the artstyle and music. It fits in perfectly, reflecting on both the initial utopiantheme and the slow descent into the dystopia which the city becomes as one approaches the end. The option to hold tab and listen to Red sing is also a gem. Her voice protrudes out from the ambient yet invigorating background music, giving even more depth to the storyline of the game, singling it out from the conventional hack-and-slash genre type of games. Overall, it is a beautifully crafted and ingeniusly designed game. Would rate almost 10/10.Gameplay: 9/10 (It's unique style style such as the ""Turn()"" ability makes it stand out from other hack-and-slash games. The enemy units are also properly balanced, posing as a proper challenge.""Visuals: 10/10 (Absolutely stunning. Art is meticulous at the proper parts and simple yet creative at other spots. The design for the enemy units<younglady, jerk, badcell etc.> as well as the transistor is refreshing new and creative.)Concep/Storylinet: 9/10 (Very cool concept. Reveals alot about the human nature and it's instinct to be selfish. Deeper thoughts can be put into the storyline to reveal much much more about the settings and the story.)Music: 10/10 (Beautiful. Fits into the settings perfectly. Go and listen for yourself :).)Overall score: 9~/10Would recommend?: Definitely			"

												Short version: This art-house action-RPG comes with an unconventional/semi-turn based battle system, gorgeous music and visuals, a somewhat thin but wonderfully told narrative, and remarkable integration of gameplay and storytelling.  It's a gem of a game with a decent amount of content and is absolutely worth cherishing.--------Long version: Transistor begins gently and without a lot of explanation, giving the player just enough information to know what's going on and where to go.  In short, you're on the run from your would-be assassins, fighting enemies along the way.  You have a sword that talks (voiced by Logan Cunningham, the narrator from Supergiant Games' own Bastion), and the game doesn't bog you down with needless explanations of how a lot of the setting's pieces work.  You quickly acquire abilities as you go, and these skills make Transistor special in several ways:1) Battles in Transistor work somewhat like Diablo's where you can button-mash if you want, but you can also queue up and instantly execute a limited number of attack commands or move a certain distance without enemy reprisal.  The catch is that until your Turn() meter refills over a few seconds, you can't use most of your attacks, so you have to be careful to play conservatively.  At the same time, you'll eventually become strong enough to where you can and should try to stay in real time more often, which works out well since your time-stop ability can leave YOU vulnerable if you're not careful.You can only equip a few of your skills as hotkey actives at once, and dying restores your health but disables one of your remaining skills until either you have none left, or you win the battle and make a certain amount of forward progress in the game.  This arguably leaves you even worse off than if you'd simply been forced to restart the fight, which you can also choose to do from the pause menu.  (Note that a few areas place you in big battles right after long interactive cutscenes without giving you a save point first; since battles can sometimes be immediately repeated, try not to hit ""Retry"" on impulse if circumstances turn against you.)  Enemies usually don't have a lot of defensive immunities, though, which is great about keeping you from feeling penalized for using a certain play style.  They're also smart enough to be aware of one another and to know how to protect and even heal each other.More importantly, skills never feel redundant, and they're designed to play off of each other, not to exist in isolation or to be used at random.  Your abilities have their own slots where they can plug into one another and change each other's properties.  One skill fires long-ranged arrows when put on a hotkey, but it can also be plugged into other skills, which usually increases their range.  You can later do the same thing with your own character, which grants additional benefits like a deflector shield or a health recharge--one of the few you'll get, so don't take it for granted.There are no character classes in Transistor, but the wonderful skill system allows you to customize and change up your play style throughout the game.  If you want to play a stealthy assassin, a somewhat tanky gunner, or a manipulator who turns enemies against each other, you have quite a few options to choose from.  The variety of different animations and graphical effects for the huge number of potential skill combinations is simply stunning--these aren't just throwaway stat boosts here--and it makes your abilities feel almost like they physically affect one another rather than simply doing whatever the game tells them to do.  I might have overlooked a way to do this, but it would be nice to be able to simply click an upgrade slot and see my various effect options at a glance, instead of just clicking on a skill itself and seeing the various places it could go.  In other words, ""I know what ability I want to augment, but not specifically how I want to do so.""2) This is one of my favorite parts.  Skills are connected to different characters and their individual stories, and while I sometimes don't like when a game presents a lot of its story through text, this method is genius--your abilities' text logs are divided up into parts that must be uncovered by equipping your skills in different ways.  Use one ability in its active mode to get one piece of text, then use that ability to upgrade another and get the next piece of text, and so on.  Hence, the game rewards and demands experimentation if you want to read all of the background info.  You can't get too comfortable with a certain battle strategy you like, since you have to constantly rearrange your skills and try new things with them in order to get the most out of the story, let alone the battles and their fairly sharp challenge curve.  It feels a lot more involving than simply having info dumps thrown at you because you discovered an unfamiliar character or area.Speaking of difficulty, you can customize it to some extent by turning on various options you earn called Limiters, which increase your rate of experience gain but also help your enemies out in some way.  Have fun turning them all on at once, achievement-lovers!When you're not battling, you navigate the deserted but absolutely beautiful streets and alleys of the city of Cloudbank, and I can't tell you how refreshing it is to play an adventure that takes you by multicolored, modern-looking restaurants, residential areas, and concert halls as opposed to yet another fantasy forest/desert/cave.  The city feels lived-in and familiar while still maintaining its own distinctive touches, such as weather and sky color being up to a popular vote, which you can take part in.  You'll be taking gorgeous, probably wallpaper-quality screenshots almost constantly--I have almost as many screenshots saved from 20 hours of Transistor as I do from 150 hours of Dota 2.  Even in the few cases where the game's tendency to not always explain itself makes for some genuinely weird encounters, the journey never stops being compelling and never overstays its welcome.The main story isn't that long, and while you'll fly through it on New Game Plus (especially if you turn off all the limiters after finishing the character-level achievements like I did), the various ""challenge room""-style quests will keep you up at night.  My favorites were the planning tests, where you're given a specific loadout and tasked with clearing an area in one turn, which implicitly teaches you new strategy ideas and lets you play around with skills you don't always have immediate access to.  Woe be to those who forget to take notes.The soundtrack, which Supergiant was wonderful enough to post on YouTube --

 -- is for the most part spectacular, even though some of the more intense songs sound better while in the context of the game, like when you're busy running from something dangerous.  Ashley Barrett's vocals are indescribably wonderful, and the game even gives you a dedicated button for humming along to the background music, which gets put to genuinely awesome use at times.------Transistor, despite perhaps having room for more detail in the main plot, crams more visual and musical identity into its small but thoroughly memorable scale than I can recall from a lot of much bigger games, and even without the wonderfully fun Turn() system, the skill combinations and the wonderful production values make the combat more special than any number of hotkey bars ever will.  As of this writing, the game is currently on sale for $7, but I'd say it's easily worth its $20 asking price if you don't mind a product that exchanges length for sheer specialness.  Pick this up right away!			"

												Psst. Hey, RPG fans. Remember how flexible, engaging, and all-around great Chrono Trigger's combat system was? How you could drop a combo-train of hurt on an enemy, or wait for a bunch of mooks to squeeze together so you could fry them all in one shot? Remember being dismayed that nobody ever used that setup again because the people who make such decisions hate innovation and fun? Well it's here, and it's even more flexible and more engaging and just a heaping platter of fun.There's a story in there too, though it feels a little aimless at times. That's not really a problem, because dang there's some great worldbuilding going on when you start sifting through function logs and other details.			"

'When everything changes, nothing changes.'First time i've seen reveal trailer i was already in love with this game. Music, art, gameplay, everything was just for me, even if it was just one-minute video. Then, it came to steam in pre-order. I was not thinking even one second, just bought it and started to wait.When it was finally out i could not hide my excitement. Hardly waited for it to install, then ran it from my library, and... It was just as it must be. Pure perfection.I have absolutely no complains about it. Art and graphics are, well, you can just press print screen whenever you want and set the result as your desktop picture. Gameplay is very smart and forces you to try out something new, by rewarding you with some more details of characters life stories. Music have astonishing melancholic mood that will follow you through the story, that shines like a little Supergiant Games star on this christmas tree of perfection.Well, i will say nothing more, just believe me, i'm very very choosy in regard of games. And this game, it's definitely my game of the year, and one of my favorites overall.'Sky looks blue cause we want it too.' "

												I really appreciate what they were trying to do with this game, and in a lot of ways, it's very appealing to me as a gamer. Well, in two ways in specific. The first is just how aesthetically pleasing this game is. The world, abilities, enemies, music and artwork is all really well done. The ability system is fun and I find myself wanting a Diablo style game to incorporate a system similar to this because I think it's well done and gives you a lot of customization. The combat is meh, the pacing is meh, the length of the story is very meh and, to me, the ending was meh. I don't know... I was super excited for this game for a LONG time, and can't really say it was worth the 20 dollars. I'll play through it again at a slower pace now that I know just how much every second counts and might edit this review, but I kind of doubt it. It was a decent experience, but wait until it's on sale. If you're cool with time trials and whatnot, you'll probably get a bit more time out of it than I did. But, for me, when you have a setting this cool and the story is so forced and short, it in no way was very satisfying.			"

												Transistor is at the same time very similiar to and very different from Bastion. Once again the game starts in a city where some kind of catastrophic event took place and the hero must fight it and maybe find a way to undo it. You'll recognize the art style and the familiar voice of Logan Cunningham guiding you through the game, this time not as the narrator but as a companion. Even with all the similarities, Transistor ia a very different experience. The setting is much more futuristic. Everything in the game is related to programming language and sometimes you wonder if the city of Cloudbank is a real city or just some kind of complex metaphor. The battle system has a unique mix of action and strategy. Every skill (called function in the game universe) can be placed in an active or passive slot. Besides that, every skill can upgrade another skill, or even itself, leading to a huge amount of possibilities to choose from. The only negative aspect of the game is that it'll take about half the time to finish it if compared to Bastion. There is a Recursion Mode that works like a NG+ where you can start the game again retaining the level and skills from the previous run but that's it. Besides that minor flaw, Transistor is still a masterpiece.			"

												From the organic ways of Bastion, from the bush and jungle, from levels created by tiles floating up beneath you, we get Transistor. Where the style has evolved into a futuristic, neon-lit, already built level. The world does no longer face the problem of falling apart, but instead it is losing it's style. “The Process”---the equivalent of “The Calamity” in Bastion---covers the creativity made from humans, with a grayscaled and blocky veneer, which seems detrimental to this particular game, where style is easily the highpoint of the experience. The music this time around leaves the closeness of acoustic guitar picking(except for the beach soundtrack) and goes for a more distant, electronic and futuristic atmosphere. Distorted electric guitars and heavy bass lines accorded with ambiance make Transistor a sonically sound experience. The story is very reminiscent of Bastion, but yet completely different. Transistors style and sound design, as with Bastion, perfectly accompanied each other. At points I felt like the levels were specifically made with the soundtrack in mind, because it was so eerily well thought out. We start of as Red, a singer that lost her voice(it found its way to the soundtrack, though). Standing above a man with a sword in his chest. This sword can talk to us, and also play the roll as narrator. Why only this man can speak through the weapon is unknown to me, since the player ingest other fallen men and women and gain powers through this procedure, but not their voices as with the first body. At this point of the game we don't know who this man is or why we should follow his advice or directions, but it's a game, so we do it anyway. We progress through the levels and gradually begin to understand the situation, “The Process” was a failed experiment from “The Camerata” and the city is conveniently told to evacuate, so we can have that barren emptiness that is so effective when it comes to atmosphere. And The Process is what haunts us throughout the game. As we try to get to the bottom of what happened. The vagueness and convolution of the story straddles the line of being annoyingly vague and mysterious and intriguing. Where at some points I feel the story would be better told if you knew some of the things you are told in the end. That would make everything feel more natural. In this mysteriousness, the story was overshadowed by the stylistic choices and obligatory gameplay sections. It's unfortunate when Transistor could have been both if they just dropped any pretensions of being deeper and having more substance than there really was. When you get to the end of this two hour game, things will be rather clear, but you will also feel like there should be more, where there are hints and ways the story could have gone that were never shut down or explored in a satisfying way. Despite it not feeling as fulfilling as it seemed to have the potential for, it was enjoyable and the game easily grabbed you and kept you interested up until the end. The gameplay seems to be a rather contentious subject. I for one, sort of liked it. You could play it like in Bastion, hack and slash, designing your “build” for this purpose. Or you could go a more tactical way, as with a controller I thought would be more suiting. And it was! Although the combat often boiled down to using your tactical slow down time mechanism, killing one foe to then run around, trying not to die until the cooldown ran out, I really enjoyed it. There was tension in that way of playing, trying to just avoid getting hit, spamming RT. While some abilities seemed useless to me, most of them were used at some point due to the fact that you lose an ability when you lose all your health. This was a clever way of making the player use all the different devices, but it's equally as dumb when you have you remake your whole build every time you “die”. The frustration of having to go in to the these access points and try to manage your attacks when half of the things you want to use are unusable somewhat breaks immersion. See Transistor tries to squeeze in a whole bunch of different attacks and combinations into, what was for me, a two hour experience. Perhaps if the game was longer and had more uses for some of the attacks, this wouldn't be so jarring and above all boring. However, when you had the attacks you wanted, with the combinations and everything, the gameplay was a lot of fun. Beautiful colors emitted from every blow, cool sound design and every attack felt more or less powerful, but alas, that didn't mean they were. All in all it's neat parcel. Well worth it for the creativity. The clumsiness of some decisions didn't come close to ruining the experience whatsoever. So it's a worthy successor to Bastion, and it will probably stay in the same place in my mind as Bastion. As a memory of a stylistically and sonically amazing experience, while the gameplay and storytelling will surely fade out of the collective memory, sooner or later.			"

												It's difficult but try to forget that Supergiant games made Bastion; whether you liked Bastion or not is not indicative of how you will feel about Transistor.Obvious points out of the way: sublime art and music. The aesthetics are scintillating, the backgrounds and world are meticulously detailed. The characters and enemies are well animated and designed, mirroring the world around them. There's a very strong noir vibe seeping through what often feels like cyberpunk New York as imagined by Europe. There's every chance I'm just projecting my desire for Remember Me to have been a good game, but I digress.The gameplay is solid, provided you realise that operating outside of Turn() is very rarely the best option. Transistor gives you a lot of different skills and variety of ways to combine them allowing you to play however you want, additionally the game encourages you to mix up your skills so that you can unlock character information and the ""Performance Tests"" force you to improvise with randomly selected skills. Unfortunately towards the end of the game encounters become quite repetitive and even with enemies evolving it is rare that whatever combo you've perfected by that point won't be just as effective as before. New Game+ is genuinely challenging but by then you are even furthered hampered in choices and will be extremely reliant on a few exceptional skills to get you through the encounters, especially with limiters on.It is unfortunate to say that the story and characters feel like the weakest aspect of Transistor. You're dropped into the world with no knowledge of anything, and as you progress you slowly uncovers scraps of information by way of skills and terminals. The game is quite short too, and ultimately it can be quite difficult to become truly invested in either the world or characters. After talking with people and going through the NG+, there are a few nuances that are illuminated and can be appreciated but the story never takes that final step.Transistor is a good game. The worst thing you could say is that it is not Bastion. Regardless of who you are you should approach with caution and pay special attention to all the little details, from the art to the written and spoken dialogue.			"

												Transistor, from the makers of Bastion, both games are among my favorites. Transistor and bastion have many similarities, and many differences. While bastions combat is based on weapons, and a couple upgrades for each weapon, in transistor, there is only one weapon, the transistor. Instead, combat is based around skills (functions) to use with the transistor, as well as being able to augment skills by equipping skills onto skills, and providing passive buffs by equipping skills onto yourself, that combined with the turn() function and a lack of environmental clutter made the combat feel a lot more varied and responsive. Unlike bastion, transistor doesn’t have levels with a hub, but rather has you progressing through a world with occasional visits to the ‘Sandbox’. While in Bastion, pretty much all information is centered on The Kid, in Transistor, everything is surrounding Red, but not really centered on her. The story is delivered in a similar, but different manner. Again, like Bastion, Transistor is not a particularly long game, around 8 hours. However, it’s well worth investing yourself into. P.S. gorgeous soundtrack, with or without hum tracks is subjective, personally I like them with humming, but even if you don’t plan on getting it, give the ost a listen.			"

												Supergiant Did it again, an amazingly beautiful game, great soundtrack, and fun gameplay. Transistor takes a more tactical approach to it's battle system than the more chaotic hack and slack ARPG combat of bastion. In many cases you absolutely need to utilize the Plan() system and can't just rage through with a few good weapons like in bastion. The game also has a slightly more mature artstyle, and I enjoy the elements of art noveau and cyberpunk aesthetics strewn about all of the cityscapes. It really is a gorgeous game. The story is refreshing and takes some unexpected turns, and despite it being a bit too cryptic at times, i enjoyed it and thought it pulled together the game well.My only complaint is the brevity of the game. Supergiant just leaves you begging for more, maybe we'll get lucky and some form of expansion will be added. That said I still do not at all regret spending $15 dollars on this beauty of a game, however short.			"

												Transistor, a cyberpunk themed action RPG made by Supergiant Games is set in a futuristic city called “Cloudbank”. You take the role of “Red”, a young women who gains control of an extraordinary weapon. After a mysterious group nearly kills you, you start your journey, slowly puzzling the story. The art style, music, and narration create a gorgeous, astonishing and captivating place you want to be part of. Beautifully drawn and rich locations where every step is a pleasure to the eyes, the amazing music by Darren Korb, the fantastic voice acting by Logan Cunningham and the memorable, intriguing characters which grow to your heart are not the only aspects that the game has to offer. The combat is remarkably fun and fresh. While you only have one weapon, there are dozens of ""functions"" which you collect on your journey through Cloudbank. Those functions act as perks which can be  combined with each other and/or used either aggressively or passively matching your playstyle.All  in all Transistor is a masterpiece and is probably my favourite indie game. Not only I recommend on buying the game but the gorgeous soundtrack it offers which is absolutely worth it.			"

												Loved the artwork, the music, the little touches(such as Transistor's/proxy etc glow during speech, even during cut-scenes) but not a fan of the story delivery. Sure keeping your audience in 'mystery' might seem nice but when you're through 3/4th the game wondering what exactly is happening. I guess the aim was to get people to continue playing it to find what happens but to me at least, it's not really a compelling reason to play through it. I can see the appeal, esp to programmers with 'functions' as skills passives as caches limiters for extra bonus XP. Another thing I didn't like was that I couldn't read the skill descriptions and effects when placed in main/upgrades/passives at any point except at access points. This is especially frustrating when you want to read up on the background of the traces but they are locked away until you use it and guess what - can't change it at any point. Feels like an artificial way of increasing the time required to play through it.What does work:  - The music & the songs, especially in backdoor when you can replay them - The artwork - Voice acting, especially that of Royce Bracket.  Overall short but sweet game.			"

												Awesome successor to Bastion! The familiar Bastion template is present, an ARPG with continual narrative and a fixed isometric view.The gameplay mechanic is more interesting and engaging, with the abillity to plan moves and combine abilities. The progression was well paced, though it seems to expect the player to continue with game+. The art style and music themes were highly polished and fit together excellently. In terms of criticism, the game could have been a bit longer. Also, the enemies start lacking variety in the later half of the game, and some more varied scenery could have helped.			"

Posted: May 25, 2014
												*Acknowledgment*Before I delve into my review of Transistor, let me first state that I am first and foremost a tremendous fan of Supergiant Games. They released Bastion in a time I had ceased playing video games, because I found the quantity over quality insignia that most modern games paraded to be a bit much to bear. With that one release they managed to quickly overturn my decision to abstain from video games. So let me just say (to my own fault) that I have a very soft spot for the company and the diligent employees they keep.*End Acknowledgment*- With the acknowledgment in mind, I would like to begin with the good about Transistor.The strongest point for the whole game, in my opinion of course, is the soundtrack produced by Darren Korb. I could create a lengthy description for this, instead, I will just tell you “listen to the soundtrack”. The man is probably one of the best composers in video game culture, that is all.The artwork of Jen Zee is a wonderful thing to behold, and deserves to be seen. This game is no exception to that. As well, as always, Logan Cunningham's voice acting is an equal treat.The setting, world building, and most of the story are solid and deserve recognition.These things all speak strongly for themselves and no words I can put to them will do them justice.- Now with the bad.The battle system, while tremendously innovative, is irritating at best. I respect their attempt, but it clearly needed a great deal more work for creating a sense of balance. It contains all of the elements of strategy and turn-based RPGs that could be considered bad, without any of the rewards, progression, or smoothness. All in all, I feel that this aspect alone could have used at least another few months of consideration, if not a year, as it just feels hastily prepared and self-righteous.The length of the game adds to the feeling of speedy preparation without consideration. Now don't get me wrong, There are some situations where a small number of episodes, or a few hours of your time can move a piece of multimedia to create a lengthy wake of contentedness. This is not one of those cases and while replay is certainly an option, I feel completely no urge to do so. They try to expand the game with a number of puzzle based battle-challenges to unlock songs within the game, but that would bring us back to the battle system.The last of what I say rests with the story. This section contains a number of ***spoilers,*** so you should move on if you do not want this portion of the game revealed and I will post when spoilers are finished. As a majority, the story is interesting, explorative, and at many points, compelling. There are a few points within it, however, that while I understand most probably lend themselves to a particular ideology or thematic pursuit, are what I feel to be gargantuan mistakes in not only the story of the game, but in writing as a whole.With the exception of Royce, each and every confrontation with the Camerata was unfulfilling, if not completely vapid of context. The characters are introduced in a very dynamic scene where they murder Red's implied and nameless lover, which is roughly the most substance you are going to get from them. The battle with Sybil is almost confusing because it feels out of place and unexplored. We do have the before mentioned cut scene, yes, but that is all we have at that point and all we get. Then we move on to Asher, and the seemingly implied arch-nemesis, Grant. Here we receive a number of communications with Asher along the way, which seem to be imploring you to garner at least a little bit of sympathy, if not just understanding for these characters. However, finally reaching them and discovering they had committed suicide, without properly introducing these supposed antagonists was (pardon my language) a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor story decision and shows (with evidence from the fantastic story writing in Bastion) that this was either a very unconsidered, or very lazy writing decision. I must apologize for my harshness in this respect, but I feel like I can give nothing but honesty to a company who's work I am so partial of.I must say that all of the confrontation/interaction with Royce felt incredibly well developed and was by far the most interesting part of the entire tale (with a lot of good progression leading up to it).  However, the suicide of Red not only seemed entirely uncharacteristic of a protagonist who pursued the Camerata so vigorously despite her nameless lover beckoning her not to, and who also fought so desperately to prolong her life against Royce's assail to emerge to a world she can attempt to make a better place, but it also felt like an incredibly unnecessary punch to garner some strong emotional response. At pulling on heartstrings, Red's death was certainly success, but it was at the cost of abandoning all character and story development up to this point.Now if there is an alternate ending I am unaware of, I would be willing to explore further. With things as they are though, I don't see my self playing this game again at any point in the near future.***end spoilers***I had to take a lot of time to mull over how precisely I felt overall with this game, and as much as I truly desire to give this game a thumbs up, I am needing to go with the opposing thumbs down.I do wish Supergiant a great deal of success and hope that any future releases are true gems that speak for the greatness that I know they are ultimately capable of. Also, perhaps my response to Transistor may be best summed up by the Buddhist phrase “Expectation is the root of all disappointment”. Many people are really loving this game, and I will continue to have my gamer soft-spot for Supergiant Games, but in continuing with honesty, this game needed more development and consideration for gameplay and story and I'll just have to sit-back an enjoy the soundtrack and artwork while waiting for the next release.

												It isn't fun.Don't mince words with any junk about how it made you cry. Don't waste your time singing the praises of a video game because of its art or its music or (god help you) its story.The movement is slow and clunky. Pretty much every attack option leaves you wide open to enemy fire (your enemies suffer no such restrictions, of course).The idea is that you're going to freeze time and belt out a series of attacks, but every time you do that it stops being an action RPG and becomes a plain old RPG. After freezing time, you can only attack out of Turn with the aid of upgrades (for individual moves), so your choices are to be effective in combat or to be involved in the combat, basically.There's some genuinely cool ideas. No one's going to deny that. Combining all your moves to give them cool side-effects is really nifty, the setting is fascinating (and ties directly into the gameplay) and there's real merit to blending strategy with action like this. But it all sort of falls flat on its face with how uninvolved it is.All Transistor needed was a couple more mobile attacks, the sort of thing you can use on the move or that doesn't slow you down massively, and a dodge roll.♥♥♥♥♥♥that gives you REAL options when you don't want to use Turn.It put in a flourish and a sing-song button instead.Make of that what you will.

												WARNING: SLIGHT SPOILERS, SO IF YOU HAVE WEAK METABOLISMS, READ THE LAST PARAGRAPH!!!Supergiant Games have done it again. Transistor is a beautiful game that blends both gameplay and story so fluently that I forget that I am playing a game at times. The story begins with a mute singer who has just experienced her attempted murder, only to be saved by a bystander. The savior's voice and soul are transferred to the sword, which she carries around to find out what is happening to her city, and off you go.One thing that stood out to me was the narrator's voice this time around makes more sense to actually hear, instead of Bastion's narrator, who you just sort of, could hear all the time for no real explanation. I know this really wasn't much of an issue in Bastion, but I like to see how the writers have grown up even more than Bastion's amazing story, which leads to another improvement: terminals. We've all been there trying to collect audio logs, but this time around, it's a bit different. Since Red has no voice, these terminals provide ways to communicate with the Transistor, which gives the player more motivation to go after them, rather than just skim over the story. Personally, I think this is a genius way to integrate both the present and the past stories of the game into one.With such a great story, there has to be some glitches involved. My main problem is after the ending. And don't get me wrong, I LOVED the ending. I never thought how that would be the end, and it was a good conclusion to the arcing story between Red and her sword. But the problem is afterwards, the Recursion. In Bastion, there was a reason to play it over, as there were references to how you ended the game before, and as such have a different experience as before. But now, the game was ended with only one choice, so there really was no point to replay it, except for gameplay value. I guess the developers were going for a more linear story, which is perfectly fine, but I just expected a similar weave to the story as Bastion.Now, I mentioned gameplay before, and it is good. Not amazing, but good. It takes Bastion's hack-and-slash type and mixes a bit of turnbased action. When a Turn is activated, one can move freely across the field setting up attacks, using up your meter above to do so. Once you are done, you then watch your actions and hopefully dominate the field. The catch with using this system is that you must wait for the meter to fill up again before you may attack again, in Turn or out of. I find that is a good balance, but if you aren't able to dominate a powerful enemy in your Turn, then you are pretty much screwed. Luckily for me, I actually liked the Turn system, but if you don't, you may not have fun with the game, especially towards the end with Man enemies, and the final boss. Which brings up what happens when you die. When Red is defeated in a battle (hence the Turn meter is down and you lose all health), she loses a function that you have under the abilities bar, and you can't get it back until you reach two different function stations. This is an interesting aspect, but it can be quite annoying, as it is often random on what you lose. For example, I once lost my main attack function, and was left with my dodge and my load functions, which do nothing in battle without a good attack. I guess this is the point as it punishes you for losing rather than just spawning you to the last checkpoint, but in my eyes, it is ultimately just wasting my time as it adds not much towards my experience except annoyance.Another issue is the extensive upgrade system. There were many combinations that one could make with their functions, but the problem was the GUI. You had to go through each function one at a time to see what upgrade you could add to a function. This could've been simply fixed by the ability to compare the upgrades with each function, rather than the other lengthy way. Not much of an issue, but it can be hectic near the ending when you have ten functions you have to go through at a time.Lastly, the art style. Remember Bastion's art style? How alive the world felt? Well, magnify that by 10, and add some city elements towards the environment, and you got Transistor. The colors vibrate off the screen, and you wish that the city, maybe even the enemies, were existent. Really, there isn't much to say, but to just look at. I once just stopped playing and watched the background for a good minute. The artists know to not mess with a good formula, and luckily they didn't.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NO MORE SPOILERS AFTER, LAST PARAGRAPH/VERDICTTransistor truly adds more to the Bastion formula, but it still latches a bit too closely towards Bastion. However, this isn't a bad thing, as Supergiant Games are playing it safe and not making a completely different game, which is what we want. We want the same feel of atmosphere from Bastion, which we got with more interactions but less replayability. We want the same gameplay feel, which we got with more options but less hack-and-slash. And we want the same story and experience, which we got with more passion but less nonlinearity. So, do I recommend Transistor? If you liked Bastion and like a bit of change, you'll love this new addition. I sure did.			"

I don't get the plot, which is amazing considering how much talking that damn memory-stick-for-a-sword does. At the onset, characters are introduced in quantity and events transpire rapidly... I promptly acquired an unrecoverable amount of plot knowledge debt. Storywise, Transistor quickly spreads out in width, but not in depth... not until my anticipation had degenerated into indifference. I perpetually felt one step behind whatever was happening.Transistor has a hybrid real-time/turn-based combat system (which makes up the bulk of the game) that isn't worth dwelling on. It's admirably done, and there's surely an audience for it, but I found it repetitive, predictable and boring.The way that Red's skills are managed however... this is the good stuff. The real good stuff. Your combat abilities are called ""functions"". They sit in a great, big uncategorized pile. You can combine and use them however you see fit. Functions can be ""installed"" in 1 of 3 ways; as one of your 4 active abilities, as upgrades to those 4 abilities, or as passives. There are combinations that work very well, and combinations that work very poorly. Playing around with them is a treat. And you WILL play around with different function combinations whether you like it or not... because when your health runs out, rather than die, you lose the use of an active function. It stays disabled for long enough that you'll be compelled to replace it with something else in the meantime. It's a clever alternative to traditional gaming death that doesn't break flow, does invoke a penalty, AND promotes experimentation. Out of desperation, I was forced into using function combinations that I never would have otherwise... and oftentimes the effects were a pleasant surprise.I believe that other people will find virtue or indifference where I find fault. Thumbs up and uninstalled.			"

												Transistor portrays an excellent story over an incredible world, that, states very nearly nothing, forcing players to have to piece it together through the limited dialogue of the supporting cast, and story logs from the abilities.The combat of the game is very unique, yet slightly reminiscent to that of Parasite Eve, with an incredible 38,416 potential uses for those functions.As for aesthetic, this is one of the two areas that the game outshines any and all competition (arguably, even that of Bastion) with a purely phenomenal and atmospheric soundtrack, that goes along outstandingly well with the awe-inspiring beauty of the visuals.

												This is easily one of the most beautiful games I have played.  This was recommended by two of my friends and I am so glad I listened.  This is a game to be savored.  If you are looking for cheap thrills and shallow action, then this is not the game for you.  Do not get me wrong, I love that stuff.  But, this game is something altogether different.  If I had to select one word that best described the gameplay and story, it would be elegant.  Beauty aside, this game is really fun and a reminder of what a game can be if the developers really cared about it.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game to any real gamer who loves the art of video games and what this medium can accomplish.  This is one of those games that stays with you.  We need more games like Transistor.  I need them.			"

												Another great game by Supergiant Games, though very different from their first, Bastion.The combat in Transistor involves a highly flexible ability system that lets you mix and match your abilities to create new abilities that play out in real time combat with some turn based elements. The combat constantly makes players choose when the optimal time to use their slotted abilities are, and when to use the planning mode (a mode that freezes enemies while you queue up and then execute some abilities before the enemies get to move again) as using abilities or planning mode can put things on cool down and make you vulnerable for follow up.However the combat does start a bit slow as you only start with a couple abilities and unlock both more abilities and more upgrade slots (the slots that let you combine abilities) as you go, so it starts slow but picks up fast as you go along. Similarly enemies are very easy at the start and most players will find fights fairly easy till most of the upgraded late game enemies start showing up. If those still aren't enough for you, you can activate ""Limiters"" which are optional and make the game even harder (such as spawning more enemies and make them do 2x damage).The story is very good and personally I enjoyed it even more than Bastion, though it is done very differently. Where Bastion gave the player a lot of knowledge, including knowledge the players character wouldn't know, and all but held the players hand through the story, Transistor gives you story through the eyes of it's characters, and it's up to the player to gain an understanding of what is going on in the story through the information their character is given throughout the game. This gives the story greater depth and immersion, but can also make the story more difficult for some people to understand or for those who skip through a lot of the dialogue. If you want to know everything about the in-game world then you might not enjoy the story of Transistor, however if you like to see a story from the view of a character present at the time and immersion that can bring, then you will probably find the story of Transistor amazing.Finally the length of the game runs about 5-6 hours. There is NG+ (and I hear NG++, though I haven't quite gotten there yet) and you can get further upgrades for playing NG+ so if you enjoy the gameplay there is some incentive to play past the ending of the story (you can get a couple hours of gameplay just trying out different ability loadouts with the amount of combinations available), though if you only want the game for story then there isn't much incentive for multiple play throughs unless you want to revisit the story.In summary the game is simply amazing. Both the combat and the story have a lot of depth to them. Though players who want the story spelled out for them or more twitch based combat may want to consider looking elsewhere. For those coming from Bastion know that this game is great as well but it is also VERY different, so don't expect Bastion 2.0 in a sci-fi setting, both the gameplay and story are done in a very different fashion so be sure to keep that in mind if you decide to pick it up.

												Gorgeous art, great soundtrack, and excellent gameplay mechanics. It's definitely worth getting, and an excellent way to spend a few hours. The story is the weakest area; it doesn't tell you everything, and you need to do a lot of unlocking to get all the pieces that are offered. Background information on very important characters is only given in the second playthrough. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad story; it just gives you enough to pick your curiosity and leaves a lot to your imagination.			"

												Transistor is one of those artsy-fartsy games that also happen to have great mechanics. You get to mix, match, and augment abilities together in probably hundreds of different ways, so you can create your own unique fighting style or try someone else's optimized build. The art and music are top notch, as other reviews will undoubtedly remark on. Some of the songs were catchy enough that they resurfaced in my mind weeks and months later, and I couldn't recall what they were from, only that it must have been good.The character design is also worthy of praise, especially the dynamic duo of protagonists: A singer who's lost her voice, and a sword who's lost everything but his voice.The setting could be considered cyberpunk, but to me it has more of a computer programming theme as there are analogous concepts that are more easily understood by the technologically literate. Transistor's story can be confusing and a tad controversial, but I'm of the opinion that it had plenty of depth. If you like puzzling things out in your games you'll love it, if not then you might still enjoy the gameplay. It's relatively short if you're not into the whole ""new game plus"" thing. So why not dive into Cloudbank's pseudo-digital ocean and see if you can swim.			"

												The world looks amazing, the music throughout the game absolutely wonderful, and the gameplay solid, deep, varied and interesting. The amount of skills and the possible different combinations that you get are mind boggling, and most have very significant effects on the way you play the game. Combat can be done strategicaly with the Turn mode, or just plain old regular real time action, and are just equally as viable and fun!Though you are presented with a central plot, much of the lore is tied to the gameplay in an interesting manner and presented in a way that not only allows you the freedom of choosing how much of it you want to read/see/hear, but also adds to the sublime world Supergiant has created. The game has atmosphere, it has character, and it's a testament to how good Supergiant is at building a world, which in my opinion, is second to none.Despite how different this game is from Supergiant's previous game, Bastion, to compare both games is inevitable. Cloudbank is in most ways busier than the areas surrounding Caelondia, but its aethetics are darker and more muted. The music in Transistor is a bit more synthetic compared to the more instrumental nature of Bastion's music, but is no less wonderful. Gameplay wise, Transistor outperforms Bastion in every which way, offering more options and a more fleshed out combat system. Narrative wise though, it feels like Transistor falls short of Bastion by way of being just slightly less coherant and emotional. But, it is still really well done and stands on its own really well.My only complaints about the game is how short it is, because I find myself just wanting MORE. While Recursion mode (New Game+) satisfies my desire for more gameplay, I also want more of the story, more of the music, and more of the world. Also, the game sometimes fails to explains the mechanics of its skills properly, leaving you to either figure some things out for yourself or consult a guide.  Should you play this? Absolutely. Definitely do consider buying the soundtrack alongside the game, but do not hesitate to give the music a listen first by way of free streaming courtesy of Supergiant themselves. I only wish the soundtrack had the different variations of all/most of the songs, such as the BGMs with Red humming to them, or the instrumental versions of a few others.http://store.supergiantgames.com/products/transistor-original-soundtrack-digitalUPDATE: Supergiant has released an extended version of the soundtrack with the aforementioned humming and instrumental verions.

												Mini Transistor review (spoiler free): I'll start out by saying a lot of love went into that game. The music, sound design, voice acting, and overall art direction are top notch, which is all the more impressive when you find out that a team of twelve built this game from the ground up. The painted world feels just as beautiful as Bastion's, even though you won't be visiting locations that are as varied.The combat can be a little confusing at first do to the sheer number of ability combinations and the amount of planning that's involved, but you definitely get the hang of it with some experimentation. You will feel kind of limited initially since you won't have enough ""memory"" to equip and use all your abilities with passives and upgrades. As a result you will be sitting there with a lot of your ability, upgrade and passive slots empty, even at the end of the game. The difficulty feels like it scales quite nicely. As the game progresses enemies will upgrade in parallel with you, gaining new abilities as you gain tem yourself. And if you feel like the game is still too easy you can equip ""limiters"" (similar to the shrines in bastion) to make the enemies more difficult, which allows you to get a bonus to experience. I did wish there was an easier way to see some of your stats. You will have to do a bit of digging in order to find out what exactly what your health, damage, ability cost, and turn() values are.I clocked the game in at around 10 hours, though I spent a lot of time tinkering and trying to figure out the best combinations of abilities, upgrades and passives, and I did all the challenges you can unlock initially. I thought the story was a little weaker than bastions in that you have to do a lot more investigating to figure out exactly what's going on and the world doesn't feel as integrated with the gameplay. After beating the game I felt like I knew the broad strokes of  what was going on, but I felt like there are definitely some gaps to fill. Hopefully with new game+  I will uncover some new information. With all that being said, its still a great bittersweet tale to experience.TLDR: Great game, decent  story, good blend of action and strategy, and awesome art direction. 8.5/10			"

												...This game is a work of art. From the gorgeous style, to the genre choice, to the fantastic music, to the characters who initially just seem like ghosts of what they could be, yet slowly grow on you. The lines are well done, and everyone winds up having a personality of some kind that you begin to relate to them. The combat is fresh, not something I've seen before (and I've been gaming a long time mind you), and they didn't slack there either. I played with a lot of limiters, but even without them, I can tell you that this one will take you a little while to get used to and will definitely test you. It's a strange blend of action, strategy, RPG, turn based combat, and even shooter all mixed together into a masterful blend that I initially dreaded, and by the end of the game (fantastic ending) was in love with.This is the sort of game that was made with passion and dreams. This is the quality of game and the determination to make a fantasy that stands out amongst other dreams real for us gamers. I highly recommend this game, and I'm not entirely sure what audience I could think of that wouldn't find something appealing here. Talking swords, sci-fi, angry hardware trying to take over the world, over-eager scientists, lasers, giant explosions, godzilla-esque monsters, and VERY frustrating hairstyles... yeah, this game has a lot of nice quirks worked in all throughout. You'll love it.			"

												I think Transistor is a game I'd recommend to pretty much everyone who wants to play a good indie game.The art is mesmerizing, the soundtrack fits perfectly and the characters are all interesting. You have to connect the dots yourself to come up with the whole story. It's very similar to an anime called ""Serial Experiments Lain"" in that sense. The whole game challenges and treats the player as someone who has enough intellect to fully grasp and learn the gameplay by himself. It mixes action rpg with turn-based strategy. I didn't like it so much, but I guess that's just a matter of preference.The ending is shocking, but makes a lot of sense given the context.However, despite me highly recommending the game it is indeed very short. But it does have a high replay value.I wouldn't buy it for the full price, but I bought it at around 60% off which is a great deal imo.			"

												Transistor excels in so many ways, I don't even know where to start.It essentially accomplished what a game means most to me: innovative gameplay mechanics, good storytelling, and state-of-the-art visuals, design, and music. But what makes Transistor stands out so much is that it demonstrated immense strength in all of the areas.Game MechanicsAt first, it seems like a generic hack-and-slash game (that is, you simply walk around and beat things up with your ""skills""). That's not how half of Transistor works. Later it will reveal a new mechanic that allows you to literally pause the game and plan out your next actions. This is the true beauty of Transistor: you get the action-packed combat mixed together with a strategic problem-solving manoeuver, allowing you to experiment on how you can chain together different moves, and knowing which combo is best used for which situation.In Transistor, you get to equip 4 ""skills"" at a time, known as Functions. Functions works in such a way that each function could be operated either as an Active slot, an Upgrade to enhance your Active Function, or a Passive slot that grants you certain perks in combat. Once you get a number of Functions, the possiblities of Function combinations are endless. This is where Transistor truly shines, and after finishing this game twice, I have probably yet to discover hundreds of other possible Function combinations to work on.The ArtSupergiant Games is renowned for its stunning visual art and unforgettable soundtracks, and Transistor is the best example you can get. All the background art you see in the game is hand-painted, and every music piece is woven seamlessly to the game. Besides, Supergiant Games made a really sweet move of creating the main character as a singer. Almost all the elements of the game revolved around her music — your character lost her voice and you're determined to get it back, you get to hear her humming to her own tunes, and you could unlock in-game soundtracks which you can play anytime. Basically, music is an integral part of Transistor, and Supergiant Games did an amazing job on this.Transistor's backstory may seem mediocre at first, but everything slowly unravels, and it all builds up until the last chapter (watching the end credits broke my heart into pieces). The story was presented in such a way that you have to head to different spots along the landscape and get a hint of what's going on. Even each Function actually originates from a character, so each Function has a story to tell. In order to fully appreciate the story, I suggest you inspect all the Functions and every nook and corner you find (or simply head over to the wiki, everything is there). There's also a sword that talks. Nothing is better than a talking weapon.ConclusionI believe that Transistor is the hallmark of an innovative game produced by creative minds. It's not something you get to see very often in these few years, so I fully recommend it to anyone who loves games as a means of entertainment and artistic expression.TL;DR, Transistor excels in every aspect, innovative and refreshing game mechanics, great artistical value, and nothing beats a talking sword.

												Thumbs up because:- Pretty- Quality voice actor (a true rarity!)- Flexible combat skill management system- Innovative non-death penalties for losingShame I don't enjoy playing it.

I don't get the plot, which is amazing considering how much talking that damn memory-stick-for-a-sword does. At the onset, characters are introduced in quantity and events transpire rapidly... I promptly acquired an unrecoverable amount of plot knowledge debt. Storywise, Transistor quickly spreads out in width, but not in depth... not until my anticipation had degenerated into indifference.

The real good stuff. Your combat abilities are called ""functions"". They sit in a great, big uncategorized pile. You can combine and use them however you see fit. Functions can be ""installed"" in 1 of 3 ways; as one of your 4 active abilities, as upgrades to those 4 abilities, or as passives. There are combinations that work very well, and combinations that work very poorly. Playing around with them is a treat. And you WILL play around with different function combinations whether you like it or not... because when your health runs out, rather than die, you lose the use of an active function. It stays disabled for long enough that you'll be compelled to replace it with something else in the meantime. It's a clever alternative to traditional gaming death that doesn't break flow, does invoke a penalty, AND promotes experimentation. Out of desperation, I was forced into using function combinations that I never would have otherwise... and oftentimes the effects were a pleasant surprise.I believe that other people will find virtue or indifference where I find fault.

												Another quality experience from SuperGiant Games.  The gameplay itself was solid.  Being able to mix and match all of the existing powers in so many ways had a great sandbox feel to it.  However, all of the enemy encounters were very scripted, limiting how long you could experiment.  It saddened me a little that the gameplay was confined to these short bursts of action.  I'm not sure if it was done this way in order to preserve the points of narration, or becuase the art was just so good, from such a small studio.  I wonder if the game may have felt longer if the presentation of the combat had been approached differently. However, the combat that was there was very enjoyable, with lots of quirks to explore.  The music, art, and story were all superb.  But, these only feel on par because of what was sacraficed to attain them - gameplay and length of the game. The new game+ is required to get all of the game's achievements, yet doesn't add anything of value except for more gameplay.  This feels lazy to me, the gameplay should have been scaled for a single playthough instead of forcing the player to loop through again.  It might have some significance to the story, but that doesn't justify forcing the player to do everything again.  But for all of the picking I'm doing, I do recommend the game.  The first time I played it through, the experience was incredibly tight, the story sucked me in, and I was equally enthralled by the gameplay and the art.  I recommend this game, but maybe wait for the steam sales.			"

One of the best games that I've ever played. Supergiant games made a lot of work. And their work we see now. It's great. This design of levels. This music. This EVERYTHING. Guys, this game is beautiful. You should try it :)			"

												Transistor portrays an excellent story over an incredible world, that, states very nearly nothing, forcing players to have to piece it together through the limited dialogue of the supporting cast, and story logs from the abilities.The combat of the game is very unique, yet slightly reminiscent to that of Parasite Eve, with an incredible 38,416 potential uses for those functions.As for aesthetic, this is one of the two areas that the game outshines any and all competition (arguably, even that of Bastion) with a purely phenomenal and atmospheric soundtrack, that goes along outstandingly well with the awe-inspiring beauty of the visuals. Another game in which Darren Korb shows that he has the complete inability to make a bad song.			"

												A short story driven RPG with an interesting tactics based stregical combat.  The art and soundtrack in this game are oozing with a cyberpunk style, with the same bold, colour saturated graphics of the successful ""Bastion"".  The combat system has a significant depth, with skills used not only to perform attacks but also to modify the way those attacks work.  Unfortunatley, I found the game does little to encourage you to modify your skills, meaning much of this depth was somewhat lost. The story in the game is drip fed through beautiful cut scenes, Basion style narration and other interactive objects.  Further story and soundtracks can be unlocked via the games challenge mode.  This is were the skill system shined the most and demonstrated the best of its range.Overall, if you are into story driven games and the strong art style that supergiant games are known for you will end this game satisfied.

												I can often tell within the first hour or so of a game whether or not I will enjoy playing it. Sometimes a game takes longer than that to suck me in, but Transistor was not that game. From the quick opening, the clever combat design, the stunning world on display, the customization options presented to the player, the mysterious yet alluring characters introduced, and above all the incredible sound design and soundtrack, I'm hooked. After one hour in I can't wait to plug in again.Some other reviewers say the game starts slow and I agree with them - it has a quick opening and the story moves rather fast, but the game takes its time introducing you to things. But like a party where you find out that you want to be friends with every new person you meet, once you've gotten into it you won't want to leave.			"

												This is one of the best games of this year so far. In Transistor, enjoy the beautiful scenery as you attempt to make your way through the city, all the while trying to uncover the events that led up to this point. As the protagonist Red, you fight you way through multiple enemies in either of two ways: Analytical or Brute Force. Different classes call for different styles of fighting, all the while being very enjoyable. The visuals in this game are fantastic, and the soundtrack is something to behold in it of itself as Ashley Barrett vocalizes the mood of the game. Overall, I give this a 10/10 and will definitely be revisiting this very soon.			"

This game is so good that it instantly jumped into the list of my favorite games.The setting is amazing and very unique.Art is mesmerizing and consistent. Soundtrack works like a superglue between ears and headphones as well as between story and gameplay.Combat system is nothing like I've played before in the best way possible.Variety of skills and upgrades is virtually limitless.Story is nothing short of astonishing. Story ending 10/10.Adjust the difficulty any way you like using 10 different limiters in any combination.Replay as many times as you want using recursion. This starts new game with all the skills (functions) and upgrades from previous play-through.Challenge yourself in 5 different types of tests.I usually write longer reviews but decided to write short one this time so anyone who reads will spend less time reading and more time playing it.

												Following from their smash debut hit, Bastion, Supergiant Games raises the bar with yet another incredible title.Transistor boasts uniquely hand-drawn artwork and visuals (which catches the eye with splashes of color and design), an absolutely fantastic soundtrack (which reacts and changes seamlessly according to ambience, scripted events, character progression and actions), simple yet complex mechanics (isometric viewpoint similiar to Bastion, but with an added layer of turnbased combat, as well as mergeable skills and abilities), on top of another astounding narrative and a deeply layered plotline. Transistor is a carefully crafted product, lovingly refined and polished by a dedicated, creative and passionate team of developers, as well as an exceptional performance by Darren Korb and vocalist Ashley Lynn Barrett. Transistor is unfortunately a very short game (but as was previously seen in Bastion), comes complete with specific attributes or ""upgrades"" resulting in a much tougher experience. Transistor also incorporates another layer of replayability - Recurse, which allows you to replay various parts of the story, or if preferred, new game plus.All in all, Transistor is an absolutely fantastic, creative and unique video game and is deservedly a masterpiece in indie development! I highly recommend Transistor and it's seperately sold soundtrack as they are both most definitely worth the money and the time.			"

												Transistor has seriously become one of my favourite games of all time. Supergiant were criticised as a one-hit wonders with Bastion but they have come back with the artistic tour-de force that is Transistor. Through the wonderful handpainted art of Jen Zee and the beautiful tones of Darren Korb's soundtrack, you really get sucked into the abtract city that is Cloudbank and it's atmosphere. Transistor captures that fleeting moment of Red and The Transistor trying to make it through alive and to get to the bottom of everything. The pacing is on form, some people say its quite short (at 7 hours) but I feel its enough to tell the story that it needed to tell without overstaying its welcome. The world and characters gell so well and all feel completely new, helped by the wonderful narration and chemistry between the characters.Transistor isnt just all pretty picture, the ability system is quite different and completely customisable and promotes experimentation for completely different playstyles and the punishment for dying in game is one of the most original I've seen and actually adds to the experimentaion of the abilities.In short, to me Transistor feels like a masterpiece of a painting with a wonderful story, good solid gameplay mechanics and a soundtrack ties it up into one fantastic and intelligently beautiful experience.Transistor is a game that will stick with me for years to come, and for that Supergiant, thank you.(I played this game completely offline so thats why my gametime in it is ~0 hours)			"

The game's combat is really satsfying and the customization that you can put in your skills makes it even better. I really reccomend picking up this game, its absoulutely worth the 20 bucks.

												Riding very much off the coat tails of Supergiant's previous beloved, Bastion, Transistor has at least been built with some articulation of what made the spiritual predecessor so compelling. An absolutely gorgeous hand-painted cityscape with a woozy yet full-bodied soundtrack makes it clear Supergiant knew what the first thing that came to player's minds were. Throw in another smoky voiced narrator voice to follow the antangonist through to the end of the journey, and it would seem Transitor is on to another winner.Well... it fails in a couple of fundemental ways. Yes, we can recall the lovely artstyle, music, *that* voice actor for Bastion, but part of the universal charm was the slick, smooth combat to follow up on a compelling storyline. The former is failed with Transistor, exchanging for a slightly more clunky affair, your character taking a moment to attempt most attacks, even needing to recover from the jaunt ability. The wide variety of upgrades, potions and weapon combinations are exchanged for a universal sword, the namesake of the game, with four primary abilities where you can assign your collected powers as either secondary additions, upgrading potency, number or secondary functions of your powers, and four passive slots. It seems that this could hold a lot of potential, but for the most part those combinations don't surprise or allow for in-depth theorycrafting. You just slap what you like to your abilities, make them more powerful/numerous/have an extra projectile thrown in and mash away. The ""Turn()"" system also does now allow for much depth, particularly end-game considering how enemies enjoy countering or simply dodging your best laid plans.The story starts off incredibly promising. I was anticipating a very Film Noir experience thrown in to a heavy sci-fi (Read: Not cyberpunk) universe. Alas, it mostly repeats the same apocalyptic overtones of Bastion with an unsatisfactory and, frankly, confusing conclusion that leaves far, far more questions than answers and no clear antagonist to despise, the ""Big Bad"" showing up very late and with not much moustache twiddling to be had.There are a few neat little touches that I enjoyed: The slick UI and artwork is just as gorgeous as the rendered graphics, you can see other players on their adventure via Dark Souls-esque ghosts around you, and there is even a button to hold to make the protagonist, Red, hum out a lovely counter-melody to whatever soundtrack is playing at the time. There is also, apparently, a procedurally generated post-game series of challenges to experience, but... the gameplay just didn't grab me enough to really care.I can't *not* recommend this game. The narrator, again, just about makes it, and the relationship between him and Red's conclusion enough was sweet enough. It *is* satisfying to watch said best laid plans work out just as you expect and watch a screen full of baddies die in one little turn, and the world, despite confusing and mysterious, is at least dazzling to explore. £15 though? Wait for a sale. Even taking my sweet time I easily steamrolled through this bite-sized treat in six hours.			"

Red is such a compelling character and I want to find out what happened in the city the moment the game starts.I did not like the gameplay as much as Bastion, due to my persona preference of action rather than strategy, but that's not a major detractor for the whole experience.Highly recommend, Super Giant games are always great experiences.

Make one or two mistakes and even the most harmless enemy can get your HP down to 0, especially when you use a lot of limiters. Something you don't see often in games nowadays. Keeps you on your toes, and entertained.The game was indeed a bit short, but it was great notheless.I'll play it again because I'm pretty sure I missed some things.			"

												Transistor, SuperGiant's follow up to the incredible Bastion, somehow manages to improve on their previous offering in every conceivable way.  I'm going to avoid spoilers in this, so I'll be mindfully vague at points.The music is amazing.  I mean, if you just set it out on its own and listened to it, it is brilliant.  However, more than just that, the music is integral to the plot.  They use the music to tell the story via lyrics.  At times plot and music is blended so well it leads you to question whether they are diegetic or non-diegetic, not unlike brilliant pieces of film such as Trois Couleurs.  The graphics are aesthetically wonderful.  Myself, I've never been a big proponent of attemps to use realism in gaming, I far prefer a well done art style that fits the world we're playing in, and style is something that simply oozes out of Transistor.  From the usage of vibrant colours juxtaposed against stark white landscapes in later games to the deco styling prevalent throughout, you will drool over this game if you have any love of comics, art, or cartooning.  Absolutely wonderful.The story is a strong narrative told in an unorthodox way.  I'll be honest, this won't be for everyone.  The story isn't spoonfed to you, you need to work for it a bit.  You have to unlock all 3 facets of all your functions, read between the lines of conversations between characters, listen to all the terminal reports and only then, at end game, do you really start to pull everything together into a functional whole.  If you take the time, however, it does make it worth your while.  The game paints a stark portrait of Orwell mixed with Huxley to create a world of immediate and meaningful gratification that overwhelms the populace's drive for freedom and the ability to stand against a tyranny, whether purposeful or merely incidental, from the people who control it.  Hardly new or different in terms of a story, but told very well and in an interesting way.This game easily creeped into my top 5 of all time, can't recommend it heavily enough.			"

												This game is a thing of beauty. Like, seriously. If anyone ever tells you that vidyagames aren't art, just show them this lovely.Enough sweet talk, here are the pros 'n' cons:Pros - Gameplay is awesome and appeals to two kinds of players: Strategic ones and the Tanky ones. I loved the planning mode.- Beautiful visuals. The colours fit every scene nicely.- Gorgeous soundtrack that compliments Ashley Barret's voice. While it can be listened on its own, which i do often, the soundtrack reaches its full potential in-game.- Well made story that leaves the user with questions and room to speculate.- The narrative is even better in this one than in Bastion. (Not to say Bastion wasn't great, i loved it to bits) All the one-sided small talk The Transistor does is cute, hilarious, but still melancholic. I can't imagine being in a sword is fun after all.- The secrets you can discover and all the additional info about the residents of Cloudbank is intriguing and the unlocking of them forces the player to switch their playstyle from the usual set.- Great variety in enemies. Whew! That was a lot of pros, here are the cons.Cons - The loss of abilities and attacks or ""functions"" became frustrating to me. I get it, it makes you switch up your playstyle (which i complimented above), but i hated having to wait to get my favourite attacks back and it crippled me. Interesting gimmick, but not for me.- Many functions seem useless.-The game was unbearably short. Sure, there's always the replay mode that lets you keep your stats and functions, but resets the story. I don't like replaying a story, so not for me. I feel like they rushed the story.- Price is too high, in my opinion. It might be worth it to just get this in a sale. Unfortunately i missed my opportunity, so i decided to slap my wallet at GabeN, since i couldn't wait.  All in all, this game is fantastic. I'd recommend it to everyone and anyone. Just keep the cons i listed in mind.  "

												Transistor is a beautiful game, from the art, world and music. It shows what it would feel like if you were inside the most fancients and most elegant of computer architecture. The is really cute with using computer jargon in it's gameplay and story elements. Such as not having enough memory to load all your functions. The story seems good, but is easily missable, the game emplores you to look for the story via reading the terminals and listening to your transistor blade. Where Transistor really shines is it's combat and difficulty. The combat is very unique while it is in real time there is a turn based element where you can unload a series of attacks simultaneous but doing so will leave you vulnerable to attack. So juggling between the turn based and real time combat is challenging and fun. The side missions which are the speed/perfomance/planning test are optional and quite fun. The planning tests I found the most fun, where you must defeat all the enemies in one turn. I would have like to see more tests and test variety. The games difficulty is dictated by limiters. Which are positive buffs to the enemies or negative buffs on you, you can decide how many are activate. The more that are active the more harder the game is. There is just enough different types of enemies to keep things fresh. I would have liked to see more creative boss battles as well as more of them. The game is quite short clocking around 4 - 5 hours if you're just doing the main story only. But it has a lot of replay value in it's combat and difficulty. Highly recommend if you are looking for a neo noir futuristic RPG which tries something new.			"

 If The Great Gatsby were a video game I really don't write a lot of reviews, like, at all. But I enjoyed this game so much; it physically compelled me to do so. Rarely has a video game caused me to spout praises about it to millions of strangers on the interwebs. This one did, big time.  Artistic direction, plot development (no spoilers) It's hard to talk about this game without mentioning the stylized presentation. Transistor shows influences from Supergiant's previous game, Bastion. Whereas Bastion's toon-like presentation contrasted with the somber themes the game explored, in Transistor, the developers made the game feel almost impressionistic. Cutscenes and plot elements are introduced in parts and pieces on a background palette of neon lights and gilded society. Much like how Bioshock gives you the choice of picking up optional voxaphones, the clarifying parts of Transistor's story are introduced via optional newscasts and recordings. The female protagonist looks like she stepped out from the Roaring Twenties, and the game feels and plays like a jaunt through The Great Gatsby if the book also featured murderous enemies at every turn. The protagonist's accomplice will narrate and banter with her throughout the game. Plot elements are introduced organically, and it's almost too easy to feel the emotions behind choices and actions the protagonist takes despite her being pretty much mute for the entire game. I found myself satisfied in almost every artistic aspect.  Music and voice acting The original soundtrack. Is. Awesome. The writter and producer of the soundtrack, Darren Korb, describes the music as ""old-world electronic post-rock."" Ashley Barrett, who sings many of the lyrical songs in the game, is suberb at giving the protagonist's (past) voice. The music strikes that rare balance where if you stop to appreciate it, it may just steal your breath away, but it's never intrusive when you're getting mauled by enemies in the heat of battle. Narration by the protagonist's accomplice is sassy, hilarious, conversational, and at times heartwrenching. It gives a sense of how the two interacted with one another in the past. Other characters who make appearances are memorable and unique; each character has their own linguistic quirks that differentiate their speakers. Nothing cookie cutter here.   Gameplay Combat is tight, clean, and rewarding. Gameplay happens in real-time, but the protagonist has the ability to pause time and lay out a series of combat moves reminiscent of KOTOR or X-Com. Battle abilities are acquired sequentially through plot and with every level the protagonist gains, and they can be mixed and matched to create endless variability, damage potential, and combat philosophies. Each ability is linked with character backstory that is unlocked through use, which encourages you to try novel combinations of skills. Enemies scale in difficulty reasonably and foes behave logically. They will heal damaged allies. They will buff their tank as he smashes your face in. And they will cause headaches for you if you aren't careful. For added challenge, the game features handicaps that make gameplay much harder but will reward the protagonist bonus experience. There is also a built-in, plot appropriate haven of sorts that the protagonist can access for scenario battles and a sandbox practice mode. After the first playthrough, you have the option of starting over again with a game-plus mode, retaining all progress with enemies starting out much stronger. It is one of the few games where I didn't think twice about playing the game again right after I beat it. And I played it until I got every single achievement and searched every single corner. It made me neglect basic necessities like eating. And sleep. And personal hygiene. And I didn't mind. Overall While writing this review, it was actually quite difficult for me to separate discrete pieces of this game into music, gameplay, etc. It is such a well integrated package that one aspect is in complete alignment with another. Gameplay introduces plot. Narrative augments gameplay. And the art pulls you into the gameplay. And the feels. Oh, does this game have the feels. The only other game that I can remember that has left me feeling like this is Portal. They are both a bit on the shorter side in terms of gameplay length, but the density of gameplay is tremendous. The white dwarf star of games really. Every moment feels meaningful, nothing is drawn out. There are no ♥♥♥♥♥♥ parts to this game. It is pure, concentrated fun with a shot of the feels right where it hurts. But it hurts so good.10/10 would (and did) play this game again (and again). And I honestly think this game is worth its full retail price.			"

												This game is gorgeous. Supergiant Games has stunned us with Bastion already and I wouldn't think that they will come up with something as good as Bastion. It's gone further than Bastion maybe not with its story but with gameplay, soundtracks, art and references to computer science. Transistor has taken its place in the top games of my life.			"

												Transistor left me spechless. At the time it came out I didn't even had a chance to put my hands on Supergiant Games Bastion, so I had to play it first, so I could feel the style of its developer. And now that I played both I can say that the game feel was surely saved (if not enhanced). The graphics are just fascinating. Bastion also has great visuals, but the setting here is different and comparing these two is kind of stupid. Can say the same about the music. As a Kid, you had to put up a new home for yourself and the others, you were the only hope, the person that felt kind of sad and scared of the burden, but on the other hand brave and ready for the unexpected. And so is the music. Transistor puts you in a sci-fi city, and the situation Red is in is really tough - her voice is stolen, the man that is close to her heart is stabbed with a somewhat electronic sword, and there is a group of people that are chasing her. Most songs have that post-rock feel to them, which made me melancholic and sad, and relaxed at the same time. But there is one thing I'm sure about - the soundtrack to Transistor is something else.Since it's hard to not to compare it to Bastion, I need to say one thing - it really is a great enchanting game, but Bastion is a bit better, imo. There are not much games that give you goosebumps, but both of the games did that to me. !!Bastion Spoilers!! The part where you're carrying Zulf back to the Bastion, accompanied by the Setting Sale, Coming Home song was much more impressive than the Transistor ending. Maybe the culmination part of Transistor should have the ending song being played during it, but anyway, that's just my opinion. Transistor is still a great game, and it's definitely 10/10. I recommend it to everyone who played Bastion, and to everyone who likes the game's plot to make you slightly sad, but satisfied.			"

												Nota completa en Liberen al Geek (Supergiant Games: Bastion & Transistor): http://liberenalgeek.com/2015/09/01/supergiant-games-bastion-transistor/En el 2013 apareció un pequeño trailer mostrando el nuevo proyecto en desarrollo, Transistor, el cuál nos dejó con muchas ansias hasta su salida un año después. ¿Contexto? Universo Cyberpunk. ¿Protagonista? Red, una famosa cantante a quien le quitaron su voz. ¿Historia? Despertamos al lado de nuestro novio, quien ha sido a♥♥♥♥♥♥ado por una espada, Transistor. ¿Llega al nivel del Bastion? Totalmente pero a pesar de asemejarse en muchos aspectos, también se diferencia en muchos otros.   La ciudad de Cloudbank está siendo atacada por el Proceso, un ejército de inteligencia robótica que está acabando con distintas personas de influencia, como Red. Los responsables de estos ataques son The Camerata, un grupo integrado por cuatro personas interesadas por recuperar la espada y a los cuales perseguiremos en busca de respuestas. El trasfondo de los mismos es muy interesante, cuentan con una personalidad y motivos muy definidos.  La  protagonista no estará sola, ya que el hombre que encontramos a nuestro lado y fue “capturado” por Transistor nos hablará (al estilo de Rucks) y guiará para que descubramos de a poco quién es. O quién era.   El estilo del juego puede parecer similar a simple vista, pero acá se ve un combate mucho más profundo, con la novedad de poder pausar el combate y planear nuestros ataques. En este estado utilizaremos puntos de acción (dependiendo la habilidad nuestros movimientos serán mayores o menores) y tendremos bonificaciones de experiencia si encadenamos combos correctamente.    En esta oportunidad tenemos a nuestra disposición 4 ataques para elegir que iremos encontrando a lo largo del juego y podremos disponer muchas combinaciones entre ellas- ya sea utilizándolas para atacar o para mejorar otro poder-.  En ciertos lugares de la ciudad, podemos acceder a una sala llamada Sandbox, un segmento de playa donde podremos descansar, escuchar canciones del juego mientras disfrutamos una vista increíble (me he quedado horas utilizando este lugar como reproductor de música) y nuevamente aparecen Challenges bastante difíciles, que nos darán experiencia y nuevos tracks para disfrutar.Visualmente es hermoso, no hay otra palabra para describirlo. Cada rincón, personaje, enemigo y detalle brilla por si solo.  Mención especial al soundtrack que nuevamente es un placer para nuestros oídos, con un estilo muy acorde a la atmósfera del juego. Tenemos la posibilidad de hacer que Red tararee la canción que está sonando en ese momento cosa que hará también automáticamente cuando pausemos el combate. Luego de finalizar la historia, desbloquearemos el modo New Game +, en el cuál podemos comenzar de nuevo manteniendo nuestros upgrades e items, pero también sucederán cosas nuevas y aparecen ciertos guiños, lo que resulta en una experiencia distinta y no tan forzosa. El juego en sí no es muy largo y seguro se queden con ganas de más (aunque tiene un final más que satisfactorio),  en todo caso si no están seguros pueden esperar a una oferta y conseguirlo a menor precio  (en mi opinión, vale su full price).

												Wow! What a game! Thrusting you right into the action, Transistor begins with Red and her companion the Transistor; a hybrid magical and technological omnipotent sword. With the Transistor by your side and acting as the narrator, you make your may through CloudBank, a futuristic utopia where everyone has a voice, whether that be what the weather will be, to what food your favorite restaurant will serve that day. But underneath it all something is brewing, and it is up to you to unstir the great storyline that this game has to offer.The game contains very engaging combat that can either be done on the fly, or via a tactical planning phase where the user is allowed a certain amount of actions per turn. Each mode has their own strengths and weaknesses, but while the planning mode may leave you vulerable for a few seconds after you have had your turn to act, it definitely seems to be better in almost all cases over the on the fly version. Although the combat in this game is great, Supergiant Games once again proves that they are king when it comes to art direction. The music in the game is a masterpiece, constantly setting the mood of the game as you progress throughout the many streets of CloudBank. This combined with the stellar hand drawn backgrounds and beautiful 2.5D art style makes it pure audio and visual bliss.Though some may disagree that Supergiant Games have not created a game as good as Bastion, I wholeheartedly disagree. Transistor is something different. Something that cannot be compared to Bastion, and something special that must be experienced by everyone. Get this game, you will NOT regret it.			"

												Better than Bastion?  Maybe.  Like the previous offering from Supergiant Games, Transistor delivers on multiple fronts:1. Visuals: Transistor is aesthetically beautiful in a way that few other games are and if Supergiant continues down this particular road, all of its games will be instantly recognizable.2. Sound: The same awesome narration with a new voice follows us into Transistor.  It's topped off by another beautiful soundtrack from the Supergiant team that you'll want to listen to many times after completing the game.3. Gameplay: Where some might have found the gameplay in Bastion a little simplified, Transistor kicks it up with a hybrid turn-based/real-time combat system, numerous weapon combinations and enemies with unique abilities that make battlefield strategizing more of a priority.4. Story: Perhaps the only place where I could knock this game, Transistor follows in the footsteps of Bastion with a couple interesting twists and a really solid story backed up by bits of in-game lore, but leaves some of the world-building up to player theorizing.  This can be a positive or negative depending on what you're looking for in a game.  Regardless, Transistor still manages to craft a compelling narrative that outstrips a lot of games on the market today.In short: I can't think of any remotely good reason not to buy or recommend this game.  It's a great example of what happens when a group of developers and artists come together with a solid and unique vision and pull it off.			"

												Supergiant's second game has much to live up to. Their first game, Bastion, was a fantastic gem with great storytelling and good, if sometimes frustrating, gameplay. So how's Transistor?It's actually quite different than Bastion, and yet is also similar. The gameplay is no longer a hack and slash spamfest, but a very thoughtful combat system that rewards planning rather than button mashing. Naturally, I prefer this to Bastion and its damned challenges, since i'm not very good at that frantic sort of stuff. You also choose from a variety of abilities for combat, and you can attach other abilities to your ""main"" ones to make those ones do cool stuff. A favorite example of mine being adding an ability that pulls enemies in and attaching it to a large AoE effect that makes enemies take more damage, giving me this lovely black hole... thing that puts enemies in one place where I can proceed to blast em. Good stuff. :DSo combat is, in my opinion, improved. How about story? Here there is still great quality and that lovely narration, in a different form, like there was in Bastion. It does take some time to unfold however, and until that point you are basically running about killing stuff because... I don't know. Fun? Also the game is rather short, with the main storyline lasting about 6 hours. There are lots of challenges and other stuff, but I cleaned everything out in 16 hours - or about half of my still-unfinished Bastion playthrough. Lastly, the ending was, well, something I have mixed feelings about.Transistor is a good game that improves upon Bastion in some areas (combat, art), maintaing the previous high quality (soundtrack), while weakening slightly in others (story and length). The sum of all the parts however is certainly something worth looking at. If you liked Bastion (and if you didn't you are strange), then go ahead and pick this one up too.Enjoy! :D			"

												There is love in this game. Love in the design, the story, the music. The essence of what was great in Bastion has been refurbished to fit the environment of Transistor. They are noticeably similar, but all-together different. Bastion is more of a hack and slash, while Transistor relies on tactics and positioning to make combat the most effective. A familiar aspect, Logan Cunningham, the narrator of Bastion has returned to voice the narrator of Transistor. While the voice is the same, the tone and style of it is noticeably different. ""Rucks"" of Bastion speaks like a storyteller, full of authoritative power and wisdom. In Transistor, the narrator is a large sword that holds great technological power. This narrator speaks in the constant present, holding conversations, granting advice, but there is a totally different feel to it as it seems like the narrator is more of a changing character than Rucks was. The point that I am attempting to make is that this is not Bastion 2, but still very similar to an experience that was obviously Bastion-esque. It is slower going at the beginning in my opinion than Bastion was, learning the new combat and leveling mechanics, but it is certainly worth the initial learning process. Supergiant Games has made two of the most wonderfully designed games with Transistor and Bastion. It will be worth following their future developments, as they have made unique experiences that are worth supporting. Also, press Tab when you're in the game. It's just that little extra aspect that makes me love this game.			"

												This is one of the best examples that videogames can be art, without sacrifizing gameplay mechanics.The gameplay is pretty tight, you have 4 actions that can be assigned as you see fit, you gain different abilities as you progress, each one with unique properties, like longer range, stun effect, slowing, health leeching, debilitate and more; all of these can be combined with each other in groups of 3 to make a huge tree of combat styles, also you can either move and fight in real time or stop time and plan your next move at the cost of a cooldown period which doesn't allow you to attack so you have to avoid incoming enemies for a while, this gives a tactical aspect that makes you think your moves instead of mindlessly hacking and slashing all over the place.The art style of this game is superb, you could take a screenshot of any frame, whether at combat or a cutscene, and make a wonderful wallpaper; if you liked Bastion's art style, you'll love Transistor's. All the characters have their own unique style at clothing and hairdress, they all have that unique vibe that SuperGiant Games has succesfully trademarked.The soundrack of this game could hold it's own on any music chart, it's beautiful, the game reserves a keybinding to simply make the protagonist stop and hum to the background music, which is amazing. the music has a ciberpunk vibe that suits the whole concept of the game, it's calmed enough to be relaxing even in the middle of a fight. Just like with most aspects of the game, if you liked Bastion's Soundtrack, you'll love Transistor's.On the technical side, I must inform that it has a couple issues, there's only one graphical option: change resolution, meaning if you can't run this game on optimal settings, you can't run it at all. Also I suffered of a couple random crashes after long sessions, and there's some people that can't even get it to launch, but to me these issues haven't ruined the experience the game offersOverall this game is worth every pennie, it's not a long story, but it can be replayed over and over with all the combat posibilities it has, Supergiant Games has earned an honorable spot in the comunity, they are capable of making beautiful works of art and play,			"

												Just beat Transistor, and I think it's safe to say that yes, it does live up to Bastion in every way.But that's not to say it's just a reskin of bastion as the trailers would have you believe at first glance, because it isn't. It plays very differently; while Bastion tested your reflexes, Transistor will test your pre-planning ability.Transistor has a V.A.T.S.-like core gameplay element that allows you to plan your attacks ahead, but unlike V.A.T.S. from Fallout, using this will leave you very open to attack. Using this function will disallow any offensive action until it recharges; so you must use it effectively because the enemies are much faster than you are. Especially the ""Fetch"" enemies which are basically like dogs that love to follow you around faster than your evade speed and chomp the ever loving ♥♥♥♥ out of you repeatedly.The soundtrack is very different to bastion. I wouldn't say it doesn't live up to Bastion's, it's just very different in it's genres presented, and that is totally okay because it's still as great as you would expect from Supergiant Games and fits the cyberpunk setting very well. Speaking of the setting, it's beautiful. I love how you get the sense that the creators had this whole other rich, lore filled world planned out in their head but could only make ""Just a video game"" about it. It's not expositioned to you as most games would do, it's just there, which is exactly what the secret to making a setting like this is supposed to be like, because it means that you get the feeling that even without the main character and their plight, it would still exist. I give this game a ""Buy this right now""/10, even despite it's minor hiccups, which I will now list.Every now and again, the game locks up for a few seconds. This is guesswork at best so take it with a grain of salt, but I believe it may be caused by an unoptimized sound cache reset because the dynamic soundtrack is played in chunks of audio that change and layer as you do certain things. It could also be an enemy spawning issue, but again, I don't know for sure. It's so minor and infrequent that it's just worth noting, although not really a bother, since it seems like something that can be patched out. This has only happened in the challenge rooms so far, but some of the enemy capabilities are at odds with good gameplay design when their strengths are combined together. This one time, I accidentally knocked a ""Cheerleader"" (Basically a radar that makes enemies invincible) next to a vine, which heals other enemies. So the vine was healing the cheerleader, the cheerleader was shielding the vine, and the remaining fetch would go back to the vine to heal itself and be shielded every time I got it's health really low, and transistor time or whatever it's called wouldn't load fast enough to let me finish off the fetch before it did so. I'd show a screenshot of what happened, but there's currently an error with steam that won't let me upload it. Anyway, I had to restart the challenge map, but it never happened again thoughout the entire game.Another thing is that this game, while very enjoyable, should be played in short bursts. I beat it in one 9 hour sitting, and it began to feel repetitive by the end, as any game would. Just when it started to change the enemy variety up by adding in the ""Men"" which are basically these enemies with special abilities that throw pretty much tracking explosives at you, the game ends. They're fun to fight, but they show up so late game that you barely have time to enjoy their presence, though I'm sure I'll see more of them on my New Game+ playthrough. This one is a nitpick and not really necessary so disregard it if you wish, but: At the end there is a part where you fight an enemy who also has transistor time and can preplan attacks against you. The multiplayer potential for that is amazing, because the fight was actually very enjoyable. I would have loved a 2 player mode for that sequence that you unlock after beating the game, even if it was just local pvp on one PC/Console instead of over the internet, but I understand that there are probably engine limitations and whatnot so it's just a fleeting pipe dream.The story, while very gripping and entertaining, didn't have any characters I could personally relate to or connect with, so when certain things happen throughout the game, I found it hard to really, truly care. But that's probably just because I'm a cynical♥♥♥♥♥hole, the writers told the story they wanted to and they did it effectively, even if some of the characters didn't really get much development outside of the biographies that add to themselves by the end of the game.Aside from these issues though, I fully and wholeheartedly recommend this game. At $19.99 as a brand new price for this memorable experience of a game, you can't go wrong.			"

												This is one of the best examples that videogames can be art, without sacrifizing gameplay mechanics.The gameplay is pretty tight, you have 4 actions that can be assigned as you see fit, you gain different abilities as you progress, each one with unique properties, like longer range, stun effect, slowing, health leeching, debilitate and more; all of these can be combined with each other in groups of 3 to make a huge tree of combat styles, also you can either move and fight in real time or stop time and plan your next move at the cost of a cooldown period which doesn't allow you to attack so you have to avoid incoming enemies for a while, this gives a tactical aspect that makes you think your moves instead of mindlessly hacking and slashing all over the place.The art style of this game is superb, you could take a screenshot of any frame, whether at combat or a cutscene, and make a wonderful wallpaper; if you liked Bastion's art style, you'll love Transistor's. All the characters have their own unique style at clothing and hairdress, they all have that unique vibe that SuperGiant Games has succesfully trademarked.The soundrack of this game could hold it's own on any music chart, it's beautiful, the game reserves a keybinding to simply make the protagonist stop and hum to the background music, which is amazing. the music has a ciberpunk vibe that suits the whole concept of the game, it's calmed enough to be relaxing even in the middle of a fight. Just like with most aspects of the game, if you liked Bastion's Soundtrack, you'll love Transistor's.On the technical side, I must inform that it has a couple issues, there's only one graphical option: change resolution, meaning if you can't run this game on optimal settings, you can't run it at all. Also I suffered of a couple random crashes after long sessions, and there's some people that can't even get it to launch, but to me these issues haven't ruined the experience the game offersOverall this game is worth every pennie, it's not a long story, but it can be replayed over and over with all the combat posibilities it has, Supergiant Games has earned an honorable spot in the comunity, they are capable of making beautiful works of art and play,			"

												Beautiful game, amazing illustrations, nice music, interesting battle mechanics, clever level-up options, sh!t story.But mostly it's an eye candy. You should smash your F12 key screenshoting the whole game game for that matter.Needs to be played twice so you can truly enjoy the battle sequences which are the most important aspect of the game. It's hard for me to enjoy turn-based rpgs that much, it's wonderful. You need to try it out!It's a pity the story was so...well it wasn't bad but felt nonexistant even though at times you could tell that the creators really wanted to create a believable world and put a considerable amount of effort in order to do so. I've read analyses about what everything ment etc that I also found pointless. If you've ever read half a shelf of sci-fi books you'll get it in the first playthrough and maybe be as dissapointed as I was. There was also an underlying ""philosophical"" message concerning the essence of the human condition that actually doubled as a plot device, but it was just funny at best. Don't concern yourselves with the story, just smash the control machine(s).			"

												I was surprised how different the gameplay is from Bastion. The combat is mostly turn based and there's no environment hazards other than enemies. The system for selecting skills and upgrades is very unique and really encourages trying different combinations. I like how the complexity grows over time, but never feels overwhelming. It has the same clever system as Bastion for customizing the difficulty with debuffs for rewards.The story is bat♥♥♥♥♥♥insane, even more so than Bastion. It turns out to be a similar sort of apocalypse, but it feels like most of the collapsing is happening offscreen. I don’t really follow how all the character including your own fits into it. At the same time this makes the world feel very massive.I miss the destructible and animating environments of Bastion, but these are incredibly beautiful. All the character an enemy design is wonderful. The music is amazingly good, but is much harder to describe than Bastion’s mix of Indian and Western.It’s tough to live in the shadow of Bastion. This isn’t my favorite game this year and didn’t meet my very high expectations, but I still like almost everything about it and was left wanting more. It probably the most stylish turn-based combat games I’ve ever played. It’s pretty different from almost anything else I’ve ever played including Bastion, so it’s worth experiencing for that. "

												Transistor is probably an afterthought to many gamers out there, but to anyone who has played Bastion, this game is a must buy. To those of you who do not know the majesty of Supergiant games, Bastion and Transistor both share epic qualities that seem to be missing from most games today.In the simplest way to define Transistor: this is art, truly inspired art. I'm literally at a loss when it comes to reviewing this game. Supergiant manages to pull you into their story and make you feel like you are a part of it. Each character has some unique facet about them that can intrigue the player. Abilities are explained through some fabrication of a character's life. Everything has its mark in Transistor's world. The story is simply magnificent and a main driving point to the game. As a player, your eyes are met with a glorious palette of colors uniquely blended across the canvas of the game world. Every building, every character, and even every enemy, meshes together in loving unison. Nothing seems out of place and it all looks beautiful. Also, without fail, Supergiant delivers another amazing soundtrack for their game -- to compliment the beautiful scenery and character design, the background music is just as eloquent and wonderous. And to add to the soundtrack even more, the in-game music can be interacted with with the main character. Have you no will to play the game,  the soundtrack alone is worth the price. As short of a review as this may be, Supergiant did not disappoint -- not even in the slightest. I would highly recommend playing Transistor AND Bastion, if you haven't already. Thanks for your time.*Disclaimer: This is an opinion, obviously. You do not need to agree :p			"

												MUSIC AND ARTWORK:Absolutely fantastic.  They do a wonderful job together of drawing you into this surreal world.10/10UI:Flawless.  UI's in games are usually pretty bad, and I'm a UI-stickler.  However, this game's UI was clearly carefully thought-out by a professional.  It always contained all the information I needed, yet was never in the way.  There was never a time I wanted to do something and thought to myself ""Crap, how do I do that again?""10/10GAMEPLAY:The fighting in this game looks artificially similar to Bastion, but the ability to pause the action and execute multiple attacks in succession makes it feel completely different.  The battles end up being much more about turn-based tactics than quick reflexes.Different powers are unlocked throughout the course of the game.  Each power can be used as an attack, an upgrade to a different attack, or a passive boost.  This mixing-and-matching opens up a wide variety of strategies for each fight; if one matchup of powers doesn't work well for a fight, you can try again with a *completely* different strategy.  This keeps the game fresh and interesting, even on subsequent playthroughs.On the forums, many people complained about the battles being repetative, but I completely disagree; due to your ability to completely change your lineup of powers, every battle felt fresh and interesting.My one complaint is that you only start out with three (I think?) powers, so you have to wait a short while before you can make the more interesting matchups.  And since the game is so short, ""a short while"" ends up being half of the game.8/10STORY:This is where things turn sour.  The story in this game is very open-ended, to the point of being lazy.  It's (obviously) difficult to critique the story without giving any spoilers, but suffice it to say there are a LOT of story-elements that are never explained or even hinted at.**Minor spoilers ahead** (but I'll keep things vague to avoid ruining the story)All of the characters are hilariously under-developed, even (or *especially*) the main two.  It's to the point where, when you fight one of the bosses, you not only don't feel anything when they die, you don't even know why you're fighting them to begin with.  Also, one very obvious lead-up to a boss-fight ends in a very contrived, almost non-sensical Deus Ex Machina.As for the the main two characters, you end up not caring what happens to them, because you barely know anything about them.  On top of that, the ending feels incredibly forced and out-of-place.The whole thing reeks of lazy writing.**End of minor spoilers**2/10GAME LENGTH:The game is pretty short - only about 5 hours long, and that's *if* you complete all the side-challenges you can.  The game feels like the creators had planned on there being more content, since all of the side quest-y stuff (unlocking all the character-stories, finishing the side-challenges, the majority of the optional achievements) are impossible to complete in a single playthrough - you don't meet enough enemies or enter the ""Backdoor"" enough times to complete them.It feels like at some point the developers said ""I think we've worked hard enough, let's just polish and release it already,"" so they did.  This is corroborated by how incomplete the storyline is.5/10OVERALLI don't regret my purchase, but I was expecting more.  Some people will think the gameplay and wonderful atmosphere make the game worth $20, even if it's so short and lacking on story (or, if you're the artsy type, maybe you enjoy open-ended stories).  Others will feel betrayed by the lack of content.  Depending on which type of person you are, I'd either recommend buying it now, or waiting for a sale, respectively.  But either way, I think it's worth playing.8/10			"

 Bastion  was my favourite game of 2011. So you could say I was highly anticipating  Supergiant Games  next release -- which was revealed to be  Transistor  in 2013. After a long and patient wait, I've completed Transistor and I would like to share some of my thoughts and perhaps answer how it stacks up to Bastion.The story revolves around a character called  Red , who seems to be a singer superstar in the city of Cloudbank. After Red wakes up from an assassination attempt by a sinister group of high ranking public figures known as  The Camerata  and realising her voice was also stolen... Red pulls The Transistor out of a mysterious body next to her, and attempts to unravel what exactly happened to her. Little does she know though, that The Transistor can talk, and actually seems to know her. As Red starts to make her way out of the district, she is attacked by an army of robotic intelligences known as  The Process , who seem to be controlled by The Camerata.The story is more abstract, subtle and darker this time. I would say the story is not as immediatetely likeable as Bastion's story -- as the narrator for Bastion basically narrated and spelled everything out for you in a clearer way. In Transistor, the narrator is also your companion,  (voiced by Logan Cunningham once again, though with a much less gravelly and cool sounding tone) . You are more encouraged to explore the world this time to find out more about Cloudbank's lore instead of relying on the narrator.What is amazing is how the story also mechanically ties into the gameplay . You come across various slain characters in the story that you absorb into The Transistor, gaining new abilities. Abilities are multifaceted, so each ability can be used as an active/upgrade/passive and can be mixed and matched for some cool possibilities. You unlock character lore by using each ability in one of the 3 types of slots. It's quite a brilliant and elegant way of doing lore if I must say so myself.You have 4 ability slots which can be upgraded (via leveling up) to have 2 upgrade slots each and you can also unlock 4 passive slots. As you can imagine, this gives Transistor much more depth and customisability this time around compared to Bastion. You can play the game in real time like any normal ARPG... but Transistor also adds a layer of strategic depth with it's new feature called the planning stage -- letting you pause, queue and plan your attacks (with a short global cooldown for all your abilities as a penalty).There is no overworld hub this time like in Bastion, but you do come across back doors -- taking you to a mini oasis of sorts. Here is where you can access all of the challenges known as  tests . Beating each test unlocks a track for you to listen to. Supergiant also added a feature where if you press tab, Red can hum to every track in the game. I love and appreciate this small attention to detail. You can also gaze up at the stars on your hammock and listen to what the Transistor has to say on your current situation and also play with your process dog named Luna (Dota reference?).The idol system from Bastion also makes its return, but in the form of limiters in Transistor. Limiters can be toggled on and off making the game harder but also granting more experience with each limiter you enable (up to 10 limiters). Limiters also have their own lore to be unlocked by using them at least once. The game becomes VERY CHALLENGING with 10 limiters enabled and is not for the feint of heart.The music for Transistor is also incredible once again. It has a bit more of a jazzy and eery sci-fi vibe this time compared to the more upbeat tunes of Bastion. In only 2 games, Darren Korb has cermented himself as one of my favourite game composers of all time. Instant classics, and I can't wait to hear more from this very talented man.Now, I'm praising this game to the high heavens, but what are some of my  dislikes ? Every time you are taken to 0 health, one of your abilities will be overloaded, and can't be used until you reach the next checkpoint. It is a unique way of handling failure, but I didn't really like the idea of having your skills being stripped from you as it can basically ruin the idea of your build if you make a mistake. It also seems random on what skill you will lose -- which is  severely  punishing -- especially when you are trying to complete some of the later performance tests where if you lose 1 crucial skill, you basically have no hope of finishing the test without restarting the whole test and playing flawlessly. The developers also forgot to add a restart test option to the menu which was frustrating when you are attempting them over and over. Frankly, I also didn't think the tests/challenges were as well designed as they were in Bastion.Transistor is another monumental achievement by Supergiant Games. It shows they are maturing as a developer. Some people probably thought Bastion's narrator was a bit of a gimmick, and that the story was all it had going for it. Transistor shows that Supergiant also understand how to craft a more mechanically deep and subtle game this time, while still sticking to their strengths of unique story-telling via narration and music.

												As a preface, I would like to state that SuperGiant's previous game, 'Bastion,' is one of my favourite games of all time. If I present an obvious bias or compare the two games on unfair grounds, then I appologise in advance.   First let us discuss what Transistor does right. The gameplay presented is the same isometric world navigation that was apparant in Bastion, the major difference being its approach to combat. It abandons the hectic run-and-gun/hammer skirmishes of the former and instead takes a far more intelligent plan and execute method. The player can temporarily pause time and plan out their battle strategy before hitting the pause button again and watching it play out at lightning speeds. The numerous variaties of enemies and the layouts of the battlefields provide ample chances to scratch that 'General Chessmaster' itch. The massive amount of weapons (called 'functions()') alsoadd to the tactical depth of this game. Each weapon can be equiped in one of four wepon slots, where it functions normally, firing lasers, dropping bombs etc. Each weapon may also be assigned to either a passive slot, providing you a powerful, perk-like bonus, or to an upgrade slot, in which one weapon buffs the other (LASERS THAT ALSO DROP BOMBS!?). The amount of combinations is truely staggering and will be greatly apprieciated by gamers who like a more intelligent approach to their combat (myself included).   Next the art style. Although the more charming cartoon-like character proportions from Bastion are gone in favor of a more realistic-(ish) art style, the vibrant colours and tones make a glorious return. The mood and the tone of various scenes are masterfully enchanced by use of reccuring temperatures and unique art assets. The forboding height of Coudbank City, as presented soon after the beggining of the game, is alleviated by the cool yellow and blue lighting, giving it a more distant, lonesome feeling, to give one example.   And the soundtrack, oh my, the soundtrack. I was so thrilled to hear that Darren Korb would be returning and boy does he deliver in the audio department. Echoing guitar riffs and droning synthesizers, alongside beautifully melancholic vocals do wonders to nail the sad, lonely cyberpunk feel that is so greatly apprieciated by big nerds such as myself. Particular standouts for me are 'In Circles,' 'Forecast' and 'The Spine.'  And now to cover what I personally was let down by. The story. WAIT! Allow me to expand. (No spoilers don't fret!) The characters themselves are very nicely portrayed, with excellent moments of individual characterisation, but I took issue with the game's plot, its over-arching story. You are dropped right into the world with zero idea of who these characters are, where you are, or what the hell is going on in general. 'But that happened in Bastion too!' I hear you shout. Yes you woke up in a floating bed in Bastion with zero understanding of what was happening, but this created a sense of wonder as the game's  plot was quickly given to you, (The world blew up, but the Bastion can fix it) and as you progressed the world, characters and other various story flavor was gradually revealed to you in satisfying amounts from level to level. And most importantly by the game's end all questions had been answered. This is not the case with Transistor. Although it does a good job with the aforementioned characterisation and also with the same story flavor being drip fed to you, major components of the the plot are flat out not explained, which frustrated me greatly as it gave me difficulty in understanding vital things such as character motivations. These questions are also not addressed, or at least not in any way a near satisfactory level, by the games end. The final boss in particular was very confusing for me, the fight itself comes out of nowhere and takes place in a very strange location and I found myself thinking 'WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING? WHY ARE WE FIGHTING NOW? WHERE-WHA-BUT I DIDN'T.........' and soon after the fight the game ends. The ending itself is rather emotional, but I couldn't get into the mood the game wanted me to due to my extreme frustration and confusuion owing to the fact that the credits were rolling and my questions had not been answered. Now I'm not some fool who only enjoys simple by-the-numbers stories, I understand that not all questions need to be answered, but jesus christ SOME would have been nice. Thematically , the game is not as strong as Bastion. It is clearly attempting to make commentary on topics such as the irrelevance of an individual in a system, and the fickleness of the general public but it falls flat if suitable context is not provided.   To summerise: Wonderfully cereberal combat with powerfull art and sound direction that is only let down by its adequately explained story. Or maybe I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												Well, that was playthrough #1. After doing all challenges, listening to and reading everything I possibly could and only once having to use the ""Retry"" function, Steam tells me I have 7 hours under my belt.The following is my critique of the game, ignoring the New Game+ mode (for now). While I do reference Supergiant Games' first title, Bastion, quite heavily, the points I make should also be accessible to players who have yet to play Bastion (seriously, get that game). While I try to be objective, some sections of this review are highly subjective; the game suffers from virtually no technical (and thus ""objectively objective"") faults and what I point out as bad may appear as ""creative"" or ""challenging"" or just ""different"" to others.Please refer to additional reviews and critiques before you decide whether or not you want to buy Transistor.THIS CRITIQUE CONTAINS VERY MINOR SPOILERS!If you want to avoid even those, skip to the conclusion section at the end.Transistor is an isometric tactical Action-RPG with a linear story.First of all, the things I was happy with - THE GOOD:- The MUSIC, obviously. Darren Korb and Ashley Barret did an amazing job and the music leaves little to be desired. It's a different style than Bastion's soundtrack, so, of course, whether you like it more or less than Bastion's is a matter of taste, but it is very atmospheric and carries the game together with- LOGAN CUNNINGHAM'S NARRATION. No surprises there. The music may be the soul of the game but the expert narration (and fantastic voice acting) are its heart.- The DESIGN. The world of Transistor is original and colorful; the ""feel"" is the same as in Bastion but it has a distinctly different theme; the result is stellar.- CUSTOMIZATION. The ability to collect a variety of skills, all of them with different effects, depending on whether they are active, passive or modifying an active skill, makes for some interesting (and tough) choices as to how you want to play. Not everything works well but you can try everything.Now to the things that I was less impressed with - THE MEH:- The COMBAT SYSTEM. Sadly, it is nowhere near as great as (I) expected. Precision is not its strong point and those who were hoping for Frozen Synapse levels of refined tactical combat will be disappointed, as will be those that expected a slick Hack&Slash. Some sections are almost impossible to beat with only one of the modes but intelligent use of both does not help in all situations and more often than not (especially later on), you can find yourself cheesing the game in less-than-fun ways when you encounter fights that are frustrating enough that you'd like to skip them, due to issues with- The BALANCING. Few enemies are balls-to-the-wall hard, but many are insanely annoying. Having to deal with enemies who have the ability to cloak themselves (which, somehow, also makes them invulnerable) without the player having any way to disrupt this cloak (other than waiting for them to deal damage to you) or to damage them in cloak makes several mid- and endgame sections downright infuriating. Especially if said enemies are rapidly regenerating health. Several enemy attacks cannot be avoided and the player's ability to heal himself is extremely limited, making the whole combat system less a matter of skill and more one of a proper choice of abilities (which is where the combat system is at odds with its RPG elements); due to this, some fights (especially boss fights) and victories are anything but satisfying and can leave a bitter aftertaste.- The CHARACTERS. While Bastion had only a few characters with little depth but strong-enough features to make them relatable and carry the story, Transistor has almost none. ""The voice"" is the strongest one by far but remains a lot more blank than Bastion's narrator. The female lead, Red, has even less than that (or Bastion's Kid). The human antagonists are hardly characterized at all and what remains is a faceless menace that changes the world around you and attacks you constantly... and yet fails to really make you feel threatened.- The STORY. Where Bastion's story was about a simple goal for most of the game (restoring the Bastion), Transistor lacks direction. You feel like a tourist who is being guided from one landmark to the other without any drive or ultimate goal behind it, which becomes even more apparent at the game's conclusion. The plot works with local tension only (i.e. short-term obstacles and goals). The lack of strong characters makes it hard to build-up a bad guy and the pace at which the city changes and the threat swallows it leaves no time to make you care about it or its inhabitants. Unlike the Bastion, you didn't build it with your own two hands and, despite being in a city, you never get a chance to interact with anybody. This leaves the romance as its only redeeming factor... except it isn't either, because the main characters' interaction is very one-sided. The sad truth is: Transistor's story is forgetable.And finally - THE BAD:- WORLD DESIGN (SCOPE AND DEPTH). While the design is great, you hardly see anything of the city (or the rest of the world). Vistas are few and far between and the game doesn't feature any maps or background information that allows you to see the ""big picture"". Sadly, this devaluates most of the ingame biographies and what lore there is because it becomes that much harder to relate to for their lack of context.- The ENDING. It certainly isn't Mass Effect 3 levels of terrible but, frankly, it makes no sense. The game's conclusion renders pretty much the entire hero's journey pointless and I have to ask what motivation Red had in the first place. That isn't to say that it isn't beautiful in several ways but nonetheless highly disappointing if you were hoping for a well-written story.- The LENGTH. From what I have heard from several people, 7 hours is not a good time. It is quite possible to beat the game in under 5 hours. New Game+ may add replay value here, if you truly enjoyed the combat system and don't share my gripes with it, but if you don't, it leaves the question of value for your money. And, regardless of New Game+, my impression is that the game tries to do too much in too little time - Introducing you to a world, threatening this world and making you its involuntary savior has worked before... but it doesn't work for Transistor.MY VERDICT: (Or: tl;dr)Transistor is a good attempt to solve a task that was almost unsolvable - To create the next ""Bastion"". Design-wise, it is every bit as strong and a true treat for the eyes and ears, with some great ideas on how to keep progression interesting and your game experience unique. But a closer look reveals a system that tries to combine real-time and tactical combat and, as a result, is the master of neither. The beautiful world that seems so full and interesting is a facade, a mere stage decoration with too little behind it to keep it from falling over when leaned on, leaving a lot of the ingame lore without sufficient context. And while music and narration are great, they cannot hide the fact that the play itself is boring and the characters forgotten as soon as they leave the stage.Supergiant Games gave their game and its world too little time to introduce themselves and captivate you and the result is all the more disappointing for it.Nevertheless, I recommend Transistor for the interesting experience it is; you may find the combat system and story, despite their flaws, more satisfying than I did and, either way, you do not want to miss out on the soundtrack and Logan Cunningham's sexy voice. Supergiant Games deserves the money for a brave attempt, even if this attempt falls short. If you aren't dying to play Transistor right now, pick it up once it goes on sale.			"

We're not going to get away with this are we? What happened when you combine great gameplay with amazing skill mechanic, creative plot and remarkable soundtrack. Find it interesting? Happens one of the best unique game that calls Transistor. Same as Bastion you can find here tons of similarities from mute main character to the same narrator actor (Logan Cunningham). And that's really great that developers continue their own creative style.  To be sure, you will enjoy this game from early start to even 2nd time ending!			"

												Alright, I'm going to say this first: A year ago, when the first trailer of this game was revealed, I cried so much. Not only was this going to be another game from SuperGiantGames, the creators of one of my favorite games, Bastion, but the trailer was excellent, blending in beautiful music with awesome gameplay and cutscenes. I forgot about the game over time, with college and projects distracting me, and it was only until a month ago that my love for the game returned. Just like many fans of the game, I was ""riding the hype train"" as the release date got nearer and nearer. As soon as it was on Steam I preordered it and the soundtrack, which was $30 out of my wallet.Was it worth it? Very much so. I might be still riding the hype train some, but I can still recognize the positive and negative aspects this game has.Story------------------------------------------------I was rather surprised on how the story went. Instead of focusing on Red as the character who advances the story, I found that the Transistor, the sword-like weapon she wields, did most of that job for her. It talks and knows her in some way, but also Red is somewhat of a silent protagonist. She's not like Gordon Freeman from the Half-Life series or Chell from Portal, as you can make her hum by holding the tab button (when I learned I could do that I squeed loudly), but is mostly silent throughout the game. Players will understand why this is early on in the game. Still though, Red and the Transistor work well together and make an amazing duo.The Transistor, being both a main character and the main tool of the player, is not some ethereal being with all the answers. It acts more like a regular person, one that feels love and courage and a sense of honor. This personality, plus Red, can make the player feel attached to both characters as they bond throughout the game. During my playthrough, I got to a scene where the pair finds a bath house and Red proceeds to wash herself. Of course the actually washing isn't shown, but the way the Transistor reacted to this made me laugh. That's what really showed me the Transistor's regular personality.I did enjoy the story as a whole and the ending is a must-see. However, I was disappointed that not much was explained about the setting of the game. If one is to save a city/ town/ country/ etc they should know the importance of it. Yes there are a lot of people in Cloudbank, some very good people, but I would have like to know more about the actual. ""How did it come to be?"" ""What was in the city that made it so grand?"" ""What was the economic structure before everything went to hell?"" ""Who was in charge?"" Those questions, and some others, were some that I felt should have been answered because they would have helped the plot make sense.Gameplay------------------------------------------------The gameplay in Transistor is different from Bastion. It's more strategic because your main ability, Turn(), freezes time and allows you to set up a number of combos and positions in order to maul your enemies to dust. Though you can also use your abilities on their own, a chain of attacks with the Transistor (the sword-like weapon our heroine, Red, wields) can clear a battlefield in seconds. Plus, if you make a mistake with your planning and have yet to initialize it, you can always go back, redo it, then unleash your power.As always though, there's a catch: After using Turn(), there is a recharge period where most of your abilities are unavailable to you and your more often defenseless. The results of what you can do though definitely outweigh the risk. Turn() to me made the game strategic, but also fast-paced at times. You have to analyze your situation and really think instead of just rushing into battle. Planning and is a major part of the game and it's what makes it so fun.You have four skills at your disposal, but you also have an upgrade slot to each (plus another upgrade slot that you can unlock later on), and passive skills that are always constant (a total of four you can unlock). Each of these three types slots give different effects to each skill and that, plus the the number of combinations you can set for upgrades, gives you a wide arrange of possibilities. For example, one of my favorite skills was ""flash-stepping"", with added bonuses of releasing balls of damaging energy along my path and a parasite that chewed away at an enemy that it homed in on. A harmless flash-step because a deadly barrage.The difficulty of the game goes up as you go through the game and it became quite tough at times and sometimes repetative. However, I find it to be not too hardcore, but good middle ground, with easy bits at the beginning and angering parts at the end (though I'm also a fast learner and have experience in video games so it might be different for other people).Other------------------------------------------------The art style of Transistor is very similar to Bastion's. It's very well done, with great effects and cutscenes through the story. Not only that, but the music fits well throughout the game. Both of these combined create a beautiful canvas as you set up your attacks.Oh yeah, there isn't really a menu. You just get thrown into the game.Overall------------------------------------------------To wrap up all this review said, Transistor has:+ Great main characters+ Great gameplay+ A wide variety of play styles+ Game mode plus+ Graphics/ art style+ Awesome music/ soundtrack- Lack of info on Cloudbank/ main setting- Short playthrough (if that's a bother)- Sometimes repetive fight scenesThis was definitely a fun game to play. It was just how I expected it to be and thrilled it was like that. Though somewhat short (I beat it in about 9 hours as I collected stuff and enjoyed the story), it does have a New Game Plus mode similar to Bastion's where you have all the progress from the previous game and start from the very beginning. Only thing different is that all the enemies are tougher, so you still have challenge as you fight once more through Cloudbank. I'll be definitely going through it soon.If you're a fan of Bastion, I highly recommend that you get this game. If you like RPGs, strategy, and some fast-paced fighting, I also recommend you buy this game. Twenty bucks was definitely worth it for me and many others who preordered it as well.			"

												I am an enormous fan of Bastion - and have been following the development of Transistor with hesitant optimism ... Wondering if they will be able to capture that same magic that Bastion had ... since it was such a unique and new voice in video games when it first came out ...I can say ... without a doubt ... that they have captured all of the magic that made Bastion great ... and that the music, the art style, the narration, the combat system ... just everything about this game is everything I had hoped it could be .... I am only a small part through the game but already while I am typing this ... I am thinking about the game ... and the world that is there to explore ... and the small touches they have used to bring that world to life around you ...SuperGiant Games have done an absolutely incredible job ... this is a game everybody should play ... at least once! 8-)For those who would rather see the art and hear the music ... here is the first part of my playthrough of the game 8-)

I feel like I should actually write a serious review of this game.I'll start by saying: If you didn't like Bastion, you won't like this at all. The storytelling is very similar. The game is also pretty short, I finished clocking in at 5 hours (did not 100% obviously, you need NG+ to unlock all the different powers and such). But during NG+, I don't see the story changing much. It will be something for only completionists.But, outside of that I found Transistor to be a great experience. Supergiant delivers again with a chillingly beautiful soundtrack, Darren Korb proving his skills at composing. As a person who loved the art style of Bastion, Transistor does not differ a lot from it with the exception of having more ""3d"" models as compared to the mostly 2D Bastion, this is most easily seen on your protagonist. The voice acting in the game is top notch, Logan Cunningham giving another near perfect preformance on his character and as the narrator. The enviroments are always beautiful to look at, if a little confusing to navigate at times. The story kept me hooked all the way through the game, with the characters being fleshed out along the way, never feeling generic and always very enthralling.The combat in the game was a very interesting idea executed well, but not to perfection. It can feel tedious at times and frustrating at others when something just doesn't lineup perfectly. Endgame, you will probably have a combo that will be able to instagib the strongest enemies, you only obstacle being the cooldown bar on your Turn(), which is the main form of combat in Transistor. It's a strategic pause that allows you to set up a bunch of moves that enemies can not react to for the most part. With the backstab mechaninc and the variety of Functions (moves), it has more uses than just being a ""VATS"" like way of fighting ala Fallout. While recharging, its a game of dodging attacks before you can go back in on the enemies.Where the combat really shines is how varried you can make your moveset. Each unlockable function is very different than the last, and aren't just moves: they can be infused to combine with other functions (Example: combine the knockup and the pull functions to create an AOE pull) or can be used as passive traits, all taking up some of your power bar, limiting how many functions you can have going.The stories included with each function are a very nice touch that fit the asthetic very well, but unlocking all 3 pieces can be a pain sometimes, since each one will need to occupy each of the 3 uses (passive, upgrade or move) to unlock the full story. Luckily, you only need one battle in each use to unlock each part and with an upgrade station seemingly after every battle you should unlock them all quickly and be able to go back to a more comfortable moveset. There was only a few spots in the game I would consider ""hard"", for the most part your average player should be able to blow through their first NG with relative ease. The enemies aren't the brightest, not to say that they are bad, but sometimes they will just stare at you as you recharge behind a wall, not even bothering to try and pressure you to move. Death is also really hard to achieve, after reaching 0 HP you will get a ""free turn()"" where you can try and save yourself or win the fight with your what you have left. If you fail and get hit again, you will lose one of your functions socketed. But, since you will usually have 4, chances are you will most likely never lose them all. I have never lost one, so I could not say if they are gone forever, but seeing the difficulty of the game I assume you recover them at the next station. The only time dying will really matter is in the training & challenge areas, where if you die once or twice you may just restart a challenge.Is it worth playing through? Absolutely, it's a beautiful experiece. Is it worth the current $20? That's a bit more debatable, due to it's shorter length. I wouldn't say not to buy it, but the second it goes on sale it is a must grab.			"

												I am a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I still believe that some games need a certain amount of time played before their price is justified. Other times I can recognize quality surpassing such an arbitrary ratio within an hour of play. Transistor is one of those games. The voice acting is, as always, top notch. The music is amazing, I might buy the album. For ♥♥♥♥'s sake, there's a ""hum"" button and your charactor will hum along to the background music. Talking swords. Dude. Talking. Sword. And he like loves you, so you two are super tite 8)Art is amazing. Mechanics are amazing. Get this game. Get this game now. I played with a controller, it as fairly decent for somebody who plays mouse and keyboard often. Worth every dollar, don't wait for a sale, you jerk.			"

												Short and sort of flat, Transistor could've been a lot better, longer and deeper. The combat has potential, but you can miss it entirely in that whooping 2,5 hour long that is Transistor. Art and sound design are top notch, but Bastion did it better. Transistor stops being Transistor and goes back to being Rucks about 40 minutes in, albeit lacking old mans charm and powers of observation.Get Bastion and then Transistor with 75% discount.			"

												I had high expectations because of Bastion. But i don't recommend it because of some points:* The narration. Bastion had an innovative narration and this game tries to copy that but in the end it just make random comments and it really distracts you from the game. ""Oh, i guess they don't like to swim"" as you pass by a pond. ""Let me tell you a joke.. What's the difference between... You know what? nevermind"" during a lift ride (loading screen disguised)* The Combat. It is nice in the beggining but gets repetitive really fast. you do get some powers but they mostly play out the same. You fully heal between fights and can save everywhere. If you die, you don't really die as the time stops and you lose one of your attacks until the second next checkpoint. I really wish it had more depth, but in the end it was  1- stop time 2- queue some attacks 3- run as your time stop ability recharges 4- repeat* The story. I am a little biased because i skipped all terminals. Or maybe i skipped them all because the reading doesnt really fit the action oriented gameplay. I didn't understand many points but in the end i didnt bother going after the information. I was just happy the game was ending. Also, I didn't care about the protagonist.* The protagonist. Female silent protagonist. you are supposed to feel her emotions through her music (why is she a singer anyway?) and like her because of her appearance (red haired, nice body, etc). But you don't. She is shallow. Lacks personality. She just does what the sword tells her to do. The ending went against what was being shown, though.* The length. It was quick. Surprisingly quick. When the final cutscene appeared i though I was just less than halfway though but it was actually the end. I was just level 11 and still had space for countless powers and upgrades. i didn't even unlock most restrictions.  What happened ?* The linearity. I guess if they went a route a little more like bastion it would have been better. many stages that you get a new power per stage, or something like that. But this game just makes you follow the path and that is it.I really loved the ending, though. But it doesn't make the game any betterI wish i liked it, but i really didn't.			"

												Before anything, I will preface this and say if you have any interest in ARPG's and are looking for a wonderful and short experience, you SHOULD pick this game up. Well worth the $20 in my opinion.  If you want a detailed explanation, feel free to read and a TLDR is at the bottom.PROS:◘Visually pleasing to the eyes, absolutly gorgeous presentation in both animation and the enviornment.◘Sound design is top notch.◘Narration done throughout the game is fun to listen to.◘Can play with either mouse or keyboard.◘Fairly intriguing theme and story get you interested◘Should run fairly well on most machines.◘Fairly challenging as you can easily be ""killed"" multiple times during any battle.     ○When you ""die"" in combat, 2 things can happen: The first is on the brink of death you engage a emergency Turn mode (Turn is explained later below) and can fight to kill a few more enemies. The second possibility is that you ""break"" a function from combat for a while, and after visiting 2 (or more) Function Kiosks you can reactive them. If you break them, you are then forced to play around with your kit to experiment with new loadouts.◘Variety of combat with many different enemies with various different upgrade versions of them.◘Absolutely STELLAR combat system along with the configurations along with it (Which are detalied below)     ○As you play the game, you obtain various skills and upgrades through leveling up or finding them around the world and they are called Functions.     ○You can use these Functions in 3 ways: The first is the Active Function which you use for combat that does its base effect. The second is the Upgrade Function, where you take one of your Functions and use it to augment another Active Function, giving it special or different effect. And lastly is the Passive Function, in which you take a Function and put it into a passive state where it will always give a effect, or activate at specific under different conditions. EVERY Function in the game connects together in one way or another.     ○As you play the game, you are allowed to fight in either real time where you cast your abilities against the enemies movements and actions with no cooldown penalty, engage the Turn system to pause the game and tactically decide how you want to approach the situation. In Turn you can move almost instantly anywhere and manually aim your shots and action which are limited by a action bar. You then execute the procedure and watch your plan unfold rapidly. However, the downside to this is that once you are done with your Turn actions, you cannot use your abilities until your Turn meter has recharged. Because of these 2 systems you have a choice as to how you want to fight your battles.◘You can use ""limiters"" to further increase the difficulty of the game and gain a small amount of bonus EXP for leveling.◘New game plus mode with all of your stuff you unlocked. CONS:◘The UI can be just a little bit wonky with assigning Functions to various roles.◘Because the story is not made apparently clear at first, you can easily get lost.◘Turn actions that detail the effects may not always be accurate, as enemies may dodge and it doesn't tell you that information.◘May be just a bit short for some, as I and other have managed to beat the game at around 6 hours.◘Because there is new game plus and not much more, some people may not find a lot of replayability from this, resulting a 6 hour experience for $20 dollars.◘The only real set of graphics options are just resolutions.TLDR: Great combat, visuals and fun for ARPG fans. Can be beaten in about 6 hours, and depending on the user the new game plus can offer replayability.Can be of a bumpy ride for the first hour for people to get used to, but you get over it quickly.Overall, I feel that just about everyone should buy this beauty. The devs that made this deserve every dollar they earn and then some for the amount of effort and love that was poured into this game.			"

												It's beautiful, it's unique, and it's got an engaging storyline to boot! For the first few minutes I wasn't sure if I was playing the game right or getting the most out of the experience. I knew I had to be doing something wrong. But in time I got the hang of it, and found that nearly dying every round was just part of the fun.But there's more to it. What really turned me off was halfway through the game I realized that there wasn't anything new turning up. I felt like I was just doing the same-old challenge, over and over again, just with different enemies. It didn't feel exciting anymore. It was a menial task to fight.Don't get me wrong, though. This game was professionally made, and it's a real work of art.			"

												I just beat this game and here is why you should buy it.Good:- Very good engaging story- Superb music- Beautiful artstyle, especially during the cutscenes.- Combat system is like nothing you've seen before, with the choice of switching between real-time and a planning mode, without either feeling superior.- Very deep upgrade system that let's you play like you want to play.- Has a New Game+ mode called Recursion that randomizes enemy encounters, so you can replay it with added difficulty if you feel like it.- Has a 'limiter'-system that allows you to change the difficulty on the fly with various different debuffs/buffs to you and the enemies respectively. Adding difficulty this way gives bonus exp.- Has checkpoints that allow you to change your loadout almost every 2-3 minutes.Bad/not as good:- Took me 4 hours to beat, could have been a little longer, but wasn't needed. It provided the necessary closure.- The gameplay is mostly just moving from fight to fight. You walk a (mostly) pre-determined path and once every 2 or 3 minutes you fight something. Not sure what they could have done to make this better though, since I found the combat system really enjoyable.- Some of the lore is locked behind your combat abilities, and this lore is unlocked by using the abilities as just a normal ability, as an upgrade to an existing ability, or as a passive bonus. I understand that this is done to make you explore different ability-combinations and to try out all of the different combinations, but I found it annoying that I had to change away from my favorite loadout if I wanted the complete story.

												Transistor is an RPG by the creators of Bastion. Similarly to their previous game, the art, story, and sound design are all fantastic. The combat is a weird hybrid between real-time and turn-based that will probably be hit-or-miss with most people. The robust skill system was incredible and is probably one of Transistor's best features.The combat is different than most other games. You can move and attack in real time, but you'll find it difficult to survive without using the Turn() feature. Turn() pauses the game and allows you to plan out your next few movements and attacks. The planned actions will then be executed very quickly, without the enemies being able to attack or move. Turn() then goes on cooldown for a few seconds and most of your skill won't be usable. This creates a turn-like tempo in the the fights where you attack with Turn() and then play defensively when it's on cooldown.  The combat takes a little getting used to and won't be for everyone, but it really works well with the skill system.The skill system is one of the games best features. I didn't unlock all of the skill on the first playthough, but there are at least 16 of them. Each skill can be used in 3 ways.1. Active Skill: The skills you use in combat. You get 4 active skill slots.2. Augementation: Each active slot has two augmentation slots which alter the effect of the active skill.3. Passive Skill: Each skill has a different passive effect when placed in one of the 4 passive slots.Although this seems to be overly complex, you only start with a couple skills, the 4 active slots, and an augmentation slot for each of them. You gain additional skills and slots when you level up so the game does a good job of easing you into the skill system. Furthermore, the game does an excellent job of pushing you to experiement and try new skill combinations. I had a lot of fun experimenting with the skills and trying to find effective combinations.In conclusion, Transistor is a great game. If you liked Bastion, or are a fan of turn based RPGs, you should get this game. If you're unsure that you'll like the combat, you should look at a couple gameplay videos, but try not to spoil the story for yourself.			"

												Where do i even start. This game is breathtaking, it's a masterpiece, the pinnacle of art in gaming. Whoever doubts games to be artistic should feel ashamed, the world is fully realized, it's captivating and ambigous.The gameplay may be short but it has replay value on the recursive mode, but it's worth the money.Did i mention that the music in this game made me shiver instantly? It's that good!They did a great work on this game, it's easily a solid 10/10 in my book.Oh and yes, i did shed a few tears in the end.			"

												Before anything, I will preface this and say if you have any interest in ARPG's and are looking for a wonderful and short experience, you SHOULD pick this game up. Well worth the $20 in my opinion.  If you want a detailed explanation, feel free to read and a TLDR is at the bottom.PROS:◘Visually pleasing to the eyes, absolutly gorgeous presentation in both animation and the enviornment.◘Sound design is top notch.◘Narration done throughout the game is fun to listen to.◘Can play with either mouse or keyboard.◘Fairly intriguing theme and story get you interested◘Should run fairly well on most machines.◘Fairly challenging as you can easily be ""killed"" multiple times during any battle.     ○When you ""die"" in combat, 2 things can happen: The first is on the brink of death you engage a emergency Turn mode (Turn is explained later below) and can fight to kill a few more enemies. The second possibility is that you ""break"" a function from combat for a while, and after visiting 2 (or more) Function Kiosks you can reactive them. If you break them, you are then forced to play around with your kit to experiment with new loadouts.◘Variety of combat with many different enemies with various different upgrade versions of them.◘Absolutely STELLAR combat system along with the configurations along with it (Which are detalied below)     ○As you play the game, you obtain various skills and upgrades through leveling up or finding them around the world and they are called Functions.     ○You can use these Functions in 3 ways: The first is the Active Function which you use for combat that does its base effect. The second is the Upgrade Function, where you take one of your Functions and use it to augment another Active Function, giving it special or different effect. And lastly is the Passive Function, in which you take a Function and put it into a passive state where it will always give a effect, or activate at specific under different conditions. EVERY Function in the game connects together in one way or another.     ○As you play the game, you are allowed to fight in either real time where you cast your abilities against the enemies movements and actions with no cooldown penalty, engage the Turn system to pause the game and tactically decide how you want to approach the situation. In Turn you can move almost instantly anywhere and manually aim your shots and action which are limited by a action bar. You then execute the procedure and watch your plan unfold rapidly. However, the downside to this is that once you are done with your Turn actions, you cannot use your abilities until your Turn meter has recharged. Because of these 2 systems you have a choice as to how you want to fight your battles.◘You can use ""limiters"" to further increase the difficulty of the game and gain a small amount of bonus EXP for leveling.◘New game plus mode with all of your stuff you unlocked. CONS:◘The UI can be just a little bit wonky with assigning Functions to various roles.◘Because the story is not made apparently clear at first, you can easily get lost.◘Turn actions that detail the effects may not always be accurate, as enemies may dodge and it doesn't tell you that information.◘May be just a bit short for some, as I and other have managed to beat the game at around 6 hours.◘Because there is new game plus and not much more, some people may not find a lot of replayability from this, resulting a 6 hour experience for $20 dollars.◘The only real set of graphics options are just resolutions.TLDR: Great combat, visuals and fun for ARPG fans. Can be beaten in about 6 hours, and depending on the user the new game plus can offer replayability.Can be of a bumpy ride for the first hour for people to get used to, but you get over it quickly.Overall, I feel that just about everyone should buy this beauty. The devs that made this deserve every dollar they earn and then some for the amount of effort and love that was poured into this game.			"

												I really like Bastion and was really excited for SuperGiant's next game.  Transistor did not disapoint.  The fighting style was unique and interesting because you had to combine moves together to make them more powerful and give unique secondary abilities based on which ones you combined.  I was also surprised to find that I didn't stick with one set of moves the whole time. Transistor did a good job of making abilities good in some situations and bad in others.  It became very strategic once you got more moves and it was a lot of fun. But by far the BEST part about Transistor was the music and art.  Bastion was one of my favorite games not because the gameplay was the something I had never seen before, but that game was a paradise for your eyes and ears.  I always thought Bastion had the best soundtrack in a videogame but after playing Transistor I was blown away. The vocals for the songs are by the same person who sang ""Build that Wall"", (Ashley Barrett) except in this game you get to hear the full potential of her voice, and let me tell you, it is the best voice I have ever heard.  It fits the tone of the game really well.  The art in this game is also amazing. Particularly the colors and overall style was what really looked great.  This game also does a great job of making the story interesting by making you figure out what it is based on clues it gives you throughout the game.  In fact one of my favorite aspects was reading through character files looking for clues on what was going on.My only complaints about this game kind of negate each other.  What I mean is, I took the game quite slow, and I still finished it in 7 hours, which with how much I enjoyed it seemed short.  On the other hand, the combat system was starting to get a little repetative so I don't know that I would have wanted it to go much longer.  Overall I loved this game, and with the very interesting story, amazing music, and incredible art, I felt like it almost should have been a movie instead of a videogame for how beautiful it was. 9/10			"

												I planned on 'acquiring' the soundtrack after finishing Transistor.Instead, I bought it.That should pretty much sum up how much I enjoyed this game...On more specific notes... Combat: The combat is brilliantly designed, challenging and engaging, with a level of -meaningful- customization that actually hurts to think about. Every time I reached a station where I could change my 'loadout', I did; and everytime, it completely changed the way I interacted with the environment and the enemy. I never 'settled in' to a particular playstyle, because I felt compelled to experiment.Music: It is not only *expletive* amazing, but your character can and *is* be an integral part of it. This is the only game I know of where music is almost more immersive than the story.Graphics\Animation\Art\etc: Look at the screenshots above and then imagine it barely does the game justice. The travel sequences alone are just... yeah...Story: Find out yourself (but I thoroughly enjoyed it).Summary: If you don't have the money to buy the game, perform 'favours' and acquire some.  "

												An excellent game from the creators of Bastion; The art is just as beautiful while being more urban-focused as opposed to the more natural/outland stylings of Bastion. The story is fed to you through monologues from your weapon (the Transistor) and through news and information terminals scattered throughout the game.Definitely buy this with the soundtrack, the music is excellent and atmospheric.

												Game Name: TransistorOriginal Release: 2014Personal Rating: AEstimated Playtime:18 HoursMultiplayer/Coop?: NonePlayed on: Steam ControllerTransistor is an indie game created from the same makers of Bastion. It is a unique rpg that has an interesting balance between turn-based gameplay and real time gameplay.Controls: When I played this, I used the Steam Controller. It wasn’t hard to use at all, and it seemed rather natural to use a controller with the game. Joystick seemed prime for the movement option, and the four buttons on the face of the controller worked really well with the four skills that you have to use in-game.Graphics: This isn’t a Crysis level of graphics. Coming straight out of an indie studio, it seems unique and more like art. Cut-scenes mix in well with the 2.5D gameplay, and it’s easy to figure out what is happening as time goes on.Music: Much like Bastion, Supergiant Games (the creators) release excellent soundtracks and this is no exception. Between the songs that you unlock and Red’s (the Main Character) humming, you find yourself playing the game for the music instead of the gameplay.Overall: Transistor has a unique and potent combination of great music, easy controls and compelling gameplay, all within a fun game with an interesting plot. No super strategy is needed as you will eventually figure out the game throughout time. I would recommend it at any price, but it does drop down during the sales.			"

												In Transistor, you play as the silent starlet and singer Red, traversing the eerily empty yet colourful city of Cloudbank. The city is slowly being overtaken by a mysterious force known only as the Process, and Cloudbank's leaders have something to do with it. Desperate to put a stop to whatever's happening, Red goes out to hunt -- but not alone. She carries a sword-like contraption with her known as the Transistor, whose dulcet and heartfelt tones guide her (and you) through a decaying world...Pros+ Beautiful, mesmerizing art & visuals+ The Transistor's narration of the game+ The dreamy, cyber-like soundtrack+ Combining functions for cool attack abilities+ The overall emotional impactCons- Combat can get a bit repetitive- The main story could have been longer & more in-depth- Some story elements are left deliberately vagueThis one of the most beautiful & artful games I've ever played! The overall cyberpunkish atmosphere, the gorgeous artwork, the hauntingly loving voice of the Transistor... The game has story elements that are quite familiar in the sci-fi sphere, but its execution is just so good. I fell in love with Red, the Transistor, and their world in a little over five hours already, and bawled my eyes out at certain points during the story. The emotional pacing, aided by the superb soundtrack, was fantastic. The upsides of this game far outweigh any downsides -- which for me personally, were the slightly repetitive combat (mostly due to lots of the same enemy types, I think) and the fact that the first run-through of the story was not longer, meatier & more in-depth.Like sci-fi, strategical planning in combat (on pause), and a deeply emotional story? Then this one's for you. This game is a perfect little jewel, with my compliments to Logan Cunningham's excellent voice acting as the Transistor.			"

												I originally bought Transistor as it was one of the few games on discount that had a 9/10 rating on IGNThe game took me less than 8 hours to finish (not complete, since there is still much to explore)Gameplay was solid; you will learn anything you need to know for combat from the startMany combinations of functions (skills) make the gameplay clever, and possibilities limitless (seriously, limitless!)The art is another aspect which is great. This is further complemented by its soundtrack which is amazing as wellFinally the story, which is just masterfully put together. You will begin to realize how deep and good the story really is only after a few hours of playing. And I must say the ending of Transistor was something truly special!Conclusion: Transistor is an artistic masterpiece, I'd recommend it to any gamerPrice is quite high, so you can wait for a great offer Steam makes for you. Though considering how good I feel the game is, I'd say full price is still well worth your money93/100			"

												I give transistor ⅗ stars.I bought Transistor solely because it is from the same developer that made one of my favorite games, Bastion.  While Transistor is still a good game I was somewhat disappointed.The Good:  -As of mid November 2014 I didn’t encounter ANY bugs or instability issues, a common complaint at launch-The graphics are good, but should still work on lower-end systems-The turn based gameplay is well done for the most part-Reasonable price for a game at 6 hours of play-Has some replayability to it-While not the best story, and a little confusing at times, I think the ending ties everything up nicely and makes you think a bit. Even though the story was lacking it kept me coming back for more to finish the game.  The Bad:-The graphics, in my opinion, are not nearly as clever as Bastion.  Bastion used beautiful bright cell-shaded/watercolor style graphics to illustrate a strange and troubled world.  Transistor relies heavily on a beautiful but dark watercolor style that looks more sophisticated but is less enjoyable to look at for 6 hours of game.-The characters aren’t as likeable, developed, or funny, as Bastion’s.  The narrator of Bastion was one of the best features.  In this game the transistor character makes soft-pointless observations throughout the game that don’t add very much creative value-The turn style gameplay is again, in my opinion, a step back.  In Bastion I spent hours mastering the various weapons in the proving ground.  This game has a similar proving ground structure but the turn style combat feel easy and disconnected.  I imagine many gamers will  disagree with me on this point.-Music is a large element to the game and passing various tests unlocks more music.  However, I found the music itself to be pretty boring and uninteresting.  I have fairly broad taste in music so I imagine many will agree with me.  I’m glad I didn’t pay extra to get the boring soundtrack because I cannot imagine wanting to listen to it at any time.Based on these reasons, I give the game ⅗ stars.  Yes, it is fun, and it is well done; but it could be so much better.  I will likely follow this developer and buy future titles with the hope that they are a bit more fun than this one. "

												I usually trudge through a game's actual gameplay to get it over with, but Transistor's gameplay was so enjoyable and solid that I found myself playing through the entire game again the very next day. The deep customization of your abilities with the various Functions(), the blend of real time frantic play with the powerful frozen planning of Turn(), and difficulty scaling done right make all the game extremely enjoyable to play. There are unbelievably powerful ability combos in the game, but you're always facing enemies that can meet the challenge. If you're not, then there's still the combat modifiers and restrictions you can add. Story-wise, the world is significantly more sparse and spare than Supergiant's previous title, Bastion, but it seems to be an intentional choice: a bit of mystery allows for varied interpretations and a long narrative shelf life, which is what I think they were going for in this game. I think they leaned a little too far in the direction of limiting information, but the game doesn't suffer for it too much. I think the endgame buildup and final fight were excellently executed and they are going to be a favorite among the games I've played.			"

												Supergiant has outdone themselves with Transistor. As with Bastion, the musical score is stunning and the storyline is engaging. However, they've upped the ante with the combat, giving you plenty of options and different combinations to try. And, if you're into lore (as I am), then there's plenty of that too. The world is amazing, too. The game doesn't take long to get through, but that's not particularly a bad thing in my opinion. At the time of this writing, I just finished the first playthrough (and the time is including the time I took to read through all the lore that I have unlocked at this point). If you enjoy action RPGs, or action games, or RPGs, you will probably enjoy Transistor. Well worth the money.			"

												Didn't even take me 20 minutes to realise just how good this game is.Should've won Game Of The Year, Destiny paled in comparison.Truly beautiful, this games masterfully orchestrated music tells the tale of two lovers in a dull world pitted against them.Look into the lyrics and the themes of the game, it's deep and has inspired so many fans of the game into the subjects of what their interpretations may be. for instance, the song In Circles, or the ingame version - ""_n C_rlc_s"".This song itself depicts many things, but it's clear that the first boss you kill you have a connection with her that goes beyond regret, love, and intense feelings of guilt. you almost pity the boss as you take her soul and condemn her for her actions that she herself guilts for.. they loved each other but one lost to the ""process"".Here's a link to a mix of the two songs, it was interesting to hear as well, but please listen to them individually as well:

												Transistor is a beautiful game. From the art, to the music, to the gameplay and story, it is a treat to play.It plays like a part turn-based part real-time strategy part action RPG. This migh sound like a cluster♥♥♥♥, but it works out really well. It offers a huge amount of customization for a lot of different playstyles, and encourages you to do so in a clever, story integrated way.The plot is, well, not entirely clear at some points, but it is a very engaging story as a whole.Buy it. Buy the soundtrack. Is gud. pls play			"

												I was intrigued by this game back when it was announced at PlayStation conference. The music and the art style got me. Well, I wasn't wrong. It's a fantastic game. A bit short, but sweet. Soundtrack is a blast. It reminded me of old Silent Hill days when some of the tracks were vocalized and performed by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. I really liked it then and same thing applies here as well. ""We all become"" is easily something I can listen many times a day. Gameplay is a lot of fun. 4-5 hours in, and you can already make almost godly builds and breeze through the game. Too easy? Install limiters and test your build for the exchange of xp. The game does a very good job at describing what each skill does and how to mix them. Achievements are quite simple and straightforward as well. If you're into these kind of things, it should be a cinch. Story's good too. A little touching, I'd say. The only cons are that it's a little short and endgame isn't very exciting. I played roughly for 20 hours, loved it, but don't see myself going back to it for now.9/10 - would hum along again.			"

												mmmmmmm....Let me write some points about this game.1. From the first i discovered this game from explore queue, i just fall in love with the visual graphic. Woman protagonist + Fancy-Sword-a-Like Thing + Beautiful Background + (extra) the Title is so mysterious. Yes, i don't ask more for this, already great.2. I already thought that this will be a-long-great game, reminds that this is RPG somelike. I excited.3. I played for the first time. I confused. Then, i had mix emotion.4. After a few days playing, i just got the rythm and start to feel fun of this gameplay. Battle system, the add-on thing, turn system. Yes, i have to learn that in order to feel the fun.5. Already expecting for the long story of this game, this will be great for my next holiday break.6. Duh. I finished it. Look at my play hours. Why is this so quick . . .7. Still. This is a great game.note : maybe the storyline is simple (until you got into some chapter), but the narrative talk is somewhat i can't follow it consistently.I recommend it (plus if you bought in sale :) )			"

												Supergiant has outdone themselves with Transistor. As with Bastion, the musical score is stunning and the storyline is engaging. However, they've upped the ante with the combat, giving you plenty of options and different combinations to try. And, if you're into lore (as I am), then there's plenty of that too. The world is amazing, too. The game doesn't take long to get through, but that's not particularly a bad thing in my opinion. At the time of this writing, I just finished the first playthrough (and the time is including the time I took to read through all the lore that I have unlocked at this point). If you enjoy action RPGs, or action games, or RPGs, you will probably enjoy Transistor. Well worth the money.			"

That is something incredibly difficult especially in today's gaming scene. Never have I been more happy for a gaming studio to exist and make such incredible experiences.			"

												I give transistor ⅗ stars.I bought Transistor solely because it is from the same developer that made one of my favorite games, Bastion.  While Transistor is still a good game I was somewhat disappointed.The Good:  -As of mid November 2014 I didn’t encounter ANY bugs or instability issues, a common complaint at launch-The graphics are good, but should still work on lower-end systems-The turn based gameplay is well done for the most part-Reasonable price for a game at 6 hours of play-Has some replayability to it-While not the best story, and a little confusing at times, I think the ending ties everything up nicely and makes you think a bit. Even though the story was lacking it kept me coming back for more to finish the game.  The Bad:-The graphics, in my opinion, are not nearly as clever as Bastion.  Bastion used beautiful bright cell-shaded/watercolor style graphics to illustrate a strange and troubled world.  Transistor relies heavily on a beautiful but dark watercolor style that looks more sophisticated but is less enjoyable to look at for 6 hours of game.-The characters aren’t as likeable, developed, or funny, as Bastion’s.  The narrator of Bastion was one of the best features.  In this game the transistor character makes soft-pointless observations throughout the game that don’t add very much creative value-The turn style gameplay is again, in my opinion, a step back.  In Bastion I spent hours mastering the various weapons in the proving ground.  This game has a similar proving ground structure but the turn style combat feel easy and disconnected.  I imagine many gamers will  disagree with me on this point.-Music is a large element to the game and passing various tests unlocks more music.  However, I found the music itself to be pretty boring and uninteresting.  I have fairly broad taste in music so I imagine many will agree with me.  I’m glad I didn’t pay extra to get the boring soundtrack because I cannot imagine wanting to listen to it at any time.Based on these reasons, I give the game ⅗ stars.  Yes, it is fun, and it is well done; but it could be so much better.  I will likely follow this developer and buy future titles with the hope that they are a bit more fun than this one. "

												Transistor is an RPG by the creators of Bastion. Similarly to their previous game, the art, story, and sound design are all fantastic. The combat is a weird hybrid between real-time and turn-based that will probably be hit-or-miss with most people. The robust skill system was incredible and is probably one of Transistor's best features.The combat is different than most other games. You can move and attack in real time, but you'll find it difficult to survive without using the Turn() feature. Turn() pauses the game and allows you to plan out your next few movements and attacks. The planned actions will then be executed very quickly, without the enemies being able to attack or move. Turn() then goes on cooldown for a few seconds and most of your skill won't be usable. This creates a turn-like tempo in the the fights where you attack with Turn() and then play defensively when it's on cooldown.  The combat takes a little getting used to and won't be for everyone, but it really works well with the skill system.The skill system is one of the games best features. I didn't unlock all of the skill on the first playthough, but there are at least 16 of them. Each skill can be used in 3 ways.1. Active Skill: The skills you use in combat. You get 4 active skill slots.2. Augementation: Each active slot has two augmentation slots which alter the effect of the active skill.3. Passive Skill: Each skill has a different passive effect when placed in one of the 4 passive slots.Although this seems to be overly complex, you only start with a couple skills, the 4 active slots, and an augmentation slot for each of them. You gain additional skills and slots when you level up so the game does a good job of easing you into the skill system. Furthermore, the game does an excellent job of pushing you to experiement and try new skill combinations. I had a lot of fun experimenting with the skills and trying to find effective combinations.In conclusion, Transistor is a great game. If you liked Bastion, or are a fan of turn based RPGs, you should get this game. If you're unsure that you'll like the combat, you should look at a couple gameplay videos, but try not to spoil the story for yourself.			"

												Like Bastion? Transistor features a story of similar originality and heart, an even more engaging form of tactical gameplay, plenty of options to mix and match, and another cast of vibrant, loveable characters. The game is eager to give you room to draw your own conclusions, which to some may seem perhaps a little lazy, but the pieces are all there. The theme of the story can be said to be individuality and creation, and as such the story follows suit, allowing you to make of Cloudbank whatever you please. But don't trust the hype, give it a go! It's worth the full price and more.Story length: ~6 hours, if you don't die a lot.Extras: Limiters, achievements and 'Tests' extend the game by a few hours, plus Recursions. Exploring every inch of Cloudbank and its voice acting will easily double your game hours.			"

												SuperGiant Games have seriously outdone themselves. Transistor is an amazing game. Visually, it's absolutely stunning. Gorgeous and complex in some places, and stark and stylized in others, you end up just looking around, taking your time to soak in all the visual details. Coupled with the absolutely enchanting soundtrack, it just sets the tone of the game perfectly. The combat is pretty smart and highly customizable as well, although the real-time aspect of it is a bit clunkier than, for example Bastion's, but that's not the main focus in Transistor. The story is kinda told to you through the Transistor sword; more as a companion than a narrator this time. You can also choose your level of involvement in the story as well, which is always a nice feature. You can play through in a straight line, or take your time and find all the little details of the city of Cloudbank and its citizens. Overall, a very VERY hearty recommendation for Transistor. Well done, SuperGiant.			"

												Just a great game all-around.Most everybody that's interested in this game will be comparing it to Bastion, so we'll go with that metric.In terms of gameplay, Transistor is quite different than Bastion.  Yes, they're both top-down hack-and-slashes at heart, but while Bastion's beating heart lies squarely in twitch/dodge/attack mechanics, Transistor is a more contemplative experience with its Turn() system.  In fact, the grand majority of Transistor ends up playing much more like a tactics game than a hack-and-slash game; use of skills outside of Turn() is limited and you'll spend most of your time outside of Turn() playing keep-away.  Some people may find this a downgrade, but if you're the sort of person that enjoyed Bastion and also logged hundered-hour files in tactical RPG games (myself included) you'll find yourself comfortable in the world of Transistor.In terms of style, Transistor is very much cut from the same cloth as Bastion.  That's to be expected when Bastion was such a beautiful and lovingly crafted game.  Painterly visuals abound, and Darren Korb (music) and Logan Cunningham (primary voice actor) are both back in top form, as I'm sure everyone not living in a cave is aware.  Come for the audio-visual niravana, stay for the gameplay.As far as criticisms are concerned, stability of the game is still a bit lower than could be desired at this point; I had to play around with the files of the game to overcome the dreaded startup crash bug that many people have been complaining of.  A minor criticisim:  If you're the sort of person that doesn't play around with the dynamic difficulty system (Bastion's Pantheon : Transistor's Limiters) you may find the game easy once you've unlocked some of the more powerful functions (I found it a bit trivial even with half the limiters on).  A New Game + feature and use of all the limiters is an easy remedy for those wanting more gameplay and more challenge.Three things that are fab:# Turn() system and executing sets that make you feel like a genius# Wonderfully detailed world and story# Extra story exposition linked to use of Functions for that extra bit of OCD fodderThree things that are butt:# May not work immediately on some computers# No Steamplay support as of yet# A bit easy for those seeking a teeth-grinding experienceAll in all, Transistor is a wonderful nugget of a game that you shouldn't hesistate to pick up, even at its introductory price-point.  If you liked Bastion for its artistic elements, you'll love Transistor, and if you enjoy tactical games you may end up liking Transistor even more than Bastion.  I know I did!  The main story lasted me roughly nine hours when doing everything available, and I have a bit of a completionist bent.  I have just started a New Game+ session.			"

												This was probably the best Steam Summer Sale 2014 game I purchased. A very linear game, but with much more customization than expected. Combining multiple skills into one powerful skill, and those you choose not to use to attack with can be used passively on youself so they don't go to waste. Transistor has the same narrator feel that Bastion did, making the story feel just as great as their previous game.Would highly recommend to purchase this during the Winter Sale if you enjoy a mixture of Action/Turn Strategy *Not 100% Turn Based*Its worth the NewGame+ it has to offer, which I will need to begin now..

												'Transistor' merits artistic recognition for its soundtrack and design. The game is visually interesting and colourful, and I'd recommend it purely for its visual showcase. Unfortunately, the storyline is somewhat confusing and hard to follow; I began to grasp the story toward the end of my first play-through and on my second, and unavoidably more challenging play-through, the story began to make more sense. Perhaps this was intentional, hoping to ensure good replay value. I didn't mind playing the game again, as the gameplay was fun (and at times challenging), however poor storytelling is certainly this game's downfall.			"

												Transistor, Supergiant Games' second release, is an enthralling, unique experience that meets and shatters any expectation one may have about it. If you've played Bastion, and are wondering how Transistor fares in comparison with it, know that this game pulls all the right inspiration from SPG's previous release, but maintains its own identity to set it apart as something truly original.Like Bastion, Transistor is a narrative-driven game with emphasis on configurable gameplay, i.e. loadouts. There's optional difficulty modifiers and the game plays in standard psuedo-isometric fashion. But the similarities end there. Unlike Bastion, Transistor's fighting system is much more diverse and complex; more RPG, less action-adventure. A core component of that system is something called 'Turn()' mode, which essentially shifts the game from real-time to turn-based action. I find Transistor's combat system to be incredibly unique, and something that enables multiple play styles to shine through.The story of the game, while similar to Bastion, in that it's a linear, narrative-driven plot, is again, just superficially similar. While the narrator in Bastion is more so telling a story, the narrator in Transistor isn't really a narrator at all. He's another character, with his own perspective and reactions on what's going on around him. He doesn't really tell the story so much as he does experience it. The real meat of lore is actually acquired through using abilities you've gathered in various ways. This is a vastly different take on storytelling because one may not have even uncovered the whole thing through one playthrough. I believe though, that the game meant to be played like that; it's meant to be played through more than once. And it's obvious, as the New Game+ mode is called a 'Recursion'. For some, this may be a turn off, which is understandable. After my first playthrough, I was left with more questions than answers. It left a slightly sour taste in mouth, but after playing more and uncovering all that there was to be uncovered, I enjoyed the story much more than I initially did. It's a very different way to tell a story, but I think fans will appreciate it.Overall, I highly recommend Transistor. It has creative, unique gameplay with a story that is equally as intriguing. Not to mention the beautiful art and soundtrack, which is worth buying in its own right!			"

												Transistor: Not a bad game. Supergiant play to their strengths, which is an isometric 3d world with beautiul art, a sweet soundtrack and a narrator that narrates everything about you in a nice rich voice.The problem I have with it is largely that, though. Supergiant stuck to their strengths and did not really push much of any boundaries, and it wasn't really that novel; Bastion 2.0, really.The main innovation is in the combat system, which I do sorta like - hate having to use Turn(), love how all your attacks work as primary attacks, upgrade modules or passive items. I also like the semi-online aspect, where you can see ghosts of other people, a'la Dark Souls. (At least, I'm pretty sure they are, and I'm sure the numerous polls you use are actually being formed by other players voting as well)One bug I had, which wasn't fatal, but severely annoying in that my game randomly locks up for maybe 3 seconds when I do things like attack.Worth buying -- if you've played Bastion, though, might want to wait until it's like $15 or cheaper instead of the full $20, because they feel like the same game almost.

The short version of this is: I thought Transistor was terrific. Doesn't overstay its welcome. Fun take on combat and on that tired ol' skill tree.Play if you like: Portishead, Bastion, noir stylings, sci-fi jazz, le 'moods'.   Also, (Supergiant Games own) Greg Kasavin's favourite game of all time is Ultima V on the Apple II. That's on record. Ultima V is also one of my favourite games.

												One of the best games of 2014. A great succesor to Bastion. The art style and the music is beautiful. The story is one that isn't immediately clear, but if you are smart enough to piece together everything, it is a beauitful plot. The gameplay is very unique and addicting. I found myself looking forward to each encounter. The final boss is probably my favorite final boss in a long time. This is a beautiful game.			"

												Supergiant games is 2 for 2 on absolutely incredible experiences. Sure both Bastion and Transistor are short games, but the story and the way it's delivered is unlike any other games out there. Transistor will make you experience more emotions than you thought you could, and by the end of the game you will cherish every damn moment you took out of the experience.			"

												BeautifulInnovativeChallengingReal-time-turn-based combatComplex & adaptable combos & upgradesA less frantic, cyberpunk sibling to Bastion. Chiefly focused on a novel and well realised real time/turn based combat action. Hugely adaptable and innovative combo/upgrade system. One of the best looking & sounding games. Good price point. Unintrusive story elements uniquely integrated into the combat upgrade mechanics system.Super Giant's second offering perhaps will elevate them to heroes of the cultured game scene.Not for everyone, including some fans of Bastion, it will be enjoyed by many and will win absolute adoration from quite a few, including me.

												Transistor is one captivating game, followed by beautiful soundtrack and pretty graphics even my toaster can manage <':And the combat system brings something slightly different than your typical RPG, I mean, you can kinda play it turn-based, or not if you're hardc0r3.Basically, you start as Red, who's lost her voice, pulling out the Transistor from a corpse... And the Transistor talks to you. The story unfolds as you continue it. Transistor begins after the action, you following a vague goal of overthrowing the Camerata, and I still don't understand who they are, but I really enjoyed it anyway, now's time to understand the whole plot...Edit: I just watched the trailer. OopsLoved this game, time to upload more screenshots			"

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ what do I say.This is a game I was absolutely hyped for. I loved Bastion, and so when they announced Transistor, I was excited, I was hyped- especially once they released a trailer with ""We All Become.""And it absolutely didn't let me down. The soundtrack is incredible and helps tell the story of the game in a wonderful way. The graphics are so nice and the story... my goodness, I absolutely LOVED everything about this game.It's a little on the short side but it's not a bad thing to me. The shortness kept it from being unnecessarily repetive like Bastion was in the later parts of the game.All in all- if you enjoyed Bastion, if you enjoyed its soundtrack, GET TRANSISTOR. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.			"

												Playing this game after my exams ended was possibly the best way to reward myself after cramming all 6 weeks of medical knowledge in 8 hours thee day before the exams.This game has an excellent combat system, allowing you the opportunity to experiment and find your playstle and suit it as such. The artwork of the game excellently crafted, a nice complementary soundtrack and the story just brimming with wanton wonder.It's amazing how Supergiant Games can pull another rabbit out of the hat after their success that is Bastion, but with the time they invested into Transistor, I'd say that it was work and time well used.I have yet to play the New Game+ mode yet, but you can be sure that I'll be back to check out  the new things in the game itself that it has to offer. Still hesitant? Don't be, this is one of the most thought-provoking and immersive game that you will ever play.			"

It's got a great looking interface and environment.  I didn't find any bugs.  It's thematic elements and artistic sensabilities are, frankly, amazing.  It's sound track is by far the best soundtrack I've ever heard in a game... seriously... like... I actually want the soundtrack.Hell for the money this is a rediculously entertaining game.  It's at least 5 time more entertaining than the new Wolfenstein... and doing the math really quick... that makes Wolfenstain about 1/15 as entertaining when you use the actual costs of the games as multipliers.

												Another great game from the makers of Bastion. Excellent gameplay coupled with a one of a kind narrative makes this mysterious story both quite memorable and replayable. The soundtrack alone makes this game worth at least one play through if not more. Transistor has a very neat way of introducing challenges as well as altering modes of difficulty through ""limiters,"" these are sort of down-grades that can create a challenge, but reward you with greater experience. The higheryour level, the greater number of ""Functions,"" or abilities you have at your disposal. While some abilities may not seem very useful directly, they usually have a benefit ifused passively. Utilizing different combinations of abilities allows for a wide range of play-styles and tactics. Transistor has such a great take on gameplay mechanics that it is entirely refreshing and a lot of fun. Considering the above, the one minor drawback, to me, is how vague the world is. However, I can't really consider that a negative, because the world of Transistor and everything in it can be open to interpretation. GIven this I think Supergiant has accomplished a pretty awesome feat, making the player use their imagination in both the gameplay/strategy as well as the story they've told. I highly recommend Transistor to just about anyone.			"

												If you liked Bastion and would play it again, then Transistor is well worth it.If you found it to be somewhat lacking, then I don't honestly feel that the reworked combat alone will be ultimately satisfying.Before I dive into the other parts of the game, I feel it is worth mentioning that the PC version suffers a few hiccups here and there, especially with KB+M controls. Being able to aim your attacks in Turn() is nice, but the game will often snap your attacks to enemies you're mousing over instead of the tile you're aiming for. Almost every attack is (or can have) AoE, so this is kind of a big deal. The game used to stutter hard on my rig, but no longer does so with the first update. However, that very update broke camera controls in Turn(), making it difficult to aim or move off of the screen. The game is definitely playable with a controller, and I recommend trying that.Now, the game's individual parts are not bad-- the art direction is gorgeous, and you really couldn't ask for more from the music or Logan Cunningham. The combat system is at first pretty deep, and allows for the player to flesh out their own arsenal and playstyle, but provides little incentive for the player to actually experiment once they've unlocked all the attached lore (executed pretty neatly) and discovered their winning combos.But there is ultimately something missing both from Bastion and Transistor. I've found that they both leave you wanting more-- not necessarily in a good way. There is little exploration or risk/reward beyond the critical path, and perhaps the addition of one or two extra mechanics might have tightened it up a bit; made it feel more substantial. I acknowledge that it sounds superfluous, and hopefully it won't bother you as much as it did me. I really want to appreciate the sentiment of elegant game design, because the game does feel like it's pretty clean of unnecessary or tacked-on bits (aside from NG+). I think the real flaw is that you aren't really introduced to any new gameplay mechanics outside of combat, and the combat does not stay fresh forever. Again, maybe it is unnecessary and it won't bother you, but them's my two pickles.Regarding NG+: don't bother recursing through the game for the story. All that's new is one or two lines at the start, different enemy setups, a second pair of every function (you can power up a function with a second instance of itself) and of course the achievement.

												This is a solid game. I'm going to compare it to Bastion, since that was the game previously released by these developers. This game is more confusing than Bastion as far as the storyline goes. The combat is just as interesting, but fairly easy once you learn certain combos. There is not much in the way of a tutorial, you just have to keep mixing abilities together until something works well.The art and music in this game are phenoemenal, the gameplay and story are average, and the length is fairly short. Supergiant Games is really good at makes a visceral, fresh world that you haven't really seen before.If you want to support new and interesting games like this one, buy it at full price to help the developers out. If you don't want to spend the money, get it while it is on sale. It's worth it.			"

Would highly recommend if you are interested in moderately short, cheap adventure game with interesting game-play, intriguing characters and plot line, and style to spare.* Note: I encountered a weird glitch at launch dealing with collisions in combat and don't know if they were fixed since then as I picked this up at launch (Day 1); it wasn't game breaking, though.  I am not sure if it was related to the fact that I was running on a Crossfire setup, just throwing it out there as a warning in case someone else encounters it to.			"

It has a few flaws: Transistor was a very easy game, it appeared to have some conflicting design decisions (specifically two of the limiters) and had some balance issues/shallow combat in parts. However, none of these flaws stopped me from enjoying the game, so I don't think they should stop anyone from purchasing it.			"

												Bastion 2: Electric Boogaloo is a fantastic game, and a more apt name than it should be. That said, while the game has many key similarities to Bastion (art style, certain plot points, music, the same narrator), it also has many key differences, even some more subtle ones in those similarities I mentioned. Most obvious is that it's sci-fi rather than fantasy, the story as a whole is bit more subtle and atmospheric, and the battle system is... turn-based...???Regardless, it's a ton of fun, the music and art are just as good if not better than the amazing precedent Bastion set, giving us a lot more vocals of the singer behind Build That Wall from Bastion (there's even a hum button this time around! it is the most important button, you can literally have your character hum to the music at pretty much any time), and having a more tech-heavy-feel to it in general.Point is, it's a fantastic game, buy it 500 times.

												I have controversial feelings about this game.It has great things like gameplay, atmosphere, interesting ideas, quality sound and graphics.But the plot is rather dull. You don't understand what happened, why happened, who are these people and what is going on. It feels like the authors wanted to make impression of deep meaning and mistery with all these unspoken things, or probably it should contribute to teh drama - but at the end it boils down to just messy heap of random facts and random words.Plus, overliance on the background narrator (the sword, in this case) is really annoying. He talks just for the sake of talking.I still can recommend it, but it is significantly weaker than Bastion.			"

												It was initally the track ""Old Friends"" from the trailer that drew me in so it was very much a case of came for the music, stayed for the experience. Storyline is an inbetween lines tale of love admist revenge.Gameplay is a fusion of real time hack and slash similar to Bastion but at a slower pace with the ""Turn Mode"" being like a tactical mode similar to V.A.T.S via the recent Fallout games (3 and New Vegas). Overall gameplay is not complicated and encourages experimentation with rewarding results. Also there are options via ""Limiters"" to increase the difficulty and affect consequntly how you utilize many of the protagonist's abilites as you level up.  Battles can be long and enduring, but this is very much true to life itself.The music and art style is what gives this game it's atmosphere. The soundtrack is an eclectic fusion of dissonance and consonance with genres such as eletronica, rock,  downbeat, jazz and vocal. There are quite a few notable tracks that are awesome to listen to for pure audial pleasure. Art style is very reminiscent of the late 19th century styles with Art Nouveau, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Gustav Klimt. Transistor is a wonderful game for its subtle poetic atmosphere and storyline that verges into the territory of Romanticism with Heinrich von Kleist.A beautiful game!			"

												I planned on 'acquiring' the soundtrack after finishing Transistor.Instead, I bought it.That should pretty much sum up how much I enjoyed this game...On more specific notes... Combat: The combat is brilliantly designed, challenging and engaging, with a level of -meaningful- customization that actually hurts to think about. Every time I reached a station where I could change my 'loadout', I did; and everytime, it completely changed the way I interacted with the environment and the enemy. I never 'settled in' to a particular playstyle, because I felt compelled to experiment.Music: It is not only *expletive* amazing, but your character can and *is* be an integral part of it. This is the only game I know of where music is almost more immersive than the story.Graphics\Animation\Art\etc: Look at the screenshots above and then imagine it barely does the game justice. The travel sequences alone are just... yeah...Story: Find out yourself (but I thoroughly enjoyed it).Summary: If you don't have the money to buy the game, perform 'favours' and acquire some.  "

												SuperGiant Games have seriously outdone themselves. Transistor is an amazing game. Visually, it's absolutely stunning. Gorgeous and complex in some places, and stark and stylized in others, you end up just looking around, taking your time to soak in all the visual details. Coupled with the absolutely enchanting soundtrack, it just sets the tone of the game perfectly. The combat is pretty smart and highly customizable as well, although the real-time aspect of it is a bit clunkier than, for example Bastion's, but that's not the main focus in Transistor. The story is kinda told to you through the Transistor sword; more as a companion than a narrator this time. You can also choose your level of involvement in the story as well, which is always a nice feature. You can play through in a straight line, or take your time and find all the little details of the city of Cloudbank and its citizens. Overall, a very VERY hearty recommendation for Transistor.

												A good game, although didn't get the same feelings I did playing Bastion. Ending was a bit disappointing, and it felt way too linear compared to the first one. For the positives, really nice way of having the combat. You can choose between either action styled combat similar to what Bastion had, or a more strategy focused approach, which in a way was similar to Frozen Synapse. Also they kept the artstyle similar to Bastion, but improved a lot on it as well. New to this game is also a really nice flexible ability system, where you can decide to use your new weapons as weapons, additions to old weapons or as passive abilities. This makes it so that you have seemingly endless options when it comes to your playstyle.In my opinion no characters aside from the main character were noteworthy, which is kind of a shame, since that contributed a lot to Bastion's atmosphere.I shouldn't really be comparing it this much to Bastion, as they aren't directly related to each other, but I think a lot of people wanting to buy this is because they want it to be a similar experience.As a conclusion I'd recommend this game to everyone who liked Bastion, but it doesn't quite live up to the expectations (storywise) I had after playing the first one.

												Dystopian stylings of a more genteel Neuromancer, lacquered with Supergiant's introversion and narrative.  Plays like a mashup of Final Fantasy Tactics and Zelda. Action RPG at its finest.  A techno-infused Bastion: a strong second showing for this studio.  Highly recommended.  Imagery evokes a midnight lantern festival.  Music, haunting and soulful.Only thing that could use improvement is the customization interface, but that doesn't take long to get over.  The flexibility of its systems is limitless.  Well, worth digging into for the min-maxing enthusiasts.  If you like RPGs and have decent reflexes for action games, go for it!			"

												I enjoyed Bastion. Bastion had pizazz. And honestly, have always been a sucker for the isometric camera in games. So this was one of those safe bet kinda things. The short version of this is: I thought Transistor was terrific. Doesn't overstay its welcome. Fun take on combat and on that tired ol' skill tree.Play if you like: Portishead, Bastion, noir stylings, sci-fi jazz, le 'moods'.   Also, (Supergiant Games own) Greg Kasavin's favourite game of all time is Ultima V on the Apple II. That's on record. Ultima V is also one of my favourite games. So really this thing couldn't have done wrong. Guess that renders all this kinda moot.			"

												Just a great game all-around.Most everybody that's interested in this game will be comparing it to Bastion, so we'll go with that metric.In terms of gameplay, Transistor is quite different than Bastion.  Yes, they're both top-down hack-and-slashes at heart, but while Bastion's beating heart lies squarely in twitch/dodge/attack mechanics, Transistor is a more contemplative experience with its Turn() system.  In fact, the grand majority of Transistor ends up playing much more like a tactics game than a hack-and-slash game; use of skills outside of Turn() is limited and you'll spend most of your time outside of Turn() playing keep-away.  Some people may find this a downgrade, but if you're the sort of person that enjoyed Bastion and also logged hundered-hour files in tactical RPG games (myself included) you'll find yourself comfortable in the world of Transistor.In terms of style, Transistor is very much cut from the same cloth as Bastion.  That's to be expected when Bastion was such a beautiful and lovingly crafted game.  Painterly visuals abound, and Darren Korb (music) and Logan Cunningham (primary voice actor) are both back in top form, as I'm sure everyone not living in a cave is aware.  Come for the audio-visual niravana, stay for the gameplay.As far as criticisms are concerned, stability of the game is still a bit lower than could be desired at this point; I had to play around with the files of the game to overcome the dreaded startup crash bug that many people have been complaining of.  A minor criticisim:  If you're the sort of person that doesn't play around with the dynamic difficulty system (Bastion's Pantheon : Transistor's Limiters) you may find the game easy once you've unlocked some of the more powerful functions (I found it a bit trivial even with half the limiters on).  A New Game + feature and use of all the limiters is an easy remedy for those wanting more gameplay and more challenge.Three things that are fab:# Turn() system and executing sets that make you feel like a genius# Wonderfully detailed world and story# Extra story exposition linked to use of Functions for that extra bit of OCD fodderThree things that are butt:# May not work immediately on some computers# No Steamplay support as of yet# A bit easy for those seeking a teeth-grinding experienceAll in all, Transistor is a wonderful nugget of a game that you shouldn't hesistate to pick up, even at its introductory price-point.  If you liked Bastion for its artistic elements, you'll love Transistor, and if you enjoy tactical games you may end up liking Transistor even more than Bastion.  I know I did!  The main story lasted me roughly nine hours when doing everything available, and I have a bit of a completionist bent.  I have just started a New Game+ session.			"

												It's hard to describe this game without using the word ""beautiful"" at least several hundred times, along with other adjectives, such as ""amazing"", ""addicting"", and ""magnificent"". I'm shocked how some people don't realize its true intentions as rather a story you are thrown into to experience first hand. I'll try to explain this further with no spoilers:The beginning throws you straight into the game; no main menu, no background story, nothing. I had to YouTube the game just to make sure I hadn't accidently skipped an intro cutscene, but sure enough, what I was seeing was the way it was intended to begin. Already, I was impressed.Gameplay felt comfortable. No stretching my tiny, feminine fingers out to reach oddly specific keys. Mouse controls were smooth and responsive. I never had a problem getting stuck on anything or walking into walls. My first time playing through I obviously relied on the Turn() aspect of the combat quite a bit, but towards the end and on my second time around, I realized the benefits of using both styles of combat, using the real time more for specific enemies that either evaded the effects of Turn() or were not of importance to waste it on. The key feature of applying Functions as a normal active function, an upgrade, or a passive stat was genius and allows for any person's unique fighting strategies. With how flexible the combat is, I'm surprised people have complaints about it.The characters and dialogue of the entire game were enthralling and immersive. I felt highly connected with Red's character, and knew so much about her despite her ailment. That never stopped her character from shining through. Her sassy yet proper attitude was visible in her actions, not to mention how weak and afraid she truly was. She didn't have the amazing super strength to lift such a giant sword all the time. It would constantly dragged behind her, but she would gather her little strength to unleash amazing attacks, usually having to lift herself and the sword back up off the ground afterwards. She was constantly playing with her hair and adjusting herself, but obviously was not too absorbed in her looks, seeing that she tore such a beautiful ball gown to shreds for the sake of being able to run. Mr. Nobody, as he titles himself at an early point and what I prefer to call him since, no, he is not the Transistor itself, still shines through despite not even having a body. His voice acting is absolutely amazing. Every word meant something. Some lines made tears well up in my eyes. He had attitude as well, much more sarcastic and joking, but he was just as believable as Red.The story, while I won't say much, was just beautiful. It's never what you expect, but not hard to follow along with. I will say the trailer gives false ideas and practically lies about the true story. Playing this blind is an amazing experience. Do me a favor and when Mr. Nobody starts talking, don't cut him off. Let him speak. All the dialogue means something in the story and if you cut him off, you could lose so much of the true story and not understand things in the future. A lot of playthroughs on YouTube do this. Don't cut off the experience for yourself. Take the extra time to sit there and just listen.The music is just fantastic, and the little hum you can play for each track gives it a new spin and practically makes it a different song. All the music is addicting and plays perfectly along side the gameplay. The music is mellow and slow, so you never feel rushed in a battle, making the combat feel smooth and relaxed rather than frantic. The music is meant to calm you in the fray of battle and does so quite well. The art speaks for itself. Even if you hate the game, you can't deny its beauty. Everything looks hand painted. The 3D models are high definition, to the point where Red's facial expressions are visible. I'm simply obsessed with the artistic style they chose.Final boss and ending sequence brought me to tears. I sobbed like a little girl, but for good reason, so don't judge. I had been near tears for most of the game due to its music and voice acting and the end pulled the final strings to my heart. It has been a very long time since a game has done this for me. I will ask you all again something here; if you beat it, when it asks you to play the recursion, at least watch the intro again. If the slight secret difference in the intro does not compel you to play more, than I'm not sure what will.To be blunt, I'm kind of an expert on this game. I've been tracking it since its announcement at E3, watched all the demos and trailers, received it on the release day, have the soundtrack on my phone, and at the time of posting this I have racked up about 14 hours on the game. I will say if you're expecting a casual game of the typical demographic of 13-17 year old boys, this has no time for you. This game requires patience, attention, and heart. It is not the game's fault if you do not feel the need to provide it with these then seek to trash it for ""not being good enough"". Before you judge it, follow my suggestion of listening to all the dialogue and at least attempt to finish it. The game should take someone who is not rushed about 10 hours; not long at all. This game is a story and an experience, not something you can mindlessly blow through.My final rating is 10/10, simply because it brought me to tears not once, not twice, but three times, and I'll happily cry again just to play through it once more to immerse myself in its beautiful story.

												Very rarely is it that a game can surprise me - and Transistor managed to surprise me with just about everything.  It set the perfect mood with its beautiful art style and soundtrack.  The gameplay was variable without being overbearing and tied into the storytelling elements with seamless grace.  In short, Transistor is the kind of game I get to play perhaps once every couple of years, if I'm lucky, and it will stay with me for a very long time to come.  Mainstream titles wish they were as good as this.

												Before anything, I will preface this and say if you have any interest in ARPG's and are looking for a wonderful and short experience, you SHOULD pick this game up. Well worth the $20 in my opinion.  If you want a detailed explanation, feel free to read and a TLDR is at the bottom.PROS:◘Visually pleasing to the eyes, absolutly gorgeous presentation in both animation and the enviornment.◘Sound design is top notch.◘Narration done throughout the game is fun to listen to.◘Can play with either mouse or keyboard.◘Fairly intriguing theme and story get you interested◘Should run fairly well on most machines.◘Fairly challenging as you can easily be ""killed"" multiple times during any battle.     ○When you ""die"" in combat, 2 things can happen: The first is on the brink of death you engage a emergency Turn mode (Turn is explained later below) and can fight to kill a few more enemies. The second possibility is that you ""break"" a function from combat for a while, and after visiting 2 (or more) Function Kiosks you can reactive them. If you break them, you are then forced to play around with your kit to experiment with new loadouts.◘Variety of combat with many different enemies with various different upgrade versions of them.◘Absolutely STELLAR combat system along with the configurations along with it (Which are detalied below)     ○As you play the game, you obtain various skills and upgrades through leveling up or finding them around the world and they are called Functions.     ○You can use these Functions in 3 ways: The first is the Active Function which you use for combat that does its base effect. The second is the Upgrade Function, where you take one of your Functions and use it to augment another Active Function, giving it special or different effect. And lastly is the Passive Function, in which you take a Function and put it into a passive state where it will always give a effect, or activate at specific under different conditions. EVERY Function in the game connects together in one way or another.     ○As you play the game, you are allowed to fight in either real time where you cast your abilities against the enemies movements and actions with no cooldown penalty, engage the Turn system to pause the game and tactically decide how you want to approach the situation. In Turn you can move almost instantly anywhere and manually aim your shots and action which are limited by a action bar. You then execute the procedure and watch your plan unfold rapidly. However, the downside to this is that once you are done with your Turn actions, you cannot use your abilities until your Turn meter has recharged. Because of these 2 systems you have a choice as to how you want to fight your battles.◘You can use ""limiters"" to further increase the difficulty of the game and gain a small amount of bonus EXP for leveling.◘New game plus mode with all of your stuff you unlocked. CONS:◘The UI can be just a little bit wonky with assigning Functions to various roles.◘Because the story is not made apparently clear at first, you can easily get lost.◘Turn actions that detail the effects may not always be accurate, as enemies may dodge and it doesn't tell you that information.◘May be just a bit short for some, as I and other have managed to beat the game at around 6 hours.◘Because there is new game plus and not much more, some people may not find a lot of replayability from this, resulting a 6 hour experience for $20 dollars.◘The only real set of graphics options are just resolutions.TLDR: Great combat, visuals and fun for ARPG fans. Can be beaten in about 6 hours, and depending on the user the new game plus can offer replayability.Can be of a bumpy ride for the first hour for people to get used to, but you get over it quickly.Overall, I feel that just about everyone should buy this beauty. The devs that made this deserve every dollar they earn and then some for the amount of effort and love that was poured into this game.			"

												Transistor is an RPG by the creators of Bastion. Similarly to their previous game, the art, story, and sound design are all fantastic. The combat is a weird hybrid between real-time and turn-based that will probably be hit-or-miss with most people. The robust skill system was incredible and is probably one of Transistor's best features.The combat is different than most other games. You can move and attack in real time, but you'll find it difficult to survive without using the Turn() feature. Turn() pauses the game and allows you to plan out your next few movements and attacks. The planned actions will then be executed very quickly, without the enemies being able to attack or move. Turn() then goes on cooldown for a few seconds and most of your skill won't be usable. This creates a turn-like tempo in the the fights where you attack with Turn() and then play defensively when it's on cooldown.  The combat takes a little getting used to and won't be for everyone, but it really works well with the skill system.The skill system is one of the games best features. I didn't unlock all of the skill on the first playthough, but there are at least 16 of them. Each skill can be used in 3 ways.1. Active Skill: The skills you use in combat. You get 4 active skill slots.2. Augementation: Each active slot has two augmentation slots which alter the effect of the active skill.3. Passive Skill: Each skill has a different passive effect when placed in one of the 4 passive slots.Although this seems to be overly complex, you only start with a couple skills, the 4 active slots, and an augmentation slot for each of them. You gain additional skills and slots when you level up so the game does a good job of easing you into the skill system. Furthermore, the game does an excellent job of pushing you to experiement and try new skill combinations. I had a lot of fun experimenting with the skills and trying to find effective combinations.In conclusion, Transistor is a great game. If you liked Bastion, or are a fan of turn based RPGs, you should get this game. If you're unsure that you'll like the combat, you should look at a couple gameplay videos, but try not to spoil the story for yourself.			"

 Truely AmazingMy First review to a game, i will try my best to tell you the pro's and cons with my personal expierence throught the game.I am an Indie Game Lover. Transistor is one of those titles that  pulled off what indie game spirit is all about. It is visually stunning with isometric graphics and a beautiful setting in a futuristic world which looks something like futuristic tokyo. It has a narrative story which is well driven with a mystery element to it.The most amazing part of the game though, is the GAMEPLAY and the Combat mechanics with no tutorial given, it is left for the player to figure it out. The controls are like MOBA(if you play from a keyboard+mouse), but the gameplay is nowhere near it(in a positive way), the combat style is highly customizable which gives every player the chance to adapt and change their playstyle as required and making the game more enjoyable. With a large repertoire of moves and the adrenaline rush obtained from implementing combos and  the stratergy of planning the moves makes the game unique and fun to play.Pros--Highly cutomizable gameplay mechanics -Stunning visuals- Phenomenal Soundtrack -Well Narrated storyline with a Mystery element - Good Difficulty level of the game(which may be a con for some players)Cons--Occasional framedrops and lag but its indie so can't really complain-No tutorial may be a negative for first timers or people new to gaming-Slow driven storyline and not that strong.( for me gameplay superceded the weak story)			"

												game of the year in the aRPG genre without a doubt. the graphics and arts are stunning, the sound and music really suits the theme of the game. It has some really cool mechanics involving ability combinations. the only drawback is the graphic setting, it seems like the game doesn't support 2560*1440 resolution.			"

												Great gameplay, the story is intriguing and the graphics are amazing (along with the art).The only cons that I have is that it needed more bosses and the end feels kinda rushed, like you fight a lot of enemies just to gain levels for the final boss (which was freaking amazing, imo).

												An excellent game from the creators of Bastion; The art is just as beautiful while being more urban-focused as opposed to the more natural/outland stylings of Bastion. The story is fed to you through monologues from your weapon (the Transistor) and through news and information terminals scattered throughout the game.Definitely buy this with the soundtrack, the music is excellent and atmospheric.

												Transistor - the followup game to Supergiant's Bastion - does exactly what it's pedecessor does. Delivering a polished top down action-RPG with a narrative driven storyline. The game has a pronounced ""interactive storybook"" feeling resulting from the games total linearity but to be fair the book is pretty damn good.Logan Cunningham's narration of Bastion was one of the most prominent features of Bastion and in Transistor he fulfills much the same role. Being your ever present companion he lends the game a magical yet melancholy feel. He exposes you to the concept of the world, the story and the characters without overexplaining anything and leaving you to fill in the blanks.The combat is no slouch either. 16 different moves can be combined or used as passive improvements and tested in the many encounters scattered throughout the storyline. How about firing a blast that scatters into bombs which scatter into more bombs when they explode...and then scatter into even more bombs afterwards - yeah.The music is really awesome as well and supplements the feel of the whole game perfectly. I'm just in love with the song ""The Spine"".A highly imaginitive game, an adult fairy tale, emotionally and intellectually stimulating - the full package. A really enjoyable experience. It just leaves me wondering what Supergiant Games' next storybook is going to be like.10/10 - Showing that not every game has to be a sandbox!(If combat is too hard: try Spark()+Mask()+Purge() and the Bounce() Passive and just spam it)			"

												Transistor is a game with many, many great aspects, but one inherent flaw that will completely kill the game for many (particularly those who are less gaming-inclined). Let me start with the good bits:- The soundtrack is superb. It's just a small notch below Bastion's. The vocal pieces are great as well.- The art style is clear and concise. It suits the game, and the full-screen images and between-area cutscenes are nice.- The difficulty curve was implemented solidly, and the game includes a ""Limiter"" system (identical to the Idols in Bastion) which allows you to tweak the difficulty as you see fit by adding various new strengths to the enemies.- Combat is a bit clunky, but it makes sense within the game's premise. The Turn() system rectifies this by turning Transistor from an action game into a strategy game -- you have a ""freeze time"" ability which allows you to plan out your next moves and execute them afterwards.- All of your abilities (called Functions) can be equipped as active abilities (4), upgrades for active abilities (2 each), and passive abilities (4). It can get a bit convoluted and for some reason the menus didn't play well with my XBox controller's analog stick, but other than that it was fine.The humongous downside to this game is in death. When you die, your most powerful active ability will ""overload"", rendering it unusable until you have passed enough checkpoints. Essentially, this means that when you die, your character gets significantly less powerful -- and not just for the current encounter, either. Numerous Limiters cause your character to have less MEM (to equip Functions with) and cause those Functions to overload for longer. You could equip a very powerful ability that you don't plan to use to offset this -- but Functions cost MEM to equip, and your MEM is very limited until you approach the maximum value (which won't be until your second playthrough). Even with max MEM, I did not have enough to equip 4 decent actives, 4 passives and all upgrades for each active.This can be an incredibly frustrating process, and I often found myself dying repeatedly on purpose after the first death just to restart so I wouldn't lose everything for so long -- particularly with 10 Limiters on. If you are not very good at video games in general you will get very frustrated very fast, as the game is horribly unforgiving when it comes to death. I consider myself to be pretty OK at games but I still found this a bit irriating -- tolerable during the normal game but downright ridiculous with 10 Limiters.This game could easily be a 9/10, but I feel that dying completely soils an otherwise-wonderful experience. I'd be perfectly ok with flat-out dying and having to restart, or any other penalty really -- but not the one they chose. Not sure what they were thinking.So, all in all,""6/10 it was ok"" - Foffy			"

												Short Review, for the lazy.Slightly reminiscent of Bioshock in tone, this game does a superb job of tying the story and the gameplay together without it being obtuse. As you progress through the game and level up, both the story and the gameplay get much deeper and more engaging, which I found sublime.I 100% recommend this game to anybody who liked Bastion, the original Bioshock, or even video games in general and 69% recommend this to absolutely anybody. One of my favourite games of all time.+ Exciting combat that continually gets deeper+ Story is engaging, with more to be found for those who care to look for it+ Story and combat interwoven beautifully+ Wonderful Art and Sound design+ NG+ Mode and non-story content+ Option to make the game harder for rewards- Story is on the short side for a single playthrough- Some mechanics are under-explained "

												In Transistor, you play as the silent starlet and singer Red, traversing the eerily empty yet colourful city of Cloudbank. The city is slowly being overtaken by a mysterious force known only as the Process, and Cloudbank's leaders have something to do with it. Desperate to put a stop to whatever's happening, Red goes out to hunt -- but not alone. She carries a sword-like contraption with her known as the Transistor, whose dulcet and heartfelt tones guide her (and you) through a decaying world...Pros+ Beautiful, mesmerizing art & visuals+ The Transistor's narration of the game+ The dreamy, cyber-like soundtrack+ Combining functions for cool attack abilities+ The overall emotional impactCons- Combat can get a bit repetitive- The main story could have been longer & more in-depth- Some story elements are left deliberately vagueThis one of the most beautiful & artful games I've ever played! The overall cyberpunkish atmosphere, the gorgeous artwork, the hauntingly loving voice of the Transistor... The game has story elements that are quite familiar in the sci-fi sphere, but its execution is just so good. I fell in love with Red, the Transistor, and their world in a little over five hours already, and bawled my eyes out at certain points during the story. The emotional pacing, aided by the superb soundtrack, was fantastic. The upsides of this game far outweigh any downsides -- which for me personally, were the slightly repetitive combat (mostly due to lots of the same enemy types, I think) and the fact that the first run-through of the story was not longer, meatier & more in-depth.Like sci-fi, strategical planning in combat (on pause), and a deeply emotional story? Then this one's for you. This game is a perfect little jewel, with my compliments to Logan Cunningham's excellent voice acting as the Transistor.			"

												Bastion 2: Electric Boogaloo is a fantastic game, and a more apt name than it should be. That said, while the game has many key similarities to Bastion (art style, certain plot points, music, the same narrator), it also has many key differences, even some more subtle ones in those similarities I mentioned. Most obvious is that it's sci-fi rather than fantasy, the story as a whole is bit more subtle and atmospheric, and the battle system is... turn-based...???Regardless, it's a ton of fun, the music and art are just as good if not better than the amazing precedent Bastion set, giving us a lot more vocals of the singer behind Build That Wall from Bastion (there's even a hum button this time around! it is the most important button, you can literally have your character hum to the music at pretty much any time), and having a more tech-heavy-feel to it in general.Point is, it's a fantastic game, buy it 500 times.

												Transistor has everything:A fantastic gameplay that accommodates both action and strategy playstyles interchangeably and simultaneouslyA dynamic leveling system that allows the player to switch their skills constantlyAn in-game difficulty setting that doesn't need any option screen to adjust, is lore-friendly and not immersion-breaking and provides the user with a more rewarding experience the harder they make the game for themselvesAn incredibly immersive atmosphere supported by a very well paced and intriguing plotA breathtaking soundtrack with which the player can actively interact outside of the typical change of scene/change of paceA stunningly beautiful art style and designThe only flaw of this game is the really short story, luckily the Recursion Mode allows for an interesting NG+ experience with a few little changes from the original playthrough, even if not really apparent or relevant to the original storyline.

												I usually trudge through a game's actual gameplay to get it over with, but Transistor's gameplay was so enjoyable and solid that I found myself playing through the entire game again the very next day. The deep customization of your abilities with the various Functions(), the blend of real time frantic play with the powerful frozen planning of Turn(), and difficulty scaling done right make all the game extremely enjoyable to play. There are unbelievably powerful ability combos in the game, but you're always facing enemies that can meet the challenge. If you're not, then there's still the combat modifiers and restrictions you can add. Story-wise, the world is significantly more sparse and spare than Supergiant's previous title, Bastion, but it seems to be an intentional choice: a bit of mystery allows for varied interpretations and a long narrative shelf life, which is what I think they were going for in this game. I think they leaned a little too far in the direction of limiting information, but the game doesn't suffer for it too much. I think the endgame buildup and final fight were excellently executed and they are going to be a favorite among the games I've played.			"

Eventually I decided to take a leap of faith considering that the same company brought out Bastion. At first I was confused with the game mechanics, but I caught on relatively quickly. As usual, the artwork is amazing. And Don't get me started on the storyline... It sounds simple, a beautiful protagonist is stripped of everything and fights back to regain what was hers. But by the end of the game you are truely attached to Red and The Transister.If you loved Bastion, give this a go.And if that didn't pursuade you... The Transistor is voiced by the same guy who Narrarated Bastion.I weapt... I weapt like a little girl in this game and I am not affraid to admit it			"

												+ Awesome Soundtrack+ Great Narrator / Guiding Voice+ Beautiful Graphics+ Interesting Combatsystem+ Intriguing Characters and StoryTransistor is a true beauty among the many available games there are.As soon as I started the game I wanted to know: What exactly happened here? Who is this woman/main-character we're controlling? Whats up with this sword? I tracked along the streets of the beautiful town to find that out and soon met enemys, trying to stop me.The combatsystem is really nice, but really interesting for me was how I could change the ensuing fight before it even happens. You can have different abilities with different characteristics.. and switch them around! That way, you can create the set of abilitys that you are most comfortable with to battle. And the battle itself can be altered as well with modifications - some simply strengthen the enemy, others give them shields, but in the end the harder battles will be rewarded with more experience.But the best part of the game are still its graphics, everything is so well made and beautiful. I would have loved to just walk around and look at everything.Getting to know the characters even better would have been nice too, but every game needs to end - And this ending.. was a surprise for me.

												One of the tags for this game is for its soundtrack, and understandably so, with its gorgeous music and vocals that you will find yourself humming to yourself long after you play it. But this game has many other strengths as well, from the stunning art to game play dynamics to the intriguing, futuristic world that feels so hauntingly believable. And last, but certainly not least, is the story itself. Wonderfully told in a very dynamic style not much seen these days that will keep you playing forward just on its merits alone. Plus the relationships between characters and how they fit in the story, and character development are executed in a delightful manner. Warning: You may get slightly attached to them.Overall, this is a very well put together game that was a real pleasure to play. And, even if you don’t play many RPG, turned-based games (like myself), this one is still definitely worth checking out.10/10 I am playing again (trust me you’ll want to play again).			"

What I liked: EverythingWhat You Need to Know: The art style is gorgeous just like they did with Bastion The music and main character singing in some songs is peaceful and fits the mood perfect You get a dedicated hum button, that's sole purpose is to hear the majestic voice of Red( main character) Main story might be hard to fully grasp for some people. Like who some characters are, what's this sword in my hand's purpose? and what the overall arc of the story might be. I loved the story The talking sword , similiar to the voice in Bastion, offers great dialogue and story to keep your engaged Combat is so satsifying and easy to understand. You get abilities and each have a main use, passive and secondary use, all vary depending on which you choice, giving alot of combations Combat is like a diablo style game, but you pause the game to chain abilities before activating them. A cooldown is needed afterwards to use your abilities again You can still go real time, but it's harder and actually slower New game plus starts the game with the leveled up enemies and your abilities, you won't have all unlocked once you first beat the game There are challenges that are optional, but really great, that help you level up, unlock music to listen to in-game, with a challenge room only for NG+My Score:A+Price:$5Completed in:6 hours first time( more if you go NG+, which I did)Games similar:  Bastion ShadowRun "

												absolutely love the story, music, and art, the combat system is really interesting! the characters and their stories are really neat too. short game, but being able to replay it with all of your movesets intact and leveled enemies (and own level) adds a challenge to the earlier parts of the game, and gives your style and gameplay style a chance to further grow. if you love gorgeous video games turning you into an emotional wreck, this is the game for you.

												Transistor and the Studio's previous title Bastion, have some similarities. I may refer to Bastion for some notes, however to avoid confusing those who haven't played Bastion, I will refrain from mentioning it if possible.For the short version of this review:+ Absolutely fantastic art style, which can be seen in the environments, as well as enemy designs and your own character.+ Beautiful soundtrack, still listening to it now. Most of the songs (if not all of them) have been uploaded to Supergiant's official youtube page to listen to.+ Narration has plenty of dialogue for optional parts of the game, as well as lines during combat.+ Planning takes the center stage in combat. Transistor mode allows you to stop time, to set out some orders and execute them.+ 10+ abilities you can select from, all with interesting combinations to try out.+ NG+ brings stronger enemies and some new lines of dialogue to your second playthrough- The game is pretty short, I only got about 8 hours from the first playthrough.- Not the most challenging game, but it can become difficult if you add in 'limiters' in the form of extra difficulty options.- Frequent freezing if you've been playing for a few hours at a time, including during combat. I've heard of crashes, but haven't experienced them myself yet.+/- PC controls are pretty good, but may require you to get adjusted.+/- Story leaves a lot to personal interpretation, while some solid conclusion is given, some may not be content with what is there.Now for the details.StoryThis is a bit touchy, as I feel most of the story is really revealed in the second half of the game, or at the end, so I won't go into to much detail. At the start of the game, you're introduced as, Red a famous singer who has lost her voice and her friend to a strange group of individuals. Your friend's mind is thrown into a sword, the Transistor, which is the only weapon you'll use through the entire Journey. You begin following the only trail you have, seeking answers. Why you? What is their end goal? What is happening to the city? As your progress, you'll get your answers, and you'll watch as the world around you changes. Will you be truly satisfied with these answers though?Enivornments and Art StyleThis is mostly subjective I suppose. However the art style present feels unique, or at least like a mix of other influencing styles. The blend of realistic environments with this strange cyber-esque world creates a very surreal feeling to the world, which is only further added to by the art style. Enemies encountered called 'processes' are very machine like in nature.SoundtrackThe soundtrack is an interesting mix of genres, with Darren Korb's personal spin on all of them. Individual songs vary quite a bit. Some songs are very dramatic vocal heavy pieces, that will have you just gushing over the singer's fantastic voice. Other's will get you deeply rooted into the atmosphere, providing a great backdrop for walking around the interesting enviroments. There is of course, good combat music as well. I'm still listening to the sound track, as I write this review actually.NarrationThis is where the mention of Bastion has to come in. Bastion (as most of you likely know) had a great narration system, which had an interesting personality narrate your actions throughout the game, highlighting key moments. Transistor uses the same voice actor, for a slightly different system. Instead the narrator, is an actual character, or rather your sword. That's right your sword talks to you throughout the game. He will comment on specific spots and regions, his thoughts and opinions. Sarcastic remarks are thrown around as well occasionally. In combat he will make comments based on your actions, such as when you execute a turn, or if you lose too much health.While this is personal taste, I find this style of 'narration' much more interesting than Bastion's narration. In Bastion, it seemed as if he was just telling the story of the protagonist, maybe even to someone else. In Transistor, he plays a character, he frequently talks to Red, not some ambiguous audience. This adds some personality to both Red and the Transistor. As he spoke throughout the game I grew an attachment to him, and a level of appreciation. Red and the Transistor also seem to grow together throughout the game, even if they are only small subtle ques. I suppose this is a bit hard to convey though, as Red can't speak.GameplayThe gameplay is relatively simple at first, you have four abilities at your disposal, that can be activated with the right click and aimed with the mouse. You move with ASWD or left mouse click. It gets a little more interesting when the Transistor mode is brought in. Transistor mode allows you to stop time to move and use your abilites to plan your attack, and then execute it. Then of course, there's a cooldown between turns. This is probably the meat of the combat, more options besides your four abilites will open up to be used in interesting ways.Your four abilities have one initial modifier slot. These modifier slots obviously modify the ability, using other abilites. For example, Crash can be modified with Jaunt to be usable inbetween turns. Or you can combine Ping with Crash to proc mini-stuns on your target. Eventually you can unlock two modifier slots for your abilities which will introduce more options. Such as a Crash that splits into three projectiles and explodes on impact. Keep in mind there are about 10 abilities, so the combinations can get a bit crazy. This however, makes it all the more fun.Overall:It's a fantastic game with plenty to offer in terms of execution and style, but it feels lacking in the amount of content it has to deliver. It may be a normal length singleplayer game (by today's standards), it still doesn't offer a large quantity. However the quality debatably makes up for the short length. For some, this will leave a lasting impression, an experience you won't forget. One that has such a unique combat system, combined with a beautiful soundtrack, art style, and presentation. If you don't care for that stuff however, this game might not be your sort of thing. Don't expect an open world sandbox experience.Final Rating: 7.5 / 10 "

												From the creative geniuses at Supergiant Games comes Transistor, a birds-eye sci-fi RPG with a strategic twist in its gameplay functions that creates a gaming experience that is both refreshing and unique in today's video game market. The first thing the player will notice in the game is the art-style and narrative reminiscent of Bastion; stylized environments, characters and enemies that can be instantly recognized and a story that is unveiled in little pieces through the smooth tones of the games narrator, who is actually the talking sword you're using throughout the game. Which creates a much more atmospheric effect than Bastion as the narrator is sharing in your experience instead of outlining what happens as you play. Transistor's story is difficult to percieve at the beginning, but as the player progresses and pays attention to the narrative and ques from the world one can piece it together over time. For the gameplay, Transistor is similar to Bastion in the birds-eye view controls and sporadic groups of enemies that have different strengths and weaknesses that you must approach in a careful manner or else you risk exposing yourself to more damage than needed. However, that is where the similarities between the two games end. Transistor uses a ""Turn()"" function that allows the player to pause combat in order to plan out their movements and attacks, then executing them in rapid succession, Turn() is mildly similar to the VATS system in Fallout 3, but much more unique and reactive than simply ""clik on whurr u wanna shewt and hope u dunt miss"". Turn() is useful for allowing yourself to punch a hole through enemy defences or to allow yourself some breathing room. However the drawback that must be taken into consideration is the short cooldown after Turn() ends, during which you are completely vulnerable as you cannot attack until the cooldown duration ends. Turn() gives players endless possibilities when combined with the notable selection of specific attacks that you are given access to, which can range from a simple energy blast to a quick dash, and even summoning a friendly unit to help you in combat (which can also be controlled during Turn()). One thing that makes the combat fast-paced and reactive are the ""cells"" dropped by all enemies when killed. Cells have a roughly 10 second cooldown timer when dropped, and if aren't picked up before the duration ends the enemy you just killed will respawn with full health, which in my opinion makes the combat much more dynamic and fast paced. Another point of interest in the combat system is the power selection and upgrade system. The player gathers a good selection of abilities throughout the game, but you can only equip four at a time. Never fear, because you can take the other abilities you gathered and use them to upgrade the abilities you currently have equipped to create powerful combinations. The only thing keeping you from upgrading yourself to over-powered proportions and keeping the gameplay balanced is the memory, which will require consideration while upgrading.Finally, instead of chugging down health regenerating items in combat like in Bastion, the player instead needs to be absolutely mindful of their current health. When your health is depleted you will automatically enter an ""Emergency Turn()"" that gives you the chance to eliminate the immediate threat. But once you execute the Turn() you still only have one hitpoint left, and if you get hit again during the cooldown you will return to full health but one of your abilites will be ""overloaded"" and cannot be used until you reach an ""access point"" (which not only act as save points but also are the only places where you can equip and upgrade your abilities). Esentially your abilities act as your lives, and the more you ""die"" at a certain area, the more difficult that area will become.To summarize, Transistor is in my opinion much more fun than Bastion and a game I thoroughly enjoy playing. I honestly recommend Transistor to all who are reading this review.			"

												ABSOLUTELY FABTASTIC!!! 10/10Just finished the first playthrough and i'll try to breakdown my experience so ar:1. The visuals are stunning. There are subtle things you notice like the buildings, the enemies, the actual weapon and of course the main protagonist...the way it all blends to make cloudbank a living world.2. The sounds in this game are really immersive especially with headphones on. The musical score in the background, the weapon effects on the enemies and the best use of humming i have seen in a game. The official soundtrack is a must have for anyone who is into that genre of music.3. The combat is a real step up and refinement from bastion. the way each function has 3 different attributes makes choosing your loadout a real brain scratcher. and for once i actually loved the challenge of actually dying (which means loosing a function) and its consequences. It means you have to be familiar with every one of them and adapt accordingly. 4. The story and characters just makes progressing through the levels a real joy. 5. Replay value is very high IMO. These guys know how to do a New Game plus. best ive seen in a while. with the limiters and functions combination, this is a game that i will be playing for months to come.Overall, this has become one of my favorite games of all time simply because of the attention to detail the devs have put into it and plus i can totally relate to the computer lingua used. Red will go down as one of the best female protagonist who didn't utter a word. A must play.			"

												It begins with a sad woman, kneeing by a dead man with a sword in his body. And yet it talks, talks through that strange looking sword... And with that opening scene your quest for answers begins. You will get many small pieces throughout the game, but you have to puzzle them together yourself. All while you get one of the most interesting combat systems in the last time. Every ability can be used actively or passively, or can enhance another active ability, which leads to many, many combinations. But as you progress, your enemies will get more and more abilities too, so that theres always a challenge, which i liked. These were two of the three parts this game has to entertain you. The third one is the constant narration by the man in the sword, and is comparable to bastion, although the expression and narration style is quiet different. If you like at least two of the three components, i can definitely recommend this game to you. If you don't, you will get quite bored as the game relies heavily on these parts.  "

												Transistor is quite possibly one of the best games to come out in the past 5 years.Everything about this game hits the sweet spot in a way I can only hope to convey in words, The world building is masterful and I would expect no less from the likes of Super Giant games being the master of the art. The gameplay is a mesh of Tactical RPG and an Action RPG, There being a way to switch between real time and the planning stage makes the game go as fast as you want it to go and tailors your combat choices accordingly. The story is somewhat the games weakpoint as it is somewhat vague but very open to interpretation so it will give you some food for thought. This game is worth £30, let alone £15 and should be a must play for people who are into masterful worlds and and rich gameplay. My only complaint would be that the game is a bit on the short side but that is fixed by new game plus letting you keeping all your upgrades and functions while starting from the beginning of the game again. Transistor is a enjoyable albeit short experience that I can recommend to anyone.			"

												Alright. I played Bastion and I didn't care too much for it, and Transistor honestly just feels like Bastion 2 rather than its own game, but as far as sequels go, Transistor is a pretty good  sequel. It's a game that builds on everything its predecessor established with high polish. The gameplay is fun (moreso than Bastion for me because being able to stop and figure things out in the middle of some clusterf*cks is really all I wanted so that Bastion wasn't so frustrating to me), the art is beautiful (and I love this 2D/isometric pastoral handpainted fantasy that Supergiant has because it ages really well--see Legend of Mana), the music and voice acting are great (of course), the plot is um. Well it's okay. There's a lot of unanswered questions. And I wish it didn't all feel so familiar.I do think the weakest ideas of the game are where it obviously copies right from Bastion. Silent protagonist lead on by a snarky narrator. Little squiggly comma monsters that run around a lot and annoy you. Giant monster that attacks the screen randomly. Skill challenges for bonus powerups. The antagonists never meant for this apocalypse to happen.There's a part of me that wishes that what the game leads you to believe at the start (that you had just murdered someone with your talking sword and were now on the lam) is the thread the game ran with. Still. It's not everything I could hope a game like this to be, but I can't deny that this is a good one and that it kept me going to the end, I even seem to have taken a lot longer than most people, just because I liked chewing the scenery and reading the lore. And I like that there's queer characters too. That's like a bonus, but I try to give devs props for it whenever they do it and it doesn't suck.			"

												My name is Red. I have a sword but it's not a sword, it's a transistor. Don't worry about it, it still kills people. Well, processes mainly, but it killed that guy I liked. I think I liked him? Anyway, it wasn't the swords fault. Some people really disliked my singing and decided to stab the guy I was crushing on, leaving the transistor/sword imbedded in him. The transistor/sword talks to me. It's the spirit of the dead guy. He rambles on about something that I don't understand and he talks over news articles I'm trying to read. Then he forgets what he's trying to say and in the process becomes even more annoying as he tries to make sense of his own existence.  On my quest to avenge the guy I barely know I meet a few other people but I can't understand a word they say. No, wait, subtitles give them a voice.

I recommend using the limiters to amp up the difficulty.Where it fell down a little for me was the story.  It has a strong story, but it doesn't want to make itself understood.  It's worth reading up on the story as you go,  as it's quite good - I just wish it wasn't so deliberately obtuse.			"

												I loved this game. It had an amazing soundtrack, interesting characters, and beautiful visuals. The beginning of the game can be quite overwhelming, and the combat takes a bit to get the hang of, but as you unlock more options and abilities, the game really opens up. My only negative is that the game took too long to give the player all the combat upgrades, and you don't really unlock everything until NG+. But the game gives you lots of time to take in the environment, learn and master the combat, and really learn about all the characters. Transistor doesn't completely match up to Bastion, but it's definitely worth playing!			"

												Alright. I played Bastion and I didn't care too much for it, and Transistor honestly just feels like Bastion 2 rather than its own game, but as far as sequels go, Transistor is a pretty good  sequel. It's a game that builds on everything its predecessor established with high polish. The gameplay is fun (moreso than Bastion for me because being able to stop and figure things out in the middle of some clusterf*cks is really all I wanted so that Bastion wasn't so frustrating to me), the art is beautiful (and I love this 2D/isometric pastoral handpainted fantasy that Supergiant has because it ages really well--see Legend of Mana), the music and voice acting are great (of course), the plot is um. Well it's okay. There's a lot of unanswered questions. And I wish it didn't all feel so familiar.I do think the weakest ideas of the game are where it obviously copies right from Bastion. Silent protagonist lead on by a snarky narrator. Little squiggly comma monsters that run around a lot and annoy you. Giant monster that attacks the screen randomly. Skill challenges for bonus powerups. The antagonists never meant for this apocalypse to happen.There's a part of me that wishes that what the game leads you to believe at the start (that you had just murdered someone with your talking sword and were now on the lam) is the thread the game ran with. Still. It's not everything I could hope a game like this to be, but I can't deny that this is a good one and that it kept me going to the end, I even seem to have taken a lot longer than most people, just because I liked chewing the scenery and reading the lore. And I like that there's queer characters too. That's like a bonus, but I try to give devs props for it whenever they do it and it doesn't suck.			"

												The atmosphere, as you might expect from the trailers, is incredible. What you won't understand from the footage is just how finely woven the storytelling is for a game whose main character has had her voice removed in the story. It starts in medias res (in the middle of the action), and unfolds plot points through beautifully illustrated flashbacks, the transistor's dialogue, and even the game mechanics themselves. Your skills are traces of people, and as you use these skills in more varied ways you unlock more information about the person the trace is from, the world they lived in and the cabal of characters they came in contact with. Combat is clever and surprisingly fast paced for the sort that lets you jump into a paused planning mode. Take advantage of the Sandbox planning areas, Red's humming mechanic and unlocking all the information in traces and limiters. Though your character can't speak, her personality is revealed through the transistor, her input into computer terminals, her actions or lack of during cutscenes, and the soundtrack that you will absolutely not regret buying. The story is deep enough to make sense and propel you forward while still leaving you wide open to theory crafting at the end. My only complaint is that I don't want to leave the game and the <10 hours of gameplay, while bittersweetly satisfying, will not be enough to appease you once you've fallen head over heels in love with this world.

												Not that I ever doubted that videogames do qualify as art, but Transistor should make it obvious to anyone.The game's artwork is done in a gorgeous, colourful style of cyber-Art Nouveau with maybe a touch of Noir (oh, that does sound really pretentious, doesn't it... what about the nods to certain paintings I imagine seeing in for example the posters? even worse? ok.)As probably expected, it has an amazing soundtrack, and you can even (sort of) interact with it in the game (Transistor has a hum button, and you won't know how great that is until you played.)The story is tragic and delivered spot-on. between terminals and the great narrator you're left to fill in the blanks about the place you're in, but the picture practically paints itself. Ha... The narrator is also the same voice as in Bastion, yet somehow the role he plays manages to be entirely different this time around.Very importantly, the game isn't lacking in its set of mechanics either. The combat system is deep and highly customisable, with not only the options of building attacks and defenses but real-time and turn-based mode as well. The limiters available can raise the difficulty if so desired. The game is just a little short, but definitely replayable in NG+.Overall, Transistor is just awesome. Get it.I'm already wondering what game Supergiant Games will come up with next - I bet it will have a great soundtrack.			"

Everything in it is beautiful, the artstyle, design, story telling, and musics are absolutely stunning. I only emailed a dev team - to express my satisfaction with a game - twice : one time for Bastion, the second time for Transistor.BUY IT, It's short but absolutely amazing.			"

												Transistor is a rather unique game, coming from the developers of Bastion, Supergiant Games. While some may have been expecting a story and gameplay similar to Bastion, it is fortunate that Supergiant Games did not down that route, and it is important to remember the following: Transistor is not Bastion, and Bastion is not Trasistor. That doesn't mean they don't have a few things that are alike, but they are very different games.Much like Bastion, much of the 'narration' of the game, if in this case it can be called that - is once again voiced by Logan Cunningham, who voiced the narrator of Bastion. Here, though, the voice is much more laid-back and relaxed rather than the rough voice he used before. It works, and helps distinguish his 'character' from being yet another narrator. You'll be hearing him a lot.The gameplay is quite solid, although, much like Bastion, not too difficult, for some not being difficult enough. To remedy that, there are the Limiters - which act much like Bastion's Idols - which make the game harder. The way you fight in Transistor will rely on you using the functions you have available, and the best thing about them is that they can 'upgraded' with other functions to change their effects slightly or fit into a 'passive' slot that passively affects things. For example, the first function you get, Crash(), does 50 damage and very temporarily stuns enemies. In another function's upgrade slot, it will make that other function temporarily stun the enemy. In a passive slot, it will reduce damage by 25% percent. There are 16 different functions in total, and that allows for a lot of different combinations . This allows you to use whatever functions fit your playstyle. For example, there's one that 'masks' you, making you effectively invisible to opponents, and another that temporarily switches their allegiance from opposing you to serving you. All of these functions can be used inside and outside Turn(), which is a fairly important mechanic: it stops time, and allows you to plan your moves, then perform them in a matter of seconds, but has a cooldown that spans several seconds, in which you can move - but can't use any functions. This helps when dealing with large amounts of opponents, or when you want to backstab them and they just won't stop moving. This also leads to situations where using Turn() wouldn't be necessary or very hard, due to the nature of some opponents - sometimes you will have to wait for the right time to use it, or decide whether to use it at all.In terms of music, it fits the game's world, and is very good. Obviously, that's no surprise, this being a Supergiant game after all. But it's the songs that have lyrics that stand out. In Bastion, there were only a few, about two or three. In Transistor, there are five. What's even better here, is that you can 'earn' the music to listen to them in what is basically the closest thing the game has to a hub by completing the game's challenges. Story-wise, the game doesn't give much exposition. Most of the story can be gathered by inferring from what the game shows and tells you through the 'narration', as well as the function files. This is probably where the game falls short for some, as some things are not immediately obvious.			"

												This won't be very in-depth, and will only cover the basic aspects of the game. Click here for my full review.[www.thatvideogameblog.com]Transistor is easily my game of the year, and one of my favourite RPGs of all time. Over time I've looked back at the experience and I've come to the conclusion that, of all the games I've played in the past fifteen years or so, Transistor may just be the best out of all them. I ended up clocking in at around thirteen hours, but that includes the time in which it was alt tabbed to write my review. In created few hours, I played one of the most complete, engaging, immersive and beautiful games ever made. Without a shadow of a doubt, Transistor is a masterpiece.Mechanically, it plays out like an isometric RPG in the vein of Fallout, but with real-time elements and less skills to upgrade. The end result is a very smooth combat experience that still has a heavy emphasis on strategy without ever being overbearing or overcomplicated. Players use the Turn system to pause the game, queue up a series of attacks, and execute them. Once this is done, they will have to wait a short while before pausing the game, forcing them to play in real time, which more often than not means running for cover and re-positioning yourself as your enemies go on the offensive.Transistor makes up for its short length with mechanical depth. Each skill or ""Function"" can be used in one of three ways. First, they can be used as an active skill to defeat enemies in combat. Second, they can be used as upgrades to the aforementioned active skills. Finally, they can be used in a passive slot, with each granting you a unique ability. This system allows for a wide variety of distinct playstyles, which adds immense replayibility and variety to an already hugely enjoyable action roleplaying experience.As the icing on the cake, each Function corresponds to a person in the city of Cloudbank, the setting of the game. Using your skills in a variety of ways unlocks lore titbits that detail the backstory and fates of the world's denizens, allowing you to piece most of the story together yourself. Not only does this encourage players to experiment with as many different loadouts as they can, it also gives players a simple way to slowly uncover the game's lore without feeling as though the narrative is being crammed down their throat. In fact, much of Transistor's narrative is told this way.Much like BioShock, Transistor features a utopian city that has seen much better days, the backstory for which is slowly revealed through dialogue and narration sprinkled throughout the campaign. The story is always subtle and never ham-fisted. Most of the plot is delivered by the Transistor itself - voiced by the brilliant Logan Cunningham - the talking sword you'll be using to cut a swath through the Process, the primary antagonistic force you'll be fighting.Fighting the Process is as hard as you want it be. It never feels like it's being padded out unnecessarily, and offers additional challenge in the form of ""limits"". Limits add rules to the game such as enemies dealing more damage and having to be hit once before collecting their cells which, if not collected, will respawn the enemy. Brilliantly, using these will also reveal additional lore and grant the player extra experience points, which can be used to unlock new skills and upgrades. Losing all of your health doesn't mean dying either. If your HP hits zero, your most expensive skill will become overloaded and unavailable to you until you visit two more access points - the terminals at which the player can change their loadout. This is an elegant solution that keeps the action flowing, whilst still discouraging players from screwing up, and pushing them to try different tactics if what they're currently doing isn't working without constantly taking them out of the experience.All of this, and I haven't even mentioned how beautiful the game looks. It's beautiful. Seriously, it's Jen Zee. You can see the screenshots, you know incredible it looks, and no amount of words will do Zee's work justice. The game sounds just as magnificent as it looks, featuring the talents of Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett, who have created a soundtrack as soothing as it blood-pumping. You see that original soundtrack for sale up there? Buy it.There's not much else I can say about Transistor, except that feels like the most complete and well-polished experience I've ever had the sheer joy of playing. It's a near-perfect and complete work of art, one that easily earns every cent of your money and second of your time.			"

												My name is Red. I have a sword but it's not a sword, it's a transistor. Don't worry about it, it still kills people. Well, processes mainly, but it killed that guy I liked. I think I liked him? Anyway, it wasn't the swords fault. Some people really disliked my singing and decided to stab the guy I was crushing on, leaving the transistor/sword imbedded in him. The transistor/sword talks to me. It's the spirit of the dead guy. He rambles on about something that I don't understand and he talks over news articles I'm trying to read. Then he forgets what he's trying to say and in the process becomes even more annoying as he tries to make sense of his own existence.  On my quest to avenge the guy I barely know I meet a few other people but I can't understand a word they say. No, wait, subtitles give them a voice. I still don't understand why they hate me but I kill them all regardless. I read all about them in my notes but whoever wrote these bios seemed to leave out some rather important bits, like why I care. Still, the pictures are pretty and after I kill them they mingle with my dead boyfriend(?) on the other side.

												ABSOLUTELY FABTASTIC!!! 10/10Just finished the first playthrough and i'll try to breakdown my experience so ar:1. The visuals are stunning. There are subtle things you notice like the buildings, the enemies, the actual weapon and of course the main protagonist...the way it all blends to make cloudbank a living world.2. The sounds in this game are really immersive especially with headphones on. The musical score in the background, the weapon effects on the enemies and the best use of humming i have seen in a game. The official soundtrack is a must have for anyone who is into that genre of music.3. The combat is a real step up and refinement from bastion. the way each function has 3 different attributes makes choosing your loadout a real brain scratcher. and for once i actually loved the challenge of actually dying (which means loosing a function) and its consequences. It means you have to be familiar with every one of them and adapt accordingly. 4. The story and characters just makes progressing through the levels a real joy. 5. Replay value is very high IMO. These guys know how to do a New Game plus. best ive seen in a while. with the limiters and functions combination, this is a game that i will be playing for months to come.Overall, this has become one of my favorite games of all time simply because of the attention to detail the devs have put into it and plus i can totally relate to the computer lingua used. Red will go down as one of the best female protagonist who didn't utter a word. A must play.			"

												The art intrigued me into clicking on the trailer... and my heart was lost. From the first beats of the music, to the soothing voice of the narrator... when the second trailer followed, with Her singing, and I was won over. Bought the game in a heartbeat, and I believe even if it wasn't on sale, I would have done the same.It took me 12.5 hours to complete. Truth be told, I'm not good at games. Perhaps a pro would have completed it faster. But I loved lingering around, listening to Red hum... and exploring every nook and cranny just to listen to more of His voice. The game lets you set the pace, with no shortage of save points, and no awful penalties when you can't keep up with the battle mechanics. I followed no guide, and pannicked when I first lost a function - but still I went on, progressing. Sure, the enemies and their upgrades are hard - but after a few rounds of losing, you'd get the hang of it. And hey, hearing His concerned voice in the background makes it well worth the hits.Love everything about the game. 10/10 would play again.			"

												This game was entertaining and interesting. I enojoyed the strategic turn-based combat style,  but it was different than the traditional way where you attack and then you can't do anything while the enemy is attacking. The story was interesting, but I found it a little too easy to guess the ending. My favorite things about Transistor were the art style and having the ability to combine the different skills in a variety of ways to create different combat experiences. You also have the option to continue playing from the beginning with difficult enemies, which helps make this game replayable. I would recommend Transistor to anyone who enjoys a game with a story, artistic design, and good music. Overall a great game!			"

												I'm not really sure what to say. The game is really pretty and the music is fantastic (REAL GOOD OKAY!?!). It just all comes together really well. The gameplay is also good (if you like turn-based/strategy and action games being smooshed together, which I did enjoy). I FrEAkINg HAtE THE DOG ENeMiES THOuGH(why do they attack fast, also have a lot of health, and also run too fast?!?! (friendly dog is good though))...Anyways...Continuing on...The voice acting is also very good and I became quite attached to the main characters. And the story is really nice, and-...This game just left me with too many feels, okay?Oh, and the game isn't super long, but not really short either (maybe around Portal length). It took me 10ish hours while doing a lot of the challenge mission thingies, but I didn't do all of them (the dogs' fault mainly). So if you're worried about that then just wait for a sale, but if you don't care about that then I'd say buy away.			"

												Transistor is a game best described as unique. The game looks, plays, and sounds like nothing else out there, and, even more impressively, exexuctes nearly all of these innovative ideas to perfection. The best game of 2014 so far. Pros: - The combat. It's a hybrid of turn based strategy and arena action a la Bastion. The standard mode allows free movement and usage of up to 4 equppied abilities (mostly) without cooldown. Pressing space initiates Turn(), which allows you to expend a set number of action points to move and perform abilities at hundreds of times the speed of the standard mode. Turn()'s cooldown length varies based the percentage of action points you used, and all abilities are locked while these points regenerate. Its a brilliant system made more so by the enemy design that forces you to quickly and strategically switch between the two modes. - The customization. Every ability is a function that can be equipped as an active ability, a passive ability, or overload an active ability with additional functionality. Additional memory and slots to equip functions unlock as the game progresses, allowing for a staggering number of highly unique loadouts. This system allows for nearly any playstyle imaginable to be viable. Using a method in one of its three roles unlock additional backstory material, strongly encouraging experimentation without ever forcing anything. Losing all health in a battle temporarily locks an ability each time it happens, further encouraging creative loadouts while waiting for the locked ability to restore. - Tests and limiters. The game features 23 tests (and additional Access tests available only on a second playthrough) of your ability to use Turn(), to survive unwinnable situations, to clear enemies with only select functions available, and your speed in standard combat. The majority of these tests are very well designed and often very challenging. All are entirely optional and unlock tracks for the music player. Similarly, limiters are fully optional abilities unlocked at various points in the story that can be equipped to increase the challenge and XP gain of combat. They're a clever way to provide and reward customizable difficulty. - The art and music. The screenshots and videos on the store page really don't do it justice. Transistor is one of the best looking and sounding games ever made. - The story. Like Bastion, the critical parts of the story are delivered largely through narration. Unlike Bastion, the non-critical majority of the story is found in terminals, function descriptors, and view points that are all fully optional and found only through exploration. All of it is interesting, well written, and best left to experience on your own. - New game+. Transistor calls NG+ ""Recurse."" This allows you to play through the game again with all of your abilities and limiters from before. Enemies also retain their abilities, however. Recurse also provides access to higher player levels and additional tests that are not unlockable in a single playthrough. Cons- Some of the dialogue is a bit weak. Notes:- The story is much better than it gets credit for. That said, it's much more abstract that what you usually see in games. There's a good chance you won't like it if you're looking for a story that gives every question a clear resolution. This applies especially to the ending. - The game is about 5 hours long on first playthrough. Recurse can likely double that. I think it's good enough to justify a $2-$4 an hour price tag. If you don't, wait for a sale. - Although by no means necessary, some basic knowledge of programming terms will likely make the game more slightly more interesting. It's entertaining to see how some terms were turned into combat abilities, and knowing what a few mean in reality will add a bit to the story. None of it is essential for understanding.			"

												To all those that have only played 2 hours and think the combat is boring, you have to give the combat a chance. Once Red obtains new functions and you turn on all the limiters it actually becomes quit strategic and the multitudes of function combinations is just staggering.The Music and Art direction is phenomenal.The story is mediocre, and sometimes the voice over work just seems off, however that is not a common occurrence.There are still some launch day bugs, but this is just the first week I guess.It's a great game, marred only be its brevity. Ran the course of the game twice. Generally had on limiters a majority of the time, finished at about 50% into level 29, 30 is the cap, confirmed on my third play through. All this took me about 20 hours, where as with Bastion I put in 35 to accomplish everything.The second playthrough was actually better in my opinion, because it opened up some new challenges.I wish it had an arena with hordes of enemies like Bastion, which was my favorite part of that game.

												Transistor was an absolute delight to play through. Definitely not a walk in the park but it also wasn't super easy. The experience is definitely best enjoyed playing with the added difficulty provided by Limiters and in Recursion Mode where you keep your progress but replay through the game with heightened difficulty. Enemies will scale up to your current level and ability in the game in the 2nd go-around.Praises aside, the game has some performance issues that will hopefully be ironed out in future updates and I feel like the experience was missing something. I was under the impression that the game would have some more puzzle features given an earlier sequence, but it's almost entirely combat oriented with Turn() being a strategic, puzzle mode.I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a a refreshing experience and who enjoys an immersive environment. This game's captivating soundtrack, art style, and general tone makes me wish I could have known more about Cloudbank and explored the city more.Thank you Supergiant for this amazing game! After playing it at Day of the Devs back in October I was eagerly awaiting the game's release!Can't wait to make my way through more of Recursion mode!			"

												From the creative geniuses at Supergiant Games comes Transistor, a birds-eye sci-fi RPG with a strategic twist in its gameplay functions that creates a gaming experience that is both refreshing and unique in today's video game market. The first thing the player will notice in the game is the art-style and narrative reminiscent of Bastion; stylized environments, characters and enemies that can be instantly recognized and a story that is unveiled in little pieces through the smooth tones of the games narrator, who is actually the talking sword you're using throughout the game. Which creates a much more atmospheric effect than Bastion as the narrator is sharing in your experience instead of outlining what happens as you play. Transistor's story is difficult to percieve at the beginning, but as the player progresses and pays attention to the narrative and ques from the world one can piece it together over time. For the gameplay, Transistor is similar to Bastion in the birds-eye view controls and sporadic groups of enemies that have different strengths and weaknesses that you must approach in a careful manner or else you risk exposing yourself to more damage than needed. However, that is where the similarities between the two games end. Transistor uses a ""Turn()"" function that allows the player to pause combat in order to plan out their movements and attacks, then executing them in rapid succession, Turn() is mildly similar to the VATS system in Fallout 3, but much more unique and reactive than simply ""clik on whurr u wanna shewt and hope u dunt miss"". Turn() is useful for allowing yourself to punch a hole through enemy defences or to allow yourself some breathing room. However the drawback that must be taken into consideration is the short cooldown after Turn() ends, during which you are completely vulnerable as you cannot attack until the cooldown duration ends. Turn() gives players endless possibilities when combined with the notable selection of specific attacks that you are given access to, which can range from a simple energy blast to a quick dash, and even summoning a friendly unit to help you in combat (which can also be controlled during Turn()). One thing that makes the combat fast-paced and reactive are the ""cells"" dropped by all enemies when killed. Cells have a roughly 10 second cooldown timer when dropped, and if aren't picked up before the duration ends the enemy you just killed will respawn with full health, which in my opinion makes the combat much more dynamic and fast paced. Another point of interest in the combat system is the power selection and upgrade system. The player gathers a good selection of abilities throughout the game, but you can only equip four at a time. Never fear, because you can take the other abilities you gathered and use them to upgrade the abilities you currently have equipped to create powerful combinations. The only thing keeping you from upgrading yourself to over-powered proportions and keeping the gameplay balanced is the memory, which will require consideration while upgrading.Finally, instead of chugging down health regenerating items in combat like in Bastion, the player instead needs to be absolutely mindful of their current health. When your health is depleted you will automatically enter an ""Emergency Turn()"" that gives you the chance to eliminate the immediate threat. But once you execute the Turn() you still only have one hitpoint left, and if you get hit again during the cooldown you will return to full health but one of your abilites will be ""overloaded"" and cannot be used until you reach an ""access point"" (which not only act as save points but also are the only places where you can equip and upgrade your abilities). Esentially your abilities act as your lives, and the more you ""die"" at a certain area, the more difficult that area will become.To summarize, Transistor is in my opinion much more fun than Bastion and a game I thoroughly enjoy playing. I honestly recommend Transistor to all who are reading this review.			"

Short versionThis game has- Mindblowing soundtrack.- Neat UI- Stylish combat system- Good story- Beautiful artwork.- Good voice acting.- Solid gameplay. Confusing at first though.Slightly long versionI am surprised that I haven't found this gem before. Right from the start you play the game with no introduction, no menu, just straightforward into the tutorial, which is pretty interesting. Then the game hits the amazing soundtrack. Combat is very stylish. UI looks neat. This game is successful when it comes to first impression. I mean, right from the beginning you will start to love this game.The coolest part is that the character is able to sing with the different stage soundtracks. I was listening to one track and I pressed the tab key without knowing anything and I realized that she starts singing along (humming, to be precise) and if you keep holding it, she keeps singing. I stopped playing for a while and kept listening to it and it was a mesmerizing experience. I feel really bad that I couldn't bought the soundtrack of the game. I can just keep listening to this calming music.Get it. You won't regret it.			"

												Transistor in many ways expands on the unique elements of Supergiant's earlier title, Bastion. First and foremost is continued use of Bastion's characteristic piece-by-piece narrative structure, this time with the help of a new narrator whose rough mumbling voice is surprisingly well suited to the staggered delivery. The game further draws inspiration from Bastion's niche musical style, bringing that surreal feminine voice to the fore with a hummed melody over almost every track in the game and continuing with the dark isolating tunes that leave the player stuck within the character's head in an unknown world.Using a similar camera and layout structure as Bastion, Transistor's gameplay sets itself apart through a series of equippable nodes collected throughout the story, each with its own unique effect depending on whether it's used as the base attack, an upgrade to a base attack, or a passive item. These nodes can be temporarily sidelined when your health runs out in combat and, as challenges become harder and your collection of nodes becomes larger, you'll find yourself shuffling them about into new combinations before each new stretch of the game, crafting hundreds of different attacks from the dozen or so nodes you will collect.This game is gorgeous, by the way. The colors are mind-numbingly vibrant at times and the in-game stills give you that same giddy feeling you get when flipping through an ""Art of ..."" book for your favorite movie or game. If eyes could weep, well... never mind.While many of the things that make this game a masterpiece are drawn very clearly from the success of Bastion, Transistor stands alone in much the same way as Tolkien's books outside of the LOTR or Monty Python's work outside of The Holy Grail have done. It is a much desired expansion of Supergiant's own storytelling and game design.**The soundtrack is on Spotify for anyone who's curious.			"

												I wasn't a fan of the game at first because of its control system but after taking a year off in the middle of the game I returned and finished it. I enjoyed it a lot and like its control setup now, contrary to my original disgust that it wasn't originally like Bastion.Some of the later skills are really interesting to use.			"

												Pros : - Amazing soundtrack that sets the atmosphere- Beautiful artstyle- Unique and deep tactical battle system- Many different skill combinations and freedom to build your character to your liking- It can be very challenging (especially on NG+ with all the limiters on)Cons :- A little short but you can always play the NG+ for the extra challenge and to relive the story with some bonus easter eggs.Overall a very unique experience!

												When I played the game for the first time, I wasn't satisfied with my purchase. It seemed strangely odd having to strategise moves in order to defeat enemies, in other words boring. Later on in the game I discovered it's unique rpg side, where you can choose from countless posibilities of skills. And when I got a hang of the amazing story combined with 10/10 soundtracks I couldn't stop playing it. Transistor made me feel strong emotions and the ending gave me goosebumps. Definitely one of the best games I've played.			"

												Transistor is an art-aesthetic game made by the same people behind Bastion, which will give you a good idea of what to expect from the game from a graphical perspective so I won’t waste time on that (except to say that it’s really pretty). As the story goes, you play a rogue vocalist on a quest to find out the meaning behind the mysterious events happening around her. The most important of which involving the accidental death of one of her biggest fans by a sword called the Transistor. You might think the gameplay is somewhat similar to Bastion and if you were to ignore the Turn() aspect, you would probably be right. However, this is where the game distances itself: at any point during combat, you can stop time and plan your next few moves, in a sequence, to be executed when you press the end turn button. This allows for some significant advantages over certain hardy foes that would normally steamroll you in real-time. Additionally, each of the processes you pick up can be slotted in one of three roes: active (for active-weapon use), upgrade (boosts active weapon), or passive (various passive benefits). This allows for a wide variety of process assignments that really lets you find your own personal combat style. If for some reason, you find the game to be too easy, you can add ‘limiters’ you have earned at any save point to spice things up in exchange for extra experience.I found the narrator to be a bit sycophantic, almost to the point where I expected him to wear a fedora and use phrases like “m’lady” while rambling about what it is to be “a gentleman” (especially certain parts of the game where he resembled a drunk version of himself with embarrassingly low levels of restraint). Despite all the cringe, the game is pretty fun and a good challenge if you turn on all the limiters and there are some challenge sections that may warrant a replay if you so desire.			"

												Finished in about 6 1/2 hours.  Did all the challenge arenas (That were available to me, not sure why one or two end ones were locked in the final scene.).  Read a decent amount, all the terminals I saw, but passed some of the character bios on the Function() screens.  Calmly playing through, listening to the story, ""exploring"" what few detours there were, and it's a 6-7 hour game in a playthrough.   Though, the game's narration didn't grab me the same as Bastion's did, and a good half to 3/4ths of the story is in the text.  It was a tad shorter than I expected for a first run-down.  But the combat did make up for it, while interesting to tackle, there's a myriad of combinations that only get more interesting down the line.   NG+ might be worth it to many, and I might dabble in it later on, but it's not something I'll mention as a way to extend what is a story-driven game for later playthroughs.  Overall, I'm not disappointed with my $20.  I would recommend others who aren't dying for the game or just HAVE to play something new right now to wait until it's in the $10-15 bracket. Give or take if you get the soundtrack with it.   It's a nifty little game, with lovely design, simply stunning combat, and a story that just obscures itself a little more than I would have liked.

												Transistor is a visually stunning game from the devs that made Bastion. The amount of detail in the areas that you don't even spend much time in is incredible. Hard to really say much more about it... it's a very unique style, similar in many ways to Bastion, but  more squared townsquare types of areas as opposed to the more natural style of Bastion (which was less angles, more curves.)Just like Bastion, the soundtrack is perfect and fits so well. It's something you can listen to outside of game and still be pleased.The story is delivered via dialogue and in-game text via computer terminals. The story is ok, but is just incredibly shallow and vague. Character motives are never really explained, it just feels like there were a few events that were described or implied, and you just have to go, ""oh okay."" It seems like a very small episode of a much larger story.The game play itself is actually fairly challenging and consists of a mixture of real-time combat and turn-based combat. Enemies appear on screen and you can attack them, but more often than not there are many of them, they're fast and disruptive. The turn-based combat is a mode you enter into, then you get to plan out your moves and attacks before having them execute in slow-motion. It's really satisfying, but is manadatory through the majority of the second half of the game. You just take way too much unavoidable damage otherwise. The enemies themselves actually feel fairly frustrating a lot of the time. There are certain units you REALLY have to priortize, otherwise you just won't win the fights. While priortizing those targets, you're pretty much getting attacked by all the others. Later on in the game these mechanics are less strategic and just more frustrating. There is also not much variety in the enemies... so the encounters end up being X amount of these guys, Y amounts of these guys, fight. Kind of lame, as it removes some depth and strategy that could come from complex fight scenarios, and instead goes for ""just throw more guys at him.""Attacks are called functions, an you unlock many, but can only equip 4 of them. The extras can be socketed into your 4 main functions to upgrade them (additional effects), or as passives that activate based on certain conditions. There's a lot of variety here, and different abilities work better in certain situations than others.If you lose all your health in combat, instead of dying one of your functions gets overloaded and you have to continue on fighting without it. I'm pretty sure the function that gets overloaded was the last one you used prior to ""death"", but not 100% sure. This cycle continues until you run out of functions completely I suspect (I never had this happen though.) It's a nice way of lessening the chances of you getting stuck and not being able to get by to continue the game... which is good because sometimes you get really unlucky in a fight and it prevents you from feeling like the game hates you as much. Functions become useable again after you access a couple of switcher terminal things later on in the levels, so until then you pretty much have to swap them out with other functions or go on without 4 functions.Overall, I think this game was pretty enjoyable. It has a very high level of thought and polish put into it. The combat system is incredibly good, but the combat scenarios are weak and frustrating at times. The game doesn't necessarily feel ""fun"" to play, which is the same gripe I had with Bastion, but that doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable or not worth a playthrough. I think this mainly stems from both these games not really having ""low"" or ""bad"" points that make the great points stand out.The game is also incredibly short... I beat it in ~5 hours according to steam, and I tried to interact with as much as I could find. This is probably the biggest ""issue"" with it... it just ends up sort of unfulfilling. It does however have a New Game + mode, so you can continue to level and unlock more things, as well as a lot of ""challenge"" levels where you can hone your skills. I think this game should have had more hands working on it, in order to really make the scope much larger in terms of gameplay and story. There is absolutely no filler in the game which is good, but like I said earlier in the review, it feels like an episode of something much bigger.... so huge amounts of potential left unexplored. Still, the amount of time, effort and detail that went into this game is really apparent in every way imaginable. For what it's worth, if you've played neither of these games, I'd highly recommend playing Bastion before this.			"

												Highly recommended. Transistor has an amazing audio-visual style and a strong emotional story. The gameplay is fused into its sci-fi world, and everything about it is blended with jargon from informatics, computers, programming, technology etc. The combat system is evolved, engaging and suprisingly deep and diverse.The Good(1) Art-style is awesome. (2) Music is fantastic, original and merged with the story. Red, the protagonist, is a singer who has lost her voice, and for that reason there's a dedicated ""Hum"" button, where the game pauses and Red hums to background music! (3) Combat system is a very interesting and well balanced blend of real-time with pause-and-give-orders: You can fight in real time (which is hard!) or you can use the ""Turn()"" command to give orders which are then executed sequentially by Red while her enemies are slowed down (nearly stopped). After that, Turn() requires several seconds to recover before you can use it again; it the meanwhile you can't use any abilities and just need to run around in real-time avoiding enemies.The Bad(1) The story can be confusing. Despite the very few characters, it's often hard to understand why Red, the protagonist, does what she does. It took me two playthroughs and reading a thorough guide, to understand what was going on. Nevertheless, you can ""breeze"" through the game just for the feeling without losing much, but understanding the story adds to the emotional experience. (2) The sci-fi jargon --informatics, computers, programming, technology-- can also be confusing. I have some skill in the department and it wasn't all that easy for me either. The GUI is good at explaining things, but you gotta spend some time to check things out. (3) The game is not good at revealing the depth of its combat system. Also, with the main story being relatively short, you can reach the ending and beat the game without needing to grasp the mechanics. My second playthrough (NG+) was much more entertaining, as was doing all the optional ""Tests"" offered.*** Comparison to Bastion: I liked Bastion's narrator better, as well as the delivery of the story, which was way simpler. Also, I believe that Bastion was better at hooking you up into its gameplay. Transistor has much better combat system, but it's not so good at hooking you up. Transistor's visuals, music and ""world"" are much more interesting.*** I played this for more than 20hrs, completed the story twice (first play-through and NewGame+) and got almost all the achievements.

												Short Version:Does this game generally objectively fulfill perceived goals: Yes.Should you buy this game: Yes.How does it chalk up to Bastion?: They have similarities, but Transistor stands on its own. In some ways, it is superior and more mature than Bastion, while in other ways, Bastion has an edge in storytelling.Long Version:Transistor is beautiful. Transistor is inspired by Bastion in many ways, and that's abundantly clear from the get-go. From the similar ever-present voice of Logan Cunningham, to the angled top-down approach, Supergiant is definitely playing to their strengths.Transistor, visually, has a great feel. Pre-rendered maps have stunning detail and effort. While Bastion in places had a pieced together, stylized look in the Calamity-stricken ruins of Caelondia, the city of Cloudbank is fully fleshed, and takes on strange and interesting changes as the enemies of the game - ""The Process"" - make their mark on the city.Transistor is linear. That's okay. Linear is not always bad, though your adventure feels more or less on rails throughout the entire game. Some may consider this a flaw. People coming from Bastion, however, probably are not expecting much here. It is, however, worth noting that Transistor does -not- have different endings.Transistor's soundtrack is breathtaking - the music alone easily justifies half the cost of the game. The music played in various scenarios takes on different variations depending on circumstances, and the world becomes muted and quiet while the haunting voice of the protagonist - Red - takes center stage during the Turn(). Musically inclined peoples want this soundtrack, if not the game too.Transistor is short. People generally expect to get more hours from a video game than they can realistically play in a day without a binge session. If it were full price, that might be a problem. Fortunately, the nice low price of 20$ means that a 6-8 hour playthrough (assuming you do not rush through content) will strike a sweet spot. The game values your time and effort, and nothing in the game feels like ""busy work"", nor does anything feel like filler. The game, contrary to what some claim, feels like pure substance.Transistor is a bargain - the game is effortlessly worth more than it costs.Transistor's combat is varying shades of complex. In time, you will find that some abilities may feel somewhat superfluous and certain abilities like Void() become more or less necessities in gameplay with highest difficulty settings enabled - ""limiters"" in game. The game does an admirable job of respecting the intellect of its player - there are very few tutorials or listed instructions in actual gameplay, and you are encouraged and rewarded with bits of story and background when you experiment with the various ""Functions"" that are made available to you throughout.Transistor leaves a lot to interpretation. If you prefer a story where everything neatly ties up in the end, and you are left satisfied and ready to move on to the next big thing in your day, Transistor will leave you unsettled. The game offers a peak into a dire moment in Cloudbank's story, and as you play a mystery unfolds that descends into chaotic circumstances that few could possibly predict. Because the game is short, there is ultimately only so much that can be done to lend clarity to some of the events of the story, and you will likely be left with questions that will leave you scratching your head for days to come.That's not to say the game is pointless, absurd, or nonsensical. It is simply the sort of game that seems more or less designed to haunt you, be that good or bad.The game, despite it's great strengths also suffers from limitations of the developers. Transistor's probably largest flaw is that the story is TOLD to you, and not SHOWN as well as some may like. Earned story tidbits more or less being fed in the form of static images and a few paragraphs of vague background information begin to feel like a substitute or a placeholder where something better could have been implemented - brief cutscenes or playable intermissions where we can watch events unfold in other places. It feels like a missed opportunity to elevate the methods used to tell the story. Why it's done this way, I can only guess - this is the first title that Supergiant Games has self-published, and only their second game. They're a very small name in gaming for now, and that means that a lot of the things we may expect and take for granted in other games are not options to them.All that said, I can wrap it up. It's a gorgeous, fun, interesting and expressive game that is presented at a price so low that you really can't lose. It's flaws are minor enough that it becomes easy to forget about them and simply bask in the enjoyable combat mechanics and the sultry tones of the sword in your hands as you explore the computer-like city of Cloudbank.

												Absolutely loved this game.While you simply cannot beat Bastion's soundtrack or narrator, Transistor's soundtrack does not disappoint, and the Hum feature is really cool. I enjoyed the world and storyline, though both can be confusing at times.The battle/customization system is awesome, based on Functions used in Active, Upgrade, or Passive slots, in addition to the given Turn() Function which allows you to pause battle and plan out your next few moves. Trying out different combinations is encouraged through optional tests the player can complete for experience at various points throughout the game, as well as receiving information on a Function's associated character as you use it in different slots, but the game allows you to use your tried-and-true combos enough that you don't feel you're constantly having to switch things around (though I found it fun to). Once you beat the game, you have the option to start Recursive Play, where you keep your User Level and all Functions/Upgrades and start the game anew, earning the same Functions as before allowing their use in more than one slot. I enjoyed this second playthrough, though I really wish that you could continue the original story instead of restarting. COMPLETELY, 100% worth the money if you pick it up on sale, and I highly recommend you do.			"

												Transistor is a game that drives my heart into the world of cyberpunk and dystopian science fiction. It’s not just about gorgeous presentation and addictive combat, but I also realize the fault of human creation.The more you advance in Transistor, the more you understand how the truth of the Cloudbank. Most of the time, Transistor is your main weapon and storyteller. Transistor also gives you strong narrative, telling what is going on, and comments on your interaction even each terminal is worthwhile to read.As you fight against The Process, the main feature is shined out. Transistor’s combat can split into real-time approach and turn-based approach which give you planning phase to set your position, target, and set of skills. The variety of skill as you progress through the game make Transistor has unique combat and gives player’s choice to try out their own skill build. Even the limiter feature which works like player debuff, and test rooms offer challenge and thinking rather than spamming for win. However, it can be frustrated for cool down after turn mode is used as you may have to run around in small area while some enemies can constantly harm you. It is just minor issue which you can get over with once you get your perfect build.Transistor is such a unique and great experience. Not just engaging combat, but I fell in love in polished art design, story, and memorable soundtracks which create what people like in the game. And I’m pretty sure you will enjoy much as I do once you get deeper into The Cloudbank. "

The game does an admirable job of respecting the intellect of its player - there are very few tutorials or listed instructions in actual gameplay, and you are encouraged and rewarded with bits of story and background when you experiment with the various ""Functions"" that are made available to you throughout.Transistor leaves a lot to interpretation. If you prefer a story where everything neatly ties up in the end, and you are left satisfied and ready to move on to the next big thing in your day, Transistor will leave you unsettled. The game offers a peak into a dire moment in Cloudbank's story, and as you play a mystery unfolds that descends into chaotic circumstances that few could possibly predict. Because the game is short, there is ultimately only so much that can be done to lend clarity to some of the events of the story, and you will likely be left with questions that will leave you scratching your head for days to come.That's not to say the game is pointless, absurd, or nonsensical. It is simply the sort of game that seems more or less designed to haunt you, be that good or bad.The game, despite it's great strengths also suffers from limitations of the developers. Transistor's probably largest flaw is that the story is TOLD to you, and not SHOWN as well as some may like. Earned story tidbits more or less being fed in the form of static images and a few paragraphs of vague background information begin to feel like a substitute or a placeholder where something better could have been implemented - brief cutscenes or playable intermissions where we can watch events unfold in other places. It feels like a missed opportunity to elevate the methods used to tell the story. Why it's done this way, I can only guess - this is the first title that Supergiant Games has self-published, and only their second game. They're a very small name in gaming for now, and that means that a lot of the things we may expect and take for granted in other games are not options to them.All that said, I can wrap it up. It's a gorgeous, fun, interesting and expressive game that is presented at a price so low that you really can't lose. It's flaws are minor enough that it becomes easy to forget about them and simply bask in the enjoyable combat mechanics and the sultry tones of the sword in your hands as you explore the computer-like city of Cloudbank.

												Absolutely loved this game.While you simply cannot beat Bastion's soundtrack or narrator, Transistor's soundtrack does not disappoint, and the Hum feature is really cool. I enjoyed the world and storyline, though both can be confusing at times.The battle/customization system is awesome, based on Functions used in Active, Upgrade, or Passive slots, in addition to the given Turn() Function which allows you to pause battle and plan out your next few moves. Trying out different combinations is encouraged through optional tests the player can complete for experience at various points throughout the game, as well as receiving information on a Function's associated character as you use it in different slots, but the game allows you to use your tried-and-true combos enough that you don't feel you're constantly having to switch things around (though I found it fun to). Once you beat the game, you have the option to start Recursive Play, where you keep your User Level and all Functions/Upgrades and start the game anew, earning the same Functions as before allowing their use in more than one slot. I enjoyed this second playthrough, though I really wish that you could continue the original story instead of restarting. COMPLETELY, 100% worth the money if you pick it up on sale, and I highly recommend you do.			"

												Transistor is an iteration of the great top-down 2d action RPG game Bastion. Once again Supergiant Games delivers a perfectly themed fantasy world (sci-fi this time), with beautiful handdrawn graphics, and a superb soundtrack from Darren korb. Once again the story just starts from scratch, and is told to you bit by bit as you progress through the game. The story has the same metaphorical vagueness about it, that lets your imagination play it's part, and make it feel more personal and relevant.At first glance it would seem that this game would be a no-brainer to recommend for anyone who liked Bastion, but there's quite a big game changer in Transistor: Turn based combat. Yup, you have the ability to stop time and plan your moves, and then ""release"" time again and watch your actions unfold. This comes at the penalty of not being able to use your weapons (functions) for some seconds afterwards. That is unless you've applied a certain upgrade to a function, then you can always use that particular weapon. But you only gain this upgrade later in the game, and you'll only have 1 instance of it, unless you're on your second playthrough.Personally, I felt the turn based element just increased the tactical depth of the combat, so I see it as an improvement, but I can see how it might put some people off. You could of course choose to use it as little as possible, but I reckon you'd be severely handicapped, and some parts would be impossible (speed tests e.g.).The only mentionable complaint I have is that there is no ""Retry with same loadout"" option during the tests. It's pretty annoying having to reconfigure all the slots from scratch every time.The game is pretty short (6-7 hours including all the tests I reckon), but if you like the game as much as I did, you wanna recurse() the story as soon as you've completed it, and get all the achievements, which btw are relevant and very achieveable :)90%			"

Transistor. A cyberpunk, apocalyptic RPG filled with enigmas in a masterpiece of a scenic city.The basic story of the game is that you control Red, a beautiful young singer whom was attacked by the Camerata, losing her voice in the process. Escaping backstage, she finds and wields an extravargently crafted sword referred to as The Transistor, a weapon with the ability to hold the consciousness of the deceased and be the ""brush"" that crafts the city of Cloudbank. As the story progresses, it is learned that Cloudbank is gradually being destroyed by monstrosities--The Process--after the Camerata lost their ownership of the Transistor, leaving them to cower in fear of the creatures.As Red seeks answers, your job is to blast through every wave or horde of processes that stand in your path, traversing the metropolis as it crumbles away to a blank canvas. Throughout the game, you progressively develop new attacks and combinations as well as face against harder entities from within the futuristic world.ReviewThe GoodGetting into the game, it was a nice experience and proved to be beautifully done. The music and scenes are well done and provide a lovely aesthetic as I progressed in the game. Truthfully, this entire game's atmosphere and environments, action/gameplay, and enemies are all unique from common RPG/Strategy games that I have seen and was definitely something new; the story elements are excellent too. After completed the game on the first good, you are able to replay it with a slightly harder difficulty, facing tougher enemies earlier and able to gain the remainder of the upgrades and limiters in the game.The Bad---Concluding Comments--Hermix.

												Transistor, aesthetic wise, think Blade Runner meets Cowboy BeBop.  But that really isn't a fair description at all.   First of all I want to say I am not a big RTS fan at all.  So I was very much on the fence about Transistor.  I got it in the Winter Sale of 2014 and just got around to playing it and boy was it a treat.  Gameplay aside this game is ART.  The visuals are stunning and the soundtrack is stellar as we have come to expect with composer Darren Korb of the previous SuperGiant game Bastion acclaim.  Ashely Barrett (also from Bastion fame) has some outstanding vocals as well.  I am not going to compare this game to Bastion they are both good in thier own right.  I enjoyed the Real time/Planning kind of gameplay Transistor brought to the table.  Really unique.  It's a great game albeit short.  I didn't do any extras or training missions and the story took me about 4 hours.  The story (to me) was kinda ambigous and convoluted, but I think that was the point to get people discussing theories and what they interpreted it as.  All in all it's a great game, pick it up if you want to see some gorgeous visuals, hear some great music, and have a unique experience only SuperGiant can deliver :)			"

												I'm gonna be honest, I almost never review games. I usually play games and leave feeling as though I had fun, but that nothing was really accomplished. But it is for that exact reason, I am reviewing Transistor.This game was amazing.Everything was well thought out, and it really showed in the final product being one of the best most enjoyable games I have ever played. Combat is flawless, the art style is beautiful and the games amazing music actually made me, a person who NEVER has audio on in a game listen throughout the entire game. On top of that, the thing I loved most about Transistor was the story. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOH MA GAWWWWWWD THE STORY.In conclusion, Transistor was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. Buy it. And to SuperGiant, make more games that are as flawless as transistor and I will be a happy person.			"

												Transistor blends Bastion’s fast-paced isometric combat with a methodical tactical planning mode to create a unique action system that fits well within its vibrant urban sci-fi setting. You can assign each ability as an action command, a passive bonus, or as an upgrade to another ability, which allows for a vast variety of combinations. This character customization, as well as your options to tweak enemy abilities, provides you significant freedom to tailor your game experience.  Bastion’s combat sandbox and escalating challenge modes return, complementing Transistor’s many avenues for player experimentation. The combat system, however, does significantly favor the planning mode, leaving you relatively weak during the real-time portions while you wait for your planning ability to recharge.  The gorgeous character art and atmospheric music paint a beautiful presentation over the solid gameplay, but the story feels stretched thin as major characters and events receive only minor acknowledgement before moving on. Moreover, the omnipresent narrator says little of value and his comments come across as a scattered stream-of-consciousness in contrast to the wise insight of Bastion’s commentary. Transistor retains many of Bastion’s best elements and distinguishes itself with its unique hybrid action, but fails to entirely match its predecessor’s heights.4/5 – Really liked it.			"

												This is my personal Game Of The Year.The last time an indie game blew my mind with such visual elegance and mechanical prowess was Fez. Yet, one must refrain from patronizing indie studios as gems like Transistor show that it's not necessarely vital to have 400 people working on one game, but a small crew of dedicated and creative people like Super Giant Games suffice to bring forth such an adventure of grandeur.This is a game of discovery, of art, of strategic maneuvering. A romance from the eyes (?) of a talking sword in the hands of a beautiful and once gifted pariah on the quest for redemption of themselves and their city.10/10 would play again...actually...I am already...

												It's hard to review a game with such little flaws. The story is a masterpiece, could easily be extrapolated to become a critic of our society, the soundtrack, jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ the soundtrack, if you played you know there aren't words to describe it. The graphics are ridiculously beautiful, scenarios are quite detailed, enemies not much but that's to be expected, won't say why since it would be a spoiler.Okay, so, to sum it up pretty poorly, the game is about a utopian city where the people who live there can shape it however they wish, until something goes wrong. You are in charge of finding out what went wrong and why. At first i thought it would be something like, ""yeah well theres the supervillain who wanted the power all to himself"" or something along those lines, as it usually is. I was wrong. Oh boy, i was.Without further ado, let's get to numbers and proper review of the game's aspects.Pros:+ Brilliant backstory+ Amazing soundtrack+ Gameplay mechanics mixes a lot of many games together, making it unique+ Very well designed, looks almost like a piece of art coming to life+ Has good replay value, since it has a ""new game+"" like feature+ You can customize your abilities to match your playstyle+ You can customize the difficulty setting of the game by messing exactly with which part you want easier/harder+ Very interesting way to develop character backgroundsCons:- Rather short game, you can finish the main story in about 5 hours- Even if you can choose the abilities, some of them are overpowered, making them almost mandatory- Battles become a chore after certain abilities are unlocked- Price is a little high for a game so shortWith about 26 hours into it, i have unlocked everything there was to unlock and got all achievements the game had. Even though the price is not ideal, it's still worth the extra effort, and if you can buy it on a good sale, the price problem is gone.Final score: 8.6/10. If you're a fan of games with more thought provoking storylines, or like new/unexplored combat systems, this game is for you.			"

												Transistor, aesthetic wise, think Blade Runner meets Cowboy BeBop.  But that really isn't a fair description at all.   First of all I want to say I am not a big RTS fan at all.  So I was very much on the fence about Transistor.  I got it in the Winter Sale of 2014 and just got around to playing it and boy was it a treat.  Gameplay aside this game is ART.  The visuals are stunning and the soundtrack is stellar as we have come to expect with composer Darren Korb of the previous SuperGiant game Bastion acclaim.  Ashely Barrett (also from Bastion fame) has some outstanding vocals as well.  I am not going to compare this game to Bastion they are both good in thier own right.  I enjoyed the Real time/Planning kind of gameplay Transistor brought to the table.  Really unique.  It's a great game albeit short.  I didn't do any extras or training missions and the story took me about 4 hours.  The story (to me) was kinda ambigous and convoluted, but I think that was the point to get people discussing theories and what they interpreted it as.  All in all it's a great game, pick it up if you want to see some gorgeous visuals, hear some great music, and have a unique experience only SuperGiant can deliver :)			"

												I'm gonna be honest, I almost never review games. I usually play games and leave feeling as though I had fun, but that nothing was really accomplished. But it is for that exact reason, I am reviewing Transistor.This game was amazing.Everything was well thought out, and it really showed in the final product being one of the best most enjoyable games I have ever played. Combat is flawless, the art style is beautiful and the games amazing music actually made me, a person who NEVER has audio on in a game listen throughout the entire game. On top of that, the thing I loved most about Transistor was the story. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOH MA GAWWWWWWD THE STORY.In conclusion, Transistor was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. Buy it. And to SuperGiant, make more games that are as flawless as transistor and I will be a happy person.			"

Which is not really a problem because you can just start all over and level up until lvl 31 while unlocking additional slots for your functions and gaining more points to spend on your functions. So I'm definetly going to play this game a 2nd time ;).Very enjoyable game from the very beginning until the end. (^.^)b"");} }			"

												well gameplay: it dosen't really add that much it's like bastion but with trun based , you have diffrent kind of wapones that you can use , upgrades and stuff like that you can say it has more depth then bastion and it is not really that long like bastion it took 4-5 hours to beat the game and it's not really that boring. Sounds : both the voice acting and the music are good flawless but still perfer bastion ostStroy: the point of this story or the game is to make the player make his own idea or theory of this world and the ending too like in dark souls .after the ending the game leaves a lot of questions and it's up to you to find the answers  i'm not going to say more about the story because i might screw up the experience for you so yeah if you like this kind of stories you will like this toothe game is good after all and there's a New Game+ mode so if you liked bastion you might like this game but this game is not really for everyone.

This game is quality stuff. But be warned . It's less easy to understand than Bastion, their previous game.Gameplay is unqiue but the 'combination of function' got some problem which some combos are must have while others are not as good as it sounds. Especially true on high difficulty(10 limiters)The games isn't long/riddle of unlockable either. you can finish the game in one sitting, around 6 hours. 10 hours on all challange and perhaps 5 more on second playthrough on hardest difficulty.It's fun, it's short. Just know that it's not going to last.  but you are going to enjoy every second of it.			"

												This game is bloody amazing. I didn't get into Bastion, somehow, though from what I've heard it was also a great game. But Transistor I know is great. My playtime is a bit low since I mostly played the game on PS4, and there I'm halfway NG+.The combat system is extremely interesting and original. One thing is the timestopping feature (or something more like ""planning phase"", to be exact) combined with how the damage works. But the really amazing part is how there are multiple clever combinations of abilities and skills, and even modifiers to make the enemies stronger. It'll take a whole playthrough to just find out all of them, and figuring out how they work together, and with the difficulty scaling up just fine, you're bound to have a good time. While I could praise the combat system forever, that wouldn't make a very interesting review. So just know that it's awesome. The only bad thing really was that there were just a few skill combinations that made the game feel a bit too easy. But that kind of thing exists almost everywhere, really, and it definitely wasn't enough to make the system feel flawed at all.The voice acting was nice (and while this has nothing to do with the Steam version, it was just SO COOL to hear the Transistor's voice from your controller... It was like you were really carrying the thing!), as was the atmosphere — the feeling of being alone was only emphasized by the fact the only voice you ever heard was, well, a sword. The storytelling was interesting, too; facts being revealed in a nice, slow pace to keep things shrouded in a mystery, to be revealed slowly, bit by bit, through various means.That's what I have to say for now. Amazing job.also the end was hhgdfsghdfgh kri evri tim/5 well done			"

												So we were all hyped once we heard about Supergiant`s 2nd game, specially after something like Bastion and normally, being hyped is a huge mistake as it sets your expectations very high, but this time, even my hype wasn`t prepared for this game, it surpassed my expectations. Beautiful art and music, coupled with an entertaining combat system with huge amounts of options towards attacking, debuffing, summoning canines to bark at enemies are making it an even better experience.

												Well, I just finished my Recursion and can now finally review the game.The fights are basically played in an arena - a closed area on the map - and require a lot of thought in skill preparation and use as well as character placement.Their are two ways to wage a fight. Either you go the classic active way (like any action game), or you can use the Turn() function which allows you to stop time and plan your attacks at leisure.While in Turn(), everyone freezes and a bar appears at the top of the screen, this bar represent the total of actions you can take (for those who know of it, imagine Legend of Legaia's system). Moving and attacking eats a part of the bar depending of the skill and isn't done right away, instead you plan all hte attack which will be carried out when you finish the Turn(). The actions are then done at lightning speed, often taking a number of enemies to the grave at once with good planning.About the skills :You will equip skills (which you acquire by leveling and by finding people) at savepoint, in up to 4 active slots.Every skill is totally different from another both visually and practically. One can debuff a group of enemies in an area while the other will make you invisible for a while.Then you can equip those skills as passives for the active skills or for yourself. A skill that makes you drop explosives packets on the ground as active will increase the damage and blast radius of another as passive. Character passives can increase your total HP, reduce damage taken, reduce cost of abilities during Turn()...The game isn't too short, but not really long. It took me 7 hours to complete my first run and 9 hours to Recurse through the story. Recursion is basically New Game+ wherre you keep everything and replay the story while the enemies are end-game level and randomized through the areas.The scenario can seem confused, but is very enjoyable with many things to learn.Apart from the Sandbox - which give acces to a practice area and a number of tests as well as some miscellaneous stuff, a big one being the jukebox - there is no side content.The art is sublime and serves very well the game. The music nicely compliments the action and events throughout the game and is a jewel to listen to. I give a solid 9.5/10 for this well crafted game. Really enjoyed it.			"

												Before we begin, let us establish something that should be obvious from the game's title, but apparently isn't to some players: THIS IS NOT BASTION 2Playing it like it was Bastion 2 can only lead to frustration and disaappointment. To appreciate Transistor, you must approach it respectfully, on its own terms, and not guided by your own expectations, as, really, you should be doing with every game worth talking about.While it uses some of the same innovative mechanisms that were introduced in Bastion, it is not, nor does it try to be, more of the same - something I admire with Supergiant's production that, apparently, some players of the game find frustration with. They could've easily printed money by making a Bastion 2, but chose to make something original instead. How can you not admire such a departure from the unscrupulous money grab that is sadly becoming the norm in this hobby?I've likely already gifted you this game if we're on reasonably friendly terms. But for everyone else, allow me to say that, speaking as an experienced gamer, this is my favourite game. It is, in a word, perfection, and those of you who know how critical I can be of these things should know I do not say that lightly. Perfectly harmonized design, art direction, music, writing, everything. The team at Supergiant, earning themselves a place as my personal favourite developers, and in any case an honoured spot on the true A-list, have here created another superbly crafted game that I warmly encourage everyone to try and experience.

												A couple of things - one - Puzzlefox's excellent thumbs down review adequately summarizes many of my complaints about the game, lack of variety, almost non-existent story, a tedious rather than rewarding challenge area, and simplistic enemies.  So there is that - having loved bastion to tag this game with any of those things (which it excelled at) is really disheartening. However aside from those issues I had some of my own (ignore my logged playtime, I got in about 3-4ish hours off the books.I still haven't finished this game. I may come back and change my review if I can ever stand to drudge my way through it. Until such a time - here are the reasons why despite loving bastion and SuperGiant; I consider this game a misfire and would only recommend it to people when it's on sale or if they simply want to support the studio without buying multiple copies of bastion. Combat.I really like turn-based games. I am enjoying my third playthrough of Invisible Inc at the time of writing this review, I also actually mucked around with the challenge modes and New Game + in Bastion, so I can get into some hack n slash. What I can't get into, no matter how hard I try, is violently switching between those two formats over and over in a fight. Or more accurately, I can't get into doing a ""turn"" and then running around or hiding for a few seconds while it recharges. It breaks my immersion, feels tedious, and honestly makes every fight in the game a chore. I know some people are really into this; and it clicks for them. I am deeply envious of those people because if the game had full turn-based I am positive I would have at least had the stomach to make it to the end.Story/NarrationI am combining these two, because I have yet to make it to the second boss (I am assuming there are three) in any playthrough and the second nail in the coffin is the narration. I love Logan as a voice actor, he essentially sold Bastion for me, and I'm not saying he needs to display a huge range in the early game. However - dribbling the story out slowly is simply less effective for me when he sounds so utterly emotionless and bored while delivering every single line. His dry quips never land, and honestly it's like they woke him up after trapping him in a sound booth and made sure he only recorded lines while still wiping the sleep from his eyes. Again - this might change in Act 3 or something - but if you bore me in the beginning I may never make it that far.Style.Initially I was really loving the art design. I still love the menus, music, and overall style. However one thing I lamented is that as I move from one section of the city to the next, I can barely tell any real difference. Part of what worked in Bastion was that each area felt distinct. With this game each area might have some slight variation, but the overwhelming same-ness of it all started to really wear on me. It didn't help that the random white blocks that popped up detracted from any sense of geography or style. In Bastion it was shop-carts, barrels, and plants. In this game it's just white blocks. White blocks. White Blocks. I'm not sure what they were going for here but it definitely contributed to my overall boredom.So inevitably it comes to this. If I had to rate it on a scale, I'd give it a 5/10. A well-polished game from a really good developer that simply misses several of the targets I really needed it to hit. However I don't get a scale, I just get a recommend or not. I don't recommend it, certainly not for $20. No one is sadder than me that I feel this way, and I sincerely hope their next game wins me back over. "

												Transistor.I honestly can't tell which one, Bastion or Transistor were more to my liking. Both have their awesome unique mechanics and stunning music.When you start the game, you don't have a main menu, instead you are put right into the game. This really took my by surprise. I think you'll understand what I mean once you launch the game.So, lets get on with it.The Plot: 10/10Just like in Bastion, you are thrown right into the game without any introduction. Just a gal with a sword-like object which apparently talks. First I had no idea what was talking to me. The further you go into the story, the more is revealed, along with the backstory of Red (the main character, the musician). Soon it appears that 4 villans, the Camerata, those who basically own the city Cloudbank. Not only that, they are mostly scientists who care for the city, but made a mistake, and... well, you'll find out.Gameplay: 9/10Bastion had a right-left-midbutton gameplay, while here you get abilities that you use. Not only that, it is also followed with Turn() feature, a planning feature that allows you to stop time and make actions like walking and using abilities for the price of Turn() potential (lets call it that). For instance, a Breach() ability (your very first ability you have access to) uses 20 Turn().Not only that, you get some introduction to different characters who these abilities belonged to. For example, Red's ability is Breach(), an ability that stuns the target and makes it more vulnerable for 1.6 secs. Another one was a racer, when you used the transistor to ""absorb"" his essence, you retrieved an ability that allows you to blink. Furthermore, you can read info on these abilities that reveal about the character.Each ability can also be used as a passive or an upgrade to a different abilities. They can be swapped at any time when you get to an access point.And of course, remember the Shrine in Bastion? Here you have so called ""Limiters"", they work exactly the same as those things in the Shrine, except they also reveal info on the ""Process"" if used.Music: 10/10I won't comment on this. No point.Visuals: 10/10Seriously, the visuals are just amazing. Some may complain tho, that they don't like cyberpunk stuff, but to me, the art in this is majestic. The lights, the sketches, everything deserves a 10 in my opinion.Duration: 7/10Sadly, its rather short, but if you play with limiters you may get a longer enjoyment from this. That's exactly what I did with Bastion. Yet Transistor is still shorter than Bastion. I really wish it either had a continuation or just a longer gameplay. That may ruin the plot however.Replayable? Yes, definitely. Its worth replaying. Unlike Bastion, you don't have to grind here to get levels (because you can't, lol).Overall:I really want to give it 10/10, but I can't. I honestly just can't. I want it to be a bit longer, I want to get more enjoyment, maybe have a reality where Process comes from, where I can destroy its core, where I can have some sort of a choice like in Half-Life at the very end, or... I don't know. I just feel the urge for this to be longer.So any way.9/10, I can't wait for Supergiant games to release a new game. Maybe soon, maybe later, maybe next year (I actually heard they are working on a new game to be released in 2017).TL;DR Transistor is awesome, has great music, gameplay mechanics and great plot. If you feel like you need a game that would allow you to relax and feel some enjoyment, then this is it. I am a Dota 2 player myself, and nothing relaxed me more than Bastion and Transistor (especially transistor, tbh). Go buy it.			"

												I was expecting a lot of this game, given that I loved Bastion and the reviews are extremely good, but I didn't manage to like it, even if I tried.The storytelling is sketchy, bland, disconnected. It manages to create an atmosphere, but not a solid story. The gameplay is interesting, the combat system is amazing, but has serious downsides: It messes up your build as a punishment for screwing up, and it depends too much on the ""turn programmer"". Challenges available were also pretty weak, and everything was way too lineal.Anyway, it's a great and enjoyable game, but small flaws can make it pretty disappointing.			"

												This game is an Art Project... Not a game. It plays horrible, combat is repetative and favors spamming. I could forgive the combat if the story was interesting but I honestly could not give a damn about any of the ""Characters"" or the overall story. Your Sword says pretty much little to nothing of interest, and it's hard to believe there was any sort of relationship between the protagonist and this man who's spirit is now trapped within this sword, if there was a relationsip it must have been a pretty boring shallow one. Overall I was just bored, the visuals are great but not enough to carry a crappy story and repetative gameplay.			"

												The player starts in the middle of action without any hint of what is going on. Soon, he will put put pieces together revealing the past events and the main plot. The story is great  and the amazing voice acting really contribute for the storytelling. Also, the art creates a beautiful futuristic immersive city.  The combat machanics are very addicting combining elements of strategy/rpg and real time action. The game offers a lot of ways to aproach battle and it's a lot of fun testing the different combinations of skills and planning every move. And the music - oh! The music! - The soundtrack perfectly blends with the mood, the plot and the gameplay and the songs are responsible for the greatest moments of the game (What a voice!).It could have a bit more of exploration, but this doesn't interfere with the experience.Great game, I recommend.

												I bought TRANSISTOR at $13.39 and I got about 20 hours of high-quality playtime out of the purchase. I consider that a great buy.So many elements of this game standout: - The combat mechanics are fully customizable, strategic, and introduced in layers - as you play, not thrown at you all at once. There are so many creative ways to build that the heroine truly becomes your own. - The mixture of real-time/turn-based combat is seamless, and cleverly left in your control. I wish I could find more games with this system! - The story is compelling and told beautifully in sound and color (although much of it is open to your own interpretation). The voice-acting and artwork are first-rate.The downside is, the game will leave you wanting more - but in my experience, that is how all good books and films end. We wish there were another chapter.			"

												ProsNice graphics and music. Awesome voice acting . Nice ""artwork"" and ""feeling"" during the gameCreative and interesting skills systemFun and moderately challenging combatNice atmospere and good storyNo grindingCons Short playtimeNo multiple save slotsNo ""Sand box""No difficulty setting I would recommend the game to those who appreciate the good music and and nice graphics.The voice acting was well excuted and personally it was one of the best voice I heard in general , really soothing and deep voice. The atmospere of the game was also nice. These things made me engaged in game. However, I dont like the lenght of the game (1 story mode play would take Probably 3 - 6 hours for the most users) and sometimes I just lost where to go because basically no maps available. And too many ""discarding"" thing.What I meant the""discarding"" thing is that - basically you choose one of the things that you can get when you lev up.It can be skill A , skill B and more MEM or more skill upgrade slots something like that and you choose 1 of these choices.This is very fine and I really like the choice in the game. However , I found later that the choice is permanent and theres no ""Skill respec"" until the end , and no turning back even in ""new game+"". So basically , I missed almost half of the skills / choices and there was no way to just ""have fun"" with the skills I missed on sandbox or something . If they had one , I coudnt find it.(Edited later : I found that after after leveling up several times more, I do get the all the skills. so this is not true. No scratch from beginning option though)Speaking of skills and lev up stuff, the skill system is but quite interesting. It is really fun expermenting with these stuff. One ""element"" can be active skill and can be fuction as the passive skill and even upgrade other skills. It makes A LOT OF the skill set possible. It gives you a lot of choices, makes you think a lot , and makes you creative. And at least for the ""elements"" you have, you can change anytime you want on the check point (But no discarded elements) The combat can be played both real-time and ""turn based"" but i think the game meant to be played on turn based. But If you are real quick with the mircro and the planning stuff , I think you may be able to play on real time only. The problem about the combat thing is that there's no ""hard and easy mode"" on the game so you are stuck with the ""normal"" . Otherwise, the combat was fun and pretty nice. Slightly lack of diversity of the enemy but I would say good enough.7.5/10Overall , the game is quite memorable one , and it has some issues but most people would appreciate the game.Don't buy the game if you are looking for huge amount of playtime of the game.

												Gorgeous Artwork, amazing soundtrack, intriguing combat system and good use of isometric perspective, if the game was only about that it would have been a undoubtedly masterpiece. But when it comes to the plot it is far too vague.Don't get me wrong, I like being thrown in medias res and struggling to understand the situation piece by piece but on this game they got a bit too far: you don't know where you are and more importantly which are your world ""rules"" (more or less like in physics rules). Not knowing the ""limits"" of your surroundings you can't empathize with the main characters and their story, you don't know who they are and what is their role in the world either (again, because you don't know what is the world you're playing your part in).So, well, with a little bit more knowledge about the world (not the ""politics"" that you can read on the terminals) I'd have been able to empathize with the main characters and understand the plot completely.I also like to spend a few words on the combat system itself. I don't know if something like that already existed, but, well, the hybrid turn/real-time combat system was amazing. You have to both plan your turn() and the time before the next turn(). Seldom being off-turn is better for strategic reasons and you have to take in considerations that too.Finally, there are no ninja-spawns you cannot react to (hello Valkyria Chronicles and partly XCOM: Enemy Unknown) meaning that you never feel like the game is not fair.So, in my opinion, if you approach this game as a multimedia artbook you will enjoy it from start, far, far more than expecting something from the plot or trying to understand the cyberpunk-art-deco world you're thrown in.Recommended to art-lovers and romantics.

												This was more of an artpiece than a game. It looks nice and it was kind of fun. Skillwise, I'm average and I never died once in the whole game (not counting the bonus challenges in the tree). That should tell you something. Pretty short. Only 2 bosses, I think, and they're both easy.Basically, you get extra chances even if you die, because if you lose all of your health you only temporarily lose an ability. You have 4 of these to lose before dying, so you're not in any serious danger. You can usually replenish these after almost every fight.Plus, I think the story isn't really exaplained. It's just kind of vague. (Trying not to give away spoilers) One guy let another guy borrow ________. He had good intentions, but the other guy... used it for evil... Why? Dunno. Everything kind of gets deflated and resolved easily.It's worth seeing, though.			"

												I've been looking forward to this game for quite awhile, and I think I got my money's worth. Supergiant Games made a worthy sophmore endeavor. I'm attempting to not write this review in comparison to Bastion.Transistor is devastating. There isn't any one thing that really makes it such. Just moving through the bleak city with nothing but the sword just makes a person weary. The combat is fun and the mix of planning, evading, and remarkably satisfying executions really shine. The incentives to try out new attack combos was enough to get me to tinker and find some really nice combos. The music in the game are stellar and haunting since it's a reminder of your character's state. Also? There is a button that makes your character hum. That might sound silly, but I found myself pushing it between fights on a regular basis and that is awesome.I admit that the story does feel a touch flimsy and rushed near the end. So much of the action takes place just off screen and you never quite catch it. However when That moment happens. Well. You'll be bewildered and upset and then you'll get it. I guess that was the best part of That moment. After a moment I think I'd make that choice too.See ya in the Country.			"

												Following on from Bastion, Transistor is yet another brilliant piece of gameplay and art, and is just a truly great experience. However, there are a few things that make it different from Bastion.First of all, the perspective is the same. The gameplay, however, is different. Instead of running in and hitting everything, your approach should be more careful because enemies tend to be a lot more deadly than they are in Bastion. You don't really have any form of instant healing (other than a few lifesteal upgrades you can find for your weapon) so you have to be much more careful. What allows you to do that while still destroying all these aggressive and powerful enemies is the turn-based system that you can switch to at any time. Time is paused while you plan your moves, and each step you take and attack you set up spends a bit of the bar at the top, which signifies how much you can do in one turn. Stronger moves generally take up more of the bar. You then end the turn and watch it all unfold as you quickly decimate your enemies... that is, if you set it up right.The challenge of the game is trying to kill your enemies as quickly and efficiently as possible, because if you finish your planning phase and you're out of energy for another turn, you may die very quickly as enemies rush to kill you. There is far more strategy than hacking and/or slashing to be found in Transistor. If you wanted to do the whole game without the  planning system, it's probably possible except for maybe the final boss fight. It will be very difficult though.Of course, the music in this game is even more spectacular than that of Bastion. You play as Red, a singer who has lost her voice completely. Although she can no longer sing, she can hum, and there is in fact a button that lets you start humming along to the current music playing in the background. Each track fits each level and the situation you're in, and each track is also expertly well done. I LOVE all the aspects of the music in this game. Without it the atmosphere wouldn't be quite the same.Speaking of atmosphere, art style is comparable to Bastion but has its own unique elements. The attention to detail is still there, however, which makes it beautiful to look at. The level design is similar throughout the whole game. However, it's not boring, just consistent. The world is very unique and futuristic, providing a strong contrast to Bastion. Supergiant Games are clearly trying to cover more than just one theme of games which is always interesting to see a developer do. In this case it works spectacularly. The enemies are also varied and you are introduced to more as the game goes on, each with their own special behaviours and attacks. The enemies fit very well with their environment as they are all robotic-looking. The boss fights are also very different from each other, which was something Bastion generally lacked. The game manages to give you plenty of action to keep yourself entertained. There are also small training rooms that you can progress through to get rewards.The story is told similarly to Bastion; a narrator guides you through the whole game, but this time the narrator is actually with you the entire time. In a way you feel less lonely, but in another way, you feel more lonely. You and the narrator are in this together, but you are alone together. The world is full of nothing but danger and despair, but there is the glitter of hope that you may somehow fix this in the end. The voice acting is fairly good, but not totally on par with Bastion's. However, the story is compelling and well written, keeping you playing and listening the whole way through.The game is amazing. I am going to be keeping a close eye on Supergiant Games in the coming years, and I hope to more excellent entertainment from them. If you like art in all forms, as well as gameplay that provides a perfect mix of action and basic strategy, then this is for you. Buy this game, support these developers, have a lovely time humming the soundtrack in the shower after you beat Transistor.			"

												As compaired to Bastion, the combat is more diverse, tight and enjoyable but the story, music, and dialogue are weaker.

Still a really nice isometric brawler and the turn and move mechanic makes for some very interesting gameplay.			"

												Transistor is staggeringly beautiful. All of the art, the setting, the music, the writing, all of it. It's also a pretty big departure from Bastion, which was made by the same developers. Yes, it's the same perspective, and there's an ever-present narrator, and the protagonist is mute, and you can increase the difficulty in a piecemeal fashion. The similarities end there. While you can play Transistor like an action game, it really requires more strategy than that. It has an active-pause system, where you can pause the action, plot out a set number of attacks or movements, and then unpause to see the results. The main loop ends up being pause, attack, run, which leads to a lot of guerilla tactics, more than straight out blasting enemies.The ability system is also super interesting. Every ability, whether it's a straight attack, or a cloak, or a bomb, can be used as-is, attached to another ability to lend it different qualities, or set as a passive bonus to yourself. This leads to a ton of combinations of attacks. Some work better than others, but they all feel unique. The limits to the system is that each ability has a memory requirement, and you have a memory limit. So you can stack up on a couple heavy hitters, but you limit yourself to a small number of attacks or bonuses. Likewise, you can have a full complement of attacks and bonuses, but you'll be lacking the most powerful of them. The one complaint I have is that the story is less straight forward than most video games. That doesn't mean it has a bad story, or that it's incomprehensible. It just takes more attention to the details than most. By the end, you'll probably get the gist of it, but expect to be a little disoriented.			"

												This is easily one of the best games I've played in the past year.  Great art style, amazing soundtrack (which I'm seriously considering buying), and good flow overall.  The mix and match skill system is cool, as is the VATS-like combat system.  My only real complaint is the game does a poor job I think of explaining the combat system.  It doesn't have a huge learning curve, but it takes a little getting used to.  Good- Art and animation are gorgeous.- Soundtrack is possibly the best I've heard in any game.- Cool skill system where almost any build is valid and useful. - Combat system is fun once you get the hang of it.Bad- Pretty short (10ish hours)- Vague story that didn't really grab me.- Combat system could be explained better early on.Ugly- Void, Crash, Mask, BACKSTAB!

												Outstanding. Never expected anything less than a matserpiece from the creators of my all-time favourite Bastion, and this is even more.Transistor is, by far, the best game I played yet (yes, even better than the last Bioshock), but it is more than a game - unbelivable imagery, that got me standing on ingame ""view points"" and just staring. The style, the lighting, the colours! Elaborate combat system, that you can never be bored by, because of numerous ways to execute your foes with new, never seen (at least by me) before ""functions"" upgrade system. The amazing story is supported by breathtaking music created by Darren Korb, who, by the way, is from now on the only person allowed to wear whiskers and still be praised by yours truly.I probably would have gone turbo-gay for Logan Cunningham, the voice of Transistor (also the narrator in Bastion), but, thanks to Ashley Barrett, who voices the main hero and sings the most of the soundtrack, I am still where I was.If in your gaming you seek something more than a timewaster, if you have the craving for sophisticated experiense, if you want to understand what a ""work of art"" is - you get yourself this game, and you play it.Thanks to Supergiant Games, videogames will get recognised as art, just like cinema and theatre.

												This is an aural and visual feast, which is no surprise coming from the makers of Bastion. What was most surprising was the elegant combat system.

It didn't seem to matter, it's a short game (about 4-6 hours) and I was glad it ended when it did. Any more and it would have been over indulgent, the chocolate eclair of gaming.			"

												Great game, SuperGiant really knows what they are doing.  This game runs on the same engine as Bastion, but is very different in several regards.  The combat system is more complex and there is little to no handleholding.  You are encouraged to try different combinations of Functions (skills/abilites) to find what suits you best. The story very good, but is not told nearly as direct as Bastion.  SuperGiant said they were experimenting with new narrative techniques, the best comparison I could use is that the story unforlds like unpealing the layers of an onion.  Here again, the player is given some control over how much of the story they want to delve into.  The ending was also very thought provoking IMO, and overall I think SuperGiant really did a good job here.  I would say this game is at least on par with Bastion.  If you (like me) really enjoyed Bastion then this is a solid choice.Definitely pick it up - 9/10			"

												So, first review for Transistor:The game is pretty, both to the eyes and the ears. Music is solid (beyond solid, it's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing), the art style is gorgeous (sort of what would happen if you took the cel-shaded style of Bastion and crossed it with Art Deco), and the detail is good, but not overdone or too busy.The gameplay certainly won't be for everyone, but I like it. It's an interesting take on a ""tactical"" style, and the sheer variety of moves and ways to go about doing solving a fight are pretty keen. Lots of abilities to use, and multiple ways to tweak each ability, not to mention passive buffs. All of this while trying to maximize a cap on how much ""boom"" you can wade into a fight with at once.Only problem I have so far: some bugs definitely made it out of their QA department. Hard-crash bugs. This is a bad thing. It's not hitting everyone, and apparently it's better if you play it in Offline Mode on Steam. I'm guessing Supergiant Games is driving for a fix at the moment, because no studio likes handing out game crashes.So, yeah: I definitely recommend it. It's on the shorter side (haven't beat it yet, but I have a feeling), but beautiful, fun, and has a refreshing take on the mechanics of a platformer. Might just wanna wait a few days for the bugs to get squashed.			"

												Transistor is a beautifully writen and designed world with a soundtrack to match.  The gameplay is fast paced while balanced with the ""turn()"" mechanic allowing you to pause the world and plan out your next set of moves as they play out in a second or two of game time.  There are enough twists and turns in the story and mechanic to keep combat fresh and the backstory is revealed as you mix and match various moves and combos, encoraging experimentation.All in all I highly reccomend it.There are a few cons to be away of however.  The first is that as of now the game is a little buggy with the occasional hiccups, but so far I've seen nothing that has caused me to die or loose progress. Another issue is its length.  Your $20 will net you roughly 7 hours for your first play through.  While this is a fair trade in my opinion, you still got more for Basition's $15.This last issue aggrivates me as someone who shares a computer with his partner.  The game offers no support for multiple saves as Bastion did.  Beyond that, there seems to be no option to start the game over from scratch once you've beaten it.  In order to give my partner a chance to play the game I had to uninstall and reinstall the game, permanently destroying my playthough.  I can only view this design as a way to try and force partners to buy the game twice and is an affont to the concept of social gaming for the sake of nickle and diming their customer.			"

Game length is roughly the same as Bastion (6ish hours for a full playthrough), though there's a NG+ option that feels very worth playing. Overall, well worth the money.			"

												This game is amazing!! The Art Style / Graphics is hands down beatuiful. Combat is outstanding with the real-time stand alone, but with the turn-based style mixed with real-time delay is perfect. The special effects of each move, and the combinations of functions is simply truely amazing. The story keep me playing until I finished the 1st playthrough. I wanted to know more:  why this was happening, what exactly happened prior the opening of me removing the sword. The level up system is clean, the choice between: passive slots, ability upgrade slots, memory upgrades are nice, since everyone play style is unique to be able to select the one you want to continue doing what you were doing. I myself did memory upgrades so I combine functions    and abused the Jaunt()+Charm() to my benefit.			"

												MUST GET GAME!You can't go wrong for buying this game. Arts, Music & Story are your things, well Transistor is for you might as well grab Bastion too if you don't have. Both games developed by Supergiant Games small studio. Excellent indie games.- Great awesome soundtracks (GET THE SOUNDTRACKS!)- Story is very good and *won't say more, no spoiler!*- Artworks are just the best.- GAME MECHANIC AND SKILL CUSTOMIZATION IS JUST MIND BLOW!- DEATH / LOST LIFE Mechanic is UNIQUE!Combat situation and skill testing, I never knew these would actually suck me into the game so much time. I didn't realize I actually spend more time finding the best skills and tactic to counter the enemies than rushing through the story with a few deaths.			"

												I really like this game. The music is beautiful, as are the visuals. The voice acting is nice, tho there are some weird pauses between lines. I sometimes find myself waiting for the second half of a sentence that never comes, or thinking a line is done and then it continues a few seconds later. A little weird. But the quality is very high. And I love that sword guy's voice ;oPThe combat system is enjoyable. Lots and lots of options to play with. You have a number of skills that can be either used as a primary skill (like hit 'em with the sword, or shoot a bolt of energy at a distant foe), or they can be slotted into a different primary (like add damage, or AoE to some other skill), or they can be used to provide a more general buff (you have a damage shield, or all backstabs do more damage). That's really clever, and it is surprisingly intuitive to use. I'm a huge fan of the pause-time-and-queue-up-your-actions mechanic as well.I'd highly recommend it, if you're into RPGs.			"

												6/10This game was made by the makers of Bastion, so I had my hopes up. Sadly, while the graphic style and music is gorgeous, the story and gameplay are lacking cohesion. Similar to Bastion the action is controlled from isometric view and has lots of action rpg elements. There is real time combat and a turn mode, which stops the action and allows you to plan moves, which are then executed. Combat in real time is clunky, as the enemies move much to fast to evade, which forces the player into the turn mode. Consequently the game forces hit and run tactics. Stop the action, move close to the enemy, hit him with a few spells and run out of range. Rinse and repeat.One of the few good things about combat is the endless combinations of skills you can use. Each of the skills can be used as primary or enhancer of another skill. Sadly, you will end up using the 1-3 heavy hitting spells, without ever experimenting too much.All in all the developers did not succeed making this a cohesive game. Graphics and sound are great, gameplay and story telling are lacking. So you find yourself walking down pretty hallways without ever caring about the enemies you kill or knowing what exactly happened in this dystopian world.			"

												Great game, SuperGiant really knows what they are doing.  This game runs on the same engine as Bastion, but is very different in several regards.  The combat system is more complex and there is little to no handleholding.  You are encouraged to try different combinations of Functions (skills/abilites) to find what suits you best. The story very good, but is not told nearly as direct as Bastion.  SuperGiant said they were experimenting with new narrative techniques, the best comparison I could use is that the story unforlds like unpealing the layers of an onion.  Here again, the player is given some control over how much of the story they want to delve into.  The ending was also very thought provoking IMO, and overall I think SuperGiant really did a good job here.  I would say this game is at least on par with Bastion.

												Transistor is an original, intelligent and lucid action RPG. The game revolves around Red, a singer whose voice was stolen by the Camerata, a group of individuals determined to Process a city that serves its people. Without formally identifying or constructing her as so, Red is presented as a strong female protagonist; this means she is without any of the clichés that so often inhibit this archetype. Supergiant masterfully pulls off a plot that gives her agency and the ability to sculpt a world inhabited by a cast of colourful characters whom the player learns about through the Functions() of the Transistor. The diversity of the characters, in particular, is to be commended: there are black and mixed-race, gay, lesbian and transgender characters.The Function() system is at the heart of the game; it allows the player to combine different attacks and abilities in either primary, upgrade, or passive slots, resulting in a unique experience with approximately 22bn different combinations to be had. The system encourages experimentation, and so leads the player in to a kind of exasperating perfectionism: you want to get your loudout exactly right. The mix of frantic, fast-paced real time action and the suspended realm that Turn() provides to plan a sequence of moves is something quite unique and, surprisingly, it doesn't get tiresome. The enemies are varied enough to keep the battles interesting; they regularly upgrade themselves to match your own increasing prowess and there are enough different kinds to always provide a challenge.The soundtrack is both touching and transcendental; it encapsulates the changing pace of the game, from the arid mystery of a deserted Cloudbank at the beginning to the decaying ruins of a Processed world at the end. The mixture of electronica-esque synths, ambient Portal-like sounds and well-timed guitar riffs give suitable gravitas at just the correct moments. The music feels alive; it actively changes as you switch between states and the Turn() mode.It's the little things in Transistor that really complete it. Flavour text is what drives the realism and the allusions to software and programming are delightful to see. The different chapters of the plot and the scenes are strung together well enough so the entire game flows. Romanticised additions like the motorbike and the posters add a sense of fun  to the game and an importance to the role that Red has.The most striking element of the game is probably the artwork; the visuals are stunning and utilise different hues, colours, art styles and changes in lighting to illuminate Cloudbank. Cloudbank is a city inside a computer, but it feels very much real. The nuanced dichotomy of an organic, breathing world that is seen through the window of Red and the basic binary foundation that underlies the entire premise is linked delicately with endless, gorgeous pieces of artwork and cutscenes and this is remarkable.What makes Transistor a gem is the seamless integration of the idiosyncratic creativity of these elements -- music, artwork, plot and mechanics -- that would only be expected to find in the most successful of indie games, with the overall polish that usually only blockbuster games can pull off. The entire game has a glistening shine that suceeds in being both immersive and compelling, pulling the player into the digital utopia of Cloudbank and refusing to let them go. Certainly a niche game, but it can't be recommended enough.			"

Beautiful music, gorgeous art, solid gameplay, incredibly deep story, and the outstanding voice acting that they've become known for makes Transistor another proud feather in Supergiant's hat.			"

												I think the Noire flavor and the intentionally opaque plot are a compliment to combat well refined. They took the standard of Bastion and elevated it to the next level, allowing freedom to compose your own style of battle. Along with the limited Turn Based mode to plan out an attack? It combines with the gorgeous art for a FUN game.And really, it is.			"

												A fine game, indeed. Beautiful world, characters and soundtrack, variety in skills and loadouts, intriguing story (a bit dissappointing ending, if understandable considering that there wasn't anyone left to save if i understood it right) and absolutely addictive combat, which is a good mix of strategy and smash-them-to-bits-before-they-do, if a bit repetitive however. The way they give you the lore is intriguing, literally by trying everything. Not in the same way as Bastion, however, with the commentator talking about everything and anything you interract with (still many things though) but when you experiment with your loadout, you get more info about the inventer of the tried out skill, who is usually in a high cultural position, like a local social butterfly who organizes most of the events in the city, so when you read about the inventer, you are told more about the world at the same time, instead of ""shoveling it into  your brain by force like Bastion,"" as some would say. This, however, leaves the lore a bit vague to those who don't read it with passion great enough, and possibly just a little bit less vague to those too. I'm also not sure about the pricing though, about the same as Bastions would have been more acceptable. Overall, however, it was worth it.			"

												Supergiant have nailed it again with Transistor- wildly beautiful art style, fantastic soundtrack and a unique twist on turn based/real time gameplay. The plot is a little hazy to begin with, and does leave a lot to interpretation, but the way the characters are fleshed out by a) using them in game (some you meet can be selected as upgrades to the titular weapon) and b) Logan Cunningham's wonderfully understated voiceover is just another feather in the cap of these developers. Whilst the pace wavers a little in the last third, it's a satisfying conclusion to their sophomore effort.If you're a fan of beautifully rendered, atmospheric, intriguing and innovative games, you should pick this up.

												Transistor is a beautifully writen and designed world with a soundtrack to match.  The gameplay is fast paced while balanced with the ""turn()"" mechanic allowing you to pause the world and plan out your next set of moves as they play out in a second or two of game time.  There are enough twists and turns in the story and mechanic to keep combat fresh and the backstory is revealed as you mix and match various moves and combos, encoraging experimentation.All in all I highly reccomend it.There are a few cons to be away of however.  The first is that as of now the game is a little buggy with the occasional hiccups, but so far I've seen nothing that has caused me to die or loose progress. Another issue is its length.  Your $20 will net you roughly 7 hours for your first play through.  While this is a fair trade in my opinion, you still got more for Basition's $15.This last issue aggrivates me as someone who shares a computer with his partner.  The game offers no support for multiple saves as Bastion did.  Beyond that, there seems to be no option to start the game over from scratch once you've beaten it.  In order to give my partner a chance to play the game I had to uninstall and reinstall the game, permanently destroying my playthough.  I can only view this design as a way to try and force partners to buy the game twice and is an affont to the concept of social gaming for the sake of nickle and diming their customer.			"

												So, first review for Transistor:The game is pretty, both to the eyes and the ears. Music is solid (beyond solid, it's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing), the art style is gorgeous (sort of what would happen if you took the cel-shaded style of Bastion and crossed it with Art Deco), and the detail is good, but not overdone or too busy.The gameplay certainly won't be for everyone, but I like it. It's an interesting take on a ""tactical"" style, and the sheer variety of moves and ways to go about doing solving a fight are pretty keen. Lots of abilities to use, and multiple ways to tweak each ability, not to mention passive buffs. All of this while trying to maximize a cap on how much ""boom"" you can wade into a fight with at once.Only problem I have so far: some bugs definitely made it out of their QA department. Hard-crash bugs. This is a bad thing. It's not hitting everyone, and apparently it's better if you play it in Offline Mode on Steam. I'm guessing Supergiant Games is driving for a fix at the moment, because no studio likes handing out game crashes.So, yeah: I definitely recommend it. It's on the shorter side (haven't beat it yet, but I have a feeling), but beautiful, fun, and has a refreshing take on the mechanics of a platformer. Might just wanna wait a few days for the bugs to get squashed.			"

												Another great title by Supergiant Games. If you liked Bastion (and who didn't, really?), you should definitely pick up Transistor.The visuals are very similar in style to Bastion's, and the soundtrack is top-notch. Storyline is compelling. Game length is roughly the same as Bastion (6ish hours for a full playthrough), though there's a NG+ option that feels very worth playing. Overall, well worth the money.			"

												Hello world!Supergiant comes back with another installment, same narrator (or at least the same actor), world still falling apart, but this time, it's in the future!For Bastion fans, Transistor has all of the flavors of  Bastion, with a whole new story and significantly changed combat elements.Combat this time often time involves the usage of the ""Turn()"" ability.Turn() is essentially a planning phase where you can plan out your attacks, then when you execute, it happens instantaneously, then you have a recharge time before it can be used again.Being in the non-discript space future, there are a decent amount of programming references embedded into the game.As a programmer, I thought that was kinda cool, because I felt like I had a secret hand shake with the developers saying ""Hey, I got that!""Even if you're not a programmer, those minor references don't really effect the story at all, so nothing will be missed by anyone that plays this game.So to break down the pieces, gameplay, I would say is equivalent to the level that Bastion output.Music, dare I say, better than Bastion. The song for the trailer, We All Become was fantastic. Old Friends was great as well.Combat, personally, I liked it. I've heard some friends that preferred Bastion's combat system to Transistor, but I'm definitely a fan of RPGs, and Transistor feels more like an RPG with its system.Story, I'm kind of mixed. Shortly in, it becomes apparent that there are elements of romance. My video game taste palate initially wasn't expected a romance, but grew to accept and even really like where it took the story.All of those elements combined, it makes this game one of my absolute favorites.I would absolutely recommend it.Gotta get that ten outta ten!System.exit(0) || return 0; //Whichever you prefer.

												I don't know how Supergiant does it. I really don't. They make a game that shares so many traits with Bastion, so it starts out feeling familiar and it reminds you how good Bastion is. Then they end up turning out a completely unique game with its own mechanics, atmosphere, pacing, you name it. I adore Bastion, and Transistor, I think, is right there on the same level. Top notch gameplay. Top notch narrative. Top notch music because Darren Korb is the man. Now I just want the next Supergiant game, especially if they keep turning out games like these.			"

												I didn't know what to expect going into this.  I'm not a fan of this kind of style, gameplay, etc etc.  So it's not something that I jumped into expecting to like it.  And I have to say that I'm surprised.  There is a story.  That you work out most of by yourself via the dialogue.  The combat is very strategic, which is why I find myself dying often.  The music is beautiful.  And getting 'Red' to stop and hum to the music randomly takes up a lot of my time as well.  If you plan on getting this, get it with the soundtrack.  I'm still slowly but surely working my way through the game and I'm having a good time.A few things that annoy me is the lack of variety when it comes to fights.  Its strategic in the fact that you have to plan out how you fight or you'll end up losing or breaking your attacks ...which is super annoying but they're not gone for good.  Its not like you don't encounter anything new but they slowly/painfully add new monsters to fight as you go and it can sometimes just all blur together.  To sum it up:  Its an awesome game so far.  Gives an amazing story but at the same time leaves so much open for you to let your imagination roam.  Fun and stuff.			"

												This game pulled me in and didn't let me go. It throws you right into the action. The combat system took a little to understand, but eventually you figure out which are the most powerful combos as you slice and dice yourself a way through the baddies. The story can be a little confusing on the first play as there is no intro, but recursion mode (new game plus) had it all make a lot more sense. The game looks amazing and the soundtrack is superb. Controls are pretty intuitive. In short, the game is amazing and I hope Supergiant Games will continue to make unique experiences like this one and Bastion.			"

So that tells you two things: this is a short game, but it's also a very good one.The story is... not sparse, but there's a lot of background detail left for you to fill in, kind of like Dark Souls. Bastion was the same way, but this is even more so.The combat is enjoyable; you can go real-time, use the Turn() system to plan out all your attacks (but then be mostly unable to attack while Turn() recharges), or some mixture of both. The music is aces and I highly recommend buying the soundtrack.Overall, if you've played Bastion, this is more of the same, but that's not a bad thing at all.			"

												*** Spoiler alert ***Transistor is a beautiful game with amazing art direction, music and a unique combat system. However, the story, in my opinion, is what completely falls flat. The premise of a female singer who's lost her voice is interesting but the storytelling is too one-sided. I understand Red can't speak but that doesn't mean she's incapable of responding or showing any emotion. At the end, we see what resembles snapshots of Red's life with the mystery man in the Transistor which should have, in my opinion, happened at moments throughout the game instead. There's a lot more I could say about the plot being lackluster but honestly the rest of the game - art, music and combat - make up for what the story lacks, and is well worth a playthrough. That being said, I don't know if I could stand to play recursion and go through the motions of listening to that narrator again...			"

												I don't review many games, but Transistor, much like SuperGiant's previous title, Bastion, exceeded my expectations on all fronts.This game is a tremendously soulful piece of work, and from the very start to the very end, is first and foremost a work of art. The music, narration, artistic style and presentation flow together in a way that I would probably say outclasses almost any other game i've played. Anyone with a quibble of curiousity and a penchant for great games, or even works of art, should immediately purchase Transistor (AND Bastion) and enjoy the ride.To touch on the gameplay itself, the combat is inventive and blends several previously done elements (pseudo-turn based combat, action queues, tactical-execution-based combat) into a pretty seamless and enjoyable experience. It is two parts arcade, one part strategic pause-and-think game. It remains fresh and has a lot of room for player creativity due to the openly configurable nature of abilities acquired throughout the game.What follows are some brief pros/cons:Pros:+Incredible Art. From music to artwork, this entire game is a masterpiece.+Gameplay. The combat remains fresh, enjoyable, and creative all the way through.+Difficulty.  Like bastion, difficulty is born of modifiers you can apply to enemies, which give you bonuses for being brave.+Storyline.  Again, this is a work of art and the storyline is rich, heartfelt, and incredibly immersive.+Soundtrack.  Incredible, as usual.Cons:-Length.   The game itself isn't that long, although there are excuses to re-play the game with new conditions and toy around with the combat some more.That's really all I can see anyone really griping about with this game.In total, I'd give Transistor a 9.5/10, as one of the most absolutely awesome pieces of work i've seen in terms of gaming. It isn't a triple-A 40 hour experience... but it's an incredibly rich, artistic romp through an engaging and incredibly envisioned city of Cloudbank.9.5/10-Colt			"

												Transistor is a top-down, turn-based adventure game that takes place in a utopian society. The gameplay is very different from Bastion; in this game, all attacks are planned beforehand during each turn. This game is beautiful to look at and holds a beautiful story within.Pros:+From the music, to the voice acting, to the writing, to the art, this game is beautifully executed. I like the gameplay, but this is definitely a game you buy for the music, story and artwork.+The romance in this game felt genuine and believable to me.+The gameplay is entertaining; different ""functions"" (attacks) can be combined in a multitude of combinations, and there are multiple ways to win each battle.+Like Bastion, there is a new game plus mode where you can restart the game at a higher difficulty and continue levelling.+For those who like the battles, there are bonus challenges, similar to Bastion.Cons:-While planning your turn, you can't pan the screen to look at far away enemies. This is a minimal problem, as you can usually see far enough anyways, and you can also simply walk where you want to see and then cancel the move.This game took me ten hours to complete, but my girlfriend completed it in four hours, which I find amazing. I think most people will take at least six if not 7-8 hours.I really loved this game. While they don't have the big budget of a AAA company, Supergiant has managed to craft something that is both more unique and more impressive than most AAA games.			"

												Have you ever thought about playing with art? Well, if you're visiting this game's page, this is your chance to see how it feels like!First of all, this is no simple indie easy money score. You can see that there were hours spent on dedicated work, constructing this piece of art. I can start by telling you what you already know and what makes this game easy on your boring days, but, instead, I'll just skip to what makes it good and different.Imagine yourself playing a Neil Gaiman's graphic novel (storyline and arts), produced by a Blizzard (isometric gods) and Square Enix (turn based combat milestone) partnership. This gets close to the experience. You will never believe how awesome this game's battles are, until you actually play it. So many possibilities... very few enemy types though. And about the graphic/arts... there is so much to say about it. You may see a mix steam punk and futuristic sci-fi on the references. Gorgeous begin to describe... And the soundtrack?! Mesh up old club music with electronic beats and you get really impressive results!This game was born a classic. With so many uncreative work popping up every single day, this game only lacks more world wide publicity to get it amongst the great ones, where it belongs.			"

												I'll start out by saying - this game is amazing! Supergiant games yet again doesn't fail to deliver a game filled with praise-worthy content. Exellent soundtrack, high quality narrative and interesting game mechanics are but few things that will accompany you through the game. Thus said, the only thing that didn't leave me statisfied was the length of the game. It's quite short, yet replayable a little, since you'll not be able to unlock everything in just one completed campaign. Sooo..Definitely recomended!			"

												Transistor is a gorgeous game with an absolutely stunning soundtrack. You play Red, a beloved singer whose voice and boyfriend were stolen by the mysterious Camerata. You spend the game on a quest to find vengence for your slain lover by battling enemies called the Process.Issues with the game The story was a bit confusing. You never really learn why you were targetted by the Camerata, what the Process are, or how any of this really fits into the world. You can glean bits of the background story by finding hidden computer terminals around the world and by changing up your attacks and powerups, but nothing really explains why these things exist. There were a couple instances where the enemies didn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about you as long as you didn't attack them, and it never explained why. Those few cases happened in the last third of the game, perhaps it's because you were better learning how to control the Transistor (the item that controlled them)? The computer themed enemies and attacks were interesting, but I'm not entirely sure how well it fit in with what was happening. Sure, your sword is called the ""Transistor"", but that really seemed to be the only thing that sort of tied in this computer world with the real world. I didn't have a controller at my disposal, so I'm not sure how well the controls work with that, but when I was wandering around the world with my keyboard/mouse, movement felt a little clunky.Best parts of the game The soundtrack. I love this music and highly recommend anyone pick up the soundtrack along with it. If you don't wish to pay for it on steam, the album is available on Spotify. I only wish they made the music an even bigger part of the game. The game took me aproximately 5 hours to complete. I'm not a big single-player fan, and this was just short enough for me to keep excited about it. The sword-based narrarator, coupled with the music, really made me feel invested in the story and emotionally attached to Red.I purchased the game on sale ($4.99 USD), and it was definitely worth twice that price. The normal price ($19.99) is probably a bit more than I would spend on a game like this though. Wait for it to be on sale and then 100% buy it. "

												I really love this game, the story was intrguing, the atmospere and art was amazing, and i found the combot to be very innovative, and thanks to the limiters and enemies that get more and more difficult, the gameplay stayed diverse and it really felt like my actions mattered. All that being said, i felt that the story was a bit short, and the character development was a bit lacking. i also would have liked a little more info about the world, because i feel that the short story would have been ok if i at least had lore to keep me entertained. Also, i just wish that there where more agency tests/battles agains other enemies with turn. That was hands down my favorite thing about the game, but i just wish there was more. However, i still find the game to be incredebly enjoyable, despite this, and if you are only going to do an incursion or 2, i think that all of these things can be overlooked. Great game overall, love the soundtrack, and im looking foreward to more games like this!			"

												Transistor is one of my favorite games. It provides a unique blend of Diablo-style kiting with Dragon Age Origins active pause battle mechanics, presented in a dreamy, futuristic world that takes cues from the Impressionism movement. Character customization is wonderfully addictive. You get multiple ability chips. Each of these chips can be used as an active ability, a passive ability, or a modifier for another active ability. Essentially, there are so many ways to build your character that you will not be able to resist spending a dozen hours experimenting with different builds. However, I must say that the strongest feature of this game is its instantly lovable main character, the singer Red who lost her voice and her talking sword, the Transistor. The soundtrack will also mark this game forever in your memory. Some might criticize this game as full of plot holes because it does not really attempt to explain everything. Rather, it draws you into a general dream-like feeling. And it does so masterfully. This is a short game, but it is a glorious.			"

												I just finished this game, and I'm sad to have to see it end. It was a truly fantastic game, on par if not better in its own way than Bastion. The story interested me and held my attention throughout, especially with the way it tells itself through the narration and environment. The music and art style were absolutely beautiful as I'm sure you will hear many people say. The combat felt fresh to me, easy to get a grip on but nothing I've ever really seen before.The only nitpicks I have with the game are: A) The boss fights are dreadfully easy once you get a hang of the game.B) There is a certain enemy type towards the end of the game that felt really cheap to me (though that may just be because I was worse at the game than I thought).C) I'm not sure how I came under the impression, but I thought ""Recursion Mode"" (New Game+) would include extra story elements or different dialogue in certain areas. After a bit of research after finishing the game, I discovered it was nearly all enemy layouts and enemy difficulty and such, much to my dismay. Though if you're into the combat, I suppose that's not really a negative.D) My game crashed. Once. In a challenge map. Before it began. After the game saved. No biggy, but something to watch out for.Overall, absolutely amazing game that will stick with me for a while, and may very well become one of my favourite games. I whole-heartedly recommend buying it, especially if you enjoyed Bastion. Even if you didn't, buy it anyways, Supergiant deserves all of your money.10/10 would bang, play, finish, get upset by, reason with myself so I stop getting upset by and then write a review that got way longer than I intended again.

												Bastion is an easy and accurate point of comparison for Transistor; if you like one, you'll probably like the other. But the gameplay here is a lot deeper and richer, so it's worth a look even if you didn't care for Supergiant's previous effort.Similar to Bastion, the story is simple but beautifully presented. The futuristic/maybe-computerized city of Cloudbank is a visually lush setting for monster bashing, and the snippets you find and decipher throughout the game paint a unique portrait of the city's history and the villain's motivations. It's easy to get drawn in, even if, from a player's perspective, you're just running around murdering everything in your path.It probably helps that your rampaging is so enjoyable. Combat is real-time, but you can periodically freeze time to cue up a string of commands as if it were turn-based. That combined with the incredibly flexible system of combining your power-ups into increasingly elaborate attacks opens up a tremendous number of options, both on-the-fly and in terms of your overall playstyle. Want to kite around and chip away at range? You can spec for that. Want to play fully real-time as a bruiser? Sure. Want to mind control everyone into killing each other? Go for it. Run around unleashing monster turn-based combos whenever you can? Yessir.If anything, the biggest problem is that the mechanics are SO flexible that it gets daunting. Thankfully, there are a handful of mechanics that guide you towards new combinations (avoiding the Diablo 3 ""here is a new option that you have no reason to care about"" issue) and, like Bastion, the game's difficulty is rather forgiving but has options for you to increase it on the fly.But bottom line, this is beautiful, enjoyable, and distinct experience that doesn't overstay its welcome. Highly recommended.			"

												Transistior is a game that follows suit to many others before it.  It brings me back to the first Devil May Cry, and shows me that I still enjoy this styl of game.  Fighting does take some careful planning as the game progresses, and the storyline is a bit undeveloped, being something of love and revenge, but not anything further than that.  The soundtrack is A+ in my books and the art follows suit as well.  As for the gameplay, everything is easy to use and cutsomization is good.  Other than that after 8.6 hours I beat the game.Recommended, but not an amazing game.6/10			"

Full disclosure:This review was written pretty much hot off the presses of finishing the game, and as such everything below is expressive of my raw impressions of the game after completion. Let that say what it will of the quality of my review.--------------------------------------------Supergiant Games has hit the ball out of the park yet again with their second game. As I've made apparent, I liked Bastion, but this game is substantially different from Bastion in many ways. So if you didn't like Bastion (I hope you at least liked the music and narration), don't let that put you off of Transistor. How is Transistor different from Bastion, you might ask? The combat is entirely different, replacing a weapon-based combat system with an ability-based system with impressive depth. As you proceed through the game, you gain new abilities either through leveling up or encountering certain points, and each of these abilities is equipped in one of four slots (1-4 are their hotkeys). However, each of these slots has one open subslot and an additional unlockable subslot, and beside the four base slots, are two slots on each side that are passive slots. As I said, very impressive depth, because each ability operates differently based on whether it's equipped primarily (in the four slots), complementarily (in one of the eight subslots), or supplementarily (in one of four passive slots). The world is likewise in its differences. You're no longer in a fantasy-esque setting in Transistor, and you don't have to worry about falling off floating platforms anymore. You're grounded, but in a world as far out there as Bastion's. It's a fascinating modern, sci-fi styled world full of mysteries to try to grapple with, not unlike Bastion. Yet, these mysteries aren't resolved like Bastion's, not laid out for you by anyone. If you want to understand Cloudbank, you're gonna have to get digging for yourself. Fortunately, you'll probably want to after exploring the place and its characters.The cast is as dynamic as Bastion's, if not more so. There's more detailed background on the much larger casting this time around, and there's more chatter occurring. This isn't to say you're frequently stopped for conversations and the like, you're definitely not, and all the background is entirely optional to look into. You can play the game ignoring the characters as much as you like, and still enjoy it as much as if you were to pay attention, much as in Supergiant's previous title.The music is as vibrant as ever in this game. It's also as vital to the atmosphere as in Bastion, and while there are equally energetic tracks in Transistor's soundtrack as in Bastion, it's of a very different styling. It's softer, of an electronic jazz vibe, compared to some of Bastion's harder, folksy tunes. If you didn't enjoy Bastion's soundtrack, don't worry, Darren Korb has outdone himself in making Transistor's soundtrack distinct from Bastion's, something you can't necessarily say for many musicians.The story is fantastic...If you don't mind a story that won't hold your hand. The plot will keep you moving forward to figure out what happened to Red, as well as who acted against her and why, but perhaps even more compelling than that is understanding the world she lives in. Every part of the story from the characters to the setting to what led up to your adventure is a mystery for you to solve, and personally, I loved that. Even after having finished the game, I have questions, and I doubt there are answers, but I like being left with room to imagine on top of their world.If you don't like that, you may not enjoy it, but there's so much more to the game than that to enjoy if you can look past your discomfort with it. The gameplay and music and art are all lovely to experience and behold.The artwork is of a different stripe than Bastion's. It's a mixture of darkness and brightness, in a bit of contrast to Bastion's primarily bright, varied color palette. Transistor has a harsher, darker color scheme, seemingly set mostly at night, but is broken up by bright lights throughout and a transition into a lighter color scheme as the game proceeds. This isn't dark grays accompanied by muddy browns as seen in other games by any stretch of the imagination, but it is something of a darker color scheme if you're coming from Bastion. Not to mention it's also in an urban setting with more futuristic and interestingly styled buildings. That also serves to differentiate the artwork drastically in its own right, having you ascending stairs along the edge of towering structures and taking elevators here and there amidst buildings serves as a different experience than Bastion would have you expecting.Conclusion: If you're looking for a unique scifi styled game with a complex cast of characters with splendid voice acting, music, gameplay,  and artwork, you can't find much better than Transistor right now. Frankly, if you have to decide between this and Watch Dogs, coming out tomorrow as of this writing, I'd say save your money and buy this. While I have nothing against Watch Dogs and intend to get it myself, I think you'll find a far more compelling experience in Transistor, in essentially every way.Thanks for reading! I hope this helped inform you of the game, and led you to pick it up. It's absolutely worth it.			"

												I feel comfortable using the phrase ""Art Game"" to describe Transistor.The holistic experience of the graphics, sound, and gameplay is superb. The almost-a-puzzle-game battle system is challenging, but the slowly unfolding storyline motivates you to keep moving forward. Play this game if you like games that push video games forward as a viable medium for artistic expression.			"

												Gorgeous Artwork, amazing soundtrack, intriguing combat system and good use of isometric perspective, if the game was only about that it would have been a undoubtedly masterpiece. But when it comes to the plot it is far too vague.Don't get me wrong, I like being thrown in medias res and struggling to understand the situation piece by piece but on this game they got a bit too far: you don't know where you are and more importantly which are your world ""rules"" (more or less like in physics rules). Not knowing the ""limits"" of your surroundings you can't empathize with the main characters and their story, you don't know who they are and what is their role in the world either (again, because you don't know what is the world you're playing your part in).So, well, with a little bit more knowledge about the world (not the ""politics"" that you can read on the terminals) I'd have been able to empathize with the main characters and understand the plot completely.I also like to spend a few words on the combat system itself. I don't know if something like that already existed, but, well, the hybrid turn/real-time combat system was amazing. You have to both plan your turn() and the time before the next turn(). Seldom being off-turn is better for strategic reasons and you have to take in considerations that too.Finally, there are no ninja-spawns you cannot react to (hello Valkyria Chronicles and partly XCOM: Enemy Unknown) meaning that you never feel like the game is not fair.So, in my opinion, if you approach this game as a multimedia artbook you will enjoy it from start, far, far more than expecting something from the plot or trying to understand the cyberpunk-art-deco world you're thrown in.Recommended to art-lovers and romantics.

												I played Bastion a couple months ago and I really enjoyed the story, the beautiful art and the soundtrack. I was super attatched! SuperGiant Games came back and wowed me again when I finally was able to buy Transistor last week.I just finished Transistor last night, and I was an emotional wreck. This game to me was, and is still estonishing. The artwork is absolutely gorgeous, thanks Jen Zee. And Ashley Barrett coming back with her amazing vocals is just breathtaking. I am obsessed with the OST. The story is also so unique, just like Bastion's. Which I love love love. And the tacticts of the game are pretty unique as well. You also become really attached to the main characters as the story goes along.I can't wait to go back and sooner or later and play it again! <3			"

												This game.. is amazing. Ok, so what I will tell you is purely 100% based on my own experience.EDIT: I now officially own this beautiful game :DFirst part of the game is very confusing and a let down for me to see ""RED"" dragging the greatsword, for I don't like to see anyone dragging a greatsword.Moreover, RED can't swing the greatsword! she stab the ground with it and I speak to myself. THEY ACTUALLY GAVE THIS GAME 9+ RATING?! THIS CAN'T BE!then.. I was wrong, I try to overcome that and not for long, I see the beauty of Transistor as the game became easier and understandable every single chapter.Pros:- Very nice settings- Nice story line / plot- The combat system.. makes you crave for more combats when you're at middle / late game- Very original gameplay- The soundtrack.. omg.. the first time I heard Red sings The Spine. I instantly go to steam layer website and search youtube for it and hear it for 1 hours straight.Cons:- (This shouldn't be considered as cons but..) Rather depressing feeling coz you're (most of the time) alone- Red dragging the transistor ( still shouldn't be considered as cons)yep.. no Cons tbh.overall 9.8/10			"

												Transistor starts off as if it cares more about style rather than substance, perhaps overly pretentious and smug. However, giving it a chance reveals engaging and deep gameplay and slowly building up an interesting world through continuous narration. Transistor may not be a sprawling epic that will last you weeks. However, if you enjoy short, well-crafted experiences, Transistor will definitely be something you should look into. Clean art direction, a great soundtrack, varied gameplay and an interesting world makes for a short, but stylish package.			"

However, the fact that it could rope in someone as jaded as me and not let go until the very end is what makes this game a 10/10 for me.			"

												As I've expected, Supergiant Games has done it again: A beautifully crafted masterpiece of an indie game. Good soundtrack? Check. Logan Cunningham providing yet another good voice for a character? Check. Story and combat to keep you glued to your screen? Check. My only gripe? The short, yet sweet storyline. Lasting for only around 4-6 hours, it's quite an enjoyable experience albeit short and slightly expensive (although I consider that $20 paid for itself). I suggest getting it on sale for a lower price, but even with a high pricetag it's well worth it on its own. If you want to support the devs even more, grab the soundtrack. It's amazing.Final Verdict: Solid 8.5/10. It has its rough edges and it's obviously not a perfect game. It, however, is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing so grab it anyway.			"

												This is honestly one of the best games I have played in a very long time (Since Bastion). I think the problem that most people are seeing is that they wanted a Bastion 2, instead they got a completly diffrent game. The gameplay is fun to learn and use well, as if you make a mistake you're punished for it. Darren Korb has outdone himself, and Ashley Barrett has the voice of a goddess. Another problem people see is that you have to find the story for yourself. You can't just walk through everything and have the story layed out for you, you have to try new weapons and combinations, you have to search every alley, and even if it's only for a little remark made by the Transistor, it helps bring the world together. I can see how the game isn't for everyone, some people don't want to explore just for tiny remarks, or read about how the Antagonists chose certan people to make ""disappear"" and why those people were chosen. This game isn't a new Bastion, not by a longshot. Once you realize and accept that then the game really shows it's true colors. I would reccomend this game to almost everyone, but explain what kind of game it is.TL;DR: The music is a treat. The gameplay is a treat. The art is a treat. Anyone with half a brain would give this game a try.			"

												This game is beautiful. The visuals are so breath taking you want to screenshot the entire game. The story line is intriguing and is build in a similar fashion to Bastion. That is, as you go along you understand more and more until things begin to click. There did seem to be a lack of tutorial however, it makes you engaged to figure out things on your own. You discover what items and abilitys do, and how you get them, each with a unique story, ultimately adding to your discovery of the story line. The gameplay is increadibly unique and fluid, with a fair amount of stratagy laid in to it. The shear number of ability combinations is stagering, with each ability having a attack, amplifier, or passive trait depending on where it is socketed.I would recommend this game, whether it is for the unique combat, amazing visuals, or intriguing story. 10/10			"

												TL;DR: Transistor is a good game, and it will make you feel good.Transistor is a narrative-driven turn-based game that always seemed to be reminding me of the Tron universe. It's in the middle of an apocalypse, yet it has an eerie peacefulness about it. As you go about the world and destroy the monsters that are transforming the world, you can't help but take a step back and listen to the protaganist Red hum along to the background music, or look out over a pier for a few seconds and think about the history of a town you never knew. Something about this game calms you down. All of the mechanics seem to cater to a casual playstyle, although some moments can be very intense. Even the fast and reflexive combat system seems to be designed to make you breathe. You can take as much time as you want to plan out your moves, take a breather, take a break from the loud fighting music and explosions that are happening around you. It's calming.Of course, there's the narrator. The more I play games with great narrators like The Stanley Parable or Bastion (the latter of which was the same creator of Transistor). The narrator of Transistor is more personal than the two, though. It addresses the character, not the player. You are simply an observer to this story, and the narrator is unaware of your existence. This game is between Red and her love. You are granted the gift of watching. It's very touching and emotional at some points to realize that this story has to end somehow, and the few moments where the narrator leaves you feel so void and wrong. I'm not really sure what to say about the narration in this game, other than it's not really narration at all. There's just only one character with dialogue.As I said, everything in this game seems to be designed to make you feel calm and content. As evil and chaotic as some parts of this game are, all of it makes you feel reflective, nostalgiac almost. It's a good feeling. This game will make you feel good. It's a pity that I can't think of eloquent enough words to describe this game. Maybe it's because there's a woman screaming nonsense in the other room and I can't process thoughts (sorry if parts of this review don't make sense, but I honestly can't hear myself think), but I think mostly it's because when you find something that is truly beautiful, it doesn't take well to words, and although I wouldn't say this game is pure beauty and art, it is beautiful, and it is deliberate in its design. That's all I ask from a game.			"

												This game was a phenomenal experience from beginning to end. (Ignore my hours played - I completed it on PS4 instead.)The storytelling is nuanced and integrated in such as way as to directly challenge your combat abilities and encourage you to attempt new combinations of skills. The music is a constant companion and, when coupled with Red's humming, turns the gameplay into something transcendental.The tiny touches - such as certain in-game actions included for no reason other than to deepen characterisation - are really what make this game stand out for me. Theirs is a romance I won't be forgetting anytime soon, and one I can't recommend highly enough.			"

												It's a top-down action RPG with a component of strategy worked in. The game has a theme centralized around a digital/electrical world where elements of technology take on a different form. This game is very artsy fartsy and stylistic. This isn't necessarily a bad thing depending on your tastes. This was created by Supergiant Games who are the guys who brought you Bastion. Similar to Bastion, there is a voice that speaks to you throughout the game. However, In this game the voice is an involved character and doesn't act as a narrator. Your character brings down evil processes, leveling up and gaining new functions. These functions can be combined in many unique ways to give you customized abilities, (hopefully) making you stronger. The combat can be paused to plan actions, but you are vulnerable when your turn is recharging. Limiters can be applied to create a challenge for yourself. I recommend this game, though it isn't very long.			"

												Awesome little gem.As good as Bastion was and probably better. Great artstyle, great music, interesting non-intrusive story well integrated in the gameplay and original gameplay.The only ""but"" is that it is quite short and the replay value is not that high imho . Yes, the game itself becomes more of a challenge and that may interest some of you but I play this sort of games mainly to enjoy the story and there is nothing new there.I don't buy much games at day one price nowadays, but I did buy transistor as soon as it came out and I dont regret it one bit.

												6/10This game was made by the makers of Bastion, so I had my hopes up. Sadly, while the graphic style and music is gorgeous, the story and gameplay are lacking cohesion. Similar to Bastion the action is controlled from isometric view and has lots of action rpg elements. There is real time combat and a turn mode, which stops the action and allows you to plan moves, which are then executed. Combat in real time is clunky, as the enemies move much to fast to evade, which forces the player into the turn mode. Consequently the game forces hit and run tactics. Stop the action, move close to the enemy, hit him with a few spells and run out of range. Rinse and repeat.One of the few good things about combat is the endless combinations of skills you can use. Each of the skills can be used as primary or enhancer of another skill. Sadly, you will end up using the 1-3 heavy hitting spells, without ever experimenting too much.All in all the developers did not succeed making this a cohesive game. Graphics and sound are great, gameplay and story telling are lacking. So you find yourself walking down pretty hallways without ever caring about the enemies you kill or knowing what exactly happened in this dystopian world.			"

												I can't recommend this game more - SuperGiant has combined fantastic story telling, wonderful characters, beautiful graphics, and spectacular music (really, buy the soundtrack too along with the game). It's a short story - realistically you can sit down and finish it in a single day - but like Bastion, it's an emotional touching story and the game has excellent replayability.  Transistor has easily become one of my absolute favorite games.			"

												Action RPG with turn-based element. In the same vein as Bastion. Gameplay is where this game shines and all the skill combinations are fun to play with.Music and artwork was sick, but the story was kinda meh. Narration was pretty cheesy, definite step back from Bastion.Still worth playing.			"

												Great game, SuperGiant really knows what they are doing.  This game runs on the same engine as Bastion, but is very different in several regards.  The combat system is more complex and there is little to no handleholding.  You are encouraged to try different combinations of Functions (skills/abilites) to find what suits you best. The story very good, but is not told nearly as direct as Bastion.  SuperGiant said they were experimenting with new narrative techniques, the best comparison I could use is that the story unforlds like unpealing the layers of an onion.  Here again, the player is given some control over how much of the story they want to delve into.  The ending was also very thought provoking IMO, and overall I think SuperGiant really did a good job here.  I would say this game is at least on par with Bastion.  If you (like me) really enjoyed Bastion then this is a solid choice.Definitely pick it up - 9/10			"

												Transistor is a unique game to say the least. It expects the player to dig into its world and find the story for themselves, from reading skill descriptions to finding the terminals hidden in the nooks and crannies of the world. Super Giant flexes it's art muscles again and delivers some of the best 2D artwork in a game. It is truly a piece of art in motion. In addition to the top notch visuals, Transistor boasts one of the best gaming soundtracks. I find myself listening to the cd over and over while at work. The combat is a unique blend of strategy and an action game where the player can freeze time and plan out their attack on the ""Process"". As with Bastion, there are game modifiers that make this game tougher, making the need for this planning mode essential. I cannot praise this game enough. A run through of the story may be a brief 6 hours but it does not over stay its welcome and feels complete in almost every way. The game does not hold your hand and expects you as a player to dig into the world to get the most out of it.			"

												One of my current favorite games in a long time. The story is very well done and left me emotional by the end. I played through twice and it didn't get any less good the second time around. The combat system is well thought out and different from a lot of things, though it reminds me of the V.A.T.S. system from the Fallout series. 9/10 if only because there's a bug in my version that doesn't allow me to do all the sidequest things without the game freezing.

												Simply put, Transistor is beautiful. The soundtrack composed by Darren Korb buzzes with electric, jazzy energy. The painted artstyle, courtesy of Jen Zee, drenches protagonist Red's world of Cloudbank in a gorgeous Art Nouveau - meets - cyberpunk atmosphere. If you played Supergiant Games's spiritual predecessor Bastion, you'll recognize Rucks's silky-smooth narration as the voice within Red's attendant sword, the titular Transistor. If nothing else, the game has an irreversible sense of style - from the way the Transistor, the titular weapon, trails along the ground, to the novel option to hum in time with the background music. Mute though she may be, Red - and the player - leave their voices imprinted upon the Processed world.Gameplay is innovative, and expands upon the isometric action style that Bastion perfected. The core of Transistor's mechanics are various Functions that represent an in-game concept - breaching, crashing, even calling for help. These translate into active abilities - a damaging linear attack, a single-target disable, and the ability to summon a robotic helper, respectively - as well as traits used to modify functions- the ability to extend range of functions, addition of a disable utility to functions, and modifying the trait to spawn weak allies when an enemy is killed - and passive abilities that can be used to modify yourself, which, for the sake of length, will not be mentioned. Combat is also made more strategic by the Turn() ability, which, when activated, allows the player to go into a pseudo-""planning mode,"" halting battle and allowing the player to input a certain number of Functions and movements. Upon deactivation of the Turn(), Red activates all of the moves near-instantaneously, but is vulnerable and has most Functions disabled until the Turn() meter passively regenerates. Players can choose to either maximize their Turn() potential, packing their moveset with tons of burst and evasion Functions, choose to play it real-time using sustain and distraction Functions, or a mixture of the two.Story is intimately tied to gameplay, as leveling up, using Functions, and empowering the enemy Process with certain upgrades allow for greater fleshing out of the world - a storytelling device that encourages the player to experiment with different approaches to the game. It does, however, mean that the story suffers somewhat in terms of actual content - a speedrunning player will find the plot threads to be confusing and sparse. Once one unravels all the various story threads though, , a greater plot does begin to emerge from the tangled network of Cloudbank's world.  If any real criticism can exist for Transistor, it may be that it does not quite live up to Bastion, in terms of sheer narrative clarity. The characters, perhaps, never feel as fully realized as the Kid, Zia, or Zulf (though perhaps the incredible ending sequence will object.) But Transistor is its own subroutine, and to contradict a certain quote, when nothing changes, well - nothing changes.			"

												I went in wanting to love this game. I walked away only liking it. Transistor is beautifully rendered in terms of its' ""Tech Nouveau"" visuals and amazing music. With all of that going for it, the gameplay failed to grab me. For me, the 3/4 view seemed to block key obstacles when fighting or taking a ""turn"" and I found myself geting unintentionally hung up on objects in the environment. I understand the artistic reason for just throwing you into the gameplay, but I just didn't like being completely lost in terms of what the was going on for the first part of the game. The complexity of the gameplay needs a space more readliy available to practice and hone your skills. The ""backdoor"" areas were too far apart to be usefull at times. Towards the end of the game I felt myself just wanting it to be over and rushing through as much as I could. I felt story was a decent one but tends to get lost in the grand scheme of things. Supergiant's talent for providing amazing voice acting as part of it's game expirence is up front and center once again. All this being said, I still reccomend a playthrough. Transistor needs to be seen at least once.			"

												With a story that gives you enough for context, but begs you to dig deeper, a combat/leveling system that does the same, and gameplay that is unique (and yet feels strangely famiar); I cannot recommend Transistor enough. I've lost myself deeply in every aspect of the game, including the gorgeous art direction, that's as good or better than SuperGiant Games previous game Bastion. Transistor also has the unique honor of defining my favorite dedicated buttons ever: LB to hum and RB to Flourish (throw your sword, and catch it in a spinning jump, all while not breaking stride as you run about from point A to B). Sometimes it's the little things that please the most, and Transistor's full of things both big and small to love. <3			"

												TL;DR: Transistor is a good game, and it will make you feel good.Transistor is a narrative-driven turn-based game that always seemed to be reminding me of the Tron universe. It's in the middle of an apocalypse, yet it has an eerie peacefulness about it. As you go about the world and destroy the monsters that are transforming the world, you can't help but take a step back and listen to the protaganist Red hum along to the background music, or look out over a pier for a few seconds and think about the history of a town you never knew. Something about this game calms you down. All of the mechanics seem to cater to a casual playstyle, although some moments can be very intense. Even the fast and reflexive combat system seems to be designed to make you breathe. You can take as much time as you want to plan out your moves, take a breather, take a break from the loud fighting music and explosions that are happening around you. It's calming.Of course, there's the narrator. The more I play games with great narrators like The Stanley Parable or Bastion (the latter of which was the same creator of Transistor). The narrator of Transistor is more personal than the two, though. It addresses the character, not the player. You are simply an observer to this story, and the narrator is unaware of your existence. This game is between Red and her love. You are granted the gift of watching. It's very touching and emotional at some points to realize that this story has to end somehow, and the few moments where the narrator leaves you feel so void and wrong. I'm not really sure what to say about the narration in this game, other than it's not really narration at all. There's just only one character with dialogue.As I said, everything in this game seems to be designed to make you feel calm and content. As evil and chaotic as some parts of this game are, all of it makes you feel reflective, nostalgiac almost. It's a good feeling. This game will make you feel good. It's a pity that I can't think of eloquent enough words to describe this game. Maybe it's because there's a woman screaming nonsense in the other room and I can't process thoughts (sorry if parts of this review don't make sense, but I honestly can't hear myself think), but I think mostly it's because when you find something that is truly beautiful, it doesn't take well to words, and although I wouldn't say this game is pure beauty and art, it is beautiful, and it is deliberate in its design. That's all I ask from a game.			"

												It took a while for Transistor to really hook me (about 2/3 of the way through my first playthrough), but at that point I went from mildly disappointed (I really loved Supergiant's previous game, Bastion), to entirely satisfied.  I think the reason for all this is that the combat system is really quite deep, and it took a lot of experimentation before I really started understanding the potential there.  I'm playing it through a second time now and really enjoying it.Aside from the mechanics, the game is beautiful and the soundtrack is excellent.  The story is really intriguing and told in a very minimal way.   A lot of it is told through short voice clips, but if you want to learn more about what is happening, you can also get snipets of story through interacting with the environment, from experimenting with the combat system or from reading message boards :)  Even the way the soundtrack is done complements the story.  I didn't play Bastion on new game+ because I felt like I experienced the whole thing and was satisfied at the end.  I think Transistor essentially requires a second playthrough because there's so much subtle detail packed in that you are bound to miss a lot of it the first time through.  Transistor is a really excellent game, but it is especially rewarding if you are willing to put some effort in.			"

												Transistor is a top-down, turn-based adventure game that takes place in a utopian society. The gameplay is very different from Bastion; in this game, all attacks are planned beforehand during each turn. This game is beautiful to look at and holds a beautiful story within.Pros:+From the music, to the voice acting, to the writing, to the art, this game is beautifully executed. I like the gameplay, but this is definitely a game you buy for the music, story and artwork.+The romance in this game felt genuine and believable to me.+The gameplay is entertaining; different ""functions"" (attacks) can be combined in a multitude of combinations, and there are multiple ways to win each battle.+Like Bastion, there is a new game plus mode where you can restart the game at a higher difficulty and continue levelling.+For those who like the battles, there are bonus challenges, similar to Bastion.Cons:-While planning your turn, you can't pan the screen to look at far away enemies. This is a minimal problem, as you can usually see far enough anyways, and you can also simply walk where you want to see and then cancel the move.This game took me ten hours to complete, but my girlfriend completed it in four hours, which I find amazing. I think most people will take at least six if not 7-8 hours.I really loved this game. While they don't have the big budget of a AAA company, Supergiant has managed to craft something that is both more unique and more impressive than most AAA games.			"

												This game is absolutely beautiful, from the wonderful soundtrack that everyone is raving about (and for good reason), to the lighting, to the plot, it's just a wonderfully handcrafted piece of artwork.  This game proves that games are art, and highlights the importance of the subtle things in a game like the aforementioned aspects.  The combat can be both breakable and break you depending on how you react to it, there's definitely room for improvement on the combat but it's new and tried something different.  There is room to get perma-stuck if you're not careful, and your only option will be to start a new game which is frustrating.  Overall it was a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend it at full price, like purchasing a hand crafted painting for full price, the developers of this game deserve every penny for this masterpiece.  9/10			"

However, it's not just the art that makes this game great: it's the fact that every little feature blends together so well. It has great art combat etc. The game just works! I beat it once and I can definitely see myself beating it again.			"

												Couldn't be more pleased on art and music parts, they're as brilliant as bastion. The best part, though, is the battle planning feature and the skills, they're flawlessly brilliant. I think all RPG/Action RPG out there should have planning feature and skill system like used in Transistor.			"

												Transistor is a game that truly asks the player to think about both their actions in combat as well as their interpretation of the narrative. The game can be also be enjoyed without this effort, but after a blind first playthrough, the game truly comes alive on the second run when the player has heightened curiosity and a desire to experiment with the depth offered by the many combinations of combat abilities available. The soundtrack is also excellent, further heightening the atmosphere and sense of presence that the game has.			"

												This game. Reader, let me tell you about this game. This game captures... that something. It also captures your heart. From the very first moment, the moment the game thrusts you into its beautiful clutches, I couldn't help but melt in the embrace of the beauty that is this game. Visually, the game is striking, and captures all the little nuances. The way Red moves with the Transistor wrapped in her arms, the world slowly becoming different. The soundtrack is something to marvel at, and the tones of Logan Cunningham bring life into this grounding, personal story. Some say the game is a bit short, and yes, it doesn't give quite the same play time as you would expect out of a game such as a Bethesdian RPG. But that's okay. The game finishes itself before it overstays its welcome. The one true problem I had with this game was it felt like it fell just... just a bit short. It felt like it had potential to be something even more spectactular, even though it is easily Game of the Year material in my eyes. But don't let these small bumps deter you. I heartily recommend this game, to both fans of Bastion and otherwise. It has roots in Supergiant's last masterpiece, but makes itself a new name. A fun blend of genius combat, and a story that hits hard make Transistor a must play, with moments that take not only your breath away, but your voice. 10/10--R.			"

												Transistor.I honestly can't tell which one, Bastion or Transistor were more to my liking. Both have their awesome unique mechanics and stunning music.When you start the game, you don't have a main menu, instead you are put right into the game. This really took my by surprise. I think you'll understand what I mean once you launch the game.So, lets get on with it.The Plot: 10/10Just like in Bastion, you are thrown right into the game without any introduction. Just a gal with a sword-like object which apparently talks. First I had no idea what was talking to me. The further you go into the story, the more is revealed, along with the backstory of Red (the main character, the musician). Soon it appears that 4 villans, the Camerata, those who basically own the city Cloudbank. Not only that, they are mostly scientists who care for the city, but made a mistake, and... well, you'll find out.Gameplay: 9/10Bastion had a right-left-midbutton gameplay, while here you get abilities that you use. Not only that, it is also followed with Turn() feature, a planning feature that allows you to stop time and make actions like walking and using abilities for the price of Turn() potential (lets call it that). For instance, a Breach() ability (your very first ability you have access to) uses 20 Turn().Not only that, you get some introduction to different characters who these abilities belonged to. For example, Red's ability is Breach(), an ability that stuns the target and makes it more vulnerable for 1.6 secs. Another one was a racer, when you used the transistor to ""absorb"" his essence, you retrieved an ability that allows you to blink. Furthermore, you can read info on these abilities that reveal about the character.Each ability can also be used as a passive or an upgrade to a different abilities. They can be swapped at any time when you get to an access point.And of course, remember the Shrine in Bastion? Here you have so called ""Limiters"", they work exactly the same as those things in the Shrine, except they also reveal info on the ""Process"" if used.Music: 10/10I won't comment on this. No point.Visuals: 10/10Seriously, the visuals are just amazing. Some may complain tho, that they don't like cyberpunk stuff, but to me, the art in this is majestic. The lights, the sketches, everything deserves a 10 in my opinion.Duration: 7/10Sadly, its rather short, but if you play with limiters you may get a longer enjoyment from this. That's exactly what I did with Bastion. Yet Transistor is still shorter than Bastion. I really wish it either had a continuation or just a longer gameplay. That may ruin the plot however.Replayable? Yes, definitely. Its worth replaying. Unlike Bastion, you don't have to grind here to get levels (because you can't, lol).Overall:I really want to give it 10/10, but I can't. I honestly just can't. I want it to be a bit longer, I want to get more enjoyment, maybe have a reality where Process comes from, where I can destroy its core, where I can have some sort of a choice like in Half-Life at the very end, or... I don't know. I just feel the urge for this to be longer.So any way.9/10, I can't wait for Supergiant games to release a new game. Maybe soon, maybe later, maybe next year (I actually heard they are working on a new game to be released in 2017).TL;DR Transistor is awesome, has great music, gameplay mechanics and great plot. If you feel like you need a game that would allow you to relax and feel some enjoyment, then this is it. I am a Dota 2 player myself, and nothing relaxed me more than Bastion and Transistor (especially transistor, tbh). Go buy it.			"

												Super Giant Games had improved themselves after Bastion and created this outstanding piece of art. The artwork is stunningly beautiful, everything is flourished with colours. Moreover, they've changed the artstyle for the characters: from chibi-ish Bastion into a more realistic style. The soundtrack music blends perfectly with the game, it gives that futuristic cyberpunk atmosphere. Even in the song 'Sandbox', you can still here bleeps of machine, indicating it's some sort of an artificial environment. Super Giant Games is consistently giving the function to raise the difficulty level (Limiters) and also a wide range of play style just like Bastion.  The game is more of a tactical approach, but it also gives the option to go hack 'n slash/ beat'em up mode. The game is also more punishing by destroying a random Function everytime your health is depleted. Although the destroyed Function is recoverable, it might be a crucial one during that encounter. The storyline is a bit vague. Even if you listen closely to everyone, there are still questions remain. However, each of the side characters have been given surprisingly detailed  back stories, although they are not directly linked with the main storyline. Overall, this game is very much enjoyable: audibly, visually, and gameplay-wise. The only downside I had was the challenges and bosses, which I felt  are not as difficult as Bastion's.			"

												This game is absolutely beautiful, from the wonderful soundtrack that everyone is raving about (and for good reason), to the lighting, to the plot, it's just a wonderfully handcrafted piece of artwork.  This game proves that games are art, and highlights the importance of the subtle things in a game like the aforementioned aspects.  The combat can be both breakable and break you depending on how you react to it, there's definitely room for improvement on the combat but it's new and tried something different.  There is room to get perma-stuck if you're not careful, and your only option will be to start a new game which is frustrating.  Overall it was a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend it at full price, like purchasing a hand crafted painting for full price, the developers of this game deserve every penny for this masterpiece.  9/10			"

												Full disclosure: I got the game for free from the developers, as I am a fellow SF-based developer. I don't think that clouds my judgement, but you can decide for yourself.The combat is innovative and fun. It starts kind of slow, but once you start getting more and more functions and playing around with the various combinations, it becomes really satisfying. I enjoyed putting together new combos, both in upgrades and in execution order, to deal with the various enemy types. I also liked that the game takes away functions when you die once - this forced me to come up with even more new combos, which was still satisfying! I wanted to share my combos with my friends, such as my stun-cluster-dash. So cool.My only gripe with the combat is some of the enemies rely on being super-fast to get at you. This can get pretty annoying, especially when you don't have the dash function available. So, keep that dash handy.I enjoyed the story and atmosphere quite a bit, but I can understand that many would find it pretty vague and unsatisfying. It's never quite clear why things start out the way they did, and I guess some would be bothered by that. Whatever - I enjoy David Lynch movies, so I'm totally AOK with stories that are more about tone than concrete plot. And the tone is quite amazing in this game. The art, music, and dialog establish a juicy sci-fi-noir vibe that is a pleasure to indulge in.Overall, it starts out a bit slow, but it hooked me soon enough. And I can't wait to play it again in Recursion mode. I beat it once in under 4 hours, so it's a bit on the short side, but for $20 I think that's reasonable. Again, I didn't pay for the game myself, so I can't honestly say how I feel about its length. But I can say that the game doesn't drag itself out, which is important to me as a consumer.			"

												Bastion was a massive success for Super Giant Games. Most people have played it and numerous gamers own it on at least two different machines. With that in mind it would have been easy for the studio to release a sequel or spiritual successor to it. We’d all have played it, loved it, and raved about it. Transistor is not like Bastion.Starting in a beautifully depicted futuristic city scape you pull an electronic sword from a body and you’re on your way. No explanation is given and no background about the world or yourself is forthcoming. The player, like the character you control is thrown in, as if awakening from some strange dream and this gives a wonderful sense of mystery and discovery as you progress.From the outside this may look to share some similarities with Bastion. The perspective is the same and there is also a narrator of sorts, although he is talking to the female protagonist as you go. Right at the start you begin to think this is going to be another hack and slash but then about five minutes in it asks you to hit the freeze button and everything changes.Here, you suddenly realise you are actually in a real time/turn based cross over style RPG. You can execute attacks in real time (and even boost them to activate almost instantly), but the real trick is mastering the freeze system. Hitting the button stops everything and you then have an action bar you can use up before the enemy moves again. It’s kind of like the V.A.T.S system in Fallout 3 or the system at work in Vagrant Story.During this time you can move around and stack up attacks. Pressing the button again sends you into action like a blur across the screen. The downside is that you then can’t use any attacks or special moves until the bar has regenerated in full. The more attacks you use, the longer the bar takes to recharge. This means you have to be extremely careful about what you are doing as you are often slower than the enemy robots sent to stop you. It’s essential to get in, attack and get back out to a place you can safely recharge as avoiding damage otherwise is almost impossible and you’ll be downed in no time.If your health bar depletes while you have charge time you’ll get a chance to move away from danger. If not, one of your powers will be damaged and unusable until you make it to two save points. This severely limits your attacking options and often leads to a daisy chain effect of you losing all your powers and flat lining. On the off chance you are finding things too easy you can also add a number of handicaps as you go which increase difficulty and the amount of experience you gain.The options you have to play around with are numerous and can be set up in a ton of different ways. This is one of Transistors strengths but we can see it easily overwhelming some players. When you gain a power you can do one of three things with it. Equipping it in an active slot will allow the player to use it via a button press. This could be a long range attack, a fast dodge, an area effect attack or something like summoning a creature to assist you. All attacks have different speeds in real time combat and few of them work fast enough to run through the game hacking away without the freeze system. Each active power can also be boosted by equipping powers as support. For instance, you could take the bouncing bomb power and add it to your long range attack, thus making the attack ricochet off enemies and into others.  You can add two boosters to each active attack which opens up all sorts of crazy possibilities. Finally, you can add powers to your passive support slots. This means they normally do things like boost player speed or increase resistance. Any power can be assigned to any slot on any other power so finding the perfect combination will require some thought and the possibilities are just about endless. The only limit on what you can do is that each power takes up a certain number of points and once that hits maximum nothing else can be equipped.While you are getting used to the combat you’ll be experiencing some absolutely beautiful visuals. The Neo Noir tone of the game is offset by stunning, neon tinged environments full of small details and snippets of information about the world you’re exploring. It reminded us of an isometric Deus Ex or the SNES version of Shadowrun if the rundown world had been replaced with some kind of semi-utopian society. There are also a few pretty big nods to Final fantasy VII in there as well. It’s gorgeous and the musical score and sound effects also help to build a picture of a once perfect, now lonely world where something seems to have gone wrong very quickly.Overall, Transistor is a triumph of both style and design. It takes some getting used to and you’ll need a PC running comfortably above the minimum specs to get a smooth experience but Super Giant Games have tried something a little different here and it works. There’s the odd pacing issue and players will need to spend some time getting used to how the combat works but it’s a rich and rewarding experience and something that you’ll likely return to long in the future.Overall 9/10			"

OverviewTransistor is, the best way I can put it, an isometric, linear brawler with a heavy emphasis on story. It's much in the vein of Bastion, and, considering that the same company made Bastion, this is easy to see. One can skip this entire review by just realizing that if you enjoyed Bastion you would enjoy this; the narrator from Bastion even voices the Transistor.In the story, you play as Red, a well-known singer in the city of Cloudbank. You use a weapon, aptly named the Transistor, as the method of combat. The city is being overrun by a strange, robotic-seeming organism called the Process that overtake whatever they touch. In search of answers, the now-mute Red goes back into the city to search for answers (sound familiar?).The game is fought in real-time but also utilizes a unique combat system called Turn(). Essentially, time freezes and you have an opportunity to plan your moves. Every action you take reduces your opportunity to do additional attacks in Turn(), and when you execute it, you cannot attack (except if certain moves are upgraded) while it recharges.Around Cloudbank are two things: access stations and terminals. Terminals are optional and for additional insight into story, and access stations can be used to upgrade the Transistor and modify it. You have a set amount of ""memory"", and each different move takes up a certain amount. You can upgrade moves using other moves to give it different abilities, like area-of-affect or a temporary switch-sides mechanic. Finally, you can have passive effects. You start with 16 memory and can increase it as time goes on.But this review is getting lengthy, so I'll just cut it down a bit.ProsSimilar to Bastion, which is one of my favorite games of all timeSatisfying combatCaptivating storyEngrossing world that feels realConsCombat is limited by memoryGame is very short; only took four hours to finish on my first sitting (this is somewhat put off by the fact that I did no challenges)Gameplay does not match up to the standard that Bastion set (Transistor is considered Bastion's spiritual successor)No weapon variety; only the Transistor is usedUI can be hard to figure outEnemy mechanics must be learned, as they are not explained wellInconsistent difficulty; hard in some places, easy in othersDisappointing ending; though sentimental, it was lacking and felt rushedA bit too similar to Bastion; generic-named mute protagonist, same narrator, same style, and though it imitates Bastion it doesn't do so very wellSomewhat confusing story; in order to even understand it, I had to look up an external guideFinal VerdictTransistor is an okay game. Not as good as Bastion, but a good game. However, at $20, it simply isn't worth the price. If you want to buy Transistor, wait until it's on sale.I rate Transistor 6/10.			"

												Although kinda short, It has an amazing story. The combat was very well done and there were plenty of backstories to get into if you needed a break from the fast pased drive. The ending made me cry. :P I went back and paid extra money for the soundtract even though i could have just downloaded it off of youtube, because they deserve the extra money coming their way.			"

												Another great game by Supergiant, Transistor is set in an intriguing world where a singer named Red obtains a strange sword after losing her voice. The story, art, and music are amazing. The combat is enjoyable and the ability system allows for many possible variations. Bastion's idea of difficulty modifiers by invoking idols is translated into limitors which can be enabled at terminals.			"

												The art of this game is wonderful. (Characters. Areas. Songs. Story.) I will not elaborate further. I am sure others have.I do have a terminology quibble: a transistor is a switch controlled by voltage. Yes, it is the basic unit of a digital processor. No, you can't stab people with it, much less stash their soul in it.Nor, taken literally, should you be able to proc stun / charm / slow / vuln / knocked-into-air on them. Gameplay-wise, these are your basic tools. By artfully arranging them - some being cheaper than others, some affecting more enemies at once, some merely being available at the time - into useful combos, a pleasing variety arises.Although the variety of (largely useful) abilities is remarkable, their tradeoffs won't particularly matter (due to some powerful, spammable late-game abilities) unless you up the difficulty. The system for doing so is remarkably flexible - rules of combat can be turned to the enemy's favor, or you can step outside the campaign (which you should be replaying at this point anyways) to pit a semi-fixed loadout against (yet )a(nother) set configuration of enemies.Cloaking enemies (temporarily untargetable) are annoying for how they drag out fights, later on. Others, that boot you out of turn-planning, violate the premise of the game - the few encounters they participate in become mere button-spamming, converting tension to panic. This is the worst quibble I have with the game. (Except maybe for the name of its titular artifact.)In summary: A fascinating post-mortem of a city that deserved to live. (Deserves, even. I'm imagining an art deco / cyberpunk life simulator. It would be a lot of work.) Coupled with the important, RPG-y business of blowing things up in increasingly efficient, then increasingly roundabout ways.			"

												One of the best game i have ever played, period. I wish i could forget everything about it just so i could expereince it again.The gameplay is fun and creative, allowing players to switch between a fast paced hack-n-slash to a slow, more strategic pace. You can set powers you unlock as you play the game as actives, passives and even upgrades to existing powers, allowing a ridicoulous amount of versatilty in how you want to play, this also makes the game more replayable along with its new game+ mode.But what really got me was the style of the game, its mood, music, art style (oh my god the art is so beautiful) and deep story feels unlike any other experince i've had with a game, leaving me with a heart-wrenching feeling when it ended.Buy this game.

												Absolutely beautiful game.  The art, sound, and music are amazing.  The story is intriguing, though not as much is explained as I would like.  There are hints of deeper secrets in the game, but that is left to the imagination.The gameplay was odd at first, but once a few abilities are unlocked it becomes pretty good.  Each ability can serve three functions, which creates a lot of variety with many combos.  I liked the ""Turn"" system which makes the game more strategy oriented (especially compared to Bastion).  The game is pretty linear, consisting of progressing between arena-like areas, but the environments keep everything feeling new and fresh.I loved the writing.  Each ability comes with a character backstory that is unlocked by using each of the ability's functions.  Each time I got a new ability I quickly used each function just so I could read the fascinating backstories.Overall, this was a pretty good game.  I recommend it to anyone.			"

												I don't review many games, but Transistor, much like SuperGiant's previous title, Bastion, exceeded my expectations on all fronts.This game is a tremendously soulful piece of work, and from the very start to the very end, is first and foremost a work of art. The music, narration, artistic style and presentation flow together in a way that I would probably say outclasses almost any other game i've played. Anyone with a quibble of curiousity and a penchant for great games, or even works of art, should immediately purchase Transistor (AND Bastion) and enjoy the ride.To touch on the gameplay itself, the combat is inventive and blends several previously done elements (pseudo-turn based combat, action queues, tactical-execution-based combat) into a pretty seamless and enjoyable experience. It is two parts arcade, one part strategic pause-and-think game. It remains fresh and has a lot of room for player creativity due to the openly configurable nature of abilities acquired throughout the game.What follows are some brief pros/cons:Pros:+Incredible Art. From music to artwork, this entire game is a masterpiece.+Gameplay. The combat remains fresh, enjoyable, and creative all the way through.+Difficulty.  Like bastion, difficulty is born of modifiers you can apply to enemies, which give you bonuses for being brave.+Storyline.  Again, this is a work of art and the storyline is rich, heartfelt, and incredibly immersive.+Soundtrack.  Incredible, as usual.Cons:-Length.   The game itself isn't that long, although there are excuses to re-play the game with new conditions and toy around with the combat some more.That's really all I can see anyone really griping about with this game.In total, I'd give Transistor a 9.5/10, as one of the most absolutely awesome pieces of work i've seen in terms of gaming. It isn't a triple-A 40 hour experience... but it's an incredibly rich, artistic romp through an engaging and incredibly envisioned city of Cloudbank.9.5/10-Colt			"

												Interesting story/setting.  Combat plays more like a puzzle, with the puzzle being as hard as you decide to make it using optional settings (limiters) you gain through the game.  Single playthrough took me 8 hours, but you get the option for a NG+ that also changes the dialogue you experience the second time through; which gives another perspective on the narrative.  As expected from Supergiant, the art and soundtrack are excellent.  The game at times can feel like walking through the work of Gustav Klimt.  The soundtrack is a largely ambient set of aucoutic guitars and subtle electronic puncutated by vocal hums.  The game also features a couple full tracks with lovely lyrics.The negatives for me were related to the amount of menu activity.  Pieces of backstory and character information are hidden in skills you use, and using the skills in different ways unlocks more of that information.  In order to change how your skills are arranged (to use them differently), you have to visit a menu and shuffle things around between most combat sequences.  It's not a big deal, but slows down the feel of progression and the pace of your play.  It feels tedius.  Granted, you could skip the unlocking of this information and stick to a skill arrangement your comfortable with.  Additionally, some skill arrangements work better for some fights than others, and you don't have any way to predict what the next fight will be, so you usually have to fail the combat sequence to go readjust for the fight.When you're out of the menu's and fighting, you do appreciate the maleability of the skills.  Using any single skill as either an active, augmenting, or passive ability and over a dozen skills, you can create what feels like an endlessly diverse series of offensive arrangments.  Really cool.Overall, a very positive experience.  Definitely worth the $19.99 price tag on release.			"

												Transistor is a big and yet a small step from Bastion.There are certain things, which remain similar to it, but for the most part it's completely different.The themed music and fitting art style  is definitely the most similar to Bastion as they were done by the same people.So are the Function Upgradesystem in Transistor and the Item Upgradesystem in Bastion very similar, as both offer a lot of possibilities.There are also modifications to yourself or the enemies in Transistor, very similar to the Gods.But this is also where the similarities in those two games end, which is what most people don't see.Bastion is a Hack and Slash game, there much easier to jump in.Transistor is a ""semi turn-based"" RPG and I am putting it into qoutations for the simple reason, that Transistor needs to be played as a turn-based game AND a realtime game and even though it tries this very weird idea for gameplay, it works beautifully, once you fully grasped the idea of what you need to do.Transistor is not a game which will guide you at your hand. It very much wants you to learn almost everything on your own. It only tells you how to fight, how to use Turn(), how to upgrade and how to use limiters. So how a Upgrade actually affects a Function is for you to find out yourself.For example, once you use a Function during Turn(), it won't be active during the realtime section unless you have a certain upgrade on it, aside from a few certain functions. If you don't have any active Functions for the recharge phase of Turn(), you're not going to be able to do much and have to run away. If you only have active functions during your recharge phase, you can fight more, but you won't do a lot of damage. The goal is finding the sweet spot between those two, which the game itself provides more than enough practice for in the challenges.The overall story of the game is confusing, if you don't go and actively search for every little bit of extra information or fully unlock all bios, but if you do, you'll see how it all fits together. It's sadly only 5 hours long, if you do all that with a few limiters on and you won't get a full gameover either, at least I didn't experience one. Though I myself aren't to sure wether what I saw at the end of the game actually is the ending of the game, since it wants you to do a second playthrough.So to sum it up:Music: 5/5Art: 4/5, because pure white screens are annoying.Gameplay: 4/5, because it requires a lot of getting used to and experimention with abilities.Story: 3.5/5, because it makes sense, but only when you spend to time to unlock almost everything.Bastion vs Transistor: It's not comparable, since they are already gernes wise completely different games. So, people, please stop comparing these games. They, of course, do not play the same.			"

												I've been gaming for many years, and it's become very difficult to surprise and impress me.  Every once in a while, though, a game comes along that breaks the mold and offers a unique and refreshing experience.  After getting goosebumps during my encounter with the first boss, I knew that Transistor was one of those games.The enchanting music, surreal visuals, and captivating narration create a wonderful atmosphere for the story of Red, a popular singer who combats ""the process"" while wandering the enigmatic city of Cloudbank.  The satisfying gameplay is unlike anything I've ever experienced before:  a delicate yet harmonious balance of tactical planning and real-time combat.  Customizing Red's intricate skillset is particularly engaging and rewarding, and the player is permitted freedom to mix-and-match skills in a way that suits their own personal play style.In an age where video games are a dime a dozen, it can be so hard to spot the gems amidst the rubbish.  A good friend made this recommendation to me... Now I return the favor to you:  Do NOT miss this gem!			"

												I don't want to comment on the story as I could give something away. The game doesn't have a tutorial but it's not really a problem/disadvantage. As you progress & level up you can choose abilities also known as functions that have an active, upgrade & passive ability depending on how you equip these functions as well as combining with other functions provides a big pool of experimental fun. This mechanic reminds me of materia managment in Final Fantasy 7.My first playthrough took about 17 hours (your mileage may vary), most of it was experimenting with the functions, but on my second playthrough, which is new game plus was actually more fun than the first time because you carry over the functions from your first playthrough as well as re-earning duplicate functions which increases the gameplay/strategy element even further. You could obtain all the Steam achievement on two playthroughs if you an achievement achiever.Side note, you can obtain flac versions (as well as mp3 v0 and mp3 320) of the Transistor soundtrack at https://supergiantgames.bandcamp.com/album/transistor-original-soundtrackIf you purchased the original soundtrack from Bandcamp & want the extended soundtrack which is basically humming & a few instrumental versions of the original soundtrack contact SuperGiant games or alternatively buy the soundtrack on Steam which has both original & extended or listen on Youtube if you're curious before spending cash.If you've played Bastion, you'll will find transistioning to Transistor a lot of fun.

												The game looks pretty good and the soundtrack is outstanding. The combat is very interesting allowing you a very large variety in ways you can set up your skills and combine them to have various and unexpected (or expected) mechanics. The real-time combat is also complimented with a turn base system (reminiscent to Fallout 3's VATS system) where you can freeze time, plan a course of multiple actions and execute them in a blink of an eye chaining powerful moves together and complimenting their attributes to do some serious damage. The story is ok. Like Bastion, you're listening to a narrator who follows your actions on screen and, like Bastion, the world is falling apart and you are trying to undo or fix it whilst it gradually gets a bit clearer on what's happening although, like Bastion, it's never entirely clear and there are loose ends left up to the imagination to fill in.

												An excellent game all around. I found it quite challenging, in part due to its unusual combination of real-time and turn-based combat. There are no difficulty settings (beyond installing limiters to make battle more difficult and increase your XP), and there are very few trivial battles. The first real boss battle kicked my butt pretty hard, which I found somewhat refreshing and somewhat like I wanted to do an angry table flip on my computer desk (in a good way).The story is compelling and moves along at a good pace, yet still leaves a lot open to interpretation and mystery even right through the end. Having just the right dosage of unanswered questions is an excellent complement to the beautiful and eerie settings and visuals.If I have any complaints it's that it's a bit short, though the ""Recursion"" playthrough, in which you get to keep all of your earned levels and abilities and the enemies have been scaled to match, feature does give it some replay value. This is especially nice if, like me, you missed some of the dialogue you could have gotten by ""commenting"" on stories at the terminals.			"

												Transistor is an audio-visual masterpiece. Even if were to lack the the intriguing gameplay and narrative, I would still have loved this game sheerly for its look-and-feel. The art is just so good; I have never taken so many screenshots! The gameplay is fittingly unique: You obtain Functions, which can behave as an active skill, as an upgrade to another skill, or as a passive upgrade. Each Function is derived from a character in the narrative, and to learn all there is to learn about that person, you need to use the Function in all three ways. It encourages experimentation with the mechanics, which can bring surprising results, even if you've settled on a favourite combo. The narrative, subtle and minimalistic, is frankly heart-warming. The world building is outstanding, and I often found myself wanting to rent an apartment in High Rise. The narration doesn't work quite as well as it did in Bastion, but there's just so much more to this game to be bothered by it. Clocking in at around 8 hours for me, Transistor is a fine gaming experience that doesn't overstay its welcome. Protagonist Red may have lost her voice, but the game still spoke to me in a profound way.			"

												I loved this game so much I just didn't want it to end.It'd be too soon to see the day when all games have visuals/art that look this sublime, and a matching soundtrack that sounds so hauntingly beautiful that I'd go through the game all over again, just to hold the 'sing/hum' button. Transistor was such a relaxing game to play, but at the same time it was equally challenging (and interesting) too, as it kept things fresh by rewarding creativity, encouraging players to constantly change their style of play for every single encounter in the game. That being said however, Transistor caters to both the completionist and the casual player. Players who are willing to put in the effort and time to search every nook and cranny in the most remote corners of the game will be glad to know that the game rewards you with even more content to complement and enhance the overall story (equivalent to audio logs in Bioshock or emails/notes in Deus Ex:HR), whereas the more casual (or lazy) players won't be missing out on anything as none of these things are critical to the game's overall progression, and thus casual, or time-constrained players will be able to speed through the game with no problems other than missing out on part of the game's background lore (which can be retrieved via the internet/wikia/etc). TL;DR: Don't wait for a Steam sale to purchase Transistor; the price tag is almost equivalent to buying an average (read: AVERAGE) musical album out there, but this is a GAME that also has MUSIC that's so beautiful it's probably going to haunt you in your sleep (in a good way that is). You get 2 QUALITY things for the price of 1, what more could you ask for? I didn't even include the game's superb artwork in there, so you really get 3 things for the price of 1. Also, use headphones.			"

												The spiritual successor to Bastion, Transistor completely lives up to its predecessor. Being essentially, 'Sci-fi Bastion', Transistor retains the Action-RPG elements and the narrative storytelling. However, it does change it up, the narrator no longer being an omnipotent recollection of events, but rather an on-the-spot narration full of cheeky one-liners and references to the game's lore.You play as Red, a singer who has had her voice taken away, who wields a sword called the transistor. The transistor is essentially your all-knowing companion and weapon for the duration of the game. It houses 'traces' of other people which it then uses to generate 'functions', your attacks. With four slots for active functions, and each one having a base 'upgrade' slot of one, as well as general passive slots, the loadout customization is fairly extensive, and can lead to some fun, and very gimmicky builds, but ultimately gives you the freedom to build to your playstyle. Placing the functions and using them in different slots also reveals exposition and background regarding the original people that make up the function, inspiring the player to expermient and explore their options.The gameplay at first appears similar to Bastion's, an Isometric Action-RPG. However, they introduced a new concept that distinctly sets it apart. You can use a function called 'Turn()', where you go into a planning mode, and you can move around and plan a certain number of attacks, and then execute it, watching Red go into a frenzy and perform all of her planned tasks. This comes with its own risk/reward, as in doing so, it leaves you vulnerable and unable to attack for some time. You're given three extra chances until death, where each time your health runs out, a function is 'overloaded' and unavailable to be used for some time. This came as more of a drawback, as typically some highly valuable function was lost and I ended up just loading a previous save anyways. Either way, I found the combat to be intuitive and fun to experience, yet towards the end when I had my ideal build, easy and non-chalant.It's a game that can't help but be compared to Bastion, being almost so alike it in every way. Yet at the same time, it remains distant and evolved. Bastion pulled me along with its narration and its storyline, while Transistor had me exploring to pick up exposition and look for fights. Supergiant Games learned from Bastion, and they made a far superior game to a game that was already outstanding. What Bastion lacked, Transistor has.			"

												Superb! The game is a bit shorter than bastion if you don't count that it can be replayed in a higher difficulty. Even after finishing the first play through there is still some content to unlock. The story is great, the art style is stunning, the sountrack is fantastic and the narrator again is brilliant. The only flaw of the game is that it leaves you wanting more. This game is art, pure and simple. Kudos for SuperGiant games and thank you for supporting all platforms. I hope to see more games like this in the future.			"

												Transistor had blew me away. This was recommended by my friend because he told me that Supergiant, who also made Bastion, is developing this game. I did try Bastion but only in demo version. I liked the game Bastion so I decided to try their new game, Transistor.First off, the game's artistic like graphic had amazed me. I have not seen a game beautiful and artistic like this game (Maybe comparable to Bastion). The artistic graphic really set up the environment and atmosphere like no other game I have seen. The game is gorgeous to look at.Second, the ""Function"" system is quite unique (I meant the way you mix function to make even more powerful and unique function or ability). Maybe I have not played many games with complex combat skill system but so far, this function system is top notch. By mixing these function, you have many ways to destroy your enemy and start to make combo out of them. One unique mixed function I use is Bounce function with Spark and Flood upgrade. This upgraded function will bounce around crazy while leaving so many lines that damages your enemy over time. Overall there is so many ways to upgrade and use your functions to match with your play style and still have a lot of function combinations to explore.Third, the soundtrack. Arguably the best game soundtrack I have ever heard so far. The music really sets the atmosphere, it is soothing and sometimes intense when the situation has to be. But what is even better is that these soundtrack is still, even more enjoyable, by themselves. I have personally listen to most of the track while I was in ""Backdoor"" (A special room for you to take a break and try challenges which by the way, a really great way to take break and try different things) and I have stayed there for at least 10 minutes listening to their song. Ashely Barrett, the vocal, and Darren Korb did an amazing job on the sound track. The character and they story is also quite memorable. The main characters, Red and her transistor, have a very heartwarming relationship between each other. Their interaction is innocent and warm. I really liked these characters and the story really shows the growth of the relationship within these two. And lastly I loved the small lore within the function and limitation. I liked how you were required to use these function to their active, passive and upgrade slot to get more lore about the function's character. I really digged into the characters within the functions. They were intriguing, dramatic and sometimes epic. These side lore were very well done. There aren't many disadvantages that bothers me too much but there is a thing that I wished it was improved.One is the replayability and the duration of the game. I have beaten this game for first time within 4 to 5 hours. While it is an indie game and not all good stories have to be long, I kinda wished the story was a bit longer. Maybe I missed the game after finishing it because I loved it so much. This point is arguable to many different gamers out there but for me, I wished it could of gone a little longer around 6 hours.Overall I highly recommend this game for those who want a breathe of fresh air. This game contains great artistic graphic, amazing music, incredible story and character interaction and extraordinary combat system. I can say this game will blow most of gamers mind or at least be impressed with it.			"

												If ever you come across that common question of whether video games truly belong in the world of high art, along with the likes of time-immune paintings, masterpiece films and all-time hit singles, you only need to answer it with Transistor.To say that Transistor is a work of art is no exaggeration. The beautifully painted art style reminiscent of Supergiant Games' brilliant favourite, Bastion, go hand in hand with the lovely soundtrack by Darren Korb. Ashley Barrett lends her vocals to most of the soundtrack as the protagonist, Red's, singing voice while the gravelly voiced Logan Cunningham returns as Red's companion, a man stuck in a sword. Their story is one of hardship, as they fight a system off in the hopes of getting what was stolen from them back. This good story backs its visuals and audio to make it an attractive package.The drawback that most see in dedicating a game as art is the common mistake of letting the gameplay slide into abandon. Thankfully, Supergiant Games made sure that the game's mechanics is deep and enjoyful. The combat system is incredibly customizable and allows for versility. I was eager to try out as many combinations as possible to find one that suited my playstyle and I eventually found my favourite life-stealing spamming long shot laser that exploded upon contact. There is an alright amount of enemy variety, especially since enemies gain abilities as you progress through the story.In short, Transistor is not only brilliant to look at or listen to, its fun to play and has a story worth following. Sounds like the perfect package, right? Now, some have complained that the game is really short and not worth the full retail price. My first playthrough lasted 9 hours, since I took my time to explore both the wonderful science fiction world and the expansive combat options. One should know that the game comes with a New Game + option, known as Recursion where you retain your levels and combat options as you play through the story again. In this mode, the enemies are leveled according to yours to make this second playthrough a tough one. While this NG+ option is there to add to the game's worth, not many would want to play through a second round.I've been playing this for 15 hours so far and am halfway through my second playthrough, loving it all the same the second time. To me, this is a work of art, one I'll be recommending to many.			"

												Writing this before I start with NG+ ..As someone who loved Bastion; a game which I still need to 100% but haven't for good reason, I'm not surprised by how beautiful this game is.After completing the first playthrough, there's only one downside I can see. Even with fully exploring levels and listening to all the great and rather touching narrative, the story is pretty short and can be played through within 5 hours. But if anything, I think this game can get away with it because there's a good amount of replay value due to the 'function' mechanics. Not to mention, it does introduce a few new things in new game plus. NG+ / Recursion is a necessity for those seeking to 100% this game as well as playing around with all the different abilities, which I think is great because you may discovering awesome new combos and builds this way. For that matter, the content is built well enough to keep one occupied.For those who are not obsessed with achievements, the game offers more than enough in terms of story, visuals and sound. The artwork is drop dead gorgeous, it's like Bastion's except sci-fi to put it bluntly. If you break it down, the story isn't really unique or in any way complex, but it's the narration of it that makes it truly shine. ..also much like in Bastion. For me, I found the narrative in Transistor to be more stirring though I think it really depends on how susceptible you are to certain kinds of reading. Words can't describe on how beautiful and enthralling the music is, a more than fitting background that makes way for a remarkable and gorgeous experience for one and all.It goes without saying that every game's aspects are subject to personal opinion. But if you loved Bastion, you will love Transistor. In any other case, the game is a marvel on it's own and in my opinion, well worth it's price if not for the music alone.			"

												The main problem with Transistor is that it's almost, but not entirely, completely unlike Bastion.  The story is intriguing, the setting is enticing, and the combat is incredibly customizable, but every so often, I was struck by how similar to something in Bastion part of the game felt.  Supergiant did a good job distancing themselves from the ideas they had from their first game for the most part yet certain plot points and game aspects, like the narrator responding to the little things you do and telling the story that way made Transistor feel not quite as fresh as it could have been.  The similar art style and same voice actors certainly didn't help, but Supergiant is a small company, so that's understandable.  Besides, the game does look incredible.I want to mention the combat again, because it's stellar.  You enter a planning phase, stringing together attacks and movements and then executing them super fast in real time.  Afterwards, you have to dodge enemies' attacks and survive until you can enter your planning phase again.  I'm sure that's not unique, but the fact that your combat abilities are made up of various Functions(), each of which can serve as a primary attack, a secondary modifier, or a passive buff ability, allows you to modify your skill set in an unimaginable variety of ways.  You're even rewarded for switching up your playstyle, since using different Functions() in different ways unlocks backstory about aspects of the world.The enemies are refreshing, too, especially when they start to unlock more powerful abilities.  Fetch can go ♥♥♥♥ itself, though.  Those things is super overpowered and I hate fighting them.			"

												Finished it again and again. Pretty fun to come back and play through it again while forcing myself to use different loadouts. Great fusion of action points based planning with cooldown timer and real time action.(You get to activate a mode that freezes everything and allows you to plan moves, might not execute the way you want it exactly. Also a penalty of disabling all function use after activating said feature unless you have a modifier attached to a function. If you wonder what functions are, just think them as weapons you can use, and those weapons can also be used as a weapons modifier, tons of combinations to pummel everything in your way lul)			"

THE SWORD TALKS, GUYS. Gameplay mechanics are different for sure, and I love them - how gameplay mechanics depend on the choices you make as you level, the combat is incredibly well thought out, running through the game on a speed run or enjoying the plotline/story will feel rewarding.+ That replayability we've come to love and know from Supergiant.

For those who love lore, love reading, and love a vibrant and beautifully handcrafted world full of mysteries, this game is for you.

												Another excellent title by Supergiant Games. Ironically, this game is about as far from ""supergiant"" as you can get in size; if anyhing, it's a small but very flavorful morsel. The artwork and soundtrack are again, top-notch stuff, and make the experience enjoyable enough that some will find the game is carried well enough by those items alone. Transistor is again another isometric action platformer, following the design of Bastion. This time around, however, the weapons you collect can also be equipped as a passive self buff, or as an augment for another weapon. This effectively streamlines Bastion's way of doing things. I particularly enjoy the pseudocode trappings of it all, as that happens to be a part of my career (please take note, however, this is NOT a game in which you do anything remotely near actual coding; it is a game merely with coding references). Actual combat is particularly interesting for two reasons. The fist is you can effectively pause time, then queue up a string of movement and attacks, which will then be executed rapdily after exiting the ""bullet time."" This, however, is a gable, as you're unable to do naught but move while you wait for your action bar to recharge (using on ability you earn early on as an augment will allow you to use any one ability of your choosing even when your action bar is recharging, though). The other stand-out point in combat is that, instead of dying, what would initially be a game over will actually temporarily remove one of your four abilities from your weapon until you visit two different ""access points"" after combat has ended. This is a vaguely Dark Souls like feature, just instead of losing your xp, you lose a weapon you earn back after visiting two bonfires. While this does add challenge, it's more of a frustration than an unforgiving mechanic that simply punishes your own mistakes as a player.Still, I found it enjoyable, and it's short enough that you can quickly suck it up in an afternoon. As with Bastion, those who replay and perform every optional area will get the most out of the game, but it is by no means less complete is you simply play through once and enjoy. Excellent buy in my opinion.			"

												Transistor is a game that deserves more attention; charming in both gameplay and aesthetic, it should be pleasing to many.Gameplay integrates strategy into the action, allowing the player to flash through and take out enemies in how they see fit. Skills are also customizable, allowing for creative combinations that will suit the player's style. And for those who wish for more of a challenge, Limiters are eventually made available, increasing the threat the enemy poses in exchange for extra experience.The game has a wonderful atmosphere, with its beautifully crafted backgrounds, dynamic yet lonely colors, somber soundtrack (made even better with Red's humming), and the Transistor's dialogue adding to the futuristic setting and story of mystery, loneliness, and dread. The skills you obtain and use also have interesting biographies of their own; unlock and read them if interested.While it is short, Transistor is quite linear and exploration will reward the player with supplementary dialogue, information, or pointless surveys. Gameplay-wise, movement can be cumbersome due to its point-and-click format and the player will have to rely on the strategy mode a lot during combat, which may deter action gamers.As such, Transistor will most likely appeal to audiences who like strategy, aesthetic, and atmosphere. But as mentioned in the beginning, the game's charm is pleasing and should at least be tried out.			"

												Absolutely brilliant. The soundtrack, story and characters(as few as there were) could have made a visual novel all on its own but Transistor tops it all off by having an amazing and permutable battle system. Not even counting the special Turn() based strategic battling, the sheer number of choices, combinations and OPTIONS you have to battle is insanely staggering.You can pick 4 actives, 2 upgrades per active, and 4 passive abilities. With a total of 16 different choices to slot into any of those. The numbers seem 'small' but doing a bit of math on this and I realize I can't properly account for all the situations and duplicate abilities you can also have later on. Not only that, but the order of the abilities even matters for some cases, amplifying or accidentally nullifying what you're trying to do.The amount of ways you can tailor your skills, number in the hundred thousands, if not the millions and that's not even including your own personal playstyle, timing and strategies. This is a game that rivals many others in sheer options of battle choices while maintaining a subtle yet engaging storyline. I can honestly say I felt this game was a true masterpiece, battle, story, art, soundtrack, replayability. God damn.			"

												From the same people that brought you Bastion (which you should have played at least twice by now) comes Transistor. Beautiful music, gorgeous art, solid gameplay, incredibly deep story, and the outstanding voice acting that they've become known for makes Transistor another proud feather in Supergiant's hat.			"

												I think the Noire flavor and the intentionally opaque plot are a compliment to combat well refined. They took the standard of Bastion and elevated it to the next level, allowing freedom to compose your own style of battle. Along with the limited Turn Based mode to plan out an attack? It combines with the gorgeous art for a FUN game.And really, it is.			"

												""The river always finds the sea""Supergiant games they guys who made the beautful Bastion, are at it again. While Bastion had okay combat Transistor knocks it out of the ball park with some really cool yet different style of combat. You really don't see the combat in Transistor in any of game. The soundtrack of Transistor is just as good as Bastion. The only thing is it is very short. Only about 6-8 hours of gameplay which is shorter then Bastion. And as for the story, without any spoilers, it made me cry. The ending was simply beautiful. In the dark world that became of Cloundbank (the city in Transistor) the ending made you feel warm, happy and then you cried. Better then Bastion? The more I think about it the more I think it is. Both games are amazing and you should buy them both. Now I'm not a guy that works for video game review companys but I think this deserves a very high rating everywhere. So good.9.6/10			"

												I loved Bastion and I love this game even more.The narrative style is different but still present. The sound track is just as excellent as Bastion's if not more so. The art style is different but just as good. Everything you liked about Bastion is there and just as good, but different.Except the combat. The actual combat itself is brilliant and rewarding, with thousands of possible ability permutations and lacking the feeling that any one combination beats out the others. All the abilities are useful, all of them fun, and all of them let you tackle each fight in a variety of interesting ways.Some people have complained about the combat in this game, but their complaints are quite bluntly bewildering to me. While it does get increasingly challenging, and dying can be frustrating, I never had to redo any one fight more than twice, and the game autosaves often. I have not enjoyed a game this much in a very long time. It is exciting to even talk about. This is Game of the Year - or at the very least the Indie Game of the Year. For $20 you get around 9 hours of singleplayer content that is brilliantly designed, written, and narrated.For $10 you get a soundtrack that is around 1 hour, 9 minutes of excellent videogame soundtrack.In my opinion you do yourself a disservice not purchasing this game.

												If you played Bastion, then you should know what you're in for and, as such, can expect the same experience and be happy that you'll get an arguably better one from Transistor. If you haven't played Bastion, then continue reading.Transistor is right up there with Bastion in ""best games I've ever played"" for many of the same reasons as well; I'll start by discussing the gameplay itself. I played through the game using an Xbox360 Afterglow controller, and the controls are very intuitive and remappable in the options menu. Of course, the game can be played without a controller. In terms of difficulty, it's that comfortable difficulty that isn't easy but isn't frustratingly impossible; it's sometimes challenging, but it's nothing an average player shouldn't be able to handle. There are unlockable and completely optional ""limiters"" that make the game harder and give greater rewards from battle as a result. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock several different abilities that can be equipped in various ways, allowing you to find out for yourself which abilities and combat styles you personally prefer; there's no punishment for not using a certain ability, and (outside of the challenge rooms) you have complete freedom as to how you wish to tackle the many battles in the game.If I were to attempt to describe the combat mechanics, it'd be a turn-based real-time hybrid; you can attack in real-time (which is rather difficult, as most attacks have short start-up and ending cooldown animations), or you could take advantage of the Turn() function, which is the game's core combat mechanic. By activating Turn(), you essentially freeze time and are able to move and perform actions; when time is frozen, you don't actually perform the actions until time is unfrozen, in which you then proceed to wreak havoc on the enemies. However, after you use this, there's a set cooldown period where you cannot use any actions except for running around and evading enemy attacks until you can use Turn() again. It takes a little bit of getting used to and the game provides helpful tips at the top of the screen, as well as the first battle.As for the non-gameplay aspects, the pacing of the story in tandem with the narrative serves to keep the game entertaining and flowing smoothly. The plot develops the more you play, and you can unlock more information about character backstories by using different abilities in combat. The soundtrack is dynamic as it changes depending on the stage of battle. The entire game can be played in one long sitting (4~6 hours), but it auto-saves at each in-game terminal or whenever you enter a new area, so it's fine to play in short intervals if you don't have the time.For the record, I shouldn't even be able to run this game, as I don't meet the minimum requirements; however, turning down the resolution and a few other settings, I was able to play the game with an acceptable framerate with little to no issues. Of course, doing such things isn't good for my processor (pun intended).			"

I started the game again as soon as I finished it, I never do that..!  The combination of the different attacks you can do make for a varied gameplay and the art is just as amazing as it is imaginative. Easy to grasp in every way and you can crack up the battles almost as much as you like, so it's definitely a buy. I would even buy at full price because it's such a gem for me and I like to support developers that deserve their money if we want them to make more awesome game..!			"

												ProsNice graphics and music. Awesome voice acting . Nice ""artwork"" and ""feeling"" during the gameCreative and interesting skills systemFun and moderately challenging combatNice atmospere and good storyNo grindingCons Short playtimeNo multiple save slotsNo ""Sand box""No difficulty setting I would recommend the game to those who appreciate the good music and and nice graphics.The voice acting was well excuted and personally it was one of the best voice I heard in general , really soothing and deep voice. The atmospere of the game was also nice. These things made me engaged in game. However, I dont like the lenght of the game (1 story mode play would take Probably 3 - 6 hours for the most users) and sometimes I just lost where to go because basically no maps available. And too many ""discarding"" thing.What I meant the""discarding"" thing is that - basically you choose one of the things that you can get when you lev up.It can be skill A , skill B and more MEM or more skill upgrade slots something like that and you choose 1 of these choices.This is very fine and I really like the choice in the game. However , I found later that the choice is permanent and theres no ""Skill respec"" until the end , and no turning back even in ""new game+"". So basically , I missed almost half of the skills / choices and there was no way to just ""have fun"" with the skills I missed on sandbox or something . If they had one , I coudnt find it.(Edited later : I found that after after leveling up several times more, I do get the all the skills. so this is not true. No scratch from beginning option though)Speaking of skills and lev up stuff, the skill system is but quite interesting. It is really fun expermenting with these stuff. One ""element"" can be active skill and can be fuction as the passive skill and even upgrade other skills. It makes A LOT OF the skill set possible. It gives you a lot of choices, makes you think a lot , and makes you creative. And at least for the ""elements"" you have, you can change anytime you want on the check point (But no discarded elements) The combat can be played both real-time and ""turn based"" but i think the game meant to be played on turn based. But If you are real quick with the mircro and the planning stuff , I think you may be able to play on real time only. The problem about the combat thing is that there's no ""hard and easy mode"" on the game so you are stuck with the ""normal"" . Otherwise, the combat was fun and pretty nice. Slightly lack of diversity of the enemy but I would say good enough.7.5/10Overall , the game is quite memorable one , and it has some issues but most people would appreciate the game.Don't buy the game if you are looking for huge amount of playtime of the game.

												Reviewing this game without spoiling too much is difficult. I suppose that already spoils some things about the game, namely the fact that the overall ""feeling"" is always changing. There is no status quo. No settling into things. Enemies get harder with time, everything keeps changing, and it all works within the game's atmosphere.Many keep mentioning that ""if you liked Bastion, you'll like this game"". Now, that is true, but don't go thinking that this is just ""sci-fi Bastion"". Yes you once again find yourself as a nameless protagonist in an isometric world that's suffering through a highly unusual catastrophe. Logan Cunningham returns as the narrator with a voice so enjoyable you could listen to it read the phonebook. And of course, the soundtrack is amazing yet again and you should buy it.But what's different from Bastion? Well its no longer a hack-n-slash, I'm honestly not sure what to call its combat system aside from an odd mix of turn based strategy and real time strategy. The new combat system also forces you to constantly improve. Its a rare time when you feel like you have things totally under control, there is always a feeling of needing to improve, of needing to improve your own skills to keep up with the evolving enemies. I don't mean this as a feeling of being constantly overwhelmed, but more a feeling of always being just on the edge. The RPG elements are also greater, as opposed to Bastion's ""pick two weapons and a drink for your loadout"", there is now a large amount of variance to what you walk into battle with.Supergiant games as also improved on storytelling, at least in regards to including more speaking characters, and you will feel things about all of them. Be it hatred or sorrow or whatever else, the writing is very well done. Without spoiling anything, I think I liked Bastion more based on tone. I still greatly enjoyed Transistor and I highly reccommend you buy it and buy the soundtrack too.			"

												Another good game from Bastion creators Supergiant. Not without flaws though, and not up to the high bar the group set previously with Bastion. Combat is weighted too heavily on use of Turn() movements, and it is straight up impossible to beat the game in only real time combat, unlike what Supergiant said during events like PAX. The game is far more linear than it should be, with almost no splitting off. Additionally, you are given a lot of customization with how you use your skills, but it will always boil down to what does the most burst damage at the time, since you can only effectively fight in Turn(). As such, it has very little replayability, since there is not going to be any variance in order of area completion or how you play the game, unlike Bastion. Lastly, enemies to far, far too much damage, the other reason open combat outside of Turn() isn't feasible. After the halfway point of game, most enemies will take well over half your HP in one attack or combo, and the AI is exceptionally aggressive and tracks movement during thier shots.Despite all this negatively, the game is still good. Art style is great, story is unusual but interesting, music is solid (though personally find it inferior to Bastion's western styling) and gameplay is mostly enjoyable. It may not be exceptional, but it's still above the average of most AAA releases these days.			"

												Transistor... I love Bastion. It is one of my favourite games ever, one I keep pushing unto everyone I know, so when I hear of transistor I had to preorder it. Finally it came out and off I went. The game is a worthy successor. Bastion without being Bastion, familiar enough for nostalgia but different enough to escape repetition. The graphics are excellent and work very well with the game type, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing, everything in the sound clicks together, music, effects, narration. The action switches between two game modes giving you both frenetic pace and tactical stimulation. The story is also gripping, you quickly create a bond with the characters and get emotionally invested, knowing what happened to the city, why you, who are they. The only problem is when you answer all those questions and... that's it. The game feels short, leaves you a bit of a bitter after taste. Maybe because of how pleasurable the trip until the end is, and not so much by fault of its own. I guess that in that, it is not Bastion. Play it, enjoy it.			"

												This game is short and didn't have the same authentic feel as Bastion.  The story was interesting and complex, but a little clunky in places.  While I enjoy having certain story elements left up to the reader/player, I think a longer, more fleshed out game would have been nice.  There also doesn't seem to be a whole lot of replayability.I only complain about the length, because what there was of the game was really fun!  The combat system was unique and took thought, and it was challenging.  The main character is a strong kind of go-get-um lady and that's pretty cool.  All of the little elements made the game really interesting as well.  Overall, I recommend the game, but not quite for twenty dollars.  It's a fun, short game, that you can probably complete in one sitting.			"

												On its own, Transistor is a solid game with a great atmosphere and world, a very complicated and interesting story, and a very unique combat system. The game features narration by Logan Cunningham, who plays a voice trapped in the Transistor, leading to a lot of real-time commentary on your actions. It's odd but the terms 'action' and 'turn based' simultaneously need to be used to describe the game. The music as well is really good, and is a prominent element to the game.This is SuperGiant's second game, their first being Bastion (a must-play, btw). For those who HAVE played Bastion, it'll feel relatively familiar in many respects (such as how the story progresses, Jen Zee's artstyle, etc.), but still unique. Comparatively, both games featured Cunningham as a narrator, though IMO it worked a bit better for Bastion as he was more able to tell a story, almost omnipotent, rather than act as a lone character. This is probably part of why the story is a bit confusing for Transistor.While Bastion's strong point was its narration, where Transistor really excels is its combat system. As I've said, the combat system is very unique. It's a little hard to understand at first but it is incredibly deep and challenging, with multiple setups, perks, and moves that are all balanced very well. The only weak part is the interface used to synergize the skills: it's just as deep and complex as the fighting itself. A slightly clearer interface would greatly help, but you can also overcome this by just gradually memorizing the functions of the skills for when they're applied.Unfortunately a lot of the additional story elements are in the form of text-based profiles from traces and skills you've acquired, and while it expands the world, setting the time aside to read through the logs for each trace you acquire kinda feels tedious. That said, there's enough explained in the main storyline to understand the world as much as you need to (if you're paying attention), so the logs are more just for additional sustenance. The game also lacks some kind of central world hub: the one they have available is only available at certain times in the middle of missions, rather than a place you return to after each mission. There are some challenge modes available for additional content, and they're worth doing, though I personally am hoping SuperGiant will add in more challenge modes in the future.The main storyline isn't too long, will take about 6-8 hours to beat, but it's very rich and fulfilling, and leaves a New Game+ option to experience more of the combat, with a few subtle changes to the story. Overall a worthy second title out of SuperGiant Games.			"

												Yet another masterpiece from the creators of Bastion. The story, while rather vauge even after the game is finished, is still a fantastic one and with such an amazing voice actor. The combat was out of this world; mixing real-time gameplay from Bastion while having the option to use turn-based elements that made it feel like Fall-Out 1 & 2 except during the turn you were much more over-powered. The game is also about half as long as Bastion, or just as long if you don't choose to go to find the second ending of Bastion. All in all, this game is a must play, and I'd have to rate it an 8/10.			"

												Transistor is incredible! If you enjoyed Bastion, you'll undoubtedly enjoy Transistor. The combat is addictive and incredibly varied. You can run a myriad of different abilities and combinations allowing you to play pretty much any play style you want. The story is quite beautiful. Be sure to read all the information you can. There's a lot of detail in this universe they've created, and still they leave you with plenty to ponder afterwards. The 2nd playthrough can be incredibly challenging at times, but definitely worth it. It helped me solidify my understand of the story. Oh and I almost forgot. The soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful. Darren Korb delivers again. I find myself listening to it all the time.  "

												Another artsy game by the Supergiant Games, the makers of Bastion. The music and art are even better this time around. They are really excellent. The gameplay is pretty good and interesting with its stop, plan and excecute combat mechanics as well as the ability to mix the elements, which is encouraged by giving more backstory if you do it. Bit easy, but can be made harder by pretty dynamic difficulty levels. The storytelling is good too. It's very in media res. You are dropped in the world without as much as a start menu and left to figure out what's going on and how everything works. It's a simple enough game to pull that off. It's pretty short and fairly linear, though. Replayability value doesn't seem that great even with new game+, though I can imagine revisiting this at some point in the future.Superior to Bastion in almost every way, except maybe Logan Cunningham isn't quite as cool as the voice here as he was as the narrator in Bastion. Definitely worth getting, but I wouldn't pay the full price.			"

												A brilliantly (overused: True) paced and beautifully balanced game oft forgets the story it is trying to tell in search of becoming something it isn't. Whether in pursuit of innovation or not, games of this fashion commonly gloss over facets that players wish more deeply explored; point being, this game will break your heart, the soundtrack will grace you back in to it's somber tale, the combat whisk away formalities in light of strategy and challenge, and the character depth and interaction will, undoubtedly bring you laughter, anguish, unncertainty, and understanding. That all without even mentioning the art, and barely tapping at the resource pool that is the lore of this game. Stories like this one do not come along oft enough, and Bastion rings the same in my ears. SuperGiant has done it again, and done it just as well.9.5/10			"

												If you played Bastion, then you should know what you're in for and, as such, can expect the same experience and be happy that you'll get an arguably better one from Transistor. If you haven't played Bastion, then continue reading.Transistor is right up there with Bastion in ""best games I've ever played"" for many of the same reasons as well; I'll start by discussing the gameplay itself. I played through the game using an Xbox360 Afterglow controller, and the controls are very intuitive and remappable in the options menu. Of course, the game can be played without a controller. In terms of difficulty, it's that comfortable difficulty that isn't easy but isn't frustratingly impossible; it's sometimes challenging, but it's nothing an average player shouldn't be able to handle. There are unlockable and completely optional ""limiters"" that make the game harder and give greater rewards from battle as a result. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock several different abilities that can be equipped in various ways, allowing you to find out for yourself which abilities and combat styles you personally prefer; there's no punishment for not using a certain ability, and (outside of the challenge rooms) you have complete freedom as to how you wish to tackle the many battles in the game.If I were to attempt to describe the combat mechanics, it'd be a turn-based real-time hybrid; you can attack in real-time (which is rather difficult, as most attacks have short start-up and ending cooldown animations), or you could take advantage of the Turn() function, which is the game's core combat mechanic. By activating Turn(), you essentially freeze time and are able to move and perform actions; when time is frozen, you don't actually perform the actions until time is unfrozen, in which you then proceed to wreak havoc on the enemies. However, after you use this, there's a set cooldown period where you cannot use any actions except for running around and evading enemy attacks until you can use Turn() again. It takes a little bit of getting used to and the game provides helpful tips at the top of the screen, as well as the first battle.As for the non-gameplay aspects, the pacing of the story in tandem with the narrative serves to keep the game entertaining and flowing smoothly. The plot develops the more you play, and you can unlock more information about character backstories by using different abilities in combat. The soundtrack is dynamic as it changes depending on the stage of battle. The entire game can be played in one long sitting (4~6 hours), but it auto-saves at each in-game terminal or whenever you enter a new area, so it's fine to play in short intervals if you don't have the time.For the record, I shouldn't even be able to run this game, as I don't meet the minimum requirements; however, turning down the resolution and a few other settings, I was able to play the game with an acceptable framerate with little to no issues. Of course, doing such things isn't good for my processor (pun intended).			"

												This game is great. ENTIRELY. GREAT.If you are wondering if you should buy it or not; DO IT (insert shia labeouf face here)This game presents a gameplay i've never seen before. You mix turns with real time based strategy in the same space. Also, you unlock functions, and you can equip them as passives, actives, or upgrades in other actives, having different effects on each and making your creativity run as you discover new combinations that suit your play style so you can do well on the game, also making the gameplay even more unique. These alone makes it worth the experience and your money.Some other add-ons:The game is really smooth. Nice graphics and animations, and you should not have problems running it even if your computer is not a gamer specs.Awesome music. I'm listening to it even off-game.Great and beautiful story. Runs of all the clichés you can find out there. If you start playing and think ""Oh probably this or that will happen"" you probably are wrong.I give this game my 10/10. Good enough for me to go after all the achievements.			"

												Transistor is one of those games that you don't want to pull away from with its story and fun gameplay. It does a very good job at building the sci-fi world it is set in with various interactable objects and character profiles that add even more depth to the plot. The actual gameplay is very easy to get into and still provides a good challenge at points like some boss fights.The game is very well made as a whole with little to no glitches, except for one bug where clicking to a location becomes somewhat unresponsive and difficult to interact with points of interest. However I've only encountered this bug after playing for longer sessions.Overall Rating: 9/10I recommend this game for anyone whose a fan on action RPGs and strategy games.			"

The combination of the different attacks you can do make for a varied gameplay and the art is just as amazing as it is imaginative. Easy to grasp in every way and you can crack up the battles almost as much as you like, so it's definitely a buy. I would even buy at full price because it's such a gem for me and I like to support developers that deserve their money if we want them to make more awesome game..!			"

The story can be a little confusing on the first play as there is no intro, but recursion mode (new game plus) had it all make a lot more sense. The game looks amazing and the soundtrack is superb. Controls are pretty intuitive. In short, the game is amazing and I hope Supergiant Games will continue to make unique experiences like this one and Bastion.			"

												Transistor is a game not comparable to any game I know. It's an excellent combination of RPG and fast-paced puzzle, in an action hack-and-slash style (Yeah, the genre is kind of hard to describe). The soundtrack is original and it adds compelling ambience to the stunning hand-drawn visuals that add feeling to all the rooms, streets, and courtyards you find yourself in. The actual gameplay seems to get more and more complex as you play, showing you new ways to defeat enemies and avoid death, some limiting your abilities or making you work harder for a better reward. The second you jump into the game, it gives you a hundred choices as to how you choose to play. The storyline - As far as I can tell - is very engaging and well-written, first shrouded in mystery but slowly being revealed as you progress in the game. The only thing I have a slight problem with - And I'm sure many others agree - Is that the controls are definitely meant for a controller. Though they still function on keyboard and mouse, it feels a bit complex. I'd give this a 5/5, though I think the background of the storyline and characters could use a bit of work.Final rating: 4.5/5			"

												This game is amazing! As expected from Supergiant Games, the soundtrack and art direction are both stellar. There are two different choices for combat: real-time combat and turn based combat. In the turn based combat you can plan out your moves and execute them at the end of the planning turn. Your moves are called functions and can be implemented as an active, upgrade, or passive. The number of combinations surpasses even Bastion which leads to lots of flexibility to match all kinds of play styles. The story and cutscenes are also great.The game is a little short, it took me about 6 hours to beat. The whole experience was worth it though. You can also recurse through the story after you beat the game and keep all of your old functions. To recurse through the story and get all of the acheivements it took me an additional 12 hours (I liked wasting time testing out function combinations).If you liked Bastion, you will love Transistor. I can't recommend this game enough. Amazing.			"

												Transistor is the second game from Supergiant Games, the creators of the critically acclaimed Bastion. It is an Action-RPG set in a futuristic sci-fi world full of dangers and mysteries. Transistor features a gorgeous hand-drawn art-style, a brilliant soundtrack and great voice-over as well as a deeply satisfying combat system. You play as Red who has been rendered mute at the beginning of the game and found herself in the possession of a mysteries sword that talks to her during the course of the game. While you uncover the secrets behind the sword and the mysteries of Cloudwalk City, you battle tons of enemies in a mixture of real-time and turn-based combat. During a combat situation you can enter a turn-based mode which enables you to give Red specific commands which she will subsequently execute upon pushing the “activate” button. This will give you the upper hand in most situations as each individual enemy type requires its own strategy. However, after executing these commands, Red will remain vulnerable for a couple seconds and if she loses her health points during this period, she will lose one of her four abilities and continue the fight with less abilities and a higher difficulty until the next checkpoint. Therefore, you have to choose wisely how to tackle each encounter. The game features an extensive upgrade system with active and passive abilities which you can combine at will in order to match you preferable play style. Furthermore, you can apply specific limiters at any time which will make the game on the one hand more difficult, but on the other hand will give you a greater experience reward. There is not much negative to be said about the game, however, some might criticize the fact that there is no equipment in the game at all. Furthermore, the story can be a bit confusing at times and while each enemy requires a specific approach, there are not that many different enemy types. However, these are tiny issues which should not keep you from playing and enjoying this great game. Thumbs up! 9/10 "

The graphics are stunning showing that a game doesn't need to be 3D with crazy graphic engines. The music for Transistor also makes this game feel more emotional, drawing you in with it's great selection. The combat is wonderful. You can both normally use attacks that you have equiped, or plan out your move in a paused turn selection. The selection of moves will benifit you in combat overall.

Transistor stated of beeing a game I just bought when it was on sale and it stood in my library untoutched ever since, but thank god I finaly decided to pick it p and play. the concept is jsut awesome. you play red and lose the ability to talk, stolen by a group you want to take revenge on. with you you have the transsistor in it there is the voice of your loved one. the transistor has the ability to ""capture"" souls and use them to manipulate time and space in diferent manners. by using this functions in diferent ways you find out more about the people you collected giving you more lore. the story is pretty good in my opinion, you just follow this couple on theyr quest to get back what was theyrs to begin with. you see how one big plan can go wrong indangering the hole city. the combat system was sometimes frustratingly hard but realy fun at the same time, I found my self doing combos who onehited most enemys while looking badass. the enemy variaty is big, with different enemy types and upgrades of said enemys. Thou at the end they just seemed to get more and more anoying to forcing you out of your comfort zone. the game is pretty nice and you should give it a try.			"

												Transistor and Bastion are probably two of the best games I've played for a long time. The amount of work the devs have placed into both of them is absolutely gigantic, creating a game that is polished from back to front. I usually have some nitpicks in every game I play, but Transistor is definitely an exception. The graphics are truly magnificent to the eye. There's detail to every little thing in every level, keeping your eyes in constant appreciation of the artwork in the game. It doesn't get boring not even in the slightest. I think if I ever did buy a soundtrack in my life, it'd be Transistor's soundtrack. The music is incredibly elegant, adding extra feeling to the visuals of the game. These two coupled with the fascinating gameplay clash together into a wonderful mix of ""this game is the best thing I've ever played"" kind of game. The gameplay keeps you on board the game nonstop, never getting you unattached. There's tons of upgrades you can get, lots of synergies with those upgrades, and a whole variety of attacks you can do. Voice acting, just like Bastion, is still at its best in Transistor. It doesn't feel cringey, doesn't feel forced, it's fluent and the remarks they make throughout the game keep you hooked up. Difficulty is a big thing in this game. It starts off simple but when you start progressing, it gradually increases and increases, up to a point where some battles do feel like a true challenge. Just like in Bastion, you can boost up the challenge with certain mechanics that stump some of your abilities, but you get rewarded with extra XP. On sale this game is at $3.99. You'll be missing a masterpiece if you don't get it at this price. Game lasts more than 12 hours and is also highly replayable. I recommend you to get this game for once.			"

The story is cryptic and melancholy, forcing you to work out what happened gradually as the game progresses. And... for a working bloke such as myself, it is mercifully short, at just around 5-6 hours.			"

												Transistor is a fantastic game with a touching story and a beautiful soundtrack. It's a bit easier than Supergiant's previous game, Bastion, but that's just fine. The new gameplay is interesting, and makes for some decent strategy elements. It is easily one of my favorite games, and makes me continue to look forward to whatever Supergiant makes next.			"

												Overall Transistor is a really captivating game and is easily one of my current favourites. The music in Transistor is beautiful, and really sets the mood throughout the game. The visuals were lovely, and the game has really nice character designs. Storyline and narration may be one of my favourite aspects of the game, and the ending broke me (it came quite unexpectedly but was a really touching).Gameplay is unique as you can choose to strategically plan your moves or dive headfirst into battle, depending on your preferred play style, but i found both to be enjoyable (though i stuck to planning more). Game was also a good length and has replay value (Recursion). It is also extremely customisable, as you are able to try all sorts of different combinations with the skills, and the results are often stunning, experimentation with different combinations was really interesting. I would say this is one of the games you should pick up when its on sale bc it's worth the money :)			"

												This game has a beautiful and unique way of storytelling. The story doesn't fit into any specific genre, and is confusing in a good way, meaning you can't predict it based on other stories/games.The art style fits perfectly and the soundtrack is just beautiful and well integrated into the gameplay. Yet the biggest surprise for me is the gameplay and skill system. The way of combining functions (skills) allows for many different effective play styles without forcing the player into making permanent choices. It doesn't make much sense to compare Transistor and Bastion, since their concepts are quite different. I personally liked Transistor better, since it's art style and gameplay goes even further away from a usual fantasy setting.			"

												I played it, it was great. I started playing expecting a relativley easy game. Its not, at least with limiters on. The soundtrack: Nice, really good. I would recommend it just because of the soundtrack. Combat/boss fights: The regular combat is interesting. You get turns to pull out crazy combos and wipe out enemies. The Boss fights doe. The first boss fight we REALLY GOOD, and so was the Second and the last. I won't reveal much of them though. Just trust me, the boss fights are good.Graphics: Looks really nice, probably better on a high quality computer. (My computer isn't the best)Story: I am pretty sure that there is only one story line even though you are given multiple choices. The ending is just right (insert meme here)/Overall:I am not very good at being a critic, but it is a 9/10. Worth getting on the sale or just regularly.			"

												Absolutely beautiful game.  The art, sound, and music are amazing.  The story is intriguing, though not as much is explained as I would like.  There are hints of deeper secrets in the game, but that is left to the imagination.The gameplay was odd at first, but once a few abilities are unlocked it becomes pretty good.  Each ability can serve three functions, which creates a lot of variety with many combos.  I liked the ""Turn"" system which makes the game more strategy oriented (especially compared to Bastion).  The game is pretty linear, consisting of progressing between arena-like areas, but the environments keep everything feeling new and fresh.I loved the writing.  Each ability comes with a character backstory that is unlocked by using each of the ability's functions.  Each time I got a new ability I quickly used each function just so I could read the fascinating backstories.Overall, this was a pretty good game.  I recommend it to anyone.			"

												Transistor has become one of my favorite games and these are the reasons why:First of all the game is simply beautiful, the lighting is always gorgeous and the detail they put into the areas is amazing. In addition, not only are the attack-animations different from each other, but the developers took the time for idle animation as well, for instance when Red's singing.Furthermore, the storytelling is great. And so is the plot. So for someone who likes story-based games, this is amazing.Last but not least, the soundtrack is SO PRETTY. And sad. I love everything about it.As always, Supergiant Games did a superb job on Transistor.			"

												Transistor isn't just one of those games that you buy, play, and then forget you ever owned. It's something that sticks with you for a long time, and that I believe defines who you are as a video game consumer, for lack of an equally dignified term. A stellar soundtrack, a plot not to be taken at face value, and combat with nearly limitless potential sees to this. I probably spent over an hour in total sitting and listening to Red hum to the music. This is a soundtrack so good that often times I hesitated to proceed to the next area, fearing that the track would change. As well as all this, the voice acting is very appealing to listen to, and much of the plot is revealed through dialogue (or monologue, rather), which keeps things interesting and attatches more emotion to it all. I struggle to think of any aspect of this game that isn't simply exceptional. The art style is somewhat simplistic, but only in the best of ways, and catches the eye. The environments create a sense of a much larger and quite fascinating world that you want to explore and lose yourself in.If nothing else has effectively captured your attention, I would also like to add that I sold literally every trading card in my possession so I could buy enough Transistor cards to craft the badge all three times.Please, do yourself a favor and play this game. Experience this. You won't regret it.			"

												TL;DR: Everything is either excellent or above average. Get it.Ok, so here's the review. I love this game, and it's one of my favorites. I'm going to do a run down of each part of the game.POSSIBLY LIGHT SPOILERS WARNINGOverview:Like Supergiant's last game, Bastion, Transistor is an isometric hack-and slasher with a good story and narrator. Story can be a little bit pretentious, but the combat provides a solid core and everything else is either excellent or good enough that I can reccomend this.Combat:This is what you'll be doing most of the time. While it starts off relativley simple, it gains depth as you aquire more Functions (your skills) from corpses you find. The main ""gimmick"" (but it's not really a gimmick) is being able to freeze time and plan what moves you'll use. You can freeze time, jump behind an enemy, and get a backstab with a melee ability. The combat is a bit complex, but you'll get the hang of it. You (eventually) get four active Function slots, each which can be buffed with two more Functions, and on top of that you can have 2 (or possibly 4 but that's hard to do) passive Functions. The only way to get story documents about corpses which gave you functions is to use the functions as an active, equiping another skill with it, and using it as a passive. This encourages trying new things with the combat. There are also things called Limiters, which you unlock over time. Equiping one makes the game harder, and tells you about the enemy it corresponds with. Combat: 8.5/10Story:The story is really good if you can figure out what's going on. The characters are mostly given depth through their Functions, because the only characters that talk are three of the villains and your sword. Red, the main character, is a singer who lost her voice because of the villains, which is all I can say without spoiling anything. The sword, getting to talk the most, is the most developed character, but Red is still the favorite of most fans. The story is great, but very confusing without reading some of the community's threads. It regards the cyberpunk city of Cloudbank, where the citizens democratically control what the sky looks like, what the weather is, and what buildings are constructed. (Can't say how without spoilers.) But patterns develop, and the system designed to bring novelty results in nothing changing. This leads to a terrorist orginization of Cloudbank's administrators killing off artists and the people who change the city, and eventually they release an evil called the Process on Cloudbank. The ending of the story is a gut-punch moment. Story: 8/10Aesthetic: While the art is great, it's nothing compared tO THE MUSIC IT'S AMAZING. (There are people who bought this game for the soundtrack and still haven't played it.) Aesthetic: 10/10So if you're looking for a short, replayable story based (slightly pretentious) hack and slasher with the greatest soundtrack of any game ever (seriously), Transistor is the game for you.Overall: 8.83			"

												This is a masterpiece.I've always loved games that tell the story through every single element of the gameplay, and Transistor is no exception. You can choose how much you learn about the characters involved in the story, which is told through the voice of the Transistor for the most part. The voice acting is superb and embellishes an already-compelling tale. The soundtrack--don't even get me started--the soundtrack is massively beautiful, adding to and improving upon the story and world of the game. The visuals are both vibrant and not distracting. And the ending...the ending is exceedingly well-done and satisfying to me as a gamer, and as someone who'd gotten invested in the characters.What really set this game apart for me was the combat system. I am usually a FPS gamer, so this was a new and intriguing experience. By customizing your chosen 'functions' you're also able to customize how you fight the enemies. In addition to that, the turn mode is REALLY interesting. It takes some getting used to, but the transition period is not overly long.All in all, Transistor has rocketed to a spot on my list of Top 5 games. This game is a work of art, simply put, a work of art to be appreciated and revisited. I only wish the base game were longer, but it felt perfectly timed.			"

												*** Spoiler alert ***Transistor is a beautiful game with amazing art direction, music and a unique combat system. However, the story, in my opinion, is what completely falls flat. The premise of a female singer who's lost her voice is interesting but the storytelling is too one-sided. I understand Red can't speak but that doesn't mean she's incapable of responding or showing any emotion. At the end, we see what resembles snapshots of Red's life with the mystery man in the Transistor which should have, in my opinion, happened at moments throughout the game instead. There's a lot more I could say about the plot being lackluster but honestly the rest of the game - art, music and combat - make up for what the story lacks, and is well worth a playthrough. That being said, I don't know if I could stand to play recursion and go through the motions of listening to that narrator again...			"

												With stunning visuals, an unforgettable soundtrack, a unique combat system and a story that just seems to keep on giving, Transistor is a must have for fans of action RPGs. I was a latecomer to Bastion but picked up Transistor soon after its release and was not disappointed. The standalone components of the game work together symphonically: constantly forcing you to think deeper about every visual, audio and gameplay element you encounter.The real showstopper is the inventive combat system which lets you customise a selection of active, upgrade and passive slots via dozens of function combinations. You can choose to attack enemies in real time or press the right trigger to freeze time, plan a series of moves and then hit the right trigger once again to unleash more devastating attacks.The training levels are great for suggesting some of the combos that work well together but the real joy of Transistor lies in discovering new functions and constantly tweaking and upgrading your setup until you find a play style that's just right. Essential!			"

												4/4 thumbs upTransistor is the second game from SuperGiant Games, the makers of Bastion, and it shares much in common with their first game.  First, the visuals are quite stunning and appealing.  Second, the narration is excellent.  Third, the protagonist is mute.  Fourth, the story is always compelling you forward.  Last, the story is, sadly, on the short side (around 6 hours if you skip the optional trials), but it's still an excellent story; I'd much rather an amazing, compelling short game than a longer game that loses its direction, or my interest, along the way.  In addition to all of that, the game includes an excellent combat system and the voice acting overall is very well-done, and kudos to SuperGiant Games for doing what much larger studios fail at accomplishing - NPCs that drive the plot forward while talking just the right amount in well-acted voices.The story puts you in the role of Red, a singer who has lost her voice and wields The Transistor, a talking circuit sword.  Much like Bastion, its predecessor, you travel around the world battling bad guys while trying to figure out what happened and how to stop it.While fighting The Process, you get the pleasure of enjoying the battle system, which is quite well-done.First, you may have up to four abilities hotkeyed to your active ability bar.  Each ability has one power-up slot, which can be used to make the ability more powerful in various ways depending on which power-up ability you choose.  As you level up, you unlock more abilities, more power-up slots, and more passive slots.  You can then take all of the abilities you have at your disposal and mix and match them in a myriad of ways to make a style that is both fun for you and powerful enough to get the job done.  Your choices are only limited by the abilities you choose to unlock and how much memory you have available (which can also be increased as you level).Second, during combat you have the option of real-time or strategic combat.  You can run around the screen using your abilities live as they come off cooldown if that's your thing, or if the combat is especially easy, or you can choose to enter strategic combat and plan out an effective attack sequence and aim your abilities in the most advantageous ways.  However, the strategic combat option has a cooldown every time you use it, during which many of your abilities will be unavailable, so in between strategic rounds you'll need to become adept at evasion.Last, if you find things too easy, you will unlock limiters as you level.  You can activate these limiters to make combat more difficult, and also to earn more XP from each battle.If you enjoy RPGs, action-adventure, mystery, and/or strategic combat, then you have a reason to play this game, because it delivers all four in a well-balanced mix.

												Hello world!Supergiant comes back with another installment, same narrator (or at least the same actor), world still falling apart, but this time, it's in the future!For Bastion fans, Transistor has all of the flavors of  Bastion, with a whole new story and significantly changed combat elements.Combat this time often time involves the usage of the ""Turn()"" ability.Turn() is essentially a planning phase where you can plan out your attacks, then when you execute, it happens instantaneously, then you have a recharge time before it can be used again.Being in the non-discript space future, there are a decent amount of programming references embedded into the game.As a programmer, I thought that was kinda cool, because I felt like I had a secret hand shake with the developers saying ""Hey, I got that!""Even if you're not a programmer, those minor references don't really effect the story at all, so nothing will be missed by anyone that plays this game.So to break down the pieces, gameplay, I would say is equivalent to the level that Bastion output.Music, dare I say, better than Bastion. The song for the trailer, We All Become was fantastic. Old Friends was great as well.Combat, personally, I liked it. I've heard some friends that preferred Bastion's combat system to Transistor, but I'm definitely a fan of RPGs, and Transistor feels more like an RPG with its system.Story, I'm kind of mixed. Shortly in, it becomes apparent that there are elements of romance. My video game taste palate initially wasn't expected a romance, but grew to accept and even really like where it took the story.All of those elements combined, it makes this game one of my absolute favorites.I would absolutely recommend it.Gotta get that ten outta ten!System.exit(0) || return 0; //Whichever you prefer.

												If Invisible, Inc. and Megaman had a baby and that baby had Bastion as the Granpa you always leave your kid with, that's what Transistor is. It's also feels like Romeo and Juliet meets Kill Bill... It's got an awsome sound track, a talking sword that reminds me of Cry when he gets drunk, and a protagonist that doesn't have a voice but can hum that makes you want to lie in that hammock on the beach and just listen to her...- It's a strategy game that feels reminecent to Invisible, Inc. when you use Incognita...- You get skills/powers similar to the feel of Megaman/Rockman- And the excellent narration and exposition of Bastion (hats off to you devs)			"

												In essence, transistor is a work of art in every aspect.Graphics: The art style and graphics of the game is not only visually stunning but timeless in gameplay. There'll never be a need for a HD remake years down the road, and if you pick it up 10 years after 2014, you'll still be awed by the world you're walking in.Combat: A very novel kind of experience that allows huge room for customization in terms of the type of action you prefer (more strategic or action packed), playstyle and also difficulty.The story: Wonderfully written narrative; both thought-invoking and heart-wrenching. A lot of the world-building and story-telling is subtle, opening up room for all sorts of theories and heated discussions which I thoroughly enjoy reading online.Voice acting: Logan Cunningham - the main narrator you'll hear throughout the game, the same narrator from Bastion - really made me fall in love with him (a man who is now a sword, mind you) and feel his love for Red (the unfortunately mute female protagonist).Soundtrack: All of this is wrapped together with a beautiful soundtrack (which is aptly timed to the game). It immerses you completely, and invokes all sorts of emotions in you. "

												Don't take the screenshots, as beautiful as they are, as an indicator for whether to buy it or not. My brother gushed about this game and I was intrigued but the graphics in these screenshots almost turned me off. I gave it shot when it went on sale and I have to say I am blown away by how emotional and in-depth this game is. It manages to give you very little in the way of story line like other games do, but little quips here and there fill in the breadth of it and I have to say these game writers are genius. The story and the world unfold before you through your skills and kiosks throughout the world. The combat is amazing and entirely customizable. I sit sometimes for a few minutes thinking up different ways to use skills and passives and upgrades and when it all comes together it's awesome. Pick it up. You won't regret it.			"

												Countless praises have already been given for this game and I'll add one more to that one part of the game that gripped me the most and pushed me to get all the achievements: the story.Transistor, like Bastion, is one of those games that has a very serious tone in its story and still manages to feel warm. The writing in this game and how the story progresses will make you ignore how linear the game is. How things end are unlike those cliche stuff where... letting myself go on will just give out spoilers.The story, the music and the visual style; the overall immersion this game can get you in makes it worth full price.

												""Masterpiece"" - The only words i can say after i finish this game, Unlike other game which have ""beautiful"" graphic, ""flashy"" gameplay,...... etc, once you begin to start the adventure of ""Red"" - the main character, you can forget all of those things. Because, you are actually live as ""Red"".-Music: 11/10 - If i have the chance, i will always stand in a place, hold Tab, and listen to the beautiful singing (humming) of Red.... (Tips: it might be a spoil but if you see a ""backdoor"", always go for it, unlock each door which will unlock different songs. Then, with each different song, Red will hum in different way.) -Story: 9/10 - When i read the review, some said they don't actually get the story. For me, i can see and can feel that the story was very good and easy to understand. But each person can feel different since the game create a new way of storytelling. Take time to listen and you will see. Still, game is quite short but i think it's fine to end like that (you will understand once you finish the game)-Gameplay: 8/10 - The gameplay are fun. You get the chance to create many kind of play-styles. You can be a ninja (1 hit 1 kill), a trickster (run around and create trap)..... etc etc. However, i'm not quite satisfied since the game was kind of short and i would love to see more things i can do.Overall, this is the game which you can spend your money on without regret, a game which you can play and enjoy every bit of it instead of being forced to play just to finish it (like: WD, Unity,.....)Goodluck with this game and.....See you in Country =)  "

												Fantastic storytelling, beautiful hand drawn world with a very distinctive look and magnificent soundtrack.The function combat system is inovitive and very customizable, with each function being either a weapon, an aumentation or a passive buff depending on how you build your loadout. Combat can be either very easy or very hard depending on how you set up your functions, so be sure to practice with different loadouts at that place you'll find out about when you find it ;)Have really enjoyed this game a lot and just started going through it again on Recursive mode (New Game+ type mode)Obvious comparisons drawn between this and Bastion.... This is a more elegant and you don't perpetually feel like you're going out to a level then back to the hub again, this flows much better and gives access to the hub type area at multiple points along the way giving you a better game flow. The combat systems are very different and I would certainly say it's better played on a pad rether then mouse & keyboard.Anyway, good game and looking forward to more releases from Supergiant Games :)			"

Made this great for just a bit of play after work and something to look forward to every evening. Last but not least I found the idea of limiters to change difficulty greatly appealing.As some people have mentioned before the soundtrack really is as good as they say.10 of 10			"

What I also found really cool is that by using the skills in a different manner you actually uncover more of the storyline. This leads to discovering unexpectedly good skill combinations.			"

												Transistor is a top-down, turn-based adventure game that takes place in a utopian society. The gameplay is very different from Bastion; in this game, all attacks are planned beforehand during each turn. This game is beautiful to look at and holds a beautiful story within.Pros:+From the music, to the voice acting, to the writing, to the art, this game is beautifully executed. I like the gameplay, but this is definitely a game you buy for the music, story and artwork.+The romance in this game felt genuine and believable to me.+The gameplay is entertaining; different ""functions"" (attacks) can be combined in a multitude of combinations, and there are multiple ways to win each battle.+Like Bastion, there is a new game plus mode where you can restart the game at a higher difficulty and continue levelling.+For those who like the battles, there are bonus challenges, similar to Bastion.Cons:-While planning your turn, you can't pan the screen to look at far away enemies. This is a minimal problem, as you can usually see far enough anyways, and you can also simply walk where you want to see and then cancel the move.This game took me ten hours to complete, but my girlfriend completed it in four hours, which I find amazing. I think most people will take at least six if not 7-8 hours.I really loved this game. While they don't have the big budget of a AAA company, Supergiant has managed to craft something that is both more unique and more impressive than most AAA games.			"

												This is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. The attention to detail is astonishing, as anyone who plays this game through the ending will find obvious. The level of immersion in this game is also incredible, with the developers having gone above and beyond to make you feel involved, with everything from the speed of the vehicle or even the weather itself; even your smallest choices seem to affect the narration, and in turn the story. There's subtle foreshadowing to the ending, which I found fitting, and wouldn't want to change even if I could. Simply everything here is perfect. And the gameplay offers so much diversity in options, that alone enhances the replayability in addition to the achievements. Play this game.			"

And if you miss Logan Cunningham's voice, GET READY HE'S BACK. Now before you go thinking this is just another Bastion with different textures, it isn't. The combat system has been completely redone, with the ability to stop time turning it into more of a turnbased fighter; upgrades are still a pretty big part but you can now mix and match them for the strongest ability you can get.

												Where to  begin with Transistor? It is a strikingly beautiful game that goes beyond the conventional bounds of what is typically considered to be standard in the sci-fi game genre. Done in a lush style, Supergiant Games utilizes a vibrant futuristic art-deco style that is as much of a character as the protagonist. Gameplay is similar to that Supergiant's first game, Bastion, with skills naturally being acquired as you level up and allowing you to add limiters to make the game as hard or as easy as you would like. Skills can also be arranged and combined together, allowing for experimentation, as well as unlocking finer details about the world Red, the protagonist, lives in. The story is fantastic and remarkably emotional for a relatively short game. Details are not missed in Transistor, with everything from style to soundtrack being considered and working together to create a truly stunning game.			"

												This game gave me goosebumps throughout its experience and ended with me crying for quite a while. It is such an emotional train and it leaves you wondering continuously. A great soundtrack and mediocre gameplay. It ain't technically the best game out there but it is easily one of the best stories. One can argue that the story is flawed but it got the fans together by asking questions since the story was told indirectly. It told more than the dialogue and it used every way of transmitting emotions onto the player. I wish I could explain more but you'll have to see, hear and feel for yourself.Feel train 2014.			"

												What can I say about this game that already hasn't been said. If you liked Bastion, you'll enjoy this. It's not quite as action RPG oriented as Bastion, but the Turn() system is actually really intuitive and easy to pick up. If you enjoyed the narrator from Bastion, he's back as well - though in a role that's a little different, though I think is much better than his previous one. There's also a little less story and immediate exposition given to you this time, you'll have to play around with the different skills (called Functions()) in different slots in order to get some more background and story. With that being said however, I can understand why people wouldn't like this as much as Bastion - it's definitely a different game, not just Bastion with a reskin. However, I highly recommend it if you want beautiful artwork, a wonderful soundtrack, an interesting (if somewhat sparse) story, and a unique take on action RPGs.			"

												Supergiant's previous game, Bastion, is probably my favourite indie game of all time... but no longer. Only an hour into Transistor, the develop has convinced me that it could handle the pressure of making another blockbuster indie hit. Transistor exceeds the expectation to do great things, with truly unique gameplay, a fantastic story, and stunning visuals.			"

												Another great game by Supergiant, Transistor is set in an intriguing world where a singer named Red obtains a strange sword after losing her voice. The story, art, and music are amazing. The combat is enjoyable and the ability system allows for many possible variations. Bastion's idea of difficulty modifiers by invoking idols is translated into limitors which can be enabled at terminals.			"

												One of the few games that left warm feeling inside of me.You may think it is short, but don't look at it as a game, more like a well made story. Artistic side was very enjoyable, gameplay was fun and side dialogs/features made it worth looking for them.Only few games I played over the years left me looking with a smile at the ending credits, this is one of them.

												The art of this game is wonderful. (Characters. Areas. Songs. Story.) I will not elaborate further. I am sure others have.I do have a terminology quibble: a transistor is a switch controlled by voltage. Yes, it is the basic unit of a digital processor. No, you can't stab people with it, much less stash their soul in it.Nor, taken literally, should you be able to proc stun / charm / slow / vuln / knocked-into-air on them. Gameplay-wise, these are your basic tools. By artfully arranging them - some being cheaper than others, some affecting more enemies at once, some merely being available at the time - into useful combos, a pleasing variety arises.Although the variety of (largely useful) abilities is remarkable, their tradeoffs won't particularly matter (due to some powerful, spammable late-game abilities) unless you up the difficulty. The system for doing so is remarkably flexible - rules of combat can be turned to the enemy's favor, or you can step outside the campaign (which you should be replaying at this point anyways) to pit a semi-fixed loadout against (yet )a(nother) set configuration of enemies.Cloaking enemies (temporarily untargetable) are annoying for how they drag out fights, later on. Others, that boot you out of turn-planning, violate the premise of the game - the few encounters they participate in become mere button-spamming, converting tension to panic. This is the worst quibble I have with the game. (Except maybe for the name of its titular artifact.)In summary: A fascinating post-mortem of a city that deserved to live. (Deserves, even. I'm imagining an art deco / cyberpunk life simulator. It would be a lot of work.) Coupled with the important, RPG-y business of blowing things up in increasingly efficient, then increasingly roundabout ways.			"

												Isn't it wonderful how game can be masterpiece of art at the same time? Gracefully narrated story with beautiful level-desing, manifold and various combat style, perfect artworks and magnificent soundtrack. I like idea of planning turns instead of simple hack-and-slash mechanics. Tragic plot about silent lady and incorporeal man in dying futuristic city made me drown in thoughts and tears. Behind the game there is a lot of difficult questions of love and public benefit and innovations and self-sacrifice and not-so-far-future to think about. Story tells itself very softly so be careful and don't miss even smallest parts of it because this game worth your time and your rapt attenion.			"

												I don't review many games, but Transistor, much like SuperGiant's previous title, Bastion, exceeded my expectations on all fronts.This game is a tremendously soulful piece of work, and from the very start to the very end, is first and foremost a work of art. The music, narration, artistic style and presentation flow together in a way that I would probably say outclasses almost any other game i've played. Anyone with a quibble of curiousity and a penchant for great games, or even works of art, should immediately purchase Transistor (AND Bastion) and enjoy the ride.To touch on the gameplay itself, the combat is inventive and blends several previously done elements (pseudo-turn based combat, action queues, tactical-execution-based combat) into a pretty seamless and enjoyable experience. It is two parts arcade, one part strategic pause-and-think game. It remains fresh and has a lot of room for player creativity due to the openly configurable nature of abilities acquired throughout the game.What follows are some brief pros/cons:Pros:+Incredible Art. From music to artwork, this entire game is a masterpiece.+Gameplay. The combat remains fresh, enjoyable, and creative all the way through.+Difficulty.  Like bastion, difficulty is born of modifiers you can apply to enemies, which give you bonuses for being brave.+Storyline.  Again, this is a work of art and the storyline is rich, heartfelt, and incredibly immersive.+Soundtrack.  Incredible, as usual.Cons:-Length.   The game itself isn't that long, although there are excuses to re-play the game with new conditions and toy around with the combat some more.That's really all I can see anyone really griping about with this game.In total, I'd give Transistor a 9.5/10, as one of the most absolutely awesome pieces of work i've seen in terms of gaming. It isn't a triple-A 40 hour experience... but it's an incredibly rich, artistic romp through an engaging and incredibly envisioned city of Cloudbank.9.5/10-Colt			"

												Interesting story/setting.  Combat plays more like a puzzle, with the puzzle being as hard as you decide to make it using optional settings (limiters) you gain through the game.  Single playthrough took me 8 hours, but you get the option for a NG+ that also changes the dialogue you experience the second time through; which gives another perspective on the narrative.  As expected from Supergiant, the art and soundtrack are excellent.  The game at times can feel like walking through the work of Gustav Klimt.  The soundtrack is a largely ambient set of aucoutic guitars and subtle electronic puncutated by vocal hums.  The game also features a couple full tracks with lovely lyrics.The negatives for me were related to the amount of menu activity.  Pieces of backstory and character information are hidden in skills you use, and using the skills in different ways unlocks more of that information.  In order to change how your skills are arranged (to use them differently), you have to visit a menu and shuffle things around between most combat sequences.  It's not a big deal, but slows down the feel of progression and the pace of your play.  It feels tedius.  Granted, you could skip the unlocking of this information and stick to a skill arrangement your comfortable with.  Additionally, some skill arrangements work better for some fights than others, and you don't have any way to predict what the next fight will be, so you usually have to fail the combat sequence to go readjust for the fight.When you're out of the menu's and fighting, you do appreciate the maleability of the skills.  Using any single skill as either an active, augmenting, or passive ability and over a dozen skills, you can create what feels like an endlessly diverse series of offensive arrangments.  Really cool.Overall, a very positive experience.  Definitely worth the $19.99 price tag on release.			"

												Honestly... I was expecting some game like a Bastion. And Transistor is like a Bastion... a very good game with interesting original story and excellent soundtrack; just press TAB in a game and haroine will start a humm : ) to the music!...and I can't forgot, this game have REALLY AWESOME fight system. Partly real-time, partly turn-based.Simply, You stop the time. Plan your moves, attacks, evasions, corruption of enemies, etc.Then You press a space and your turn is executed within a second. But... after that You have to wait for your turn again (but in the real time). It is like you combined chess, when your opponent have turn after You, but you can still move too.+ it is really good that every skill which You've found can have three functions:Main skill, support skill, passive skill = and its only up to You how you will mix themSo don't wait and try this game.

												Transistor follows the story of a mute young woman, Red, in her journey of discovery. Taking place shortly after losing her voice, she discovers a key like object known as the Transistor, which narrates and communicates with Red in an accustomed manor. Together, they explore a world which has been over-run with digital viruses, which plagues the worlds existence itself.From start up, I was astonished by the beautiful design. color and soundtrack this feature displays, it all fits splendidly together in a blend that can only impress. The game play is phenomenal, sporting a combination of classic mechanic systems, in a mix that I can only describe as Final Fantasy meets Zelda. The narration is a pleasure to listen too and pays homage to their previous game, Bastion, which was equally fantastic.The game length tends to be on the shorter side, supplying approximately 8 hours of overall game time. Don't be fooled though, once you've seen the ending you're given the option the restart the journey, allowing you to keep all the items and progression from your current file, which lends to some interesting replay ability.Overall, the game is a breathtaking experience, every aspect of the game works well together in a new and original concept. Supergiant Games, creators of Transistor and Bastion, deserve a congratulations for creating a masterpiece, this game will will certainly stand the test of time as one of the greatest games to hit the market. I rate Transistor a 9/10.			"

												This game has a beautiful and unique way of storytelling. The story doesn't fit into any specific genre, and is confusing in a good way, meaning you can't predict it based on other stories/games.The art style fits perfectly and the soundtrack is just beautiful and well integrated into the gameplay. Yet the biggest surprise for me is the gameplay and skill system. The way of combining functions (skills) allows for many different effective play styles without forcing the player into making permanent choices. It doesn't make much sense to compare Transistor and Bastion, since their concepts are quite different. I personally liked Transistor better, since it's art style and gameplay goes even further away from a usual fantasy setting.			"

The visuals were lovely, and the game has really nice character designs. Storyline and narration may be one of my favourite aspects of the game, and the ending broke me (it came quite unexpectedly but was a really touching).Gameplay is unique as you can choose to strategically plan your moves or dive headfirst into battle, depending on your preferred play style, but i found both to be enjoyable (though i stuck to planning more). Game was also a good length and has replay value (Recursion). It is also extremely customisable, as you are able to try all sorts of different combinations with the skills, and the results are often stunning, experimentation with different combinations was really interesting. I would say this is one of the games you should pick up when its on sale bc it's worth the money :)			"

												The game looks pretty good and the soundtrack is outstanding. The combat is very interesting allowing you a very large variety in ways you can set up your skills and combine them to have various and unexpected (or expected) mechanics. The real-time combat is also complimented with a turn base system (reminiscent to Fallout 3's VATS system) where you can freeze time, plan a course of multiple actions and execute them in a blink of an eye chaining powerful moves together and complimenting their attributes to do some serious damage. The story is ok. Like Bastion, you're listening to a narrator who follows your actions on screen and, like Bastion, the world is falling apart and you are trying to undo or fix it whilst it gradually gets a bit clearer on what's happening although, like Bastion, it's never entirely clear and there are loose ends left up to the imagination to fill in.

												Jesus Christ, I don't have words enough to describe how perfect this game is.First off: looks. 10/10The minute I looked at this game, I knew I'd want to play it. Attractive, attention-drawing female lead character who turned out to be amazingly pretty and humble. Then, the art. Oh my God. Flawless, perfect, awesome. Everything drawn to its smallest detail, and all very thought-through for the whole gaming experience. The mixture of lights in-combat makes you want to play it nonstop.Gameplay: 10/10At first, I was a little concerned about it being a 2D game (not because 2D games are bad, but because I tend not to like them). Actually, I saw it be launched back in 2014, but was not caught in the moment to buy it. Then, I decided to give it a shot now. Best idea so far. I couldn't find a single bug ingame, not to mention how fluid the animations are. But the best part: ingame sound experience. Sweet Lord. Best game I've ever played, by far. Games are not about graphics or long stories, but how much they can make you dive into the atmosphere and really feel you're the character. And boy, does this game excel at this. I truly felt I was a red-haired woman with a talking technologic-sword in a city where everything'd been consumed by programs. One point I really liked was the fact that whenever she hums, it goes according to whatever song is currently playing in the background. It really shows the commitment the team had in doing this game, and planning it so the story would feel real. I cared for Red and her sword, I did. I felt like a child rooting for them when the sword got red and it seemed it'd be corrupted away from her. Very immersive.Art/Music/Story: 9.9/10Exerything perfect. You can't find one single image that says 'look how poorly drawn I was'. None. Very hard work applied into creating this world and the story. Everything makes sense, there aren't loose ends. All songs were very good, highlight on ""In Circles"", which is a favorite and definetly could be a pop singer' single. Red's voice is something unique, I don't know wheter because the effects or what, which also don't mind. The fact is you get goosebumps and shivers everything she hums to a song. The reason my grade isn't 10 is the ending, which I'd hoped would be the other way around. But, I must not spread spoilers. All in All: 10/10I don't recommend it. I command people to play it. :)			"

												If Invisible, Inc. and Megaman had a baby and that baby had Bastion as the Granpa you always leave your kid with, that's what Transistor is. It's also feels like Romeo and Juliet meets Kill Bill... It's got an awsome sound track, a talking sword that reminds me of Cry when he gets drunk, and a protagonist that doesn't have a voice but can hum that makes you want to lie in that hammock on the beach and just listen to her...- It's a strategy game that feels reminecent to Invisible, Inc. when you use Incognita...- You get skills/powers similar to the feel of Megaman/Rockman- And the excellent narration and exposition of Bastion (hats off to you devs)			"

												Transistor really took me by surprise. Bought it on sale, didn't really expect much. I started the game for the first time, completely overwhelmed by the artwork and the raw beauty of the colours and the music combined really puts you into a trance. The gameplay is extremely satisfying as well, play it action combat or strategically - it's your choice. However, it is not as easy as it looks. I really didn't have much idea as to what was happening in terms of the storyline. I went through the game completely captured by the art and music so I didn't really care. However as I pieced the bits of information given to me throughout the game together I sort of got a vague understanding as to what was happening. As I progressed through the game, nearing the end especially, things slowly began to make more and more sense. By the end, it all made sense. I sat in my chair, having finished the game, in tears. It was colourful, beautiful, dark, light, saddening, elevating, absolutely shocking, and completely expected at the same time. Words can't really describe this game to be honest, but if there's one thing I wish for you - random stranger - is you play the game. Now this, this is art.			"

												In essence, transistor is a work of art in every aspect.Graphics: The art style and graphics of the game is not only visually stunning but timeless in gameplay. There'll never be a need for a HD remake years down the road, and if you pick it up 10 years after 2014, you'll still be awed by the world you're walking in.Combat: A very novel kind of experience that allows huge room for customization in terms of the type of action you prefer (more strategic or action packed), playstyle and also difficulty.The story: Wonderfully written narrative; both thought-invoking and heart-wrenching. A lot of the world-building and story-telling is subtle, opening up room for all sorts of theories and heated discussions which I thoroughly enjoy reading online.Voice acting: Logan Cunningham - the main narrator you'll hear throughout the game, the same narrator from Bastion - really made me fall in love with him (a man who is now a sword, mind you) and feel his love for Red (the unfortunately mute female protagonist).Soundtrack: All of this is wrapped together with a beautiful soundtrack (which is aptly timed to the game). It immerses you completely, and invokes all sorts of emotions in you. "

												Transistor is a game that truly asks the player to think about both their actions in combat as well as their interpretation of the narrative. The game can be also be enjoyed without this effort, but after a blind first playthrough, the game truly comes alive on the second run when the player has heightened curiosity and a desire to experiment with the depth offered by the many combinations of combat abilities available. The soundtrack is also excellent, further heightening the atmosphere and sense of presence that the game has.			"

												Roblins Review:Transistor is a surreal and beautiful Sci-fi, Cyberpunk game with a great story, and has a soundtrack that might make your ears try to jump off your head and try to get into the game.~ The Combat is innovative in the fact that you can choose to use a turn based approach or take a direct approach (Although turns are a safer and more efficient way through the game). That along with the many play style options for combat. You can choose to be a tank, or use buffs to weaken your enemies. The game has a way of making you feel very powerful without it being too easy, and if it is too easy you can use Limiters to make the game even harder.~The Story is good, but you're left to figure out most of it yourself, which is something i like, but not everyone will agree on that. You play as a popular singer named Red, and you've just barely escaped death at the hands of the Camerata. A secret-ish Society in cloudbank (the city the game takes place in.) I don't want to say too much about the story. If you want to get every last detail on the characters you can use your combat functions in different ways to gain access to personal files. I liked this feature because it pushes you to try different play styles.~The Soundtrack is Visceral and well done. Most of the songs relating to the story so there is a deep sense of drive and emotion in every note. If you're into techno or anything of that sort you should love it.~The Art in this game is self explanatory. It's just amazing. The world of Cloudbank feels deep like it was once a bustling city full of people. Plus it has the best Flat bread Delivery around. It has a very Cyber-punk feel to it. It's just great.Overall I'd say this is the best game I've played in 2014. It has decent replayability as well. Only thing i have to complain about is that it was too short, and the only reason i say that is because i wanted more!  I highly recommend it. Amazing 9/10.			"

												Beautiful.Simply beautiful. The art is gorgeous, with a unique Art Deco Cyberpunk aesthetic heavily influenced by the art style of Gustav Klimt. The music is haunting and evocative, and the gameplay starts off simple but adds layers and layers of depth the deeper you invest in it.There are some who complain that the game is too short, and indeed, you could probably finish it in 5-6 hrs if you zip through the levels, avoid using limters, ignore the backstory, skip the side challenges, and pay no attention to the truly artfully created world that Supergiant has made. But that would be a crime. A crime against...yourself, really for missing out on what is one of the most beautiful games made in a long time.Come to CloudBank. Stay for a while.			"

												Transistor... I love Bastion. It is one of my favourite games ever, one I keep pushing unto everyone I know, so when I hear of transistor I had to preorder it. Finally it came out and off I went. The game is a worthy successor. Bastion without being Bastion, familiar enough for nostalgia but different enough to escape repetition. The graphics are excellent and work very well with the game type, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing, everything in the sound clicks together, music, effects, narration. The action switches between two game modes giving you both frenetic pace and tactical stimulation. The story is also gripping, you quickly create a bond with the characters and get emotionally invested, knowing what happened to the city, why you, who are they. The only problem is when you answer all those questions and... that's it. The game feels short, leaves you a bit of a bitter after taste. Maybe because of how pleasurable the trip until the end is, and not so much by fault of its own. I guess that in that, it is not Bastion. Play it, enjoy it.			"

												This game is short and didn't have the same authentic feel as Bastion.  The story was interesting and complex, but a little clunky in places.  While I enjoy having certain story elements left up to the reader/player, I think a longer, more fleshed out game would have been nice.  There also doesn't seem to be a whole lot of replayability.I only complain about the length, because what there was of the game was really fun!  The combat system was unique and took thought, and it was challenging.  The main character is a strong kind of go-get-um lady and that's pretty cool.  All of the little elements made the game really interesting as well.  Overall, I recommend the game, but not quite for twenty dollars.  It's a fun, short game, that you can probably complete in one sitting.			"

												Transistor is Beautiful. As soon as you start up the game you play it. There are no Difficulty selections to pick, you simply start the game.

The music for Transistor also makes this game feel more emotional, drawing you in with it's great selection. The combat is wonderful. You can both normally use attacks that you have equiped, or plan out your move in a paused turn selection. The selection of moves will benifit you in combat overall.

												I picked up this little jewel during the Summer Sale and I'd recommend it a thousand times if I could. I'll try and keep the review short and sweet and hopefully spoiler-free, though some gameplay mechanics may be explained.You begin your journey in the city of Cloudbank as the mute songstress, Red, wielding nothing but a talking sword which happens to be called the Transistor. Immediately, your companion tells you to move and you're soon running around the mysterious and towering city looking for answers to the events that have transpired, reading Function files and OVC terminals to find out what is causing the disappearance of the city and the people who had the most influence making the city into what it is.The overall design for this game is absolutely beautiful. The blend of art deco and cyberpunk makes the game vastly unique with beautiful artwork appearing during cutscenes and optional areas. There aren't many characters in the game but the interplay between Red and her talking companion makes it hard not to care about their situation and the surrounding events. Sound design also plays a huge part in becoming immersed in the game as it is very influential and relevant to the story and really reminds the player of Red's past life as a musician. Often times, I will let Red hum to the background music for minutes without realizing how long I've been doing it. Yeah, it's that good.As in traditional RPG fashion, the game involves a leveling system which unlock slots for upgrades to your basic arsenal of Functions. It also utilizes the ability to combine these Functions to upgrade your moves or give different effects depending on the slot they're in; giving the player quite a bit of options regarding how you choose to fight. Mechanics for the gameplay seem to try to expand on the typical RPG style and use a cross between real time and activating Turn() to strategically plan your next couple of moves without fear of retailiation from enemies. I personally enjoyed figuring out countless combinations to alter my playstyle, though some players may find the combat repetititve considering you will most likely use the most powerful combinations you can make and continue to use the same tactic to deal with every foe from about mid to end game. Fortunately, Limiters can keep the game from becoming too monotonous, allowing you to ramp up the difficulty at your own leisure and the Recursion playthrough will bring you back for more if you'd like 100% completion.In summary, the game can be completed in about 5-10 hours depending on your speed and while not very lengthy, you can go for a second playthrough if you want more. The combat is intelligent, though some players will be turned off by its repetition and may find certain combinations of Functions too powerful or easy and can burn through the game using only 2-3 moves. The interaction between Red and her Transistor makes for a compelling story hopefully enticing the player to find out the truth behind Cloudbank and the Process and where it leads our protagonists. The artwork and design of the game is astoundingly vivid and the soundtrack fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game and I can't possibly stress enough how beautiful it all feels. I also highly recommend buying the soundtrack.Overall rating: 9/10			"

												The obvious strength in music and visuals makes it easy to treat Transistor as the gaming equivalent of a snack, but the more patience you invest into the game the greater the reward and the more engaging it becomes. It's beautiful in every way - sound, art, gameplay, plot, and the way they all mesh together to turn what could be a good game into a fantastic game.The music is tied closely to the plot and the art brings out the ethereal and ephemeral feeling of Cloudbank in an amazingly unique way, while reinforcing the overall atmosphere and excitement of the entire game. They underscore SuperGiant's (by now) trademark way of storytelling: letting the atmosphere speak for itself, with the narration more like a tour-guide than noisy friend. The battle system is a fun hybrid of action and turn based - you can play as purely one or the other, but utilizing both makes for an interesting blend of twitch and chess-like strategy. With plenty of skills, a staggering amount of ways to combine them, and variable difficulty - you can choose which limitations to use and how to power up enemies to make the perfect personal challenge - battles never feel like a grind, and are always exciting. Since ""function file"" plot and character information is unlocked by using skills in different ways, it encourages you to constantly change up your playstyle, try everything, and keeps things interesting. Even going through the game multiple times feels fresh since both you and enemies retain your strength upon ""recursion"". The battles grow with you every time through.However, to understand the game fully you need to play it through twice. If you love the game this is an easy plus, but requires investment. The depth of the plot doesn't really come out until right at the very end, and important details are in the ignorable function files. The ending might leave those expecting things to go a different way feeling unsatisfied, but I believe it fits the game perfectly, and suits the bittersweet inevitability hanging over the entire game.Overall, highly recommended. See you in the Country.			"

												Transistor is yet another masterpiece from SuperGiant Games. The story has players in control of Red, a widely beloved singer of the setting city, Cloudbank, where all voices are heard so to speak. When our Heroine finds herself trekking throughout the city without her voice after being attacked by a secret group that wishes to use her voice for their master plan for the city, Red must take use of the Transistor, a oddly sword that downloads the data of people in order to store them inside.Within the first fewminutes of the game, we see this in action as the swords main entity is Red's boyfriend, a figure unknown by not just the player but the also the city itself. With him guiding her along the way the game really opens up some interesting dailogue between them that range from comedic relief and worry. the Characters are all fairly written and the background data on the people you download into the sword keep you playing to find out more on why they were killed and the truth behind the Transistor.The Combat is great, and engaging; combining elements of strategy and action. You have a feature called turn which in essence allows the player to stop time, plan their next move, and then re-initiate time and watch your plan play out. THe best part about this feature is that it's mostly optional save for some bosses and puzzles. The most of the game can be played without ever activating Turn for the more hardy of players looking for a decent challenge. Not enough you say? well how about the added limiter that allow you so make the game harder in order to earn even more experience. Limiters are a great way to give that extra wager to your skills from making enemys immune to status effects to giving them more health and power to having them break your skills should you get hit with no health.Darren Knob Has outdone himself again with Transistors Soundtrack. This and Bastion are two example of just how good Game OST's are getting, and I'd recommend picking it up like I did. I could sit here all day trying to sweeten up music for you, but my moto on music is the only way I could get someone to like music is to have them hear it for themselves, and that's just what you need to do. Check some of it out on Youtube, and if you enjoy the jazzy/blues tunes of the game then you simply must purchase the soundtrack.All-in-all, Transistor is a great game for those that enjoy a great action game, with a few twist here and there, a interesting story, and great soundtrack. Overall i'd give the game a 8.5/10, and I'd reccomend it to anyone who does and doesn't hold interest in the title already. Trust me, it is a well worth buy.			"

I didn't think it would be plausible to make something better.But behold, Supergiant Games has done it again.Transistor will confuse you.Transistor will astound you.Transistor will make you question morals and most important make you question actions.Move around in a beautiful city and try to unravel a breathtaking mystery.In short: Transistor is amazing, and you should definitely try it!

												PROS:+Beautiful Soundtrack, Art +Function system allows for varied play-styles +Similar reactive story-telling as in Bastion+Decent replayabilityCONS:-Combat mechanics not polished-Less than 10 hours of core gameplay (unless you're a completionist)-Nothing new is offered past first playthroughThe game is kinda like a good Tiramisu; It's rich, intense, and leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth. It's small, and leaves you craving for more, but I wouldn't have it any other way. The pacing is good and the filler between battles is refreshing considering the amount of detail that goes into it. The art style speaks for itself and there is a consistence in quality between in-game graphics and cinematics. The music is immersive and well-written. The combat mechanics does not have (m)any obvious or game-breaking bugs, but some things aren't the most polished [E.g. you can set up a chain-explosion attack during planning phase, but the subsequent explosions after the first may not hit because the first explosion knocked them out of the hit radius.] Warning: Like Bastion, Supergiant Games' writers love their plot twists.

												10 out of heart-ing 10. A game with a great mix of actions and tactical gameplay. Best part is: it never lets up. The whole Functions (abilities) system is diverse and leaves many different options with many different playstyles to be made—where abilities can be used as they are, or used to augment other abilities, or even augment your character. It's all reaaaaally well done. The music will take you over and force delightful milk out your ears. Get your happy tissues ready. Highly recommend purchasing the soundtrack if you're ever in need of revitalizing. The art portrays the world both as it is and as it once was—with such beauty. The controls are incredibly good, and I got the strong desire to play the NG+.Just such a worthy purchase.EDIT (10/15/2014): Played the NG+ and it was great. It gave me far more room to improve on various skill synergies and properly prepare for a speedrun, which I ended up doing upon completion of NG+. Still just a 10/10 <3			"

Game difficulty can change drastically with ""Limiters"" (totally optional) that effect different aspects of enemies, use of abilities, and penalties for dying.

In addition, not only are the attack-animations different from each other, but the developers took the time for idle animation as well, for instance when Red's singing.Furthermore, the storytelling is great.

												This was a completely random purchase. Bought it on faith of a review I read ages ago in like Game Informer or something - and it's the best $20 I've spent on a game, period. I can honestly say that - in my opinion - this game is flawless.Pros:-Combat is innovative and doesn't get old. Even after you beat the game and recurse through it, you can change your functions so easily to have different effects. There's a lot of experimenting, and the game promotes that.-The art style is gorgeous. Everything goes together so well, even the Process and its spread through Cloudbank.-The soundtrack. Oh my god, the soundtrack. Where do I even start? Darren Korb makes the music fit constantly (whatever is playing fits where you are and the general tone of the game) and Ashley Barrett's voice (which you hear in the soundtrack more prominently, only occasionally in the game) is literally stunning. I've probably listened to her sing The Spine a hundred times, and I'll be repeating those hundred times over and over. There is no better soundtrack out there right now - nor will there be, I'm willing to bet.-The story is awesome! It's a little hard to pick up at points, but not so much that you'd miss something crucial. I'm not going into more depth than that.-Replayability. If you want to max that level out, you have to play it again - which means more combat combinations, maybe pick up on some of the story bits you may have missed, and MORE BADASS SOUNDTRACK YES.-There are characters with questionable sexuality, AND THE GAME DOES NOT JAM THAT DOWN YOUR THROAT. Yes, I think that's a good thing. Most games with characters that are gay/bi have to make it really obvious that they did. Transistor lets you catch it on your own, and...that's it. There's no parading it about, it's just a neat little thing you either find out or don't.Cons:-It's too short! D:Yes. That's the only bad part. And if that's the only bad part in a game, well...that speaks volumes by itself. Even at its full price of $20, this game is a STEAL at that value. I would've paid the full $60 typical new game price for this in a heartbeat. It's not frequent that you find a game this good - certainly in this day and age. But this? This is more than just an average game. This is a damn experience. This is art. Easily a 10/10. And I, personally, cannot WAIT to see what Supergiant Games pulls off next. Trust me - buy this game the second you can afford it. You won't regret it.			"

												TL;DR: Everything is either excellent or above average. Get it.Ok, so here's the review. I love this game, and it's one of my favorites. I'm going to do a run down of each part of the game.POSSIBLY LIGHT SPOILERS WARNINGOverview:Like Supergiant's last game, Bastion, Transistor is an isometric hack-and slasher with a good story and narrator. Story can be a little bit pretentious, but the combat provides a solid core and everything else is either excellent or good enough that I can reccomend this.Combat:This is what you'll be doing most of the time. While it starts off relativley simple, it gains depth as you aquire more Functions (your skills) from corpses you find. The main ""gimmick"" (but it's not really a gimmick) is being able to freeze time and plan what moves you'll use. You can freeze time, jump behind an enemy, and get a backstab with a melee ability. The combat is a bit complex, but you'll get the hang of it. You (eventually) get four active Function slots, each which can be buffed with two more Functions, and on top of that you can have 2 (or possibly 4 but that's hard to do) passive Functions. The only way to get story documents about corpses which gave you functions is to use the functions as an active, equiping another skill with it, and using it as a passive. This encourages trying new things with the combat. There are also things called Limiters, which you unlock over time. Equiping one makes the game harder, and tells you about the enemy it corresponds with. Combat: 8.5/10Story:The story is really good if you can figure out what's going on. The characters are mostly given depth through their Functions, because the only characters that talk are three of the villains and your sword. Red, the main character, is a singer who lost her voice because of the villains, which is all I can say without spoiling anything. The sword, getting to talk the most, is the most developed character, but Red is still the favorite of most fans. The story is great, but very confusing without reading some of the community's threads. It regards the cyberpunk city of Cloudbank, where the citizens democratically control what the sky looks like, what the weather is, and what buildings are constructed. (Can't say how without spoilers.) But patterns develop, and the system designed to bring novelty results in nothing changing. This leads to a terrorist orginization of Cloudbank's administrators killing off artists and the people who change the city, and eventually they release an evil called the Process on Cloudbank. The ending of the story is a gut-punch moment. Story: 8/10Aesthetic: While the art is great, it's nothing compared tO THE MUSIC IT'S AMAZING. (There are people who bought this game for the soundtrack and still haven't played it.) Aesthetic: 10/10So if you're looking for a short, replayable story based (slightly pretentious) hack and slasher with the greatest soundtrack of any game ever (seriously), Transistor is the game for you.Overall: 8.83			"

												""Proper story's supposed to start at the beginning. Ain't so simple with this one.""That was the first line said in Supergiant Games' debut RPG, Bastion. While the line was definitely fitting for the story of said game, I'd say that it's even more fitting for Transistor, the indie company's sophomore release. Transistor starts off with the protagonist, a famous singer named Red, standing over the silhouette of a man who had been impaled by a USB-stick sort of thing known as the Transistor. There is no information as to what lead up to this moment- the game starts here. For the next hour or two of my time in-game, I was constantly trying to imagine what exactly had happened. The game had me lost- in a good way. Transistor's story is, in some senses of the word, all over the place. But it was never too difficult to follow. I've yet to beat the game myself, but with the progress I've made, I'm definitely willing to say that it has one of the best stories out of any game I've played this year.And where there's a good story, Transistor also brings more good things. A lot of good things, really. For starters, the soundtrack is beautiful. Ashley Barrett, also known as Zia in Bastion, makes her return as the voice for Red- and the songs that she sings are better than ever. From the low humming that plays whenever you're in the Planning phase of combat, to the entirety of The Spine, Barrett is back, and better than ever.Speaking of the ""Planning phase of combat,"" Transistor brings about a new combat system that has been done before, but never quite as well-implemented as it was in Transistor. You can play the game like it's Diablo, sure- but this is incredibly dangerous, difficult, and most of the time, uneffective. The game also features a Planning phase, in which the character is able to move freely about in a frozen world, planning their movements and attacks. Very turn-based in style. Along with this unique combat system, Transistor features countless upgrades, many difficulty mutators in the style of the Shrine from Bastion, and the ability to string attacks together for devastating results. All in all, I may be a bit biased towards Transistor, as Bastion is arguably one of the best games I've ever played, but I without a doubt recommend this game. The $20 pricetag stirred me up a bit at first, but I can guarantee that it was worth it. Transistor is definitely an unforgettable experience that I cannot recommend you to buy enough. And while you're at it, buy Bastion. You won't regret it.			"

												Well, this here is a quality game. Lets start with its strengths: STORY, MUSIC, VISUALS, GAMEPLAY. Everything about this game shines immensley. Every aspect is so well polished I often had to take moments away from the game because it just got too impressive. That being said, there are some flaws... While the story was well executed there wasn't any exposition or call to action, which meant you don't progress because you want to save the land, you progress because you know thats where the story is. Also, the combat has a huge amount of depth and I wish they would have made some kind of multiplayer mode to accompany that. Finally, the game was a tad short. If we got that little bit of exposition that let us live a regular day in Red's world, it would have felt longer, but since we didn't, the game lacks the punch something like Mother 3 gives you. Still a good game, but it falls shy of being perfect. Like literally, centimeters away from perfection.BUY IT.			"

												I really like this game. The music is beautiful, as are the visuals. The voice acting is nice, tho there are some weird pauses between lines. I sometimes find myself waiting for the second half of a sentence that never comes, or thinking a line is done and then it continues a few seconds later. A little weird. But the quality is very high. And I love that sword guy's voice ;oPThe combat system is enjoyable. Lots and lots of options to play with. You have a number of skills that can be either used as a primary skill (like hit 'em with the sword, or shoot a bolt of energy at a distant foe), or they can be slotted into a different primary (like add damage, or AoE to some other skill), or they can be used to provide a more general buff (you have a damage shield, or all backstabs do more damage). That's really clever, and it is surprisingly intuitive to use. I'm a huge fan of the pause-time-and-queue-up-your-actions mechanic as well.I'd highly recommend it, if you're into RPGs.			"

												Another great title from Supergiant Games!You never get tried of the great narration of their stories. Immersive and overly complete, those who have loved Bastion will definetely enjoy Transistor as well. Logan Cunningham sets the tone once again in a gameplay mechanic that brings sparkles to your eyes, as you figure out endless ways of synergizing your abilities. The game offers a challenging and enjoyable experience, although, as for Bastion, it lacks depth. You will eventually get bored at replaying the same story over and over, even though it offers many ways to vary and challenge your ever more experienced self. Definetely worth the purchase, every cent.			"

												I can't recommend this game more - SuperGiant has combined fantastic story telling, wonderful characters, beautiful graphics, and spectacular music (really, buy the soundtrack too along with the game). It's a short story - realistically you can sit down and finish it in a single day - but like Bastion, it's an emotional touching story and the game has excellent replayability.  Transistor has easily become one of my absolute favorite games.			"

												Beautiful game, compelling story, and highly addictive gameplay. I played this game before Bastion and enjoyed every minute of it. Take note that this game doesn't hold your hand through the story or the combat (and you adjust the difficulty to suit you) and more or less throws you into both, and that might turn some gamers off. Short and sweet and improves with subsequent playthroughs. If you don't mind the length, I highly recommend it.			"

												Easily one of the best games I've ever played. I absolutely loved the story and the world. The story was short, sweet, and to the point; it didn't drag out, and it wrapped itself up with a nice definitive ending that left me with a sense of completion. The world was fleshed out wonderfully through side data and peripherals and the awesome soundtrack really helped me feel like I was in Cloudbank. In fact purchasing the soundtrack is pretty much one of the best decisions I've ever made. The combat is definitely where this game shines though. Challenging and rewarding, I really felt like there was a sense of creativity and 'playing your way' that I've rarely found in anything else. You can find whatever strategies float your boat and roll with them, and despite that the enemies aren't exactly pushovers either. Definitely worth every penny.			"

												Buy this game. Seriously. I would buy it dinner. Then I would end our night with a respectful kiss, awaiting the next time we could meet. Because this game is classy like that. It doesn't treat you like a gibbering man-ape and dump everything in your lap right at the start. It teases, it hints, I would say more but part of the allure is figuring out exactly what is going on for yourself.The only con I can think of is that it is on the short side, 5-6 hours for a playthrough stopping and doing everything possible. However, there is a recursion mode (New Game +) which allows you to play through it again with varying difficulty. I played through the game in one sitting and immediately hit the recursion button.Bottom line: It is beautiful in both sound and visuals, intriguing in story, wonderfully written and acted, causes an actual emotional reaction, and is an absolute joy to play.

												So, first review for Transistor:The game is pretty, both to the eyes and the ears. Music is solid (beyond solid, it's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing), the art style is gorgeous (sort of what would happen if you took the cel-shaded style of Bastion and crossed it with Art Deco), and the detail is good, but not overdone or too busy.The gameplay certainly won't be for everyone, but I like it. It's an interesting take on a ""tactical"" style, and the sheer variety of moves and ways to go about doing solving a fight are pretty keen. Lots of abilities to use, and multiple ways to tweak each ability, not to mention passive buffs. All of this while trying to maximize a cap on how much ""boom"" you can wade into a fight with at once.Only problem I have so far: some bugs definitely made it out of their QA department. Hard-crash bugs. This is a bad thing. It's not hitting everyone, and apparently it's better if you play it in Offline Mode on Steam. I'm guessing Supergiant Games is driving for a fix at the moment, because no studio likes handing out game crashes.So, yeah: I definitely recommend it. It's on the shorter side (haven't beat it yet, but I have a feeling), but beautiful, fun, and has a refreshing take on the mechanics of a platformer. Might just wanna wait a few days for the bugs to get squashed.			"

												Transistor is a beautifully writen and designed world with a soundtrack to match.  The gameplay is fast paced while balanced with the ""turn()"" mechanic allowing you to pause the world and plan out your next set of moves as they play out in a second or two of game time.  There are enough twists and turns in the story and mechanic to keep combat fresh and the backstory is revealed as you mix and match various moves and combos, encoraging experimentation.All in all I highly reccomend it.There are a few cons to be away of however.  The first is that as of now the game is a little buggy with the occasional hiccups, but so far I've seen nothing that has caused me to die or loose progress. Another issue is its length.  Your $20 will net you roughly 7 hours for your first play through.  While this is a fair trade in my opinion, you still got more for Basition's $15.This last issue aggrivates me as someone who shares a computer with his partner.  The game offers no support for multiple saves as Bastion did.  Beyond that, there seems to be no option to start the game over from scratch once you've beaten it.  In order to give my partner a chance to play the game I had to uninstall and reinstall the game, permanently destroying my playthough.  I can only view this design as a way to try and force partners to buy the game twice and is an affont to the concept of social gaming for the sake of nickle and diming their customer.			"

												Transistor uses a simple, but fantastically deep combat system that is sure to indulge fans of customization and optional difficulty. Enemies are varied and interesting, each having a different optimal strategy to be defeated without feeling like a gimmick, and the tactical dimension of combat added by the Turn() system is not to be underestimated. The game-world of Transistor and atmosphere are exquisite, not the least because of the stunning visuals and bold sound track. The city of Cloudbank is beautiful and feels alive and ripe for exploration. My only complaints lie in the delivery of the game's plot line: Transistor errs a little too heavily on the side of the player filling in the blanks. While I love deducing things about a game's greater environment, the primary plot occasionally required a lot of out-of-game legwork to just feel coherent.All in all, I would certainly recommend Transistor. It's a delight to play and explore, and a very worthy successor to Bastion.			"

It's sort of a meshing of real time action and turn-based calculative strategy combat.I personally found this to be a lot more fun than Bastion despite being a pretty short game. Gets a 9/10 from me.

												Supergiant has made another innovative game with great art, and this time, with superb gameplay. Unlike their last game, Bastion, Transistor has a much more in-depth combat system that is cool to toy around with. Now for what everyone's waiting for: the story. The story of Transistor is very similar to the one that was in Bastion's. Supergiant brings back many of the things we've loved from Bastion and puts in it Transistor. The game drops you into a world that is being torn apart, and you have to try and fix it. There is a narrator in the game that serves to tell the story about how the world around you was, although he takes a more laid back seat in his role in that instead of narrating every single thing you're doing, here, he'll talk to you as a companion and friend. While the fact that the story between the two games is almost identical, the main difference between the two games is the world you're dropped in, and why the world is being destroyed.You start off in not so much as a world that Supergiant has made, but a city called Cloudbank that is part of that world. Cloudbank has a Tron kind of feel, where it is unsure whether the characters you are seeing are really alive, or just some programs living in a digital world. On the one hand, when they die, their souls or processes go into your Transistor, giving you extra powers. On the other hand, the characters are exactly the same as human characters except for that fact. The game tries really hard to demonstrate this idea that even though every character in the game is some kind of computer program, they still have all behave differently and have flaws like normal humans. Characters end up having tons of personality, except instead of forcing you to learn about them, Transistor does this more subtly by giving you the choice to read about the lore of the world or not.The storytelling in the game has also been improved from Bastion. Instead of the singlular path of find all the cores, find all the shards, then find the last core and the last shard to power up the bastion machine, Transistor's story is a lot less linear and way more subtle. As said before, much of the story lies in the background of the powers you gain, as well as the OVC stations (pretty much the newspaper) that are placed around Cloudbank. Transistor focuses mainly on telling a good story but because of that, it ends a little short. By no means is Bastion a bad story, but it was practically one big fetch quest for 70% of the game, which was good because it made the game longer, but the story was made weaker and the weakness in its gameplay was made much more obvious. If anything, I wish this game was longer but at least the story doesnt feel as forced as Bastion, forcing you to continuously retrieve things to power the bastion. Your playthrough could last anywhere from 4-5 hours on the first playthroughbut there is a new game+ mode called recursion in the game that lets you keep all your abilities and your level as you start the game over again.Other than the story, the gameplay is the most noticeable improvement in Transistor. Instead of dodge rolling and then spamming left or right click, this game relies on 4 active skills that you can add 2 passive skills to each, and 4 passive skills that buff your character. Each and every skill you have can go into any of these categories and its up to you to mix and match each skill to fit your playstle. You use these 4 actives in combat and when you are in a pinch, you can use the pause mechanic which allows you to plan your attack. With these mechanics,Transistor is a much more tactical and interesting game  since you get to carry most, if not all, of your skills into combat with you into a fight. In the end, Transistor has taken many of the things in Bastions, and improved on them. The story has been made less linear, the gameplay has been totally rehauled, and you'll fall in love with the art style, the crumbling world, and the characters all over again.			"

												Another artsy game by the Supergiant Games, the makers of Bastion. The music and art are even better this time around. They are really excellent. The gameplay is pretty good and interesting with its stop, plan and excecute combat mechanics as well as the ability to mix the elements, which is encouraged by giving more backstory if you do it. Bit easy, but can be made harder by pretty dynamic difficulty levels. The storytelling is good too. It's very in media res. You are dropped in the world without as much as a start menu and left to figure out what's going on and how everything works. It's a simple enough game to pull that off. It's pretty short and fairly linear, though. Replayability value doesn't seem that great even with new game+, though I can imagine revisiting this at some point in the future.Superior to Bastion in almost every way, except maybe Logan Cunningham isn't quite as cool as the voice here as he was as the narrator in Bastion. Definitely worth getting, but I wouldn't pay the full price.			"

												Cut much from the same cloth as Bastion, Supergiant managed to do all of the things they did wonderfully with Bastion: art direction, amazing music, interesting narrative technique, etc., but in a new game rather than a sequel.			"

												SPECS:AMD-A6 5200 (3rd generation i3 equivalent) AMD Radeon HD8400 / R3 Series 512 MB4 gigs of RAM64-bit Windows 10What could be said for Transistor that hasn't been said before? Supergiant Games second game is a massive step forward from its previous title Bastion, and while gamers may argue over which is better; both are great. Where Transistor differs, is that Supergiant made a hybrid action RPG. Red has a ""turn"" function in the sense of traditional RPG battles; but by equipping Red's weapon with certain functions (they are found throughout the game) some will allow her to battle outside of her turn. Her weapon consists of four attacks that you slot functions into, these can then have up to 2 more functions attached increasing various attributes like damage or even combining skills.The tale of Transistor is one I don't want to spoil, and lasting only 6 hours even while searching every dark corner of the world, I was left pondering what would I do in the end. Some gamers may not enjoy the combat and originally I felt the same. Despite the game tutorials being pretty straightforward, once you find a basic setup for the functions you can nearly button mash your way to end.Transistors art design is brilliant, everything within the city and its characters seem inspired by the art deco / streamline era of the 1930's and Supergiant has never disappointed and I go so far as to say outdone and surpassed anyones expectation with the music in Transistor. I urge everyone that reads this to look up the soundtrack and give it listen.If Supergiant asked if there was anything I could change with Transistor, I would probably say to remove the Performance challenges. I know they are possible, but ultimately I feel that any type of challenges is unnecessary filler and the effort could have gone to adding additional areas and bosses or expanded story elements.			"

												Had this for a while, didn't get to finishing it until now.The game's shining feature is its artwork of course -- as usually what I feel gets Supergiant Games' awards 90% of the time.  You can delve into the game's ""deep"" story by Inspecting the abilities you gain at certain points of the game -- as the abilities you gain are from dead citizens of the city you're trying to save, which are absorbed into the Transistor.  This player kinda glossed over the story, because as usual I play games for the gameplay.  As I did enjoy the gameplay itself, I feel it has a few problems. The combat and core gameplay definitely has its merits, and can be quite enjoyable.  It touts the whole ""player's choice gimmick"" of either going for more Turn-based gameplay or real-time.   Unfortunately, the game can push you into one or the other, and it's a lot of trial-and-error to figure out which situation suits which playstyle -- and which techniques you should have equipped.  Then of course, you can be punished harshly by having to wait for your Turn meter to build back up in order to use any abilities (Jaunt discluded), getting Tech uninstalled (by getting your life drained all the way) or by dying and having to restart from the last Access (Save) point.  And pending on what you have after you've lost a certain ability in battle,  you might as well restore your save point anyway.I've found a lot of times towards the ending, and more challenging parts like some of the Tests you can do, there's really no point to do real-time combat, because the game can get very spammy, and almost every ability you have has a stop-wind-up, and cool-down animation which can really get you hurt.   And SPOILERS -- the final boss uses Turn, so pretty much forces you to do the same.Developers like Supergiant get super praised for a lot of their gameplay designs from Bastion and this very game, but I feel they give an ILLUSION of strategy and thought that a lot of players get fooled over.  This game barely has any strategy.  Yes, you have a wide variety of abilities to learn and tune to your liking, but in the end, there's really only 2 or 3 most effective set ups you'll find to use.  It's worth a playthrough, and I'll even say worth the $20. It's more fine-tuned than the cluster♥♥♥♥ that was Bastion -- though that one was fun too in certain ways.  Bastion had a lot of enemy hell spam, and this game can get to that point towards the end of the game.  7/10			"

An indie game of high quality you can expect from the makers of Bastion. However, be aware the combat is very different from Bastion, but is still really well designed and fun in its own right. It's sort of a meshing of real time action and turn-based calculative strategy combat.I personally found this to be a lot more fun than Bastion despite being a pretty short game. Gets a 9/10 from me. And because this is the internet my opinion is a fact. Buy it. You won't regret it.			"

												Great game with very beautiful presentation.Enjoyed it a great deal more than Bastion, since the combat in Transistor is more about planning and experimentation rather than quick reflexes.The only bummer is the campaign is quite short and the dificulty of the game is quite easy, even on Recursion mode with all the Limiters turned on. I wished the developers could have added a super hard secret hidden boss battle with 100k HP similar to the ones in JRPGs, since it is so much fun to toy around the different weapon combinations and dealing the most maximum damage output. Alas, you're stuck experimenting maximum damage on the Practice Room.However, I'd still recommend buying this game. It's a very well-crafted game from Supergiant Games, and I am very looking forward for their next project.			"

												I've never been moved to tears upon playing a video game until now. Despite the obvious flaws that the game has, (bugs, crashes, framerate issues) the game is carried by the weight of the story alone. While the gameplay was fantastic, it isn't the greatest video game I've ever played, but it's one of the greatest, if not the greatest, stories I've ever been told. The only thing that truly saddened me with Transistor was the mere fact that I didn't have more time to spend in Red's world. Without a doubt, I would recommened this game to anyone that cares for a story in video games. For anyone that claims that a video game can never truly be a work of art, this would be my go to game to show them.			"

												The lovely art style of Bastion evolves into something much darker and sci-fi in tone. The gameplay evolves into something much more complex with an easy to pick up (yet, difficult to master) play style. The narrative is stronger, shorter, tighter, and leaves a world you really want to know more about. A great (albeit shorter) action//RPG hybrid that's tough to put down until you finish it.

												Very quickly going up to one of my favourite games this year, Transistor is everything I could have wanted from a Supergiant Games title. The combat is fluid and tactical and can be played in both a real-time hack-and-slash type affair or using the tactical Turn() mechanic similar to that of V.A.T.S. in the Fallout series.The storyline is an unsurprising ride of emotion and characterisation. The character of Transistor provides a similar commentary to Rucks in Bastion but on a much more personal level.I can't recommend this title enough, well done Supergiant and thank you for such a great title.

You star as Red, a woman who can't speak (not entirely voiceless, mind you) and the talking sword, the Transistor.The game is definitely for strategy junkies, since you can't do combat without a certain function, or else you'll most likely die.

												Transistor uses a simple, but fantastically deep combat system that is sure to indulge fans of customization and optional difficulty. Enemies are varied and interesting, each having a different optimal strategy to be defeated without feeling like a gimmick, and the tactical dimension of combat added by the Turn() system is not to be underestimated. The game-world of Transistor and atmosphere are exquisite, not the least because of the stunning visuals and bold sound track. The city of Cloudbank is beautiful and feels alive and ripe for exploration. My only complaints lie in the delivery of the game's plot line: Transistor errs a little too heavily on the side of the player filling in the blanks. While I love deducing things about a game's greater environment, the primary plot occasionally required a lot of out-of-game legwork to just feel coherent.All in all, I would certainly recommend Transistor. It's a delight to play and explore, and a very worthy successor to Bastion.			"

												Interesting story/setting.  Combat plays more like a puzzle, with the puzzle being as hard as you decide to make it using optional settings (limiters) you gain through the game.  Single playthrough took me 8 hours, but you get the option for a NG+ that also changes the dialogue you experience the second time through; which gives another perspective on the narrative.  As expected from Supergiant, the art and soundtrack are excellent.  The game at times can feel like walking through the work of Gustav Klimt.  The soundtrack is a largely ambient set of aucoutic guitars and subtle electronic puncutated by vocal hums.  The game also features a couple full tracks with lovely lyrics.The negatives for me were related to the amount of menu activity.  Pieces of backstory and character information are hidden in skills you use, and using the skills in different ways unlocks more of that information.  In order to change how your skills are arranged (to use them differently), you have to visit a menu and shuffle things around between most combat sequences.  It's not a big deal, but slows down the feel of progression and the pace of your play.  It feels tedius.  Granted, you could skip the unlocking of this information and stick to a skill arrangement your comfortable with.  Additionally, some skill arrangements work better for some fights than others, and you don't have any way to predict what the next fight will be, so you usually have to fail the combat sequence to go readjust for the fight.When you're out of the menu's and fighting, you do appreciate the maleability of the skills.  Using any single skill as either an active, augmenting, or passive ability and over a dozen skills, you can create what feels like an endlessly diverse series of offensive arrangments.  Really cool.Overall, a very positive experience.  Definitely worth the $19.99 price tag on release.			"

												I don't review many games, but Transistor, much like SuperGiant's previous title, Bastion, exceeded my expectations on all fronts.This game is a tremendously soulful piece of work, and from the very start to the very end, is first and foremost a work of art. The music, narration, artistic style and presentation flow together in a way that I would probably say outclasses almost any other game i've played. Anyone with a quibble of curiousity and a penchant for great games, or even works of art, should immediately purchase Transistor (AND Bastion) and enjoy the ride.To touch on the gameplay itself, the combat is inventive and blends several previously done elements (pseudo-turn based combat, action queues, tactical-execution-based combat) into a pretty seamless and enjoyable experience. It is two parts arcade, one part strategic pause-and-think game. It remains fresh and has a lot of room for player creativity due to the openly configurable nature of abilities acquired throughout the game.What follows are some brief pros/cons:Pros:+Incredible Art. From music to artwork, this entire game is a masterpiece.+Gameplay. The combat remains fresh, enjoyable, and creative all the way through.+Difficulty.  Like bastion, difficulty is born of modifiers you can apply to enemies, which give you bonuses for being brave.+Storyline.  Again, this is a work of art and the storyline is rich, heartfelt, and incredibly immersive.+Soundtrack.  Incredible, as usual.Cons:-Length.   The game itself isn't that long, although there are excuses to re-play the game with new conditions and toy around with the combat some more.That's really all I can see anyone really griping about with this game.In total, I'd give Transistor a 9.5/10, as one of the most absolutely awesome pieces of work i've seen in terms of gaming. It isn't a triple-A 40 hour experience... but it's an incredibly rich, artistic romp through an engaging and incredibly envisioned city of Cloudbank.9.5/10-Colt			"

												Honestly... I was expecting some game like a Bastion. And Transistor is like a Bastion... a very good game with interesting original story and excellent soundtrack; just press TAB in a game and haroine will start a humm : ) to the music!...and I can't forgot, this game have REALLY AWESOME fight system. Partly real-time, partly turn-based.Simply, You stop the time. Plan your moves, attacks, evasions, corruption of enemies, etc.Then You press a space and your turn is executed within a second. But... after that You have to wait for your turn again (but in the real time). It is like you combined chess, when your opponent have turn after You, but you can still move too.+ it is really good that every skill which You've found can have three functions:Main skill, support skill, passive skill = and its only up to You how you will mix themSo don't wait and try this game. It is really good!			"

												Absolutely brilliant. The soundtrack, story and characters(as few as there were) could have made a visual novel all on its own but Transistor tops it all off by having an amazing and permutable battle system. Not even counting the special Turn() based strategic battling, the sheer number of choices, combinations and OPTIONS you have to battle is insanely staggering.You can pick 4 actives, 2 upgrades per active, and 4 passive abilities. With a total of 16 different choices to slot into any of those. The numbers seem 'small' but doing a bit of math on this and I realize I can't properly account for all the situations and duplicate abilities you can also have later on. Not only that, but the order of the abilities even matters for some cases, amplifying or accidentally nullifying what you're trying to do.The amount of ways you can tailor your skills, number in the hundred thousands, if not the millions and that's not even including your own personal playstyle, timing and strategies. This is a game that rivals many others in sheer options of battle choices while maintaining a subtle yet engaging storyline. I can honestly say I felt this game was a true masterpiece, battle, story, art, soundtrack, replayability. God damn.			"

												If you're looking for a game that sets a mood, lets you escape, and has simple but challenging gameplay, you've found it.  If you're familiar with Bastion, you are likely to recognize Supergiant's atmospheric touch in this game.  This game is shorter and has a less fleshed out plot.  Like Bastion, mysteries are left to your imagination, unanswered.  However, the brevity of this game will leave you wishing there were more mysteries to boggle over.The combat is moderately strategic.  If your mood is too specific, you might be disappointed, whether you're looking for simple combat or serious strategy.  It has more of a balance between simplicity and strategy. It's fun for what it is.Replay value is mildly elevated by the New Game+ style recursion mode.   Overall, I'd recommend this game.Pros: -The music and other atmospheric elements are exceptional.  Supergiant sets a high standard for game atmosphere. -The main gameplay mechanic is fun and allows for experimentation with the various function (skill/upgrade) combos.Cons: -As stated above, the game is shorter than I'd like (needs more plot points).

												This is the only game I have ever reviewed on steam. And that's because it's this good. Back in the dark times of my piracy days I torrented this game and played through it and stopped after the end credits. And it's not like I didn't want to play again, actually it is one of the few games I ever wanted to play again, and the only one I wanted to start immediately after the first playthrough. The reason I stopped myself was that I knew right away I would buy that game and play through it at least two more times. And now, when my library is getting close to 500 and my days on the Torrent Seas are long past, it still holds true. It is my second favourite game of all time, the first place being held forever by WC III The Frozen Throne on the sole principle that I probably spent more time playing and talking about that game that I spent doing literally anything else. Transistor settled above FF VII, all three Bioshocks, entire Witcher trilogy, Planescape Torment, Dragon Age, Dark Souls and so many others exquisite games. And I can't even properly say why. The game is short, and even though the plot is easy to follow, if you want to get the full story it requires skill grinding. But the gameplay is so good, and said grinding made so much fun by the various ways you can put the skills together, that even I, being allergic to the idea of grinding ever since the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Golden Saucer (I still don't know if Omnislash was worth it...) wasn't bored even for a nanosecond. And, well, the story is so worth it, the picture of Cloudbank painted through the various character profiles fascinated me more than many worlds in other, more straightforward stories. And at the same time it is a complete experience on it's own, which, to be honest, could also be a minus. Those 12+ hours are two playthroughs, but after the first one the story was pretty much complete, only one or two character profiles to finish. There was very little to talk about with my friends. The reason this could be a minus comes from the fact that another game that forces you to look for the full story *ekhmDarkSoulsekhm* comes to mind, and that one resulted in hours of speculations. Still, this is no Dark Souls, and I can't say I feel this lack of ambiguity is a fault on games part. I was really satisfied with how the story unfolds, the resolution of that build-up towards confrontation with Camerata, and the ending. Yes, the ending was at the same time probably my favourite in all fiction I had ever come in contact with, and the reason I nominated this game for ""I'm not crying..."" Award. OK, I'm gonna stop myself now, before I write another two pages of a love letter to Supergiant Games for this masterpiece, I probably made myself clear. The gameplay is a surprising and surprisingly well executed mix of action and tactical RPG, the story is great, the ""interactions"" between two main characters are brilliant, the game is incredibly fun. Oh yeah, and the ""Great Soundtrack"" on those tags is definitely not just for show, but nothing I could write would do it justice. Suffice to say I've been listenin to it on the train  for most of the last two years. Damn, it's been two years... If the ""hrs on record"" on record is higher than 12,5 I probably replayed that again. And again in some not far future. But seriously, this game is awesome :D			"

												SPECS:AMD-A6 5200 (3rd generation i3 equivalent) AMD Radeon HD8400 / R3 Series 512 MB4 gigs of RAM64-bit Windows 10What could be said for Transistor that hasn't been said before? Supergiant Games second game is a massive step forward from its previous title Bastion, and while gamers may argue over which is better; both are great. Where Transistor differs, is that Supergiant made a hybrid action RPG. Red has a ""turn"" function in the sense of traditional RPG battles; but by equipping Red's weapon with certain functions (they are found throughout the game) some will allow her to battle outside of her turn. Her weapon consists of four attacks that you slot functions into, these can then have up to 2 more functions attached increasing various attributes like damage or even combining skills.The tale of Transistor is one I don't want to spoil, and lasting only 6 hours even while searching every dark corner of the world, I was left pondering what would I do in the end. Some gamers may not enjoy the combat and originally I felt the same. Despite the game tutorials being pretty straightforward, once you find a basic setup for the functions you can nearly button mash your way to end.Transistors art design is brilliant, everything within the city and its characters seem inspired by the art deco / streamline era of the 1930's and Supergiant has never disappointed and I go so far as to say outdone and surpassed anyones expectation with the music in Transistor. I urge everyone that reads this to look up the soundtrack and give it listen.If Supergiant asked if there was anything I could change with Transistor, I would probably say to remove the Performance challenges. I know they are possible, but ultimately I feel that any type of challenges is unnecessary filler and the effort could have gone to adding additional areas and bosses or expanded story elements.			"

												Another artsy game by the Supergiant Games, the makers of Bastion. The music and art are even better this time around. They are really excellent. The gameplay is pretty good and interesting with its stop, plan and excecute combat mechanics as well as the ability to mix the elements, which is encouraged by giving more backstory if you do it. Bit easy, but can be made harder by pretty dynamic difficulty levels. The storytelling is good too. It's very in media res. You are dropped in the world without as much as a start menu and left to figure out what's going on and how everything works. It's a simple enough game to pull that off. It's pretty short and fairly linear, though. Replayability value doesn't seem that great even with new game+, though I can imagine revisiting this at some point in the future.Superior to Bastion in almost every way, except maybe Logan Cunningham isn't quite as cool as the voice here as he was as the narrator in Bastion. Definitely worth getting, but I wouldn't pay the full price.			"

												Transistor and Bastion are probably two of the best games I've played for a long time. The amount of work the devs have placed into both of them is absolutely gigantic, creating a game that is polished from back to front. I usually have some nitpicks in every game I play, but Transistor is definitely an exception. The graphics are truly magnificent to the eye. There's detail to every little thing in every level, keeping your eyes in constant appreciation of the artwork in the game. It doesn't get boring not even in the slightest. I think if I ever did buy a soundtrack in my life, it'd be Transistor's soundtrack. The music is incredibly elegant, adding extra feeling to the visuals of the game. These two coupled with the fascinating gameplay clash together into a wonderful mix of ""this game is the best thing I've ever played"" kind of game. The gameplay keeps you on board the game nonstop, never getting you unattached. There's tons of upgrades you can get, lots of synergies with those upgrades, and a whole variety of attacks you can do. Voice acting, just like Bastion, is still at its best in Transistor. It doesn't feel cringey, doesn't feel forced, it's fluent and the remarks they make throughout the game keep you hooked up. Difficulty is a big thing in this game. It starts off simple but when you start progressing, it gradually increases and increases, up to a point where some battles do feel like a true challenge. Just like in Bastion, you can boost up the challenge with certain mechanics that stump some of your abilities, but you get rewarded with extra XP. On sale this game is at $3.99. You'll be missing a masterpiece if you don't get it at this price. Game lasts more than 12 hours and is also highly replayable. I recommend you to get this game for once.			"

												One of the most impressive visual environments I have seen in a game. The combat mechanics are deep and have just enough challenge to require a few retries. The story is cryptic and melancholy, forcing you to work out what happened gradually as the game progresses. And... for a working bloke such as myself, it is mercifully short, at just around 5-6 hours.			"

												I think I came a little from Red's voice.....What do you mean, ""That's not natural?""Don't knock it till you try it.No, but really. This game earns a   9.3/10  and is still one of the most audio-engaging games i've ever played to date, maybe only rivaled by Audio surf.Words can't even describe how utterly beautiful and magnificient this game is. This game is artistically a treat to your eyes. Seriously, sometimes just take a moment to ""take it all in' This is a game meant to be a visual spectacle, and it clearly wants you to take a moment to look at it.  If we really judged games by aesthetics alone, then it easily earns a solid 10/10 for it's unique ""Interactable Painting""-Esque world that just oozes style and personality like it's distance cousin: Bastion.However, in a world where we judge a game by multiple factors, I will give it a fair review.This easily earns a solid 10/10 for it's art style. Gameplay can be jagged sometimes, as there's ever only three real stages of the combat: 1. Plotting your Turn()2. Fleeing from enemies during Turn() Recovery.3. Psuedo-Combat in realtime, in which most enemies outright dodge your attacks unless you carefully plan. However, it's still engaging. The sheer amount of customizations done with your functions, and all the nifty and unique combinations that can be made from them is absoloutely stellar, and provides a deep ""Play how you want to play"" feeling to the game.The difficulty can be artificially tweaked by enabling ""Limiters"" which power up the enemies in exchange for more EXP. It's worth it, for the most part. However by late game some of the Limiter's are fairly hard to keep up with, so be careful.So as as such, the combat earns a 8.5/10, with a bit of room for improvement, mostly on some of the odd-looking animations that accompany Red's moves, and a lack of real in-between for the Turn() Planning period.The Story of the game is told through the functions you find, whether they be extracted from the data of people, or enemies you defeat, reading is essential. There is a post about the story of Transistor, and it is a decent story filled with some intrigue and computer-geek jokes that some people might not catch unless they're pretty saavy in the computer sciences.Lastly, and probably the second most important part of this game I feel, is the BGM. Oh lordy, probably my favorite part of this game, the OST is hands down one of the most ear-pleasing experiences known to man. It's hard to argue that this game doesn't just compell you to listen to the BGM, you grow an utter appreciation for the atmosphere it creates. The best part of the game is when you learn to simply ""Hum"" with Red by holding Tab. Try it out! Once you learn how to Flourish, you also learn how to Hum. I'd say I spent many a 20 minutes or so simply listening to red ""Hum"" songs at various points. Absoloutely amazing. Earns an easy 9.5/10, only deducting .5 because you aren't given the ability to ""Hum' at the very start of the game. With that said, I'd say the game comes out to be a pretty solid 9.3/10 with a definite ""Recommend This Game"" from me. I hope you get to enjoy it too~  "

Great soundtrack! I liked it better than Bastion's, honestly. Great art! Again, better than Bastion's.Gameplay is greaaaaat! I absolutely loved how the function system worked, and the limiter system also proved to be a good challenge (until you get the big functions which pretty much nullifies every challenge there is to the game. But that's a good thing because you only get that on NG+.)Story is meh. Bastion's was better. A lot of the things in the game are left unexplained, and by a lot, I mean, almost everything from what the hell the Transistor is to why the ♥♥♥♥ did the final boss battle happen in that place. A lot of it is left to the imagination of the player. Length is meh as well. The game is short. I only spent 11 and a half hours on the game to get all achievements.Replayability is nonexistent. After the first recursion (NG+), you shouldn't find any more reason to play it again, except probaly when you haven't gotten all achievements yet. I loved Transistor better than Bastion because unlike Bastion, Transistor felt less of the traditional RPG mainly due to its function system. I'd recommend this to anybody who likes different stuff in their RPG. Though the story is lacking and the game is short, this game kinda shows that Supergiant Games is taking the right steps towards making new games. I just hope that their next game could actually stand alongside this great game, or even top it. Anything else might just be a disappointment. Grading fairly though, I'd give this a 7.75 out of 10 because I want more of it. Please.  "

 IF YOU LIKED BASTION, YOU GONNA LOVE THIS ONE!STORY and GAMEPLAY: Its amazing.. thats all I have to say. well written and the story traps you in a way that you will fall in love with it and thats just the beginning.. the revelations... and the stuff that happends when you go further into the story!. its really great. tho its short but still amazing.While the gameplay is really something else. might not be for everyone or you might get confused by it but once you get the hang of the combat system, its a cake walk. for me it was an exelent turn based combat. you gotta be strategic in every move you make and the power ups.. oboy.. you have a few options to experiment on!. you can even make the game harder for yourself if you want with the ""Limiters"" that the transistor has. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC and ART:  Outstandingly beautiful both of them. the music is just amazing, one of my favorites for sure and one of the best, you get from catchy songs to songs that have deep messages on them!, the art style is just a treat for you to look at!. really beautiful scenarios kinda looking a bit steampunk, ya gonna love it, if you like steampunk style.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHARACTERS and VA: = Theres a few characters here and there in this game... we have our protagonist RED that she can interact with OVC terminals to know about what happend or whats going on in that moment. Then we have Logan Cunningham aka The man inside the Transistor. He narrates during the story and staying with RED and fighting along side her, he also like Bastion. he makes remarks here and there depending on whats the player doing or interacting with. Theres the bad guys too.. but I dont wanna spoil anything.  tho I wish there was more background on them. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OVERALL: 9.80 Transistor is a beautiful and awesome game, enjoyeable at 10%!. Outstanding soundtrack and beautiful art.. tho a bit short. once you finish it.. you would be like: ""I want more of this!"". The story is really good no matter what, we got touching moments to plot twists!. The game also includes a New game+ for those who want to keep playin! and to add a bit of replayability, the game is very enjoyeable and entertaining for sure. this is why I recomend ya to grab this if you havent yet!See ya in the country.

												Writing this before I start with NG+ ..As someone who loved Bastion; a game which I still need to 100% but haven't for good reason, I'm not surprised by how beautiful this game is.After completing the first playthrough, there's only one downside I can see. Even with fully exploring levels and listening to all the great and rather touching narrative, the story is pretty short and can be played through within 5 hours. But if anything, I think this game can get away with it because there's a good amount of replay value due to the 'function' mechanics. Not to mention, it does introduce a few new things in new game plus. NG+ / Recursion is a necessity for those seeking to 100% this game as well as playing around with all the different abilities, which I think is great because you may discovering awesome new combos and builds this way. For that matter, the content is built well enough to keep one occupied.For those who are not obsessed with achievements, the game offers more than enough in terms of story, visuals and sound. The artwork is drop dead gorgeous, it's like Bastion's except sci-fi to put it bluntly. If you break it down, the story isn't really unique or in any way complex, but it's the narration of it that makes it truly shine. ..also much like in Bastion. For me, I found the narrative in Transistor to be more stirring though I think it really depends on how susceptible you are to certain kinds of reading. Words can't describe on how beautiful and enthralling the music is, a more than fitting background that makes way for a remarkable and gorgeous experience for one and all.It goes without saying that every game's aspects are subject to personal opinion. But if you loved Bastion, you will love Transistor. In any other case, the game is a marvel on it's own and in my opinion, well worth it's price if not for the music alone.			"

Great fusion of action points based planning with cooldown timer and real time action.(You get to activate a mode that freezes everything and allows you to plan moves, might not execute the way you want it exactly. Also a penalty of disabling all function use after activating said feature unless you have a modifier attached to a function. If you wonder what functions are, just think them as weapons you can use, and those weapons can also be used as a weapons modifier, tons of combinations to pummel everything in your way lul)			"

												The main problem with Transistor is that it's almost, but not entirely, completely unlike Bastion.  The story is intriguing, the setting is enticing, and the combat is incredibly customizable, but every so often, I was struck by how similar to something in Bastion part of the game felt.  Supergiant did a good job distancing themselves from the ideas they had from their first game for the most part yet certain plot points and game aspects, like the narrator responding to the little things you do and telling the story that way made Transistor feel not quite as fresh as it could have been.  The similar art style and same voice actors certainly didn't help, but Supergiant is a small company, so that's understandable.  Besides, the game does look incredible.I want to mention the combat again, because it's stellar.  You enter a planning phase, stringing together attacks and movements and then executing them super fast in real time.  Afterwards, you have to dodge enemies' attacks and survive until you can enter your planning phase again.  I'm sure that's not unique, but the fact that your combat abilities are made up of various Functions(), each of which can serve as a primary attack, a secondary modifier, or a passive buff ability, allows you to modify your skill set in an unimaginable variety of ways.  You're even rewarded for switching up your playstyle, since using different Functions() in different ways unlocks backstory about aspects of the world.The enemies are refreshing, too, especially when they start to unlock more powerful abilities.  Fetch can go ♥♥♥♥ itself, though.  Those things is super overpowered and I hate fighting them.			"

												This game.. is amazing. Ok, so what I will tell you is purely 100% based on my own experience.EDIT: I now officially own this beautiful game :DFirst part of the game is very confusing and a let down for me to see ""RED"" dragging the greatsword, for I don't like to see anyone dragging a greatsword.Moreover, RED can't swing the greatsword! she stab the ground with it and I speak to myself. THEY ACTUALLY GAVE THIS GAME 9+ RATING?! THIS CAN'T BE!then.. I was wrong, I try to overcome that and not for long, I see the beauty of Transistor as the game became easier and understandable every single chapter.Pros:- Very nice settings- Nice story line / plot- The combat system.. makes you crave for more combats when you're at middle / late game- Very original gameplay- The soundtrack.. omg.. the first time I heard Red sings The Spine. I instantly go to steam layer website and search youtube for it and hear it for 1 hours straight.Cons:- (This shouldn't be considered as cons but..) Rather depressing feeling coz you're (most of the time) alone- Red dragging the transistor ( still shouldn't be considered as cons)yep.. no Cons tbh.overall 9.8/10			"

This game to me was, and is still estonishing. The artwork is absolutely gorgeous, thanks Jen Zee. And Ashley Barrett coming back with her amazing vocals is just breathtaking. I am obsessed with the OST. The story is also so unique, just like Bastion's. Which I love love love. And the tacticts of the game are pretty unique as well.

												It took a while for Transistor to really hook me (about 2/3 of the way through my first playthrough), but at that point I went from mildly disappointed (I really loved Supergiant's previous game, Bastion), to entirely satisfied.  I think the reason for all this is that the combat system is really quite deep, and it took a lot of experimentation before I really started understanding the potential there.  I'm playing it through a second time now and really enjoying it.Aside from the mechanics, the game is beautiful and the soundtrack is excellent.  The story is really intriguing and told in a very minimal way.   A lot of it is told through short voice clips, but if you want to learn more about what is happening, you can also get snipets of story through interacting with the environment, from experimenting with the combat system or from reading message boards :)  Even the way the soundtrack is done complements the story.  I didn't play Bastion on new game+ because I felt like I experienced the whole thing and was satisfied at the end.  I think Transistor essentially requires a second playthrough because there's so much subtle detail packed in that you are bound to miss a lot of it the first time through.  Transistor is a really excellent game, but it is especially rewarding if you are willing to put some effort in.			"

												I think I came a little from Red's voice.....What do you mean, ""That's not natural?""Don't knock it till you try it.No, but really. This game earns a   9.3/10  and is still one of the most audio-engaging games i've ever played to date, maybe only rivaled by Audio surf.Words can't even describe how utterly beautiful and magnificient this game is. This game is artistically a treat to your eyes. Seriously, sometimes just take a moment to ""take it all in' This is a game meant to be a visual spectacle, and it clearly wants you to take a moment to look at it.  If we really judged games by aesthetics alone, then it easily earns a solid 10/10 for it's unique ""Interactable Painting""-Esque world that just oozes style and personality like it's distance cousin: Bastion.However, in a world where we judge a game by multiple factors, I will give it a fair review.This easily earns a solid 10/10 for it's art style. Gameplay can be jagged sometimes, as there's ever only three real stages of the combat: 1. Plotting your Turn()2. Fleeing from enemies during Turn() Recovery.3. Psuedo-Combat in realtime, in which most enemies outright dodge your attacks unless you carefully plan. However, it's still engaging. The sheer amount of customizations done with your functions, and all the nifty and unique combinations that can be made from them is absoloutely stellar, and provides a deep ""Play how you want to play"" feeling to the game.The difficulty can be artificially tweaked by enabling ""Limiters"" which power up the enemies in exchange for more EXP. It's worth it, for the most part. However by late game some of the Limiter's are fairly hard to keep up with, so be careful.So as as such, the combat earns a 8.5/10, with a bit of room for improvement, mostly on some of the odd-looking animations that accompany Red's moves, and a lack of real in-between for the Turn() Planning period.The Story of the game is told through the functions you find, whether they be extracted from the data of people, or enemies you defeat, reading is essential. There is a post about the story of Transistor, and it is a decent story filled with some intrigue and computer-geek jokes that some people might not catch unless they're pretty saavy in the computer sciences.Lastly, and probably the second most important part of this game I feel, is the BGM. Oh lordy, probably my favorite part of this game, the OST is hands down one of the most ear-pleasing experiences known to man. It's hard to argue that this game doesn't just compell you to listen to the BGM, you grow an utter appreciation for the atmosphere it creates. The best part of the game is when you learn to simply ""Hum"" with Red by holding Tab. Try it out! Once you learn how to Flourish, you also learn how to Hum. I'd say I spent many a 20 minutes or so simply listening to red ""Hum"" songs at various points. Absoloutely amazing. Earns an easy 9.5/10, only deducting .5 because you aren't given the ability to ""Hum' at the very start of the game. With that said, I'd say the game comes out to be a pretty solid 9.3/10 with a definite ""Recommend This Game"" from me. I hope you get to enjoy it too~  "

												Short but sweet. Transistor is an isometric action RPG with beautiful art design, an addictive and unique combat system with loads of customisation and an intriguing storyline that requires some actual thinking on the player's part to fully understand. It also has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game. The whole concept would be truly unique if not for Supergiant Games' previous title Bastion, and fans of that game will no doubt feel right at home with Transistor. It is a fairly short game, taking about 7-10 hours to complete, but it's a truly enjoyable experience throughout and definitely worth the asking price. The controls are very well optimised for both kb+m and a controller. Graphical options are pretty much non-existent, but the game looks absolutely gorgeous and should run just fine even on older PC's.			"

The writing in this game and how the story progresses will make you ignore how linear the game is. How things end are unlike those cliche stuff where... letting myself go on will just give out spoilers.The story, the music and the visual style; the overall immersion this game can get you in makes it worth full price.

												I don't know how Supergiant does it. I really don't. They make a game that shares so many traits with Bastion, so it starts out feeling familiar and it reminds you how good Bastion is. Then they end up turning out a completely unique game with its own mechanics, atmosphere, pacing, you name it. I adore Bastion, and Transistor, I think, is right there on the same level. Top notch gameplay. Top notch narrative. Top notch music because Darren Korb is the man. Now I just want the next Supergiant game, especially if they keep turning out games like these.			"

												Hello world!Supergiant comes back with another installment, same narrator (or at least the same actor), world still falling apart, but this time, it's in the future!For Bastion fans, Transistor has all of the flavors of  Bastion, with a whole new story and significantly changed combat elements.Combat this time often time involves the usage of the ""Turn()"" ability.Turn() is essentially a planning phase where you can plan out your attacks, then when you execute, it happens instantaneously, then you have a recharge time before it can be used again.Being in the non-discript space future, there are a decent amount of programming references embedded into the game.As a programmer, I thought that was kinda cool, because I felt like I had a secret hand shake with the developers saying ""Hey, I got that!""Even if you're not a programmer, those minor references don't really effect the story at all, so nothing will be missed by anyone that plays this game.So to break down the pieces, gameplay, I would say is equivalent to the level that Bastion output.Music, dare I say, better than Bastion. The song for the trailer, We All Become was fantastic. Old Friends was great as well.Combat, personally, I liked it. I've heard some friends that preferred Bastion's combat system to Transistor, but I'm definitely a fan of RPGs, and Transistor feels more like an RPG with its system.Story, I'm kind of mixed. Shortly in, it becomes apparent that there are elements of romance. My video game taste palate initially wasn't expected a romance, but grew to accept and even really like where it took the story.All of those elements combined, it makes this game one of my absolute favorites.I would absolutely recommend it.Gotta get that ten outta ten!System.exit(0) || return 0; //Whichever you prefer.

												Bastion was a massive success for Super Giant Games. Most people have played it and numerous gamers own it on at least two different machines. With that in mind it would have been easy for the studio to release a sequel or spiritual successor to it. We’d all have played it, loved it, and raved about it. Transistor is not like Bastion.Starting in a beautifully depicted futuristic city scape you pull an electronic sword from a body and you’re on your way. No explanation is given and no background about the world or yourself is forthcoming. The player, like the character you control is thrown in, as if awakening from some strange dream and this gives a wonderful sense of mystery and discovery as you progress.From the outside this may look to share some similarities with Bastion. The perspective is the same and there is also a narrator of sorts, although he is talking to the female protagonist as you go. Right at the start you begin to think this is going to be another hack and slash but then about five minutes in it asks you to hit the freeze button and everything changes.Here, you suddenly realise you are actually in a real time/turn based cross over style RPG. You can execute attacks in real time (and even boost them to activate almost instantly), but the real trick is mastering the freeze system. Hitting the button stops everything and you then have an action bar you can use up before the enemy moves again. It’s kind of like the V.A.T.S system in Fallout 3 or the system at work in Vagrant Story.During this time you can move around and stack up attacks. Pressing the button again sends you into action like a blur across the screen. The downside is that you then can’t use any attacks or special moves until the bar has regenerated in full. The more attacks you use, the longer the bar takes to recharge. This means you have to be extremely careful about what you are doing as you are often slower than the enemy robots sent to stop you. It’s essential to get in, attack and get back out to a place you can safely recharge as avoiding damage otherwise is almost impossible and you’ll be downed in no time.If your health bar depletes while you have charge time you’ll get a chance to move away from danger. If not, one of your powers will be damaged and unusable until you make it to two save points. This severely limits your attacking options and often leads to a daisy chain effect of you losing all your powers and flat lining. On the off chance you are finding things too easy you can also add a number of handicaps as you go which increase difficulty and the amount of experience you gain.The options you have to play around with are numerous and can be set up in a ton of different ways. This is one of Transistors strengths but we can see it easily overwhelming some players. When you gain a power you can do one of three things with it. Equipping it in an active slot will allow the player to use it via a button press. This could be a long range attack, a fast dodge, an area effect attack or something like summoning a creature to assist you. All attacks have different speeds in real time combat and few of them work fast enough to run through the game hacking away without the freeze system. Each active power can also be boosted by equipping powers as support. For instance, you could take the bouncing bomb power and add it to your long range attack, thus making the attack ricochet off enemies and into others.  You can add two boosters to each active attack which opens up all sorts of crazy possibilities. Finally, you can add powers to your passive support slots. This means they normally do things like boost player speed or increase resistance. Any power can be assigned to any slot on any other power so finding the perfect combination will require some thought and the possibilities are just about endless. The only limit on what you can do is that each power takes up a certain number of points and once that hits maximum nothing else can be equipped.While you are getting used to the combat you’ll be experiencing some absolutely beautiful visuals. The Neo Noir tone of the game is offset by stunning, neon tinged environments full of small details and snippets of information about the world you’re exploring. It reminded us of an isometric Deus Ex or the SNES version of Shadowrun if the rundown world had been replaced with some kind of semi-utopian society. There are also a few pretty big nods to Final fantasy VII in there as well. It’s gorgeous and the musical score and sound effects also help to build a picture of a once perfect, now lonely world where something seems to have gone wrong very quickly.Overall, Transistor is a triumph of both style and design. It takes some getting used to and you’ll need a PC running comfortably above the minimum specs to get a smooth experience but Super Giant Games have tried something a little different here and it works. There’s the odd pacing issue and players will need to spend some time getting used to how the combat works but it’s a rich and rewarding experience and something that you’ll likely return to long in the future.Overall 9/10			"

												Absolutely beautiful game.  The art, sound, and music are amazing.  The story is intriguing, though not as much is explained as I would like.  There are hints of deeper secrets in the game, but that is left to the imagination.The gameplay was odd at first, but once a few abilities are unlocked it becomes pretty good.  Each ability can serve three functions, which creates a lot of variety with many combos.  I liked the ""Turn"" system which makes the game more strategy oriented (especially compared to Bastion).  The game is pretty linear, consisting of progressing between arena-like areas, but the environments keep everything feeling new and fresh.I loved the writing.  Each ability comes with a character backstory that is unlocked by using each of the ability's functions.  Each time I got a new ability I quickly used each function just so I could read the fascinating backstories.Overall, this was a pretty good game.  I recommend it to anyone.			"

												Transistor is an incredible game, to say the very least. Although not very long, the music and visuals are astounding and greatly assist the development of the story. I would TOTALLY recommend investing in the soundtrack if you're able to. The weapon, the Transistor, functions in a manner totally unique to almost all other games I've played. The necessity to switch out and rearrange certain skills/abilities in order to fight certain enemies is very engaging, and results in a near infinite combination of abilities/boosters/passives. The story of transistor is the perfect balance of vague and solidified, giving you enough information to be perfectly aware of what's going on, but leaving enough to mystery that you can imagine the entire world of the game unfolding in much greater detail than is given. The characters all have unique aspects and are voiced, which I really appreciated. The mood and impact of their actions was shown through the voice acting and made it an even better experience. Overall, definitely worth the price, especially now. Grab this during summer sale and do yourself a favor!			"

												At first I didn't give enough credits for Transistor, but somedays ago I thought it was time to try it and oh boy! It worth a lot!The game story isn't exeptional, I mean, it is a good story but nothing worth of prize.The gameplay on the other hand, this one deserve a LOT of respect. The totally turn based/not turn based system have an incredible flow that always make you want to play more and face the next encounter, ALWAYS hungry for more.Also, it is worth to mention the soundstrack. A friend said that the soundtrack pulled more of his attention than the gameplay. It was not my case, but I have to give credits to the OST because it is anything but awesome.Long story short, buy the game and have a great time playing it!			"

												Transistor is a game that truly asks the player to think about both their actions in combat as well as their interpretation of the narrative. The game can be also be enjoyed without this effort, but after a blind first playthrough, the game truly comes alive on the second run when the player has heightened curiosity and a desire to experiment with the depth offered by the many combinations of combat abilities available. The soundtrack is also excellent, further heightening the atmosphere and sense of presence that the game has.			"

												This game's sountrack is a melodic warm embrace upon your eardrums and inner soul.I'm on my second playthrough. Before I begin rambling, here's a quick list:1. This game is short, I probably finished my first playthrough in about 10 hours or so. 2. Get the soundtrack, you will not regret it.3. This game is stunningly beautiful, and if you liked Bastion at all, you'll love this, possibly even more.4. The gameplay element to this is fascinating. You can, much like in Bastion, configure and reconfigure your protagonist as you please, taking her attacks apart and putting them back together again just like with sexy, exploding Lego's. 5. The further you progress through the story the more upgrades and limiters you will choose to unlock. 6. Limiters can be brutal (I turned 9 on immediately on my second run-through, thinking I was a boss with the NG+ system (New Game+) - No. I was wrong. I was hilariously wrong.7. I've heard the first ending isn't really the ending. I would not be surprised.8. The pace of the game is very quick, and the only distraction from the story are little rooms you can find to practice different setups and complete challenges. The first ones are easy, but on towards the end of the game the last two stability tests were rather challenging. This game makes you strategize sometimes ;P9. Again, this is one of those games this is more about pleasing your senses. Just let it happen.10. I would suggesting searching on Youtube the following tracks, and listening to them in this order:> Gateless> We All Become Instrumental> The Spine> Vanishing Point Hummed (sounds just like a theme from arguably one of the greatest games of all time and space)> In CirclesSeriously. Grand game. SO glad I got it on sale so I could buy the OST as well for the grand total of $10 and some change. Which I then used a gift card for X3			"

												I don't always write reviews for games but when I do. I do tell you this game has the most soundtrack ever, it's like the next best thing after Nobue Uematsus Final Fantasy games. Speaking of soundtracks the soundtrack is so good and fitting to the game that it makes you forget about time and all you want to do is to play this game. The way the story is told is one of the less used now days but it speaks to the player very well, giving the player new thougs and understandings of the game world and the story surrounding it. I think this game is the best investment in a game in the year of 2014 that I have made. I STRONGLY recomend this game to anybody ever interrested in games. --T			"

												I can't deliver enough praise for this game, I really can't. It excels in every aspect; graphics are breathtaking and beautiful, the soundtrack is also beautiful and emotional, and the story, while vague for a good portion of the game, is so intricate, complex and interesting.The second playthrough of the game is a real treat, after starting it I was compelled to write this review as the startling beauty of the game came rushing back. The second playthrough of the game is definitely a different experience and allows you to uncover more about the vague story, piece everything together that you may have missed and feel completely satisifed and astounded. Like another reviewer has said, it's like watching Fight Club or The Usual Suspects or Memento again. The game is fairly short but it doesn't leave you angered or dissapointed it just makes you want to experience it all over again. This game just gives you a wholly unique feeling, a great mix of awe, joy, sadness, wonder... Much like the rest of the game, words can't truly describe this feeling, you'll just have to discover it for yourself.10/10, an utter delight in every way.			"

												This game is beautiful in so many ways, each of which is reason enough to play.The music is haunting and lovely, and the singer did a fantastic job capturing the character. The cyberpunk / art nouveau aesthetic works surprisingly well, and makes each new area gorgeous and memorable. The voice acting is evocative, drawing at the heartstrings in just the right way. And the plot is elegant and compelling, with the characters making reasonable decisions, trying to fix what's been done, but each solution makes the situation worse.The gameplay is similar to its predecessor, Bastion, but it adds a turn-based-strategy angle to the fighting. So instead of running around simply wailing on stuff, this time you get to plan out your moves. The game also deals with player death in a genius way; when you die, you get respawned but with one of your fighting moves broken (but you get it back a few fights later). The way it acknowledges player death, makes it meaningful, and forces the player to try new playstyles is devious and amazing.The feeling I came away with after playing (twice, for all the cheevos) was melancholy. It's sad, but the good kind, you know? The kind of sad you feel good for having experienced.That's what this game is. An experience - and a good one at that.			"

												This game is truly brilliant. At it's core, it's an action-RPG with the ability to stop time and plan out your next sequence of moves, then execute that sequence at hyper-speed. As you play, you will earn or find new abilities (functions), and each one can be equipped either as an active function (press a button and do a thing), an upgrade to another function, or as a passive bonus. The number of possible combinations is near-infinite, and the game really requires and rewards experimentation. The plot, setting and characters are wonderful. Despite the game's relatively short length (around 10-12 hours, probably), I would recommend taking it easy and letting the game breathe. The intracacies of the plot and gameplay can be subtle and vague, and if you try to burn through the game quickly, you will probably miss quite a bit. Take the time to explore, experiment and take in the world and story, and I guarantee you will love Transistor.			"

												A wonderful RPG. Combat is both Turn()-based and real time, the story is compelling, and the soundtrack is absolutely breathtaking.Playing through for the first time is like slowly discovering your own powers of godhood as you crush each encounter and acquire new abilities or limiters to change the game and suit your playstyle.Starting a New Game+ is where you'll really see the depth of the game. Your enemies will evolve right alongside you, to provide you with increasing challenges; each encounter becoming a wholly unique experience with a randomized set of enemies every time you load the game.It's hard to put into words the joy that comes from planning out a magnificent Turn(), then watching Red swiftly execute it and destroy all of your enemies within seconds.This game is truly a gift to all RPG fans.

												I played Bastion. I loved Bastion. The lighthearted story, amazing presentation, and even more amazing narration has made it a gem that I talk up whenever I have the opportunity. With that said, I liked Transistor, but it was a bit too... emo.. for my taste.The combat, music, and animation are amazing in Transistor. I will definitely say that all of the aforementioned traits are very well done and very interesting in their own ways.Where I was left feeling a bit empty was the narration, the story, and the the lack of a growing interest in what's going on. I kept playing in hopes that things would be explained and that things would get better. IMO they didn't. The story ended abruptly and I never had a ""calamity"" type of obstacle that I was trying to overcome.The narration was what really stung. It was so beautifully and creatively implemented in Bastion that I would have been happy with half of that. Unfortunately, the tone of the narration matches the aforementioned emo feel quite well. It's cold, emotionless, and for lack of a better term.. rote. I would recommend this game to someone if it was discounted (bout 50%) because the combat and beauty of the game itself are both components that are well worth the time and money. However, the story/narration is so.. clinical and cold feeling that I'd have trouble talking those up.			"

												This is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. The attention to detail is astonishing, as anyone who plays this game through the ending will find obvious. The level of immersion in this game is also incredible, with the developers having gone above and beyond to make you feel involved, with everything from the speed of the vehicle or even the weather itself; even your smallest choices seem to affect the narration, and in turn the story. There's subtle foreshadowing to the ending, which I found fitting, and wouldn't want to change even if I could. Simply everything here is perfect. And the gameplay offers so much diversity in options, that alone enhances the replayability in addition to the achievements. Play this game.			"

												A short, but inspired game. It literally walks the line between turn-based and action rpgs, and you must decide which one to use - executing a Turn() allows you to complete a string of commands much more quickly, but leaves you unable to act for a brief period of time. The beauty of it is enhanced by a handful of functions to use in one of sixteen slots. There are three types of slots:Primary - functions assigned to these slots have direct affect on the field.Secondary - functions assigned to these augment the primary it's attached to. Each Primary has two Secondaries.Support - functions assigned here have a perpetual or reoccuring effect.The story was a surprising joy; while it doesn't break any ground in its plot, it's still well told with clever plot devices and evokes a genuine feeling through Red's actions and Transistor's words. The soundtrack helps carry it along in ways that can only really be summarized thusly: You can find the moody soundtrack on youtube, but the studio recommends not listening until the game is finished - not as a dare, but because it's the soul of the story. As of this writing, I played through the game twice in 20 hours. I also unlocked every achievement offered in this time. They're definitely easy to acquire, but they draw your attention to the nuances of the story and the gameplay mechanics  in a masterful way. Despite how easy it is, the difficulty continues to ramp up on successive playthroughs as you unlock copies of functions you already have, creating even more strategic options. It's quick and chaotic, and without Turn(), you won't survive many encounters. This game reminds me of what I loved about my SNES days and allows me to relive a time when I wanted to understand what was going on in the character's head. For me, the shortness of it made for an awesome lazy weekend and left as quickly as it began.I bought it on sale, so it doesn't seem fair to discuss value. Would I buy it at full price? Yes, if it INCLUDED the soundtrack. Definitely worth putting on your wishlist, because any discount on it will make it a Goodbye().			"

												It took a while for Transistor to really hook me (about 2/3 of the way through my first playthrough), but at that point I went from mildly disappointed (I really loved Supergiant's previous game, Bastion), to entirely satisfied.  I think the reason for all this is that the combat system is really quite deep, and it took a lot of experimentation before I really started understanding the potential there.  I'm playing it through a second time now and really enjoying it.Aside from the mechanics, the game is beautiful and the soundtrack is excellent.  The story is really intriguing and told in a very minimal way.   A lot of it is told through short voice clips, but if you want to learn more about what is happening, you can also get snipets of story through interacting with the environment, from experimenting with the combat system or from reading message boards :)  Even the way the soundtrack is done complements the story.  I didn't play Bastion on new game+ because I felt like I experienced the whole thing and was satisfied at the end.  I think Transistor essentially requires a second playthrough because there's so much subtle detail packed in that you are bound to miss a lot of it the first time through.  Transistor is a really excellent game, but it is especially rewarding if you are willing to put some effort in.			"

												Had this for a while, didn't get to finishing it until now.The game's shining feature is its artwork of course -- as usually what I feel gets Supergiant Games' awards 90% of the time.  You can delve into the game's ""deep"" story by Inspecting the abilities you gain at certain points of the game -- as the abilities you gain are from dead citizens of the city you're trying to save, which are absorbed into the Transistor.  This player kinda glossed over the story, because as usual I play games for the gameplay.  As I did enjoy the gameplay itself, I feel it has a few problems. The combat and core gameplay definitely has its merits, and can be quite enjoyable.  It touts the whole ""player's choice gimmick"" of either going for more Turn-based gameplay or real-time.   Unfortunately, the game can push you into one or the other, and it's a lot of trial-and-error to figure out which situation suits which playstyle -- and which techniques you should have equipped.  Then of course, you can be punished harshly by having to wait for your Turn meter to build back up in order to use any abilities (Jaunt discluded), getting Tech uninstalled (by getting your life drained all the way) or by dying and having to restart from the last Access (Save) point.  And pending on what you have after you've lost a certain ability in battle,  you might as well restore your save point anyway.I've found a lot of times towards the ending, and more challenging parts like some of the Tests you can do, there's really no point to do real-time combat, because the game can get very spammy, and almost every ability you have has a stop-wind-up, and cool-down animation which can really get you hurt.   And SPOILERS -- the final boss uses Turn, so pretty much forces you to do the same.Developers like Supergiant get super praised for a lot of their gameplay designs from Bastion and this very game, but I feel they give an ILLUSION of strategy and thought that a lot of players get fooled over.  This game barely has any strategy.  Yes, you have a wide variety of abilities to learn and tune to your liking, but in the end, there's really only 2 or 3 most effective set ups you'll find to use.  It's worth a playthrough, and I'll even say worth the $20. It's more fine-tuned than the cluster♥♥♥♥ that was Bastion -- though that one was fun too in certain ways.  Bastion had a lot of enemy hell spam, and this game can get to that point towards the end of the game.  7/10			"

												What a rare gem in the world of gaming. This game encapsulates what makes a game really good, and I mean extraordinarily great. So far this is definitly my game of the year, and one of my favourite games of all time.I played Bastion back when it came to pc, and back then I liked that game to bits, and that is still on my list of all time favourite games, but this game overtakes Bastion by a quite a fair margin.First of I'd like to talk about the mechanichs wich was the first thing I got an impression of. As for combat mechanics I'd go as far as to say they are better than Bastions combat system, because there's so much more to do here, and it is still simple to understand and use. I personally don't like games with too many active abilities (wich is also one of the reasons I liked the Borderlands games so much), and this games givbes you four, wich in my oppinion is quite damn near to perfect. Although I'd always end up having one ability I rarely would use. I do feel the combat system might be a bit too fleshed out, in the sense that the game isn't that long, and you only really get to try the different skills for a short while, I'd imagine that your skills carry over in the new game plus mode, but personally I don't have any reason to replay the game. Overall I liked the combat system, and it could even be used or inspired by in other games, that wants to have an isometric top-down game with an amazing combat system.As for the story, it is really great. I enjoyed every minute of the game, and the narrator who was in Bastion returns in Transistor as 'The Transistor', and provides great commentary troughout the game. The story itself is very good, and strays from the convetional routes and adresses other things such as the fear of change, and the feeling that the whole world is falling apart around you. Go play it, the ending is great, and I were to spoil it you would think I was making up a lie, because it would be out of context, so go play it, it's soo good.Also: Art = beautiful.As an hobbyist artist I feel sad that I'm nowhere near as good as Jen Zee (who is amazing, go look her up!).I couldn't reccomend this game enough, go buy it already. Also if you haven't played Bastion yet, do pick that up aswell, both games are timeless masterpieces that deserve a place amongst the most brillinat pieces of art in the world.			"

												Transistor is a game about a girl and her sword against an all consuming enemy controlled by a shadow group with less than altruistic intentions. At first glance the combat system may seem simple with a Diablo like feel to it, that is until you begin to use the Turn() system making everything much more strategic giving you the ability to freeze time and carefully plan out your next move. While there are no talents or many lateral upgrades to choose from the game does have this intriguing upgrade system where you use one ability to augment another making it so you can tailor your ability set to best match your play style, or to better counter certain enemy types of which there are many. Logan Cunningham (Bastion) narrates the story from the point of view of the Transistor. What’s really nice is that they don’t try to hold your hand throughout the game, spoon feeding you the plot. No, instead the story unravels naturally letting you discover the plot for yourself which I really appreciated. All of this as well as a uniquely beautiful art style and an amazing soundtrack that is becoming a staple of these dev’s, Transistor makes for an excellent sophomore entry from developer Supergiant Games.

												Short but oh so sweet. This game had a riveting story that just kept pulling me in. It had enough extra stuff to give it replay value and was definitely worth the buy. The game was made by the same people who made Bastion, so if you like that shiz, get this. It's all stratigetical and stuff with rouge like aspects to it.Pros- Story, voice actors, gameplay. cons- too short. leaves you wanting more.			"

												""Masterpiece"" - The only words i can say after i finish this game, Unlike other game which have ""beautiful"" graphic, ""flashy"" gameplay,...... etc, once you begin to start the adventure of ""Red"" - the main character, you can forget all of those things. Because, you are actually live as ""Red"".-Music: 11/10 - If i have the chance, i will always stand in a place, hold Tab, and listen to the beautiful singing (humming) of Red.... (Tips: it might be a spoil but if you see a ""backdoor"", always go for it, unlock each door which will unlock different songs. Then, with each different song, Red will hum in different way.) -Story: 9/10 - When i read the review, some said they don't actually get the story. For me, i can see and can feel that the story was very good and easy to understand. But each person can feel different since the game create a new way of storytelling. Take time to listen and you will see. Still, game is quite short but i think it's fine to end like that (you will understand once you finish the game)-Gameplay: 8/10 - The gameplay are fun. You get the chance to create many kind of play-styles. You can be a ninja (1 hit 1 kill), a trickster (run around and create trap)..... etc etc. However, i'm not quite satisfied since the game was kind of short and i would love to see more things i can do.Overall, this is the game which you can spend your money on without regret, a game which you can play and enjoy every bit of it instead of being forced to play just to finish it (like: WD, Unity,.....)Goodluck with this game and.....See you in Country =)  "

												I played Bastion. I loved Bastion. The lighthearted story, amazing presentation, and even more amazing narration has made it a gem that I talk up whenever I have the opportunity. With that said, I liked Transistor, but it was a bit too... emo.. for my taste.The combat, music, and animation are amazing in Transistor. I will definitely say that all of the aforementioned traits are very well done and very interesting in their own ways.Where I was left feeling a bit empty was the narration, the story, and the the lack of a growing interest in what's going on. I kept playing in hopes that things would be explained and that things would get better. IMO they didn't. The story ended abruptly and I never had a ""calamity"" type of obstacle that I was trying to overcome.The narration was what really stung. It was so beautifully and creatively implemented in Bastion that I would have been happy with half of that. Unfortunately, the tone of the narration matches the aforementioned emo feel quite well. It's cold, emotionless, and for lack of a better term.. rote. I would recommend this game to someone if it was discounted (bout 50%) because the combat and beauty of the game itself are both components that are well worth the time and money. However, the story/narration is so.. clinical and cold feeling that I'd have trouble talking those up.			"

The story is just superb, its presented in a same style as bastion, we have our mute hero and a narrator who has such a magnificent voice. Gameplay is actually pretty fun and can be quite challenging but once you get hang of it, it's just amazing. The art in this game is just astonishing, watching this whole colorful city turn into a blank and lifeless city has its impact. This game is just so much fun and it has one of the best soundtracks, for example that ""In Circles"" song, man it brings the goosebumps.5/5 just loved the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it			"

												This game pulled me in and didn't let me go. It throws you right into the action. The combat system took a little to understand, but eventually you figure out which are the most powerful combos as you slice and dice yourself a way through the baddies. The story can be a little confusing on the first play as there is no intro, but recursion mode (new game plus) had it all make a lot more sense. The game looks amazing and the soundtrack is superb. Controls are pretty intuitive. In short, the game is amazing and I hope Supergiant Games will continue to make unique experiences like this one and Bastion.			"

												With stunning visuals, an unforgettable soundtrack, a unique combat system and a story that just seems to keep on giving, Transistor is a must have for fans of action RPGs. I was a latecomer to Bastion but picked up Transistor soon after its release and was not disappointed. The standalone components of the game work together symphonically: constantly forcing you to think deeper about every visual, audio and gameplay element you encounter.The real showstopper is the inventive combat system which lets you customise a selection of active, upgrade and passive slots via dozens of function combinations. You can choose to attack enemies in real time or press the right trigger to freeze time, plan a series of moves and then hit the right trigger once again to unleash more devastating attacks.The training levels are great for suggesting some of the combos that work well together but the real joy of Transistor lies in discovering new functions and constantly tweaking and upgrading your setup until you find a play style that's just right. Essential!			"

												I went in wanting to love this game. I walked away only liking it. Transistor is beautifully rendered in terms of its' ""Tech Nouveau"" visuals and amazing music. With all of that going for it, the gameplay failed to grab me. For me, the 3/4 view seemed to block key obstacles when fighting or taking a ""turn"" and I found myself geting unintentionally hung up on objects in the environment. I understand the artistic reason for just throwing you into the gameplay, but I just didn't like being completely lost in terms of what the was going on for the first part of the game. The complexity of the gameplay needs a space more readliy available to practice and hone your skills. The ""backdoor"" areas were too far apart to be usefull at times. Towards the end of the game I felt myself just wanting it to be over and rushing through as much as I could. I felt story was a decent one but tends to get lost in the grand scheme of things. Supergiant's talent for providing amazing voice acting as part of it's game expirence is up front and center once again. All this being said, I still reccomend a playthrough. Transistor needs to be seen at least once.			"

												Transistor is a top-down, turn-based adventure game that takes place in a utopian society. The gameplay is very different from Bastion; in this game, all attacks are planned beforehand during each turn. This game is beautiful to look at and holds a beautiful story within.Pros:+From the music, to the voice acting, to the writing, to the art, this game is beautifully executed. I like the gameplay, but this is definitely a game you buy for the music, story and artwork.+The romance in this game felt genuine and believable to me.+The gameplay is entertaining; different ""functions"" (attacks) can be combined in a multitude of combinations, and there are multiple ways to win each battle.+Like Bastion, there is a new game plus mode where you can restart the game at a higher difficulty and continue levelling.+For those who like the battles, there are bonus challenges, similar to Bastion.Cons:-While planning your turn, you can't pan the screen to look at far away enemies. This is a minimal problem, as you can usually see far enough anyways, and you can also simply walk where you want to see and then cancel the move.This game took me ten hours to complete, but my girlfriend completed it in four hours, which I find amazing. I think most people will take at least six if not 7-8 hours.I really loved this game. While they don't have the big budget of a AAA company, Supergiant has managed to craft something that is both more unique and more impressive than most AAA games.			"

												Not great but ok. I can't avoid comparing it to Bastion. You have main story, you have storyteller, you have your own place where you can rest (Bastion in Bastion, Backdoor in Transistor). In overall it looks like developers tried to repeat success of Bastion. But the problem is that story is not that great, art is not as detailed as in Bastion, soundtrack is boring and repetitive and whole Backdoor concept is useless. As for Backdoor I hate it the most. In Bastion you could build your own island to receive new stuff and complete trials to receive parts needed to upgrade your weapons. In Transistor you have Backdoor where you can complete trials to unlock new songs from soundtrack to listen in only in Backdoor. And thats all.			"

												Have you ever thought about playing with art? Well, if you're visiting this game's page, this is your chance to see how it feels like!First of all, this is no simple indie easy money score. You can see that there were hours spent on dedicated work, constructing this piece of art. I can start by telling you what you already know and what makes this game easy on your boring days, but, instead, I'll just skip to what makes it good and different.Imagine yourself playing a Neil Gaiman's graphic novel (storyline and arts), produced by a Blizzard (isometric gods) and Square Enix (turn based combat milestone) partnership. This gets close to the experience. You will never believe how awesome this game's battles are, until you actually play it. So many possibilities... very few enemy types though. And about the graphic/arts... there is so much to say about it. You may see a mix steam punk and futuristic sci-fi on the references. Gorgeous begin to describe... And the soundtrack?! Mesh up old club music with electronic beats and you get really impressive results!This game was born a classic. With so many uncreative work popping up every single day, this game only lacks more world wide publicity to get it amongst the great ones, where it belongs.			"

												This game is truly brilliant. At it's core, it's an action-RPG with the ability to stop time and plan out your next sequence of moves, then execute that sequence at hyper-speed. As you play, you will earn or find new abilities (functions), and each one can be equipped either as an active function (press a button and do a thing), an upgrade to another function, or as a passive bonus. The number of possible combinations is near-infinite, and the game really requires and rewards experimentation. The plot, setting and characters are wonderful. Despite the game's relatively short length (around 10-12 hours, probably), I would recommend taking it easy and letting the game breathe. The intracacies of the plot and gameplay can be subtle and vague, and if you try to burn through the game quickly, you will probably miss quite a bit. Take the time to explore, experiment and take in the world and story, and I guarantee you will love Transistor.			"

												I can't deliver enough praise for this game, I really can't. It excels in every aspect; graphics are breathtaking and beautiful, the soundtrack is also beautiful and emotional, and the story, while vague for a good portion of the game, is so intricate, complex and interesting.The second playthrough of the game is a real treat, after starting it I was compelled to write this review as the startling beauty of the game came rushing back. The second playthrough of the game is definitely a different experience and allows you to uncover more about the vague story, piece everything together that you may have missed and feel completely satisifed and astounded. Like another reviewer has said, it's like watching Fight Club or The Usual Suspects or Memento again. The game is fairly short but it doesn't leave you angered or dissapointed it just makes you want to experience it all over again. This game just gives you a wholly unique feeling, a great mix of awe, joy, sadness, wonder... Much like the rest of the game, words can't truly describe this feeling, you'll just have to discover it for yourself.10/10, an utter delight in every way.			"

One can argue that the story is flawed but it got the fans together by asking questions since the story was told indirectly.

												I don't review many games, but Transistor, much like SuperGiant's previous title, Bastion, exceeded my expectations on all fronts.This game is a tremendously soulful piece of work, and from the very start to the very end, is first and foremost a work of art. The music, narration, artistic style and presentation flow together in a way that I would probably say outclasses almost any other game i've played. Anyone with a quibble of curiousity and a penchant for great games, or even works of art, should immediately purchase Transistor (AND Bastion) and enjoy the ride.To touch on the gameplay itself, the combat is inventive and blends several previously done elements (pseudo-turn based combat, action queues, tactical-execution-based combat) into a pretty seamless and enjoyable experience. It is two parts arcade, one part strategic pause-and-think game. It remains fresh and has a lot of room for player creativity due to the openly configurable nature of abilities acquired throughout the game.What follows are some brief pros/cons:Pros:+Incredible Art. From music to artwork, this entire game is a masterpiece.+Gameplay. The combat remains fresh, enjoyable, and creative all the way through.+Difficulty.  Like bastion, difficulty is born of modifiers you can apply to enemies, which give you bonuses for being brave.+Storyline.  Again, this is a work of art and the storyline is rich, heartfelt, and incredibly immersive.+Soundtrack.  Incredible, as usual.Cons:-Length.   The game itself isn't that long, although there are excuses to re-play the game with new conditions and toy around with the combat some more.That's really all I can see anyone really griping about with this game.In total, I'd give Transistor a 9.5/10, as one of the most absolutely awesome pieces of work i've seen in terms of gaming. It isn't a triple-A 40 hour experience... but it's an incredibly rich, artistic romp through an engaging and incredibly envisioned city of Cloudbank.9.5/10-Colt			"

												Interesting story/setting.  Combat plays more like a puzzle, with the puzzle being as hard as you decide to make it using optional settings (limiters) you gain through the game.  Single playthrough took me 8 hours, but you get the option for a NG+ that also changes the dialogue you experience the second time through; which gives another perspective on the narrative.  As expected from Supergiant, the art and soundtrack are excellent.  The game at times can feel like walking through the work of Gustav Klimt.  The soundtrack is a largely ambient set of aucoutic guitars and subtle electronic puncutated by vocal hums.  The game also features a couple full tracks with lovely lyrics.The negatives for me were related to the amount of menu activity.  Pieces of backstory and character information are hidden in skills you use, and using the skills in different ways unlocks more of that information.  In order to change how your skills are arranged (to use them differently), you have to visit a menu and shuffle things around between most combat sequences.  It's not a big deal, but slows down the feel of progression and the pace of your play.  It feels tedius.  Granted, you could skip the unlocking of this information and stick to a skill arrangement your comfortable with.  Additionally, some skill arrangements work better for some fights than others, and you don't have any way to predict what the next fight will be, so you usually have to fail the combat sequence to go readjust for the fight.When you're out of the menu's and fighting, you do appreciate the maleability of the skills.  Using any single skill as either an active, augmenting, or passive ability and over a dozen skills, you can create what feels like an endlessly diverse series of offensive arrangments.  Really cool.Overall, a very positive experience.  Definitely worth the $19.99 price tag on release.			"

The story is ... a bit confusing at first but man it goes deep and its kinda in your face not your regular cliche story. It has a few twists and turns that hit me hard.If you like RPG's or in general looking for something new in the video game industry then definietly go for Transistor... this is one game that will be remembered for a long time :) i hope to see more like this in the future			"

												Transistor is an incredible game, to say the very least. Although not very long, the music and visuals are astounding and greatly assist the development of the story. I would TOTALLY recommend investing in the soundtrack if you're able to. The weapon, the Transistor, functions in a manner totally unique to almost all other games I've played. The necessity to switch out and rearrange certain skills/abilities in order to fight certain enemies is very engaging, and results in a near infinite combination of abilities/boosters/passives. The story of transistor is the perfect balance of vague and solidified, giving you enough information to be perfectly aware of what's going on, but leaving enough to mystery that you can imagine the entire world of the game unfolding in much greater detail than is given. The characters all have unique aspects and are voiced, which I really appreciated. The mood and impact of their actions was shown through the voice acting and made it an even better experience. Overall, definitely worth the price, especially now. Grab this during summer sale and do yourself a favor!			"

												This and Bastion... examples of art, these games, to me, are beautiful works of art... would reccommend to any gamer of any type. Not just the beautiful graphics, amazing soundtrack, but the game mechanics... my god... I come accross someone's work like Transistor, where I am filled so much awe and envy that people can be this creative, and this smart to bring such a brilliant concept to reality. This is the first time I've written a review and for good reason. Anyone who appreciates a good game will enjoy this game, enough said. SuperGiant games will have my undying loyalty... I don't really like it when people name drop, but this and Bastion, this company has proved itself, and when Pyre comes out.. my god just TAKE MY MONEY.			"

												In essence, transistor is a work of art in every aspect.Graphics: The art style and graphics of the game is not only visually stunning but timeless in gameplay. There'll never be a need for a HD remake years down the road, and if you pick it up 10 years after 2014, you'll still be awed by the world you're walking in.Combat: A very novel kind of experience that allows huge room for customization in terms of the type of action you prefer (more strategic or action packed), playstyle and also difficulty.The story: Wonderfully written narrative; both thought-invoking and heart-wrenching. A lot of the world-building and story-telling is subtle, opening up room for all sorts of theories and heated discussions which I thoroughly enjoy reading online.Voice acting: Logan Cunningham - the main narrator you'll hear throughout the game, the same narrator from Bastion - really made me fall in love with him (a man who is now a sword, mind you) and feel his love for Red (the unfortunately mute female protagonist).Soundtrack: All of this is wrapped together with a beautiful soundtrack (which is aptly timed to the game). It immerses you completely, and invokes all sorts of emotions in you. "

												Transistor is a game that truly asks the player to think about both their actions in combat as well as their interpretation of the narrative. The game can be also be enjoyed without this effort, but after a blind first playthrough, the game truly comes alive on the second run when the player has heightened curiosity and a desire to experiment with the depth offered by the many combinations of combat abilities available. The soundtrack is also excellent, further heightening the atmosphere and sense of presence that the game has.			"

												Countless praises have already been given for this game and I'll add one more to that one part of the game that gripped me the most and pushed me to get all the achievements: the story.Transistor, like Bastion, is one of those games that has a very serious tone in its story and still manages to feel warm. The writing in this game and how the story progresses will make you ignore how linear the game is. How things end are unlike those cliche stuff where... letting myself go on will just give out spoilers.The story, the music and the visual style; the overall immersion this game can get you in makes it worth full price. Even more.			"

												""Masterpiece"" - The only words i can say after i finish this game, Unlike other game which have ""beautiful"" graphic, ""flashy"" gameplay,...... etc, once you begin to start the adventure of ""Red"" - the main character, you can forget all of those things. Because, you are actually live as ""Red"".-Music: 11/10 - If i have the chance, i will always stand in a place, hold Tab, and listen to the beautiful singing (humming) of Red.... (Tips: it might be a spoil but if you see a ""backdoor"", always go for it, unlock each door which will unlock different songs. Then, with each different song, Red will hum in different way.) -Story: 9/10 - When i read the review, some said they don't actually get the story. For me, i can see and can feel that the story was very good and easy to understand. But each person can feel different since the game create a new way of storytelling. Take time to listen and you will see. Still, game is quite short but i think it's fine to end like that (you will understand once you finish the game)-Gameplay: 8/10 - The gameplay are fun. You get the chance to create many kind of play-styles. You can be a ninja (1 hit 1 kill), a trickster (run around and create trap)..... etc etc. However, i'm not quite satisfied since the game was kind of short and i would love to see more things i can do.Overall, this is the game which you can spend your money on without regret, a game which you can play and enjoy every bit of it instead of being forced to play just to finish it (like: WD, Unity,.....)Goodluck with this game and.....See you in Country =)  "

												This game has a beautiful and unique way of storytelling. The story doesn't fit into any specific genre, and is confusing in a good way, meaning you can't predict it based on other stories/games.The art style fits perfectly and the soundtrack is just beautiful and well integrated into the gameplay. Yet the biggest surprise for me is the gameplay and skill system. The way of combining functions (skills) allows for many different effective play styles without forcing the player into making permanent choices. It doesn't make much sense to compare Transistor and Bastion, since their concepts are quite different. I personally liked Transistor better, since it's art style and gameplay goes even further away from a usual fantasy setting.			"

												Transistor follows the story of a mute young woman, Red, in her journey of discovery. Taking place shortly after losing her voice, she discovers a key like object known as the Transistor, which narrates and communicates with Red in an accustomed manor. Together, they explore a world which has been over-run with digital viruses, which plagues the worlds existence itself.From start up, I was astonished by the beautiful design. color and soundtrack this feature displays, it all fits splendidly together in a blend that can only impress. The game play is phenomenal, sporting a combination of classic mechanic systems, in a mix that I can only describe as Final Fantasy meets Zelda. The narration is a pleasure to listen too and pays homage to their previous game, Bastion, which was equally fantastic.The game length tends to be on the shorter side, supplying approximately 8 hours of overall game time. Don't be fooled though, once you've seen the ending you're given the option the restart the journey, allowing you to keep all the items and progression from your current file, which lends to some interesting replay ability.Overall, the game is a breathtaking experience, every aspect of the game works well together in a new and original concept. Supergiant Games, creators of Transistor and Bastion, deserve a congratulations for creating a masterpiece, this game will will certainly stand the test of time as one of the greatest games to hit the market. I rate Transistor a 9/10.			"

The first boss fight we REALLY GOOD, and so was the Second and the last. I won't reveal much of them though. Just trust me, the boss fights are good.Graphics: Looks really nice, probably better on a high quality computer. (My computer isn't the best)Story: I am pretty sure that there is only one story line even though you are given multiple choices.

												SuperGiantGames delivers again with Transistor, Transistor is an amazing strategy game with a beautiful soundtrack and artstyle which helps create a lot of atmosphere. The gameplay is kept entertaining and challenging through the use of the Function() combo and Turn() systems and there is a surprising amount of replay value that encourages you to play again in New Game Plus.

												Very much the same story-telling style as Bastion, along with great voice work and music.  I personally loved the combat, though I hear it is not everyone's thing, as it's built more around planning out a sequence than real-time fighting.  The sheer amount of moves/combos is super fun to play around with either way, though!			"

												Supergiant does it again. The music, story, environment, voice acting: all top-notch. The combat is engaging, and due to how functions can be pieced together, it's a new experience each time. Darren Korb, of Bastion reknown, delivers a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack. The voice acting is superb: I found Royce's delivery to be especially enthralling. The environment, keeping with Supergiant's style, is equally as much a part of the story as the protagonists. I cannot recommend this game highly enough. It has captured my imagination and wonder for it's albeit short playthrough. I would have liked a few more content, but I feel content with what was delivered. I look forward to a second playthrough.			"

												Transistor is an game immensely pleasing on an aesthetical, mechanical and narritivel level. The music and art of this game is some of the best in the industry. The combat is a fantastic and intersting mix of real time and paused tactics. You have a wide vairety of options of going about killing things, and I couldn't be more pleased with them. The story of Transistor follows a Dark Souls-esque setup - mininum expository elements, all info on the world and background of the story can be found through exploration. The one story that is done just through pure gameplay on the other hand, is done damn well. All in all, this is a fantastic follow up from Bastion , and a far better game.			"

The Fighting is exceptional and you get to unlock some pretty unique moves that can be combined with other moves to make it even more awesome . There are some mini games where you can test your skills and abilitys , even a damage one where you need to kill robots to get the highest damage score . The best thing is the sword talks to you and gives you either advice or a witty joke in his no emotion like accent .

The story is great, the ending is perfect (seriously, you need to play this game through), the visuals and atmosphere are stunning, the voice acting superb, and don't even get me started on the soundtrack. I'm still undecided if I enjoyed it more than Bastion and that alone is indeed high praise for any game. I'm madly in love with Transistor right now and I urge you to play it, too.			"

												Wow. Where do I begin? This game is quite novel. At first, I was put off by the gameplay, but it was mostly because I had to familiarize myself with the unique skill system and the mechanics of the game. The mainly turn-based combat is superb, and I really appreciate that the game encourages the player to try different methods. In addition, it encourages the player to be challenged with the Limiter system. I'm not going to go into much detail about the gameplay, because I'd like to talk about the story and the other stuff.The story had me. I was eager to explore and learn more about what was going on. I loved the 'dialogue' between the protagonist Red and her Transistor sword. It was a neat way of providing some narration and setting the tone. The graphics are quite aesthetically pleasing. The setting of the game evoked the same feelings that thriller movies give me -- that's a good thing. In addition, Red's singing and the game's soundtrack are superb. Besides the frustrating parts of the game where I had to try repeatedly to overcome some combat stages, I enjoyed this game. In short, I recommend this game for its story, novel gameplay, soundtrack and overall aesthetic.			"

												I picked up this little game because it happened to be on sale, and it has been my obsession for the past couple of days.  Everything about this game is gorgeous: the combat system, the art design, the storyline, the voice-over work, and the soundtrack... especially the soundtrack!What to expect: Well, it's a top-down action game with some light RPG elements set in a futuristic world that is quite different than the usual fare.  Combat seems straight-forward at the beginning, but as you begin to pick up more abilities, and learn how to combine them in new and differant ways, it has surprising depth and leaves a lot of room to develop your own unique style.  The game does very little hand-holding as far as the background story goes, only dropping little hints as to what is really going on, and leaving you to pick up the plot in pieces as you go all the way to the end.  Some may not enjoy the confusion that style of storytelling can cause, but I feel it was a great choice on the part of the writers.  The characters' journey as they make their way through the story together is very compelling at an emotional level - at least it was for me - and this in due in large part to the excellent voice-over work of your ever-present and yet unnamed compaion.Is Transistor worth getting?  It took me 18 hours to complete two runthroughs and get 100% of the acheivements.  For some, that might not be enough gameplay to justify the purchase, but for me, it absolutley was.  Even if I had paid full price, I still would feel that I got my money's worth on this one.			"

												Not quite as good as Bastion, but the game certainly held up under its own weight.  The art was nice, the music not really to my taste but I could tell they at least put effort into it.The gameplay was fun with its mix of real time hack-and-slashiness, and the cut in periods of slowed down planning and execution.  I'd say it took too long to really start unlocking the full potential of the skill system.  You only get to enjoy the full flourish for a very brief time.The story was a giant mix of ""what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on"", and ""ohh, that makes sense now"".  It was somewhat refreshing from the general straight forward trend most game stories take (not counting in their less than subtle attempts at plot twists).All in all, it's a game I'd recommend to most people.

The soundtrack is phenomenal, the art is fantastic, the fighting is fun, and the setting is cool. I also often don't talk about voice actors whenever I review a game, but the two main voice actors are excellent. Highly recommend you play this game, especially if you can pick it up on sale.			"

												Supergiant Games have done it again. Bastion is still one of my favourite games of all time; with its music, its solid, simple yet fun gameplay, its story which drew me in immediately and left me with so many wonderful questions about the world, music which blew me away and is still a joy to listen to outside of the game, characters which I adored and wnated to protect at all costs, I couldn't put it odnw. I have completed it something like three or four times... The game has left me in tears at the beauty of its story each time... But this isn't a review about Bastion.This is about Transistor.I get exactly the same from Transistor as what I got from Bastion. Do not buy on sale. buy at full price. Get the soundtrack. Experience it, love it, adore it, have your mind filled with questions about this fantastic, wonderful world, learn about all the people lost in this and still feel a connection to each, uncover the mysteries of the Process.If the game has any down-points it is that I am left with many more questions about the setting and the world than I did with Bastion but... I am only on my first playthrough... What happens next remains to be seen.			"

												It's a strange game, to be fair. The turn-based/action RPG thing takes some getting used to. Then encounters become almost laughably easy once you understand it and what some of the nastier combos are. - though a brilliant bit of game design makes you try different combinations anyway to unlock more backstory on what's going on. The story is very good and gives you enough information that you generally get what's going on without holding your hand or taking out out of the game for an exposition dump. A few questions remain unanswered, which actually is something I liked - the character spends most of the game on the run from a powerful enemy, so it made sense that I never felt 100% in control of everything. Top notch sound and artistic direction. Between this and Bastion, there may not be anyone that beats Supergiant Games in those departments.Not everyone will love it, but it definitely has something new to offer and is worth a try.			"

												I had really high expectations for this game when it came out and even though it wasn't quite what I imagined, I still enjoyed it. The main problem with it is the story because it is told very, very vaguely and you really have to work hard to figure out exactly what is going on. It kinda bothers me because, to me, the story is usually important because it contextualizes your actions within the game. As a result, for those trying to figure out what's going on, part of the experience is lost. However, the combat really makes up for it and the music just sounds fantastic. So, I can safely recommend this game based solely on these two things because that's what I enjoyed the most about it.			"

												Some love it, some hate it. The worst thing you can do is compare it to Bastion. Transistor has gorgeous hand drawn assets with some fantastic music by Darren Korb, again, has a single, excellent voice actor accompanying you, and maintains a psuedo-isometric view, but that's about it that remains the same.I found the story predictable, yet gripping and powerful. The combat is tricky, yet is highly adaptive and customizable to your playstyle. likewise with the difficulty. Difficulty is self-inhibited via Limiters, disabilities that scale and reward you with increased experience.The game is well balanced around the highly intruiging and well-scaled combat, surrounded with beautiful assets and gripping characters that drive you forward.

												I could write an entire essay/article on this game, I'm not going to for the sheer fact that I'm lazy and hope that whoever reads this will take my word and buy the game.NOTICE: *Although my steam record says that I have 4.6 hours played, I actually spent a total of about 9-10 hours playing the whole game itself. The reason for why is because I went offline for those good 6 or so other hours. I've played and beaten this game once already.*     Transistor...Oh what to say about this wonderful game that has kept my weekend more than entertaining for me. This game is something that I've been looking for a long time. With it's interesting combat system, the artful use of combining skills and attacks, Transistor and it's creator, Supergiant Games, shows off a more than polished interactive experience that'll be sure to glue your eyes to the screen for countless hours.      The combat system, to me at least, is something that you can compare to VATS from the fallout games, only in a sense that you're able to choose your attacks and inflict them to whoever you wish provided that you have the resources to do it. This system is a big plus for me in that it gives me the choice on a situation and how I'd like to tackle it. It left it to my decision and in doing so, kept me in my chair (may I add that it is an uncomfortable one) for hours at a time.      The storyline was confusing at first, but once I progressed through the story I found that it was a pretty good one. Nothing that blew my mind, but still was a little more than satisfactory.     In short, buy this game. You're not going to regret it, especially if you got it on sale.   "

												Amazing game, great story, but if i hadnt got the game on sale for 3 dollars instead of the usual 20, i would be slightly disappointed with the amount of content as i beat the story in 3 hours, but on the other hand im glad they didnt pump it full of meaningless filler to extend the game.If you like Bastion you will probably like this too as they have some similarities.

												First of all, I saw 'Bastion' which did not appeal to me for some reason. When I read that this game was by the same people it made me instantly give it a pass.I'm glad I was wrong to do so.I saw this game in the sales and that it was highly noticed by my friends, so with the spare change I had, I decided to try it out.Well worth the £2-£3 that I paid.

												The city of Cloudbank is under attack by an organisation known as the Camerata. The protagonist, Red, a contemporary artist with a golden voice, gets caught up in the mess and is forced to figure out what is going on with the help of the newly acquired Transistor. A sword used by the Camerata that falls into the hands of our classy heroine. Red is guided through her journey by the voices of those who dwell inside the Transistor on an adventure that will leave you perplexed and wanting answers.The Story Is About What?The story in Transistor is quite convoluted, requiring you to pay pretty close attention to what is being said by the voices who dwell inside the sword appropriated by Red.In short Transistor is a science fiction action RPG where you will fight your way through the futuristic city of Cloudbank. Wielding the Transistor (a powerful sword of unknown origin), Red will piece together the mysteries of the Transistor by pursuing it’s former owners.During an attack by the Process (a robotic force controlled by an organisation known as the Camerata), Red loses her voice to the great-sword known as the Transistor. You come to find Red kneeling next to an unknown man who lies motionless beside her. This man’s consciousness has been absorbed into the sword which, while Red wields the weapon, can speak to her acting as the narrator of the story and Red’s guide.Red is now being hunted by the Camerata who want to track her down and retrieve the Transistor by using the Process to attack and kill her. Why they want the sword however, is still a mystery.Transistor logically combines strategy with a fast-paced action experience, resulting in a combination of reactive gameplay and rich, deep storytelling.CombatI must say, the combat in Transistor is incredibly enjoyable. You have the option to battle in real-time just like any action game, or freeze time to plan out a number of moves to take place during your turn, however each turn has a cost and you can only afford so many moves.Real-time combat allows you to use your abilities (or functions) on the go but they have a use-time and a cooldown.Turn-based combat gives you a gauge that is filled up depending on how much the functions you use cost. After your turn is executed you will be placed on a global cooldown of varying time depending on how much of your gauge you filled up. The more moves you use, the longer the global cooldown and vice versa, allowing for true strategic combat.You gain access to new functions by increasing Red’s level. You can only have four functions on your hot bar at a time but you can combine different functions to grant extra effects such as pulling your enemy right up close to you or switching the allegiance of your foe for a time. However, only a certain amount of functions can be equipped depending on how much memory Red has.Battles can sometimes be quite unforgiving and if your health bar completely empties you will lose access to a function until it is repaired by visiting functions terminals. If you have no functions left to sacrifice, you will die and restart from the last checkpoint.Value For MoneyFor all you completionists out there, you will be pleasantly surprised by how long you get to play Transistor for. Everyone else though, will only get around six to seven hours of play out of Transistor.There really is a lot to see and do in the city of Cloudbank and beyond, so if you really want to stick to it and unlock/read everything you can, expect to be sitting pretty for at least fourteen hours.I managed to snag Transistor during a sale on Steam for around $10AUD so in my opinion that is great value for money. And don’t forget all of the Steam achievements/PS Trophies that go along with it.Aesthetic CharmImmediately upon launching Transistor will you be impressed by the graphics and smooth animations. Personally I was surprisingly awed just by the way Red moves around the screen. The animation of her running with the Transistor dragging along the ground behind her looks really great. Incredibly simple but at the same time quite intricate.Enemies are fun to watch and discover. I especially like the Jerks which pummel the ground with their piston-flattening arms and the way they persistently pursue Red.Once again Darren Korb has composed the soundtrack for Supergiant, accompanied by the beautiful vocals of Ashley Barrett. Every song in this soundtrack is amazing to listen to and I must admit, I was hooked on the soundtrack before I even played Transistor. Each piece of music plays it’s role really well throughout the game, and if you’re also a bit of a Darren Korb fan, you can listen to the pieces of music in a place called the Sandbox which is accessed via ‘Backdoors’ that you gain access to once Red reaches level four.The Sandbox also acts almost like a home base where you can hone your battle strategies in mock battles or practice your planning in timed challenges. Very similar to the challenge levels found in Bastion.Final ThoughtsTransistor is a visually and aurally stunning piece of gaming that draws you into Red’s mysterious world. The voice of Logan Cunningham is thankfully quite pleasant to listen to which is quite a relief as you will be hearing his narration for what feels like the entire game.The story itself is fairly hard to get into which I find to be quite a let down, but once you start to weave your way around the intricacies of what happened and what is happening, you will find yourself wanting to keep going in the hopes of unraveling even more of the enigma that is the city of Cloudbank.If you love an engaging storyline with lots of questions to be answered, Transistor is right up your alley. But if you want a game that has a different type of strategic combat you haven’t experienced before, you will also be greatly impressed. Read the full review[gamereviewsau.com] "

												pros: visually immersive art style, environmental textures & lighting, soundtrack fits the theme, varied enemies, strategic turn mode at your disposal during combat, multiple abilities & combinations, a beachside instance called the ""backdoor"" which has minigames that showcase/tutorial many of the games' mechanics, you can increase the game difficulty/rewards by inputting ""Limiters"" (equivalent to ""Gods"" in Bastion), fighting the final boss was challenging, game offers additional playthroughs/newgame+ called ""Recursion"" (including visual & audio changes)cons: story is told in an abstract format (not my fancy), I found the narrator rather annoying (& creepy) after a while, skills menu is a bit wonky to navigate, final boss is some emo♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending was a bit emoOverall, I found the strategic turn mode combat more satisfying than Frozen Synapse & just as fun as Xcom Enemy Unknown. This game takes a lot of what was great about Bastion & adds drastically improved gameplay mechanics. The depth of gameplay really shines after the first playthrough.Transistor has my highest recommendation, a must play especially for those who enjoyed Bastion.			"

												Lucious, and I'm not just talking about the protagonist, Red. Everything in this game is lavished with art deco style in a technology rich future where anything is possible. Cleverly written, expertly staged, there's but one drawback: Combat abilities are nearly incompehensible. A tutorial or practice mode enabling the player to experiment with the nigh countless combat options granted by the individuals you meet during the fast paced story progression.Once you muddle through what these abilities do, you realize how ingenious it all is. Just a little too ingenious for popular consumption, regrettably. If you can spare the time to overcome this flaw, dive in - you won't regret a moment of it.			"

												Transistor has one of the most unique combat engines I've seen in a game, in a good way. It's got the basic hack/slash combat, but throws a spark into it by introducing a clever ""turn-based"" feature which might feel overpowered at first. However given the weight at which you're out numbered, the game definitely knows you've got a trick up your sleeve and feels compelled to ensure you're not allowed to run rampant with it - you will lose functions, you will be forced to strategize.Combat aside, the game has a deep, fleshed out story that, while not completely interwoven with the gameplay, convinces you to earn it through actively combining various functions in various roles. It further pushes you to do this by not simply killing you upon death, but allowing you to continue fight with heavily relied upon functions being removed from your arsenal. The result being a stronger emphasis on reworking your strategy and further opening up more backstory.In short: The game does a lot of new stuff while keeping fresh some of the more traditional concepts. I'd even go as far as to say that it's brilliant on everything it does new and nothing short of great on it's weaker areas, as far and few as they even are.			"

												I liked this game, but it was primarily due to the combat style.  It uses a combination of turn-based and real-time.  The player gets to decide how to handle combat.  Does the player use TB or RT?  Most of the time I used turn-based.  Sure, I could attempt to play it like Bastion, but playing by turn gives some added benefits.  The storyline leaves much to be desired.  I found it to be full of plot holes and towards the end, it seemed rush and slapped together.  Up to that point, I found it intriguing.  However, it really loses the player towards the end.  Additionally, the difficulty curve of the game was a bit uneven in spots.  From what I found, the player would be engaged with somewhat challenging opponents and then, suddenly, would have to take on a boss that was much, much more difficult than what the player had dealt with prior.  After that point, the level of challenge never really peaked beyond the difficulty of that boss - not even the last boss.  Should you get it?  Well, that depends.  Did you like the music in Bastion?  Do you like linear, but somewhat engaging storylines?  Will the better aspects of the game (e.g. combat, music) outweigh the not-so-great?The good:Great musicDifferent style of combatNice art styleMysterious storylineGreat narrationThe bad:Still a bit glitchy after a couple of dev patchesPredictable storylineUneven difficulty curve "

												This game is a masterpiece. With one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in a game, with stunning visuals, great voice acting, astounding story, and interesting and unique combat create an experience that must be played.From the art direction, to the controls, to the Turn() system, this game oozes atmosphere and depth. I love it to bits, and I wish I could play it again and again with the same experience as I did the first time.My only gripe is that there could have been a few puzzles here and there. This idea was kinda flirted about in the beginning of the game, but never really touched on again. Puzzles would have made this game even more amazing.Overall, this is a must get. It takes around 8-10 hours to complete, and you will enjoy every minute of it.			"

												Whoever tell that ""Transistor is not Bastion""... well is right:Transistor is far better then Bastion and this should be more then enough.This game got a solid gameplay with a very nice graphic, darker then Basion's, but very appropriate to the game's background and these are the ""bad spot"".In addiction this game got a superb storyline, slow start, but will kidnap you after the first 1-2 hours of gameplay, I won't say more to avoid spoilers.Some people criticed the combat system, I can understand why, but I don't share their thought: the combat system is very funny and give the player a lot of freedom and tactics, only problem is that you will need some time to get familiarize with it, and that there are some ""combo"" which are far superior then other.I left the OST last for a reason: this game music is AWESOME! Probably on my the top 3 OST I've ever hear, and I've heared A LOT. Red (Ashley Bennet) got a wonderful, crystalline voice and all of the music accompany the player in a perfect way through the game.I reccomend everyone to play this game, it really worth your time and money :)			"

												Only tossers write lengthy steam reviews so here's a quick list of the reasons you should buy this game.Playstyle is fluid: You get a bunch of abilities, four of which you can slot. The rest of your remaining abilities can be used to augment the slotted abilities, giving bonus effects or changing the ability altogether. You can swap them around, mix and match and change them as much as you want, to find a playstyle that suits you or just to experiment with new ways to play after every fight, keeping things fresh.Art style is beautiful: The city looks amazing and intricate. The cutscenes are minimalistic but still amazingly illustrated. It's a very pretty game to look at. Setting is cool: Futuristic, yet original. It's a city where everything is done by the numbers, to the point where even the sky is painted and the weather is voted on by the residents.  It feels three dimensional. Story is interesting: It's a game that tells you nothing, but leaves tidbits here and there for you to read so you can put together the bigger picture yourself. It's a little frustrating at times but it keeps you wanting more.The music is incredible: When people hark on about a game soundtrack, I usually dismiss it. How memorable can some background music be? Transistor's answer: Phenominal. It fits the game and setting, and like the art style, experiencing it is an absolute pleasure. I've never heard a soundtrack like this before. Short answer: Buy this game. It's bloody good.			"

My Rating - Beautiful and fun with a delicious soundtrack. Definitely worth getting - even if you have trouble running it (see bolded section below)Traditional Rating - 8/10I'll highlight the key words for you.There are mostly good things to say about this game. I love how customizable the difficulty level is (similar to Bastion in that way), the enemies are varied enough that it's more effective to change up your strategy once in a while, so there's no clear ""right"" strategy or set of skills, everything flowed smoothly for me. The art work is absolutely gorgeous; I stopped multiple times just to stare at what was on my screen and be impressed with how beautiful it was. In terms of story, there's a lot of depth, but you have to look for it very often. The game gives you a living, breathing world, and it's up to you how much you want to read in to what's there. The gameplay itself was very fun and different enough from Bastion to feel new to me; there's a big ""coolness"" factor to your actions during and outside of conflicts. It's not a super long game, but it has a similar replay value to Bastion. I definitely wouldn't have asked the game to be longer, as that would pad things out unnecessarily (looking at you, Dragon Age), but I also wouldn't want it to be any shorter. I never found myself thinking ""when's this going to end?"". I'm trying to say it is the perfect length.So there's the good; now what about the bad?The steam version of this game did not run on my computer. After attempting all the patches, work-arounds, suggestions, and anti-virus disabling I possibly could, there was nothing that got it running. I'd click Play (or Run as Admin from the .exe), then nothing would happen... or it would immediately say the game had stopped responding. If this sounds like what's happening to you, go grab a torrented version from your favourite sketchy website, replace the downloaded files with the one from the cracked version and launch like normal from steam. I figure that's a fair work-around if you've already payed for the game :) Hopefully the devs find a fix for this soon.Aside from that, I felt like there could have been a little more clarity to the story. They rely very heavily on the player to be capable of piecing bits of information together. I took me a while to figure out why The Camerata went kill-crazy, and I have no idea what Red's relationship with the guy in the transistor is; my best guess for that is that he's a (not a major spoiler by any means) bodyguard/boyfriend combination of sorts. Those are pretty minor issues though. You don't need to fully grasp the story to enjoy the game, but it certainly doesn't hurt to dig deeper. My best advice for that is to read what's on the OC terminals and the biographies of the characters. There's a lot of depth you can grasp from putting the puzzle together and filling in the holes with your imagination (or maybe I just dig too deep :p)			"

												Fun tactics-based RPG where you set-up combos and try to take on enemies with as little moves as possible. Equipping Functions (the game's items) in the active, passive, and upgrade slots create a myriad of skill and character combinations, and provides strategical and tactical depth for various situations in the game. On top of that, as you use Functions, character biography is gradually revealed, providing the already rich story some additional insights.The story and presentation is artistically vague and out of this world. The intangible nature of some things in Cloudbank provides mystery and ambiance to the game, and is served up dramatically with an awesome soundtrack. As a bonus, there is a new game plus which repeats the whole game with different and more difficult enemy arrangements, reinforcing the replayability of the game.			"

												Extremely solid game mechanics meet sublative storytelling, as to be expected from the makers of Bastion.Though the two games share some similarities, Transitor does not require as much twitch skills as Bastion because you do your best work in the paused strategic planning mode, Turn(), that has you just plotting out what you will do to perfection, then execute it and see it done.  Given that kind of power, Transistor is not too hard, but you can activate ""Limiters"" that boost xp rewards in exchange for raising the difficulty.  Things are kept interesting by a clever mixing of various ""functions"" that each can be slotted as one of your four activatable skills, a buff to a slotted activatable skill, or a passive benefit.Clocking in at about 7 1/2 hours to complete, Transistor is one game whose content does not outlast the appeal of its robust game mechanics.  However, there is a ""recursion"" mode which is basically ""New Game+"" (start over, with minor differences from the first run, retain everything you gathered during your first run, even gather doubles of the same ""functions."")  Though, even with recursion mode, you'll eventually run out of challenges and level upgrades, and then there's not a whole lot of point to keep playing.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, Transistor keeps things short and sweet.			"

												Awesome. Another great game by Supergiant.If you liked Bastion, be prepared for something different. The play style of the game teeters on almost ""too"" experimental, but I really liked the risk the developers took.It is much more futuristic than fantasy. The story is... A little confusing at first, but that is what makes you want to go back and play it a second go around. Make sure you investigate. There is much more than lies on the surface with this game.Also, the ""leveling up"" system is pretty great with the different attack styles and such. Makes you experiment even more and see what you can get to work.If you are cool with small time developers, deep(ish) story, and pretty good risk taking, check this one out. You'll most likely like it.			"

												Beautifully stunning art style.Gameplay was a breath of fresh air, both simple and complex depending on which limiters you enable and your moveset.Story made the onion ninjas appear, could feel the emotions of the characters.Dont get me started on the soundtrack for this game; mesmerizing, it really set the mood and added to the atmosphere of each area... Darren Korb and Ashley Lynn Barrett really deserve a lot of credit for the masterpieces they created. "

												Transistor is by far the best single-player experience I've had in a while. This game quickly immersed me in its unique world and original story. The soundtrack was stellar, Darren Korb did a wonderful job, not to mention Ashley Barret's vocals. The gameplay was very strategy-based but managed to stay well-paced enough to keep me interested. But what really made the game for me was Logan Cunningham's performance as the Transistor.The mere fact that the Transistor had a voice and personality was a great choice. Without him, the game would've felt lonely and fairly empty. The dynamic voice lines that made the Transistor react to situations made him feel a lot more real and I eventually fell infatuated with his and Red's relationship. The few other characters were also very well done, and the voice actors for them were all phenomenal.The gameplay, as said before, was unusual but fun. The ""turn"" mechanic I had not seen in a game before, but it was very well polished. I found myself trying out functions left and right for new effects which proved very useful, less I go through the entire game with Joust as an Active Function. Many of the fights were simple once I understood the core mechanics, so I added ""Limits"" in order to challenge myself. I found this to make some specific fights harder, while most stayed the same difficulty.The art and music added to the feel of the world's dystopian setting. I can't really describe this any better than it would be for you to just watch the trailer or pick up the game. Both are among the best that the video game industry has offered in this decade.If you are looking for a fairly short game with a lot of replayability, this is definitely the game for you. While not the most challenging game, it's definitely one worth playing through once or twice or five times. Between the breathtaking ambience, stunning performance, and astounding story and gameplay, Transistor is definitely one of my favorite games from the last few years.			"

												This is a beautiful game with an interesting story and a peculiar combat system that blends turn-based and real-time combat.  You can unlock peices of the world's lore by useing your skills in combat which is very interesting for me and forced me to use almost all of the skills to find out as much info as possible.

												If you appreciate elegant story telling, excellent voice acting, challenging and unique combat, incredible music, and downright breathtakingly beautiful art then you will enjoy this game. I first purchased this gem a few years ago during a sale only to try it out and discard it, what a huge mistake. After picking Transistor up again and giving it the attention it truly deserves I was blown away. It had me hooked instantly and before I knew it six hours had flown by. Everything about this game is polished to a shine from the unique story telling to the stunning art. Albeit short by most standards every minute of this game is filled to the brim with beautiful art, a captivating narrative, and fun semi-turn based combat. This game also has a sort of new game + I did not try it out but I assume it adds a fair amount of replayability if you're into that sort of thing. I would recommend playing this game at night with the lights off to fully enjoy the art this game has to offer.Overall pretty good game would recommend, ez value.			"

												Quite honostly, I loved the game. I loved the characters, game-style, the mood and the music most of all! However, there is no excuse for it being so short of a campaign. I ended up beating the game in three hours of playtime and only found myself confronting 3 bosses. The character-relationship buildup between the sword and Red is awesome, and would have made the ending (no spoiler) so much more powerful if we could spend more time playing the game and seeing their dynamic grow.Pros:+Fun and unique gameplay+Unbelievably great music for the mood the game sets+Dramatic Film-Noir feel+Customizable level-up and upgrade system+Dramatic, intense story that makes you want more!Cons:-Too. Damn. Short.If the campaign were twice as long, I'd give this game a 9.5/10HOWEVER--because of it's super short campaign, I must give it a 8/10. Not a bad rating, I guess, but not as good as it should be.			"

												The lowest point of the game is a somewhat... empty story (as in, there isn't a whole lot there). In that regard, Bastion was more fleshed out. There is a healthy amount of worldbuilding to uncover, but it still leaves a lot of questions about the nature of the world. The enemy combinations become a little repetitive towards the end of the game.That's the most criticism I can level at this game. The combat is very deep - you have a ton of options for how to go about defeating enemies, and there's a decent variety of them. The challenges add nice side options as well, and one of them is basically winning with random abilities available and a great way to discover new tricks and combinations. There's a ton of ways to win at combat. In short, the story is a bit lacking, but the gameplay is solid, and I wish for more. It's not quite Bastion, but it's a solid game at a very reasonable price.			"

While it can be argued that it doesn't have quite the depth that Bastion did, story-wise, it certainly makes up for it in interesting and highly customizeable combat. The music, as always, is wonderful as well and available for streaming on Spotify and Google Music.			"

												Probably one of my favorite games. People who enjoyed Bastion will feel right at home, as the two games are extremely similar with Transistor mainly changing and improving the combat system. The storyline is compelling and thoroughly enjoyable. Very short game. 5-8 hours with trying out all the challenges and reading the extralore and watching all the beach cutscenes. Worth 20 bucks? Yeah, but I'd much more recomend it on a sale. Definitely worth picking up even on its normal price.			"

												Supergiant Games, who're also behind Bastion, really know how to make games that shine through in my opinion.Games can sometimes seem bland and even unimportant and I play a lot of games that feel like that...When I encounter games like Transistor, I start thinking about why I even play the games that don't do thing as well. I held back with playing transistor for a very long time because people had been going into transistor to play another 'Bastion', and had been dissapointed. So I really wanted to forget the idea that this would be another 'Bastion' and I almost did, untill... I played the game.I didn't regard 'another Bastion' as something that would come in mechanical or storywise likeliness, but rather a game that did the same to me, that Bastion did.The game starts you off 'in medias res' and gives to few clues as to why you're here and what you're doing, the story unfolds at it's own pace and through the two-person monologue that takes place, with this time's narrarator. The game immediately striked me as a viual masterpiece, but that also leads me to one of my complaints... The only graphical option there is, is resolution. Now, I get it, most of the game is hand-drawn, which is really impresive, but it still wouldn't hurt to throw some graphical option in there, especially because there is a short part where Red, the main character, is really close to the screen and I noticed she was very, very blurry and was the one time I was taken out of the experience.Now that I've mentioned one critique, let's jusmp right into the next one... I want more, I mean I don't think there's anything wrong with the game being a 5-or-so hour experience but I have a hard time using the game's 'recourse' (NewGame+) because the game is so dependant on the narrative and the experience, that playing it a second time for challange seems like sacrificial butchering to me, with that said I understand that some people don't feel that way, It's just a bit short, so don't expect to be using 10+ hours on this game. ...This paragraph was me whining that I liked it so much that I want more.I must say, there are few things that capture me like this game, the whole of just work so damned well. I mean the atmosphere, the music, the visuals, the mechanical feel of the game, and the story clash toghether beautifully, and just make me feel the story so much, I even found myself answering on behalf of Red a few times. And not just that old ""Oh you're gonna die.""-type of stuff, but heartfelt replies to what happened in the world.The atmosphere is desolate and dystopian, you're alone and you're fighting against odds, in a world where help comes very indirectly. I ended feeling a longing for the people close to the main character, and I was afraid on her behalf not to see them again (Spoilers, someone you know is not with you at some part of the game). The visuals work very well with the atmosphere as the city to start is dark and empty while giving an urban-look which in it's whole is very unsetteling. Of course Darren Korb has done it again, and composed a masterpiece of a soundtrack which just hits the spot. I don't have much more to say about that, really. All of this of course compliments the story which I would characterize as beautiful, dystopian and tragic.The last thing I want to discuss are the mechanics. They strike me odd, but interesting,  and very appealing, but they feel heavy and a bit hard-maneuvarable. Surprisingly I don't have a problem with them though as I feel they reflect the position Red is in.In conclution:I love this game.I will soon be using this game to write a project, along with other similar games with narrators.

												To Those expecting this to be just a not-so-good version of Bastion? It's compareable. I wont call it betterm, because Bastion is a gameing masterpiece, but this comes very, very close. This game took several upgraes from where Bastion came from. It has more voice acting, enhanced combat system, and it's more open with it's lore. (Sort of)And to fans of Ashley Barret, the girl who sang Build that Wall? She has 6 vocal songs in this game. So another awesome plus.(None of them sung by Korb. Boooooo)This game is alot harder then Bastion, but sacrifices the casual attitude for a confuseing, but well thought out, plot, insane character details, and many many more.If you played Bastion, get this. You have that feeling that this just 'wont be the same' ? Well it will be I promise you. If you decide to get it, Enjoy! It's worth the money. Also, Pyre. THat's comeing out. Make sure to play this before it's release, so you could be there to play all of Supergiant's games in order of release.			"

												It's a strange game, to be fair. The turn-based/action RPG thing takes some getting used to. Then encounters become almost laughably easy once you understand it and what some of the nastier combos are. - though a brilliant bit of game design makes you try different combinations anyway to unlock more backstory on what's going on. The story is very good and gives you enough information that you generally get what's going on without holding your hand or taking out out of the game for an exposition dump. A few questions remain unanswered, which actually is something I liked - the character spends most of the game on the run from a powerful enemy, so it made sense that I never felt 100% in control of everything. Top notch sound and artistic direction. Between this and Bastion, there may not be anyone that beats Supergiant Games in those departments.Not everyone will love it, but it definitely has something new to offer and is worth a try.			"

												I had really high expectations for this game when it came out and even though it wasn't quite what I imagined, I still enjoyed it. The main problem with it is the story because it is told very, very vaguely and you really have to work hard to figure out exactly what is going on. It kinda bothers me because, to me, the story is usually important because it contextualizes your actions within the game. As a result, for those trying to figure out what's going on, part of the experience is lost. However, the combat really makes up for it and the music just sounds fantastic. So, I can safely recommend this game based solely on these two things because that's what I enjoyed the most about it.			"

Gameplay was fun, and like Bastion you can easily make it way more difficult if you want. If you thought one set of moves was making it too easy, you could easily completely change your play style with a different set of attacks which makes you think of it in a different way.The story was a lot shorter then I expected though. which left me thinking that more could have been done with it.Final note, steam music lets me listen to the soundtrack all the time now since I am too lazy to load it on itunes.

												Let me begin by saying Transistor had big shoes to fill after the indie gaming victory that was Bastion. Transistor's story is delivered in a fashion only slightly removed from Supergiant's trademark narrated style, and whilst not executed badly it does lack that breath of fresh air that Bastion delivered. The characters have their story fleshed out with unlockable text snippets, detailing their lives and events leading up to the start of your playthrough. The odd fallout from this is it almost seems the plot and intrigue has all already unfolded retrospetively; which, when coupled with mining oodles of text and only tenuous explanation of major plot progression, makes for reduced immersion and ephemeral characters.That said, you're probably dusting off your hands and thinking ""well I guess that's a no to Transistor!"". Actually Transistor brings a lot to the table regardless of its weaknesses, like many a classic game. The precise combat mechanics and endlessly customisable skill sets are what makes the title worthy of your valuable gamer hours. The difficulty ramps up at a steady pace, thanks to enemies that scale with your levels, wielding a variety of unique threats. One minute you're master of your art, the next a new contender appears and makes you rethink your style. The replay option keeping all your skill progress is a fantastic feature on top, do try this title if you liked Bastion.			"

												This game met the expectations beset by Bastion: better combat, the same great narration we have come to expect from the likes of Logan Cunningham, the amazing music provided by Ashely Barrett and Darren Korb, and a high-calliber story to boot.But, comparisons invited need adressing:-The story is different, but not in a bad way, because it is an entirely different story: Bastion was more of a world-focused, mini-epic, and Transistor is closer to a film noir. It is more of a personal journey of the titular character Red, and the voice trapped in the Transistor. I still feel that there are some themes(especially towards the end) that seem a bit similar to Bastion, but on the whole, it is a different story. It is still great, especially if you can enjoy something nuanced.-The combat is a bit heavy to begin with, but it is a joy to experiment with. It is built in such a way that you can employ any strategy you wish to, without making the game too easy or too hard: I often found myself using Jaunt(a dodge/dash move) as my primary damage output, and I wasn't punished for it, which is nice. I still think that whilst its preferrable to utilise the Turn() mechanic, it is entirely possible to use only the real time part of the combat. There are enough cooldown modifying abilities that you could unleash entire barrages at the enemy without having to go into Turn().Aside from that, well the music is a bit more cyber-punk, as goes with the setting, but it did satisfy me more than Bastion's soundtrack. However, that is due to my own preferences in music. The art style is still as gorgeous as it was before, and the enemy design and variation are also pretty good.Overall, it is definitely worth your time: it improved in Bastion in its gameplay, the story is brilliant, and everything else is of the same(if not greater) standard than the studio's previous title. It is well worth the asking price, because it is that damn good.			"

												RATING: 9/10Absolutely stunning visuals and interesting combat style. Personally, I haven't played Bastion so I did not know what to expect - but I was wow'd! The benefit of this playstyle is that it really allows you to plan your moves, learn your abilities for a speedier play through. This is not just a simple hack and slash game!The narration wasn't over bearing, Logan Cunningham was an absolute pleasure to listen to. What's more, even without constant chatter between comrades, you could get a real feel for the characters emotions towards eachother, as well as an overall sense of Red's character.The storyline was enthralling, and you're glued to the computer screen to play this through. I finished in 10 hours (because I enjoy small things) but you could finish it in less. Without giving too much away, I would say the ONLY minor con to this game was the lack of boss fights.			"

												I fell in love with a USB Greatsword. Transistor is one of a kind. The narrator from Bastion is back with his sultry voice commentating and ever so slightly guiding you along this broken story about a girl, Red, who lost her voice in a futuristic, neon lit gorgeously drawn city.The Good-The customization of your spells is near endless. You have 4 attack spells total on screen. Each can be customized with two other spells. Your character has 4 passive spells. Every move can be placed in any slot and within every slot is a different ability for that spell. 10/10 on customization.The artstyle keeps you hooked. The narrator is, as always, fantastic. If you enjoyed him in Bastion, Transistor is no different.The Bad-The story is short and linear. But hey, it's almost not even noticeable since you spend so much time customizing your layout and mapping out your battlefield.I highly recommend this game to any fan of Bastion and any fan of Turn-based strategy games. I hope to see more done with this game in the future			"

												Beautifully executed game. Combines a 1920s theme and a future technology theme that blend together almost perfectly, and is can be seen throughout the game in the numerous splash artworks that are found as you go. The voice actor for the transistor, personally, has the mode captivating voice I have ever heard since Rucks from Bastion. The combat system in the game is well done, and the various abilities and combinations allow for different types of gameplay. It's somewhat of a real-time, yet turn-based method, where you can basically stop time to plan out your attacks. Once you have completed attacking, you must survive the next few seconds until you have a chance to stop time again. The storyline itself is understood as a love story from the beginning, with a tragic end. The music in the game is atmospheric and soothing, and the soft, muffled humming that can be heard in-between turns is possibly my favorite part of the game. I'm hope that they will release a Transistor announcer for Dota 2, because the Transistor's voice is sublime.10/10, would recommend to anyone.			"

Oh don't get me started. The music is remarkable, I listen to it times a day...

												Totally stunning. Every scene in this game is a work of art and I couldn't get enough. I really dig the story and how the world itself isn't explicitly described; you just have to take all the aspects you're given and piece together your own impression of this sci-fi dreamscape. In terms of gameplay, I enjoyed the combat system. I don't often come across a game with multiple interchangable skills that really encourages me to try different combinations. Usually I find my 2 or 3 favourites and stick with them all game, but this system of losing/regaining skills gave me the extra push to experiment, and that was cool! The soundtrack is magnificent, as everyone says (I'm sure it would sound incredible on vinyl *wink nudge*). It's all the little touches that made this really special for me, like finding a peaceful, pretty spot and letting Red hum a tune. It's easy to tell that a lot of love and care went into this, thank you! I'd recommend this to anyone.			"

												Just... play it. It is beautiful in every single aspect. Its visuals, music, audio design, story and gameplay are all wonderful. Many people are saying the game is too short, but you must explore the world. The developers have thought about every tiny detail for you and it is greatly rewarding. The story is very hard to get, but it is a marvellous story. And if you think the game is too easy, use the limiters, seriously! They are there for a reason.(Plan on writing a proper review later, this is more of a recommendation).			"

Extremely deep customization and combat systems, excellent art design, level design, enemy design, everything design. And of course, Ashley Barrett's deep and heartfelt vocals lend Red a voice for all of time. I'm still scratching my head over the story; a replay is required to fully decipher everything.That said, the ending was a bit less stellar than Bastion's, and the conflict more opaque. But, the game is better overall. For $20, this game is a steal. 9/10 stars.			"

												I could write an entire essay/article on this game, I'm not going to for the sheer fact that I'm lazy and hope that whoever reads this will take my word and buy the game.NOTICE: *Although my steam record says that I have 4.6 hours played, I actually spent a total of about 9-10 hours playing the whole game itself. The reason for why is because I went offline for those good 6 or so other hours. I've played and beaten this game once already.*     Transistor...Oh what to say about this wonderful game that has kept my weekend more than entertaining for me. This game is something that I've been looking for a long time. With it's interesting combat system, the artful use of combining skills and attacks, Transistor and it's creator, Supergiant Games, shows off a more than polished interactive experience that'll be sure to glue your eyes to the screen for countless hours.      The combat system, to me at least, is something that you can compare to VATS from the fallout games, only in a sense that you're able to choose your attacks and inflict them to whoever you wish provided that you have the resources to do it. This system is a big plus for me in that it gives me the choice on a situation and how I'd like to tackle it. It left it to my decision and in doing so, kept me in my chair (may I add that it is an uncomfortable one) for hours at a time.      The storyline was confusing at first, but once I progressed through the story I found that it was a pretty good one. Nothing that blew my mind, but still was a little more than satisfactory.     In short, buy this game. You're not going to regret it, especially if you got it on sale.   "

												I generally liked Bastion, Supergiant's first game and was thrilled by its soundtrack and voiceover by Logan Cunningham (This guy is the gaming Morgan Freeman). On this note i was thrilled when transistor came out but held myself till it was on sale to pick it. I thought it's price was a little too high for it's gameplay experience. I just finished it yesterday and i have to say i would buy it full price any day and I am looking forward to Supergiant Games new project. The battle system was intense because you can either play turn based or real time depending on the mobs you encounter and the skills are pretty cool too. The game isn't hard to master but it gets harder too sudden when the ""Man"" and ""Haircut"" mobs appear. Anyway after restarting 3-4 times every stage and change my skills i managed to kill everything pretty quickly. Bosses are relatively easy and fun to win against ;)The main Thumbs Up to Supergiant Games though is the soundtrack once more. If you liked the Bastion music you will LOVE Transistor's too. Darren Korb really put together all the intensity of Red's struggle through the town and Ashley Barret's voice suited Red like a glove. The narration by Logan Cummingham is off the top again, he makes the game so intense with his voice as the""Transistor"" that he can make even the haters agree that they did a very good job.My overal experience was amazing but i am not a very objective person to say it because i liked Bastion too much to hate Transistor. It's a worth buying game in my opinion, especially if you are an ost and story game lover.- K :)			"

												Transistor is a fascinating exercise and succeeds in much of what it sets out to do.Great soundtrack, unique art style, gorgeous animations - these seem to be the common threads between Bastion and this title that work exceptionally well.Transistor's voice actor, Rucks from the first game, doesn't work so well. The muddled storyline also isn't well presented - although I do love the clever Terminal interactions that you come across, as well as the story's overall themes.The combat mechanics, while interesting, don't offer as great a depth as it may first appear. Certain combinations are incredibly deadly while others simply don't work for many situations. The differences between using Turn and not using Turn are extreme - it would have been great to offer the possibility (and achievement!) of doing the whole game without using a single Turn. The best part here was learning the unique mechanics and interactions.It seems almost designed for multiplayer too - in a style as seen in the Agency tests? This is disappointing. Although I can see some of the combos would have to be rebalanced.There is a lot to like here, and I am glad that I waited until it dropped to 50% off, and I can recommended it - but it's a light recommendation. There is no doubt that Supergiant Games have built another incredible world that I am glad to have explored.			"

												Supergiant Games have done it again. Bastion is still one of my favourite games of all time; with its music, its solid, simple yet fun gameplay, its story which drew me in immediately and left me with so many wonderful questions about the world, music which blew me away and is still a joy to listen to outside of the game, characters which I adored and wnated to protect at all costs, I couldn't put it odnw. I have completed it something like three or four times... The game has left me in tears at the beauty of its story each time... But this isn't a review about Bastion.This is about Transistor.I get exactly the same from Transistor as what I got from Bastion. Do not buy on sale. buy at full price. Get the soundtrack. Experience it, love it, adore it, have your mind filled with questions about this fantastic, wonderful world, learn about all the people lost in this and still feel a connection to each, uncover the mysteries of the Process.If the game has any down-points it is that I am left with many more questions about the setting and the world than I did with Bastion but... I am only on my first playthrough... What happens next remains to be seen.			"

												This is my first review on Steam, and am compelled to write one as a result of playing and finishing this game.Great storyline, I've never seen such witty and creative narrative from a game - it was like being inside a graphic novel. The develop has done a great job balancing the game. You set the difficulty depending on how aggresive you want to level up the main protagonist. I tried using several Limiter functions at once, but got my rear handed to me in turn.Couldnt put this game down. The level of customization is fantastic and let's you tinker with how you build your main attack and turn functions. Graphics are beautiful and the color palette draws you right in. The game is just absolutely gorgeous.Sound and music are a main part of the game- I won't spoil that for anyone here.This game recently made it's way to iOS and made the Apple featured page!Support the developer and check out this unique title.

												From Supergaint Games (the same people who brought you Bastion), comes he Sci-FI Acton RPG Transistor, a game that feels like a more futuristic Bastion but with a futuristic setting and with a silent female protagonist named Red, with the narrator taking the form of the talking sword she carries with her (that has he conciousness of a man close to Red) as she peices together what happened to her as well as what is happening to the city of Cloudbank. The game's soundtrack fits in perfectly and is really quite amazing. The game gives the player the job of trying to peice together the stpry as it unravels through voice recordings, terminal messages, and exchanges between the characters. The game can be played with a gamepad but i found a mouse and key to suit better for gameplay. The combat system is complex in the sense that Red has the ability to stop time with ()turn and allow her to plan movements, attacks and combos with limitations of course. Take too much damage and a function you have equipped will short circuit, casuing you to return to another user terminal to try and recover it after a battle. Having all your functions destroyed ultimately cuases death. Each function can be equpided to the Transistor for a main attack, another function for an added effect, or to Red herself for a buff like extended health. The fuction system provides different styles of gameplay and different powerful combinations. The versitility of how these functuions are equipped add to the story becuase the functions, appart from being attacks and various buffs, are actually the essenses of some of cloudbank's finest. The more you use a function in a different slot, the more you'll discover about the person behind the function. The game does a great job of haing the player peice together what is going on, tagged along with a great soundtrack, gorgeous graphics and snazzy voice work make a great game. BUT the game feels just a tad short...that's what made me a little disapointed..so while the game is good, it is recomended to buy during a sale :p			"

												Transistor is probably one of my favourite games of all time, for a variety of reasons, which includes things such as masterfully crafted artwork and aesthetics, an amazing soundtrack by Darren Korb, and an incredible world-setting, characters and lore. This is, of course, a non-exhaustive list, and it has a surprising amount of replayability value for both the completionist and the non-completionist.Just like Bastion, it's a story-rich game that leaves a lot of the world to the player's interpretation and imagination, with only one constant voice to accompany you through the game: the Transistor's. The optional rooms found within the Backdoors are challenging but non-intensive and fun, and there's a certain charm in exploring all of the areas to find all of the interactive objects to hear the Transistor/narrator expound upon the world.The cons of this game would include things such as the combat system, which can be difficult to get used to at first (or be frustrating if you decide to use limiters), and the lack of obvious direction in-game (as you might end up progressing before you mean to), though these would only be a problem if you're a completionist. Luckily enough, you can go through this games as many times as you want in the NG+ mode, which basically eliminates these issues.It's definitely worth the full price, but grabbing this game during a sale only makes the entire experience better. ; )			"

												Supergiant is steadily becoming one of my favorite developers.  Bastion was amazing enough, but Transistor went even further with the strength of its art, music, sentimental narrative (Cunningham's voice is become quite iconic in its own right!), and more than anything, its mechanics with the customizable ability system, setting it apart from Bastion entirely.  Both of their games make me realize why I now prefer smaller companies in gaming: a smaller number of dedicated people making a smaller game seems much more likely to never lose sight of their creative focus, and the end product is often a more memorable and rewarding experience than an big budget pile of trendy mediocrity where things either drag on to the point of tedium, or abruptly end in unfulfilled disappointment.My only regret is that I can't SPECIFICALLY explain why I love Transistor so much without spoiling what makes it so memorable, so I'm stuck with being vague.  All I can say is that I was extremely happy to play this game, despite...well, if anyone's finished the game, they know.  After the emotional reaction I got from Bastion, I would expect no less from Transistor.  They delivered exactly what I was hoping for, and let's just say there's a very good reason why I refused to buy this game without the soundtrack bundled in.  I only wish I could get an artbook to go with it.I really wish I didn't have to be so cryptic, but this is one of those games that you just do not spoil.  It's just so refreshing to see a game like this.			"

												Another beautiful blend of art and storytelling by Supergiant Games.  I'm pretty much sold.  Next thing they come out with, I'm likely to buy it, blind.Similar to Bastion, you're plopped into a mythos where the assumption is that you already know how everything here works -now, quickly, come help, we've got a problem.  Again, you go careening down a gorgeous rabbit-hole with a perfect blend of real-time and strategic-planning combat.  Another brilliant example of interactive storytelling where you are placed in the plot.			"

												Transistor is a great, short game that combines a unique combat mechanic, very cool art design and music, and a thought-provoking, emotionally-involving story that manages to Show Don't Tell despite the fact that you're tailed through the entire game by a narrator.The narrator, incidentally, talks pretty much non-stop through the entire experience, but manages to do so without being annoying, which may be Transistor's most remarkable accomplishment.

If you're looking for a game thats a just a bit different that's still great to play then you found it, just buy it, it's that good.It's incredibly pretty to look at, I enjoyed it more than some major big games thats come out. I didn't find the soundtrack as amazing as people say, it really fits the game, and it's great but the gameplay is just awesome. I played it through twice in 1 sitting and loved it both times and still felt sad at the end.It is short, a speed run is probably about 5 hours maybe, but it is COMPLETLY worth it!			"

												As a fan of Bastion and Cyperpunk♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is probably one of my favorites. One of the biggest things of Bastion was the soundtrack, and Darren Korb certainly didn't disapoint. And if you miss Logan Cunningham's voice, GET READY HE'S BACK. Now before you go thinking this is just another Bastion with different textures, it isn't. The combat system has been completely redone, with the ability to stop time turning it into more of a turnbased fighter; upgrades are still a pretty big part but you can now mix and match them for the strongest ability you can get. All in all, it's pretty ♥♥♥♥in great 10/10			"

												Though the game is fairly short, it's still a very enjoyable experience, with lovely visuals and story, despite the fact it may seem basic and simple enough. The combat system is very well-made, and revolves around planning - Not so much on luck.  The game's humor - while it isn't much, it IS still in there - feels very natural and doesn't take away from the game at all. While I personally suggest you wait until it is 50% off, as I wouldn't really pay $20 for it, it still is a very enjoyable game.			"

												This is my first review on Steam, and am compelled to write one as a result of playing and finishing this game.Great storyline, I've never seen such witty and creative narrative from a game - it was like being inside a graphic novel. The develop has done a great job balancing the game. You set the difficulty depending on how aggresive you want to level up the main protagonist. I tried using several Limiter functions at once, but got my rear handed to me in turn.Couldnt put this game down. The level of customization is fantastic and let's you tinker with how you build your main attack and turn functions. Graphics are beautiful and the color palette draws you right in. The game is just absolutely gorgeous.Sound and music are a main part of the game- I won't spoil that for anyone here.This game recently made it's way to iOS and made the Apple featured page!Support the developer and check out this unique title.

												After playing Bastion then after heard Transistor was being made I couldn't wait for it to comeout. And after it came out if for somereason  hasitated to buying this game...and i regret it so much.This game is great. I'm going to say this right away.you play as an (once again) silent protaganist name Red (Maybe it's becoming tradition) a singer who lost her voice who carrys this sword shape thing called the transistor which has a person talking through it. She goes around without a voice but through out the adventure having the guy in the Transistor talks to red. This give the game a more story without a stop either through cutscene or even while in combat, giving the so beautiful flow in progression and story telling. Besides that the skim of the story is while travaling through town you realise it's empty. like the only thing that inhabited the city are these robot thing called process and it's up to you and your bud in the transistor to find out whats going on in your city.Theres so much to talk about in gameplay.The gameplay is simple and by simple i mean it's major linear path with rich story element and  beatiful enviorment. While walking through these paths you run into enemies. This time however they introduce the how they call it a action/turnbase rpg element, but i just like to call it action/RUN WHERE you like and ♥♥♥♥ em up mechanic. The game allow you to carry 4 ability at max but with those 4 ability you can also stack other abilities you collected in the game, either you use at as an attack or an upgrade to your already equiped attack. This games keep you on the edge and give you a reason to experiment with the new combo of upgrades and skill, but why stop there? The obtained ability can also be equiped on your passive bar to weild bonus ""turn"" bar faster or  boost your defence and such. before forget i did mention a turn bar. it's this game awesome gimick. this is where you stop time to think about what to you want to proform. each ability takes up a bar as well as movement. depending on the action you remove that part of the bar. the more you use, the more it has to recharge and while recharging you cant attack unless theres an upgrade for that attack that grants it enable while in recovery. after you end ""turn"" you start to do those action within a second while seeing everything happen in slowmo and seeing your character moving lighting fast aswell at being invincible to any attack in this effect. The veriety of enemies are enough to keep you interested though the last enemy type you face is joke. it pose no threat. like all the otherstuff is great but seing that was the last enemy type you'll see before the final act is really pathetic.phew. Out of the gameplay talk. Now the graphic. A bit simular as bastion but this time no falling tiles and all that weird stuff. This game do gets it's own great element. These people never cease to amaise me. All the colors city light   to just plain halls is just a beautiful sight. it's downright beautiful.Like the music in Bastion?. Well once again this game nails it. through out the game you can use the hum button. when hold down button red will hum to the music thats playing in the background. I even regret not using it at someplaces in my first playthrough. Does this game has replaybility. Yes. at any checkpoint station in the game you can configure the dificulty of the process. you can grant them double damage, sheilds and some other stuff i forgot about. They did this in bastion too but this time adding more veriety in the dificulty setup.You will not unlock everything in your first playthrough and playing it again will keep your abilities and upgrade intact aswell is all the process dificulty setup unlocked. This game is allot of fun and Cant wait for my next playthrough.This game gets a 5/ out of 5.A game that  you should absolutly play. Do buy it. Though it is quite short and i did beat it in one sitting. It's still oh so worth it.			"

												Quite honostly, I loved the game. I loved the characters, game-style, the mood and the music most of all! However, there is no excuse for it being so short of a campaign. I ended up beating the game in three hours of playtime and only found myself confronting 3 bosses. The character-relationship buildup between the sword and Red is awesome, and would have made the ending (no spoiler) so much more powerful if we could spend more time playing the game and seeing their dynamic grow.Pros:+Fun and unique gameplay+Unbelievably great music for the mood the game sets+Dramatic Film-Noir feel+Customizable level-up and upgrade system+Dramatic, intense story that makes you want more!Cons:-Too. Damn. Short.If the campaign were twice as long, I'd give this game a 9.5/10HOWEVER--because of it's super short campaign, I must give it a 8/10. Not a bad rating, I guess, but not as good as it should be.			"

												The lowest point of the game is a somewhat... empty story (as in, there isn't a whole lot there). In that regard, Bastion was more fleshed out. There is a healthy amount of worldbuilding to uncover, but it still leaves a lot of questions about the nature of the world. The enemy combinations become a little repetitive towards the end of the game.That's the most criticism I can level at this game. The combat is very deep - you have a ton of options for how to go about defeating enemies, and there's a decent variety of them. The challenges add nice side options as well, and one of them is basically winning with random abilities available and a great way to discover new tricks and combinations. There's a ton of ways to win at combat. In short, the story is a bit lacking, but the gameplay is solid, and I wish for more. It's not quite Bastion, but it's a solid game at a very reasonable price.			"

While it can be argued that it doesn't have quite the depth that Bastion did, story-wise, it certainly makes up for it in interesting and highly customizeable combat.

												This game met the expectations beset by Bastion: better combat, the same great narration we have come to expect from the likes of Logan Cunningham, the amazing music provided by Ashely Barrett and Darren Korb, and a high-calliber story to boot.But, comparisons invited need adressing:-The story is different, but not in a bad way, because it is an entirely different story: Bastion was more of a world-focused, mini-epic, and Transistor is closer to a film noir. It is more of a personal journey of the titular character Red, and the voice trapped in the Transistor. I still feel that there are some themes(especially towards the end) that seem a bit similar to Bastion, but on the whole, it is a different story. It is still great, especially if you can enjoy something nuanced.-The combat is a bit heavy to begin with, but it is a joy to experiment with. It is built in such a way that you can employ any strategy you wish to, without making the game too easy or too hard: I often found myself using Jaunt(a dodge/dash move) as my primary damage output, and I wasn't punished for it, which is nice. I still think that whilst its preferrable to utilise the Turn() mechanic, it is entirely possible to use only the real time part of the combat. There are enough cooldown modifying abilities that you could unleash entire barrages at the enemy without having to go into Turn().Aside from that, well the music is a bit more cyber-punk, as goes with the setting, but it did satisfy me more than Bastion's soundtrack. However, that is due to my own preferences in music. The art style is still as gorgeous as it was before, and the enemy design and variation are also pretty good.Overall, it is definitely worth your time: it improved in Bastion in its gameplay, the story is brilliant, and everything else is of the same(if not greater) standard than the studio's previous title. It is well worth the asking price, because it is that damn good.			"

												This is the next game from SuperGiant Games; the developers of Bastion. The art style and music are incredibly similar in the two, but the gameplay is very different. Transistor feels like a character action game mixed with an RPG. With infinite combinations of different movesets Transistor will keep you playing although the story mode is only 6 hours. A New Game+ brings new challenge to the game allowing you to restart with harder enemies, but keeping your current levels allows for at least a second playthrough. The side challenges add time too they are difficult, but not frustrating and feel very rewarding when you finish them. The music and art is beautiful and the story is told to you through not only plot, but exploration as well. Transistor is a sold 8.5 out of 10 and deserves a twenty (or thirty for the amazing soundtrack) dollar purchase.			"

												Beautifully executed game. Combines a 1920s theme and a future technology theme that blend together almost perfectly, and is can be seen throughout the game in the numerous splash artworks that are found as you go. The voice actor for the transistor, personally, has the mode captivating voice I have ever heard since Rucks from Bastion. The combat system in the game is well done, and the various abilities and combinations allow for different types of gameplay. It's somewhat of a real-time, yet turn-based method, where you can basically stop time to plan out your attacks. Once you have completed attacking, you must survive the next few seconds until you have a chance to stop time again. The storyline itself is understood as a love story from the beginning, with a tragic end. The music in the game is atmospheric and soothing, and the soft, muffled humming that can be heard in-between turns is possibly my favorite part of the game. I'm hope that they will release a Transistor announcer for Dota 2, because the Transistor's voice is sublime.10/10, would recommend to anyone.			"

												TL;DR? If you liked Bastion, then buy this one as well. Comparisons are inevitable with Bastion, including strengths (writing, music, artwork, gameplay) and weaknesses (level design, repetitive combat). Where Transistor shines is with the time stopping mechanism and the unique ways in which you can combine the combat powers. With both of these aspects, the game is challenging and compelling enough to motivate you forward. It's a short game (under 20 hours, maybe even less without using limiters). I want to say that it's better than Bastion, but in the end, I'll say it's a different take on this genre. Score: 8/10			"

Transistor has a very unique gameplay, amazing sound design (Supergiant games are the best at it, in my opinion), and just as good visual design. The customization of the skill system is probably the biggest I have ever seen, you can try out different combinations and it is very interesting to look for the best combo you can achieve.Supergiant Games proved that Bastion was not just a one time success. Although they are a very small team, but already they are supergiants of the video games industry. Can't wait for their future projects.			"

												Transistor is a brilliantly amazing game. Amazing combat that fuses real-time and RPG elements, one of the best soundtracks of all time, mesmerizing graphics with a beautiful art style and solid voice acting pack it all into one amazing game. What's best about this game is that it's not made with idiots in mind. The game presumes you are a gamer and have the mindset of one, it expects you to learn quickly and adapt quickly. That really keeps the pace up and keeps the game fun. There's also multiple ways to play in terms of techniques and abilities. The story and the world are very interesting but the ending is quite confusing and worth mulling over. All in all one of the best games of all time in my opinion, simply because of how genius it is. Everything here is amazing.			"

												I have not played Transistor for a particularly long time and as far as I can tell, only around 1/5 of the way through the storyline, perhaps a little more. I can however, with absoluteness, say that this game is simply amazing. It has stunning music that is simply captivating. If you don't believe me go look up the OST on youtube. The graphics, wow. I was blown away at the detail and vibrant colours. I would highly recommend this to anyone, and already have to friends in real life. Get it!			"

												The story of the couple protagonist and the surrounding is unlike games I've played before. The voice acting really come together with the character.SuperGiant Games I believe is one of the rising developer right now. The ambience, the atmosphere, and the soundtrack! Oh don't get me started. The music is remarkable, I listen to it times a day... It's like Daren Korb really put his/her heart into the making.I liked it better than their 1st game, Bastion.Well, if you like smart isometric strategy games, with well-written story and amazing ambience, I recommend you play it.

												Totally stunning. Every scene in this game is a work of art and I couldn't get enough. I really dig the story and how the world itself isn't explicitly described; you just have to take all the aspects you're given and piece together your own impression of this sci-fi dreamscape. In terms of gameplay, I enjoyed the combat system. I don't often come across a game with multiple interchangable skills that really encourages me to try different combinations. Usually I find my 2 or 3 favourites and stick with them all game, but this system of losing/regaining skills gave me the extra push to experiment, and that was cool! The soundtrack is magnificent, as everyone says (I'm sure it would sound incredible on vinyl *wink nudge*). It's all the little touches that made this really special for me, like finding a peaceful, pretty spot and letting Red hum a tune. It's easy to tell that a lot of love and care went into this, thank you! I'd recommend this to anyone.			"

												Original Review (4 hours in): Picked this up on sale, bought it for a friend because I loved it so much, and would pay full price all over again. Although I'm still completing the game, this is quickly rising on my favorites list. The music is fantastic, the art is gorgeous, and I never realized how much I could care about a fictional sword until Transistor.Adding to original:I'm almost 19 hours in at this point, and still on my second playthrough. Granted, some of these hours come from me being afk and leaving the game running. I know people that have completed the game in less than 5 hours or so, but I just keep taking time to read each bio, complete each achievement, and generally replay the game. My second playthrough is just as good (perhaps better, now that I know the story and can pick up on more subtext) as the first. This is, all in all, a very excellent game. The soundtrack is just as wonderful as the game. Art is wonderful, gameplay is very much dependent on your cycle - my first playthrough, I relied very heavily on a feature called ""Turn"". Turn pauses the game and allows you to plot out each action. On my second, I've been relying much more on live play and slotted skills accordingly. Honestly? Buy this game. You won't regret it. It's worth every penny and every hour you put in. You will have feels. You will be emotionally attached to the sword. You will probably yell profanity at the screen.You will regret nothing.			"

												Transistor is an action RPG where you try to find out the myth about the sword called Transistor.At the same time,you will be chased by enemies,who are trying to take your sword by...killing you.For the gameplay itself,you are tasked by taking out enemies,who in turn give powers for your sword and then you configure it using passive stat slots,active stat and upgrade ones.Its short though,as it takes about 7-8 hours to be completed.And yet...the story is good but short,soundtrack is great,artwork is good,gameplay is good and the combat system...i found it underwhelming and easy.So,my rating on this game is 7/10 because of *easy* combat system,short story and its features aren't perfect.

												Unique art, good music, and interesting story, as expected from the creator of Bastion.Speaking about gameplay, at first I was think like, ""What the hell? Focus mode? This gonna be easy"". Then, a moment later it's balanced by handicap on player. So, OK, focus mode is kinda necessary since Red's skills are generally slow while on the other hand, her enemies are quick.Afterall, Transistor has more value than its price, rated 9/10.			"

												I'm not an expert in genre definition, but I think this is what modern-day cyberpunk is like - less rainy undertown swarming with cyber-implanted punks and more cloud storage wrapped in a sleek casing and filled with the souls of hipsters.It's all about the mood - the humming, the colours, the spotlights, the show posters, the news terminals. The way Red writes comments and sometimes uses them to talk to her lover, who's right next to her, because that's the only way she CAN do it - that's a trifle (just one of many) that plays really well into the whole picture. It's a kind of melodic despair, a sweetly aching melancholy.Get the soundtrack. It's as much part of the story as anything else, Ashley Barrett's voice a flashback to just before the game begins, when Red still had hers.Combat... well, it's there. You can whack 'em in real-time, Diablo-style, or you can plan your moves for maximum tactical efficiency - the game has a built-in 'challenge mode' for all styles. The system where you use skills as upgrades for other skills, or as separate passive skills, is interesting. But again, it's all about the mood and the story here - because every skill is a person, and you learn their story by using the skill in various ways.The game is horribly short, but I get the feeling that it's exactly long enough. Sometimes a short story should be a short story. It shouldn't be sold for the price of a whole book, though.			"

												A beautiful game with an even more beautiful soundtrack. It sums up right about everything this game is.But what about the gameplay? Well, simply great. The game uses some new mecanics that give it a bit more dept. By example,the move turn() which gives you the ability to pause the game and plan your next moves. Transistor also gives you a verry satisfying skill system. It lets you combine every skill in the game. . .Yes! Every single one.So yeah, the gameplay is great. But do we get a good story? The answer is yes.Well, I'm not gonna say to much about the story, because I don't want to spoil anything. But it definitly won't let you down.When you start a series of events have happened. You, ""Red"", seek revenge. While playing the game you slowly find out what all happened before. The whole game gets supported by a ""one of a kind"" naration. The Transistor, your sword, is always holding a one sided converstation with you, Red, who has lost her voice. Making it a unike experience.The only downside I've found is that, however the game introduces some great mecanics, It doesn't realy explane them.Leaving you somewhat in the dark and leaving you somethimes in a situation where you don't know what happens or what you are doing.This however is a minor problem, as you learn verry quickly how everthing works.My final conclusion? Transistor is a must have!			"

												Transistor is a fascinating exercise and succeeds in much of what it sets out to do.Great soundtrack, unique art style, gorgeous animations - these seem to be the common threads between Bastion and this title that work exceptionally well.Transistor's voice actor, Rucks from the first game, doesn't work so well. The muddled storyline also isn't well presented - although I do love the clever Terminal interactions that you come across, as well as the story's overall themes.The combat mechanics, while interesting, don't offer as great a depth as it may first appear. Certain combinations are incredibly deadly while others simply don't work for many situations. The differences between using Turn and not using Turn are extreme - it would have been great to offer the possibility (and achievement!) of doing the whole game without using a single Turn. The best part here was learning the unique mechanics and interactions.It seems almost designed for multiplayer too - in a style as seen in the Agency tests? This is disappointing. Although I can see some of the combos would have to be rebalanced.There is a lot to like here, and I am glad that I waited until it dropped to 50% off, and I can recommended it - but it's a light recommendation. There is no doubt that Supergiant Games have built another incredible world that I am glad to have explored.			"

This game though it can be beaten in a two hour session (I recommend you don't) it's a very immersive game. Play the game slow take your time and enjoy everything it has to offer. If you were wondering it plays like a turn based live action RPG. Supergiant Games has done a great job developing this work of art called Transistor. The only gripe I really have with this game is it's length but other then that the combat is intuitive the enviroments are psychedelic and the relationship that Red and the Transistor develop is lovely. Buy this game right away it's totally worth the price(sidenote: This game is one of the only games to bring me to tears.)			"

												If you appreciate elegant story telling, excellent voice acting, challenging and unique combat, incredible music, and downright breathtakingly beautiful art then you will enjoy this game. I first purchased this gem a few years ago during a sale only to try it out and discard it, what a huge mistake. After picking Transistor up again and giving it the attention it truly deserves I was blown away. It had me hooked instantly and before I knew it six hours had flown by. Everything about this game is polished to a shine from the unique story telling to the stunning art. Albeit short by most standards every minute of this game is filled to the brim with beautiful art, a captivating narrative, and fun semi-turn based combat. This game also has a sort of new game + I did not try it out but I assume it adds a fair amount of replayability if you're into that sort of thing. I would recommend playing this game at night with the lights off to fully enjoy the art this game has to offer.Overall pretty good game would recommend, ez value.			"

												Oh man.After having played through Bastion, my expectations for this game were high.I was not disappointed.Everything was solid, the combat was a really fun variant of a turn-based system, it's fairly easy to play through (only 4 hours). The balancing is done very well, since enemies get more abilities and strength at the same rate as you do, keeping combat fairly fresh rather than a tiring grind. The game can be quickly made unforgivably hard with ingame options for those who like a challenge.The artstyle is also very beautiful, but to me the highlight of this game is the soundtrack, like just about every other reviewer has said. The story is a bit hard to get into, but if you pay some attention to the information you hear and read, you'll understand, although I wish there was more lore to be found.I bought this for somewhere around 10€, and it was worth every cent of it. I wouldn't mind paying the full price for it.There really isn't any more to say other than ""Get it, you won't regret it""			"

The combination of a gorgeous sound track and  breathtaking artwork from Jen Zee ( http://jenzee.deviantart.com/ ) make for an awesome experince on it's own! But to top it off the story line is equally as great. It leaves you craving more and wishing it never ended. The gameplay is remarkebly well thought out and pulled off incredibly well. How you play the game is unique to you as there are endless possiblities for combination of skills and abilities! If you don't have this game, buy it ASAP, for the 20USD you spend it is 110% worth it. 10/10 would play again  "

												Transistor is made by the same people who made Bastion and you can really tell. This isn’t an insult, just a statement of fact. There are a lot of mechanical similarities between the two games, as well as some style elements. I loved both games, but I think Transistor is the better game. I like the style better and it seems to have more polish as well. That said, the fifth performance test is pure crap. I got to the 9th wave of 11 and played for more than an hour and I was at 100% health and not a single bad guy was injured, because they could go stealth and heal to 100%.			"

												Transistor is a fun and exciting game that not only puts you in the heat of battle but allows you to strategically plan out your approach. With dozens of different combinations of skills and subskills, there is always a new way to enjoy the game, from quick and slippery to powerful and awesome. Would recommend for anyone looking for a game to get absorbed in the storyline and music (one of the best parts of the game IMO) or to just go in and have fun.			"

												I had really high expectations for this game when it came out and even though it wasn't quite what I imagined, I still enjoyed it. The main problem with it is the story because it is told very, very vaguely and you really have to work hard to figure out exactly what is going on. It kinda bothers me because, to me, the story is usually important because it contextualizes your actions within the game. As a result, for those trying to figure out what's going on, part of the experience is lost. However, the combat really makes up for it and the music just sounds fantastic. So, I can safely recommend this game based solely on these two things because that's what I enjoyed the most about it.			"

												Loved this game. Main selling point for me was the art stlye and soundtrack, which really help make the atmosphere amazing. Gameplay was fun, and like Bastion you can easily make it way more difficult if you want. If you thought one set of moves was making it too easy, you could easily completely change your play style with a different set of attacks which makes you think of it in a different way.The story was a lot shorter then I expected though. which left me thinking that more could have been done with it.Final note, steam music lets me listen to the soundtrack all the time now since I am too lazy to load it on itunes.

												The story and atmosphere in this game are a cut above most other games on the market. The combat is well thought out and allows for solid tactical decision making.  If you enjoied Bastion, then this game will scratch most of the same itch, though I don't think the Transistor is quite as good a narrator as Rukus from Bastion.  The soundtrack is also quite well done, though again, I think Bastion's high points might have been a little higher.			"

												Let me begin by saying Transistor had big shoes to fill after the indie gaming victory that was Bastion. Transistor's story is delivered in a fashion only slightly removed from Supergiant's trademark narrated style, and whilst not executed badly it does lack that breath of fresh air that Bastion delivered. The characters have their story fleshed out with unlockable text snippets, detailing their lives and events leading up to the start of your playthrough. The odd fallout from this is it almost seems the plot and intrigue has all already unfolded retrospetively; which, when coupled with mining oodles of text and only tenuous explanation of major plot progression, makes for reduced immersion and ephemeral characters.That said, you're probably dusting off your hands and thinking ""well I guess that's a no to Transistor!"". Actually Transistor brings a lot to the table regardless of its weaknesses, like many a classic game. The precise combat mechanics and endlessly customisable skill sets are what makes the title worthy of your valuable gamer hours. The difficulty ramps up at a steady pace, thanks to enemies that scale with your levels, wielding a variety of unique threats. One minute you're master of your art, the next a new contender appears and makes you rethink your style. The replay option keeping all your skill progress is a fantastic feature on top, do try this title if you liked Bastion.			"

There was just so much to do and so many tactics to try. This game really makes you think while you enjoy the world they created along with its beautiful sounds. I hope super giant makes a new game soon because I'm dying for more. I'm a bit sad that its over honestly. Fantastic game that I highly reccomed at 3.99.			"

												Transistor is the second game from Bastion developer Super Giant Games, and it is another exceptionally crafted artistic RPG.In Transistor you play the role of Red, a beautiful and talented musician who has seemingly lost her voice.  The game begins with Red pulling a sword like device known as the Transistor out of the chest of a dead man.  Immediately the Transistor begins talking to Red as if it knows her.  The voice of the Transistor is how we learn what's going on in this abandoned ghost town of a city called Cloudbank.   Much like the narrator in Bastion comments on the situation of Caelondia, the Transistor will talk to Red about things happening in Cloudbank.  It seems Super Giant Games really has a thing for mysterious apocalyptic events that wipe out flourishing cities.  Not only is the Transistor your talking guide through the game it's also a very powerful tool and weapon.   In the beginning the Transistor only has two functions loaded into it, thus giving you two different attack options.  As you level up you'll unlock   more functions, function upgrade slots, and passive function slots.  The function customization and use is incredibly deep and fun to experiment with as you explore combinations to fit your play style.  It really makes the combat an enjoyable sandbox of trial by fire.Every function in the game has 3 optional ways of using it in the Transistor.  The first use is an Active attack and used to directly afflict damage or other debuffs on the enemies.   The second use is an upgrade slot to an existing Active attack.  This will add extra abilities to your attacks.   The final use is a passive slot which will grant you various buffs or abilities that are always active.  With 16 different functions to unlock, and each having 3 ways to potentially use them, you can see the amount of customization gets exponential.  And even more in new game plus when it allows you to unlock another copy of an already used function.Using the functions in the variety of ways will also reward the story loving fanatics.  Each function you discover is linked to one pronounced citizen of Cloudbank, and as you use the functions in combat you'll unlock background information regarding their history.  It's a fun way to learn more about the story and reward players for trying new combinations of function loadouts.While the story of Transistor may seem eerily similar to Bastion the combat game play is quite different.  Arguably Transistor can be played in the same real time hack-n-slash style of Bastion, but in all likelihood you'll be using the strategic pause mode for most battles.  This mode feels like a turn based strategy game.   When combat is paused you are shown a progress bar of action points to spend.  Every movement, every function will use up action points until the bar is full.   This allows you to plan out your attack before committing to the plan.  Once you execute a plan you'll see all your attacks played out in real time.  You'll then need to fight in real time as you wait for the cool down timer on strategic mode.  It really is a good balance of real time and turn based combat.The thing I loved most about Bastion was it's story, soundtrack and art direction, and once again with Transistor they delivered.   A hauntingly desolate city again brought to life by beautiful landscapes and enchanting music you'll be humming along the way with Red.While it may be relatively short it has replay value in new game plus, just to try more function combos.  If you enjoyed Bastion then you'll find Transistor worthy of a play.			"

												Awesome visuals and sound track, and the main gameplay gimmick is really cool too. Unfortunately, the game isn't very challenging, and it doesn't push the abilities of the Transistor unless you're playing on NG+ with all the limiters on. The story is another weird part; the story isn't bad, but the way it's told is completely♥♥♥♥♥backwards. It's meant to be vague and up for interpretation, but it goes too far.All in all, good stuff. Not as good as Supergiant's last game, Bastion, but great nonetheless.			"

												If you're familiar with their other game, Bastion, then you have a good idea of what to expect.The game begins with the female main character, Red, pulling the sword named Transistor out of someone who has just been killed.  The rest of the game is essentially her seeking answers and battling with the fallout of that individual's death in this really unique and original world they've created. The game is extremely polished.  Like Bastion, they pair the visuals, music, and narration perfectly.  The game is absolutely dripping with style and attention to detail.  The combat system is really solid (and pretty challenging) as well.  You have four main abilities, or functions, that can be active at one time.  Each function you gain in the game contains the essence of a fallen individual of the city, whose lore you can read about once you possess it.  Each function has a main, secondary, and passive property.  Each one also requires a certain amount of memory, so which abilities you can run at the same time will depend on how much you have invested in increasing your max memory capacity.  The combat can be performed in real time or you can execute the turn() function and plan your moves ahead like a turn based game.  It's highly customizeable, albeit a little overwhelming at first (there is no tutorial but you do run have occasional access to a practice zone throughout).  I completed the playthrough without unlocking all of the passives or secondaries.  I guess that is supposed to draw you towards playing it again. My complaint is that the game is so compact.  It took me about 5 hours to complete.  I guess I played with minimum limiters (kind of like talents you pick to make certain aspects of the game more difficult in return for bonus xp), but if you need to have a multitude of these limiters to stretch out the experience of the game, then maybe somethings wrong.  Additionally, there are only a handful of enemy types (they get progressively more difficult as you advance in the game).  This leads to the combat getting a little repetitive in some combat filled areas.The game is very unique and well made, and I would absolutely recommend it.  However the $20 price-tag seems to have been made with the notion that the buyer would do multiple playthroughs.  I'd pick it up on sale instead.			"

												Okay, where do I begin...Overall, yes, I would recommend it, just because Supergiant made a unique experience with a definitive art style.That being said, the game to me is very flawed, especially when you compare it to its spiritual predecessor, Bastion:1) This game is incredibly short. You can beat it in 3 hours, if not less. There is a time and place for games as short as this (Journey, where replays are encouraged). 2) You spend half the game going through a few maps, get to a certain area, and lo and behold your final destination was JUST PAST where you started the game in the opposite direction. You spend the second half retracing your steps through a disfigured Cloudbank 3) Combat and customization are very limited. Combining your abilities in new, unique ways was actually rather satisfying, especially when you discover a new combination to trounce enemies ahead of you. Other than that, there is almost no character progression other than increasing your RAM (literally) and junctioning moves together.4) There were two voices (if you don't count Red's occasional humming), and I didn't feel an emotional connection to either of them because of how they were voiced. It was as if they took a page out of William Shatner's book of acting on pausing mid-sentence, coupled with very monotonous expressions. 5) Biggest complaint about the story though has to be how disconnected I was to all of it. I will say that the ending was well done, though. I can see the rationale behind it. 6) There was almost no tutorial to speak of. I had to figure out almost everything by myself. Any tutorial that was there was hidden behind technical lingo resembling computer code, which I suppose fits the game's style.6/10. Support your indie devs!			"

After picking Transistor up again and giving it the attention it truly deserves I was blown away. It had me hooked instantly and before I knew it six hours had flown by. Everything about this game is polished to a shine from the unique story telling to the stunning art. Albeit short by most standards every minute of this game is filled to the brim with beautiful art, a captivating narrative, and fun semi-turn based combat. This game also has a sort of new game + I did not try it out but I assume it adds a fair amount of replayability if you're into that sort of thing.

												Really enjoyed the game. It has a beautiful art-style and the soundtrack is just what you'd expect from SuperGiant. It has a nice combat system, but that is the main mechanic, so if you do not enjoy the real-time/turn-based fighting system this game might not be for you.It's also pretty short, so if you're looking for a really long game, unless you're willing to do multiple NG+ you might want to look elsewhere.

However, Supergiant Games have done a fantastic job weaving naritive directly into gameplay, they have crafted a beautiful world, and they made a game with one of the most uniqe and engaging combat styles I have seen. If you enjoy isometric RPGs, or naritive driven games, give Transistor a try.			"

												To Those expecting this to be just a not-so-good version of Bastion? It's compareable. I wont call it betterm, because Bastion is a gameing masterpiece, but this comes very, very close. This game took several upgraes from where Bastion came from. It has more voice acting, enhanced combat system, and it's more open with it's lore. (Sort of)And to fans of Ashley Barret, the girl who sang Build that Wall? She has 6 vocal songs in this game. So another awesome plus.(None of them sung by Korb. Boooooo)This game is alot harder then Bastion, but sacrifices the casual attitude for a confuseing, but well thought out, plot, insane character details, and many many more.If you played Bastion, get this. You have that feeling that this just 'wont be the same' ? Well it will be I promise you. If you decide to get it, Enjoy! It's worth the money. Also, Pyre. THat's comeing out. Make sure to play this before it's release, so you could be there to play all of Supergiant's games in order of release.			"

												Transistor is probably best described as a ""tactical hack & slash."" That odd combo of descriptors speaks to a set of game mechanics that is unique and, at times, complex. The ""trials"" they present you are especially challenging puzzles, as are boss fights. The game offers a wide array of stylistic capabilities, as well as ""limiters"" - options which you can turn on to enhance the difficulty (and your reward). The story is really nothing to speak of - the flimsiest outline of a plot, loosely carried along by vague, non-specific lines of dialogue uttered by cardboard characters with cool portraits but little personality. Don't get this expecting to find an engaging narrative - the gameplay is the real strength here.I paid this game the ultimate compliment and actually beat it. The game is satisfying, albeit frustrating at times - the ""challenge puzzles"" usually have a trick to figure out. Until you do it can feel like you're beating your head against a brick wall - sometimes unsure whether it's your tactics or your ability to execute that's at fault. That being said, the game is well worth it, especially if you enjoyed Bastion - and, frankly, I would recommend Bastion to anyone who's never played a SuperGiant game before I'd send them to Transistor.

												First, the obvious: there are few games as beautiful as Transitor. I don't think I need to go into detail, since you can clearly see that on the store page. Transistor is also a very fun game. It's active/modifier/passive system for abilities is extremely unique and engaging. At times it feels like you can use this to exploit the game, and so sometimes Transitor feels a bit too easy. I would suggest playing the game without retrying stages, at least after you have enough abilities to fall back on. If you do this, the game's difficulty is well calibrated: you amost always succeed, but it's often a very close call. Now, as for the plot: it's thinner than you might guess. I was surprised to find that I was often rushed from one battle to the next without too much of an intermission. Luckily, the combat is fun enough that this wasn't really a fualt. Transistor is a piece of art, and like so much great art, Transistor's meaning is vague, even at he end. The story is not confusing or empty, certainly: the game gives you content to mentally fidget with, and time to do so, but it never outright tells (or shows) you exactly what's going on. Transistor rewards players for expirimenting with their loadouts by granting little chunks of lore, which I felt was a nice bridge between the gameplay and the world-building parts of the experience. In every aspect Transistor is enjoyable, but those expecting an existential masterpiece may be disappointed.I should, however, note that TRANSISTOR HAS PERFORMANCE ISSUES. On some settups, Steam runs the 32bit version of the game, and the results are predictable. I am not the only one to have this issue, but apparently I am the first one to send Supergiant Games a letter about it. Their response, which resolved the issue for me, was this:Please try locating your save file which should be here:\Program Files\Steam\userdata\[USERID]\237930\remote\here:\Program Files\Steam\userdata\[USERID]\237930\local\or here:\Documents and Settings\User\Saved Games\Transistor\depending on whether you are running the game outside of Steam or if you are using cloud saves.The file is named Profile1.sav assuming you have not changed your profile.If one of those locations has a save with a recent timestamp, try copying it to the other locations!Hope that helps!

												This game is unique.The art, music, story and voice acting are all fantastic, and a lot of people talk about it a lot, so I'm going to go straight to the gameplay, because to me, that's what really makes this game stand out.The gameplay in transistor is an interesting and deep blend of strategy, tactics, and action RPG. It looks like an action RPG - one character, running around the game world in real time, trying to pull off attack combos. And you can play it like that, if you get good at the controls. But you can also stop time and program perfectly timed combos to occur.That alone sets this game apart. The balance between those two completely different mechanics - using your moves in real time, and planning out moves in a safe, stopped, environment - straddles two completely different genres, and thus two completely different play styles. Besides the real time action RPG style of gameplay, you can more or less impose a turn based style of game play - the mechanic for stopping time is even called /turn. On your /turn, you try to deal as much damage as possible to your opponents by planning out the right moves in the right order so that they don't get blocked or cancelled. Then, you can just run around the board, dodging attacks until the meter reloads and you can take your /turn again.Obviously, most of the time, you find yourself doing a bit of both. You figure out good move combinations to use in /turn, and then while turn is loading, you try to use those same combos in real time to deal more damage. Sometimes, you find yourself using Turn primarily to dodge or reposition yourself, and doing all your real damage in real time. You find the middle ground that best suits you.But the real complexity and beauty comes in the wealth of moves available. You end up learning a bunch of different moves, and the moves can be adapted to three forms - they can be moves, they can modify other moves, or they can modify your player character. You like explosions, but the explosion move is too slow for your playstyle? Slap it onto one of your faster attacks to give it an extra punch. Or, slap your fastest attack on it, to remove its drawbacks. The combinations and complexity available is staggering, and it makes the game more personal and more fun. When you discover a great synnergy between two moves, that was your discovery, and you can feel proud of it.All of this makes the death mechanic in the game hit even harder. You have a health bar in this game, but when it gets to zero, you lose one of your moves - usually the one that's been most modified, so probably your best move. If you built your playstyle around one synnergy, you effectively have one life. If you have a lot of moves, you live longer, but each hit still really hurts, as it takes away one of your tools, and probably one you designed a little yourself and are proud of. This makes the 'death' of your moves matter to you, and makes the tension of the game more real.Since you can only reinstall moves at a save point, and your ''dead' moves will be unavailable for the next new save point you find, this also changes how you use your save points. In an insane reversal of usual game logic, you might choose not to use the save point that's right in front of a hard battle or a boss, so that you can go to it after the battle, restock, and get back your main moves more quickly. All of this is to say, there isn't another game fully like Transistor. It has elements from several different genres, and playstyles or strategies that you have from those other games might apply to it. But as a whole, this game is a unique experience, and one that is unque all the way down its considerable depths.It's also a very fun, immersive, and beautiful experience, and it can be extremely challenging if that's what you want, but also extremely casual if that's not.

												Buyers guide to Transistor (as unbiased as possible).What you'll get from buying this game:-Story:An elaborated story that places the focus on the protagonist (and her talking ironing board/weapon/partner). The fully voiced narration is a mix of on-the-spot quips and exposition. Additionally to the narration you'll get text documents from the weapons menu and in-game billboards. You'll understand the setting and story as you progress through the game (warning: the text documents are in advanced English, which might be difficult for non-native English speakers).-Gameplay (action/puzzles):   -Action: In this action/rpg you'll be progressing through several locations in which you'll have several encounters with a group of enemies. There's no running away from or avoiding encounters. As you progress though the game you'll aquire several moves (called functions) which can be used as an active move, a booster to an active move or/and as a status booster. This system encourages you to experiment with all the moves to see which playstyle suits you best. During an encounter you can choose to fight directly (click-to-attack) or in a sequence of pre-planned moves (called a Turn). After a Turn, your weapon needs some time to recharge, during which you can't perform any moves (just run around to avoid damage). It's possible your Turn won't have the desired effect because the enemies are moving, are protected or because your aim was wrong. It's possible to artificially make encounters harder by activating boosters for enemies (called limiters). Activating limiters yields more EXP.  - Puzzles: the main campaign barely contains any puzzles. Yet similar to Supergiant Games Bastion there are locations which have nothing to do with the main campaign (called Backdoors) in which you'll find challenges. Some of these challenges are puzzles.-Graphics:The lay-out is hand drawn, the menus are all neon-like and there are many filters to add to the atmosphere of this game. Animation is fluid if your computer is strong enough.-Soundtrack:As far as I can place music in a genre, I would say it's a mix of Jazz and Alternative music. Some tracks are sung by Ash Barett, who also performed in the game Bastion. Most of time during the campaign, you can make your protagonist hum to the soundtrack with the voice of Ash Barett.-Unlockables (in-game/ additional to game):  -In-game: (See chapter Gameplay/action). While experimenting with your moves, you'll unlock the text documents which explain the setting of the story. As you progress through the game, the Backdoors will give you more challenges to complete. By completing these challenges, you'll unlock soundtracks which can be only heard in these Backdoors.  - Additional: After completing the game you'll unlock New-Game Plus (called Recursion). In Recursion, you keep your moves you previously have unlocked and the enemies are harder.-Tips for purchasing  - Check out other reviews (I personally always follow Zero Punctuation's Yahtzee's reviews because he points out the bad things in a game. Link to his review of Transistor :

Steam might bundle those games together with the soundtrack which can save you some money.  - Wait until SuperGiant Games Pyres release for the same reasons stated above.-Personal opinion (for what it's worth):I liked this game in general for it's atmosphere, gameplay, story, setting, soundtrack, in-game unlockables and encouragement of experimentation.Yet I disliked the imbalance of puzzles and action, its hard English (I'm not a native English-speaker) and the limited additional-to-game unlockables.

It's so good that I have to buy the dlc for the whole album!!! 9/10 for overall performance! Not giving 10/10 because the story is too short in my opinion :( I wish there would be more			"

												Transistor is a fantastic game, the levels are designed beautifully and the storytelling is awesome. You follow the story of a singer called Red in a futuristic city. She is using Transistor - a powerful weapon - to fight the Process and the Camerata who are chasing her to obtain the Transistor for themselfs... All in all it's a great and moving story.The fight system may be unusual at first, but as you find more and more functions you can create much powerful combos. Like in Supergiant's previous game, Bastion, you can turn on different limiters which increase the power of the Process thus making the game harder. Altough I think the Bastion was more challenging. I also recommend the Recursion() mode (basically a second playthrough) where you can create combos using function recursion.The soundtrack is also awesome, it results in a gloomy athmosphere.10/10""Hey Red.

												Transistor is probably one of my favourite games of all time, for a variety of reasons, which includes things such as masterfully crafted artwork and aesthetics, an amazing soundtrack by Darren Korb, and an incredible world-setting, characters and lore. This is, of course, a non-exhaustive list, and it has a surprising amount of replayability value for both the completionist and the non-completionist.Just like Bastion, it's a story-rich game that leaves a lot of the world to the player's interpretation and imagination, with only one constant voice to accompany you through the game: the Transistor's. The optional rooms found within the Backdoors are challenging but non-intensive and fun, and there's a certain charm in exploring all of the areas to find all of the interactive objects to hear the Transistor/narrator expound upon the world.The cons of this game would include things such as the combat system, which can be difficult to get used to at first (or be frustrating if you decide to use limiters), and the lack of obvious direction in-game (as you might end up progressing before you mean to), though these would only be a problem if you're a completionist. Luckily enough, you can go through this games as many times as you want in the NG+ mode, which basically eliminates these issues.It's definitely worth the full price, but grabbing this game during a sale only makes the entire experience better. ; )			"

												So I have a rough time figuring out how I feel about this game.But let me try.The combat, the music, the environment were all beautiful. The character design was striking and really I can't say how much I enjoy playing the game for what it is. I enjoy the narration to, which comes from your sword, though sometimes his commentary is pretty empty or generic. I feel a lot more could have been done there.My problem here is the story and the characters. A lot of this game is ambigious and parts of it are meant to be. However too much of it is. We don't know a lot of the things our characters would, concepts and ideas are brought up but we never get a decent explanation. I feel like knowing what the 'country' is would be nice. I mean it could be implied to be death, or it could be people logging out of the virtual world...which is confusing.Some text in game makes it sound like many people are dying, yet other commentary makes it seem like people might have just left. Afterall it seems the world is virtual...to some extent. It makes you wonder about how it all works. Yet this is never really explored. I get wanting things to be mysterious, but in thise case it feels like it would just be basic information. Maybe it's not too important though....Afterall this is a love story in the end, but I think things could have been done to make the player feel more satisified with the ending and more invested in the characters. While the story isn't terrible by any means, it feels like we could have seen a lot more interesting interactions, explored what this utopia was really like and made it all feel more meaningful. To me though...the game was fun, I did like the style and while the characters weren't all that fleshed out I did want to know about them and I did end up caring about what happened to the two main characters.

												Transistor is probably best described as a ""tactical hack & slash."" That odd combo of descriptors speaks to a set of game mechanics that is unique and, at times, complex. The ""trials"" they present you are especially challenging puzzles, as are boss fights. The game offers a wide array of stylistic capabilities, as well as ""limiters"" - options which you can turn on to enhance the difficulty (and your reward). The story is really nothing to speak of - the flimsiest outline of a plot, loosely carried along by vague, non-specific lines of dialogue uttered by cardboard characters with cool portraits but little personality. Don't get this expecting to find an engaging narrative - the gameplay is the real strength here.I paid this game the ultimate compliment and actually beat it. The game is satisfying, albeit frustrating at times - the ""challenge puzzles"" usually have a trick to figure out. Until you do it can feel like you're beating your head against a brick wall - sometimes unsure whether it's your tactics or your ability to execute that's at fault. That being said, the game is well worth it, especially if you enjoyed Bastion - and, frankly, I would recommend Bastion to anyone who's never played a SuperGiant game before I'd send them to Transistor.

												First, the obvious: there are few games as beautiful as Transitor. I don't think I need to go into detail, since you can clearly see that on the store page. Transistor is also a very fun game. It's active/modifier/passive system for abilities is extremely unique and engaging. At times it feels like you can use this to exploit the game, and so sometimes Transitor feels a bit too easy. I would suggest playing the game without retrying stages, at least after you have enough abilities to fall back on. If you do this, the game's difficulty is well calibrated: you amost always succeed, but it's often a very close call. Now, as for the plot: it's thinner than you might guess. I was surprised to find that I was often rushed from one battle to the next without too much of an intermission. Luckily, the combat is fun enough that this wasn't really a fualt. Transistor is a piece of art, and like so much great art, Transistor's meaning is vague, even at he end. The story is not confusing or empty, certainly: the game gives you content to mentally fidget with, and time to do so, but it never outright tells (or shows) you exactly what's going on. Transistor rewards players for expirimenting with their loadouts by granting little chunks of lore, which I felt was a nice bridge between the gameplay and the world-building parts of the experience. In every aspect Transistor is enjoyable, but those expecting an existential masterpiece may be disappointed.I should, however, note that TRANSISTOR HAS PERFORMANCE ISSUES. On some settups, Steam runs the 32bit version of the game, and the results are predictable. I am not the only one to have this issue, but apparently I am the first one to send Supergiant Games a letter about it. Their response, which resolved the issue for me, was this:Please try locating your save file which should be here:\Program Files\Steam\userdata\[USERID]\237930\remote\here:\Program Files\Steam\userdata\[USERID]\237930\local\or here:\Documents and Settings\User\Saved Games\Transistor\depending on whether you are running the game outside of Steam or if you are using cloud saves.The file is named Profile1.sav assuming you have not changed your profile.If one of those locations has a save with a recent timestamp, try copying it to the other locations!Hope that helps!

												This game is unique.The art, music, story and voice acting are all fantastic, and a lot of people talk about it a lot, so I'm going to go straight to the gameplay, because to me, that's what really makes this game stand out.The gameplay in transistor is an interesting and deep blend of strategy, tactics, and action RPG. It looks like an action RPG - one character, running around the game world in real time, trying to pull off attack combos. And you can play it like that, if you get good at the controls. But you can also stop time and program perfectly timed combos to occur.That alone sets this game apart. The balance between those two completely different mechanics - using your moves in real time, and planning out moves in a safe, stopped, environment - straddles two completely different genres, and thus two completely different play styles. Besides the real time action RPG style of gameplay, you can more or less impose a turn based style of game play - the mechanic for stopping time is even called /turn. On your /turn, you try to deal as much damage as possible to your opponents by planning out the right moves in the right order so that they don't get blocked or cancelled. Then, you can just run around the board, dodging attacks until the meter reloads and you can take your /turn again.Obviously, most of the time, you find yourself doing a bit of both. You figure out good move combinations to use in /turn, and then while turn is loading, you try to use those same combos in real time to deal more damage. Sometimes, you find yourself using Turn primarily to dodge or reposition yourself, and doing all your real damage in real time. You find the middle ground that best suits you.But the real complexity and beauty comes in the wealth of moves available. You end up learning a bunch of different moves, and the moves can be adapted to three forms - they can be moves, they can modify other moves, or they can modify your player character. You like explosions, but the explosion move is too slow for your playstyle? Slap it onto one of your faster attacks to give it an extra punch. Or, slap your fastest attack on it, to remove its drawbacks. The combinations and complexity available is staggering, and it makes the game more personal and more fun. When you discover a great synnergy between two moves, that was your discovery, and you can feel proud of it.All of this makes the death mechanic in the game hit even harder. You have a health bar in this game, but when it gets to zero, you lose one of your moves - usually the one that's been most modified, so probably your best move. If you built your playstyle around one synnergy, you effectively have one life. If you have a lot of moves, you live longer, but each hit still really hurts, as it takes away one of your tools, and probably one you designed a little yourself and are proud of. This makes the 'death' of your moves matter to you, and makes the tension of the game more real.Since you can only reinstall moves at a save point, and your ''dead' moves will be unavailable for the next new save point you find, this also changes how you use your save points. In an insane reversal of usual game logic, you might choose not to use the save point that's right in front of a hard battle or a boss, so that you can go to it after the battle, restock, and get back your main moves more quickly. All of this is to say, there isn't another game fully like Transistor. It has elements from several different genres, and playstyles or strategies that you have from those other games might apply to it. But as a whole, this game is a unique experience, and one that is unque all the way down its considerable depths.It's also a very fun, immersive, and beautiful experience, and it can be extremely challenging if that's what you want, but also extremely casual if that's not.

												Okay, where do I begin...Overall, yes, I would recommend it, just because Supergiant made a unique experience with a definitive art style.That being said, the game to me is very flawed, especially when you compare it to its spiritual predecessor, Bastion:1) This game is incredibly short. You can beat it in 3 hours, if not less. There is a time and place for games as short as this (Journey, where replays are encouraged). 2) You spend half the game going through a few maps, get to a certain area, and lo and behold your final destination was JUST PAST where you started the game in the opposite direction. You spend the second half retracing your steps through a disfigured Cloudbank 3) Combat and customization are very limited. Combining your abilities in new, unique ways was actually rather satisfying, especially when you discover a new combination to trounce enemies ahead of you. Other than that, there is almost no character progression other than increasing your RAM (literally) and junctioning moves together.4) There were two voices (if you don't count Red's occasional humming), and I didn't feel an emotional connection to either of them because of how they were voiced. It was as if they took a page out of William Shatner's book of acting on pausing mid-sentence, coupled with very monotonous expressions. 5) Biggest complaint about the story though has to be how disconnected I was to all of it. I will say that the ending was well done, though. I can see the rationale behind it. 6) There was almost no tutorial to speak of. I had to figure out almost everything by myself. Any tutorial that was there was hidden behind technical lingo resembling computer code, which I suppose fits the game's style.6/10. Support your indie devs!			"

There quite a bit to love about this game, from the beautiful artwork and soundtrack, to the customizable skills and unique battling system, which really require you to think in order to defeat your enemies. The story was intriguing and really required you to dig deep into the game to figure out all of its secrets. Transistor only offers about 10 hours of gameplay, but there is a ""recursion"" option (sort of a ng+) to delve into after finishing the main story. "

												Shocked this didn't get 95+. 83 is an insult. Seriously. Probably the most freedom I've ever had in a game. The combat system is like nothing else. You can play it so many different ways, it boggles the mind. Also one of the most gorgeous games I've ever played.			"

												Holy sh*t this game was incredible.- Absolutely enthralling storyline unlike any I have experienced before- Beautiful artwork and animations- Novel gameplay that is challenging at times but never too difficult- Great sound effects/soundtrack- 10/10- I was literally crying in my room alone during the ending sequences of the game because that's how emotionally powerful the game was.My only problem was that I couldn't get it to run fullscreen on my 2880x1620 display, but it didn't matter. The gameplay was so immersive that I didn't even realize it wasn't fullscreen			"

												Just, how a game can be this wondereful, meaningful and heart-breaking? This game, literally changed my life. It means a lot to me. And I know, it will also mean a lot to you too. Speaking honest, this is the most wonderful game in my whole life. Give it a shot, you won't regret it a single bit. Plus, this was the first (yes, first) and only time I cried after a game's ending. It will always have a special part in my heart.			"

												Transistor is one of the most beautiful and engaging games I've ever played. The art is breathtaking and it has a soundtrack to match. Its combat is very unique and leaves you with a very satisfied feeling when you pull of more and more complex combos. It's a game that rewards you for testing around with different combinations, leaving for a lot of replay value. Please play it!			"

												The game is quite short. Short, on its own, is fine, even for $20 when done well - but this is to the point where once you feel like things are getting going and you get the hang of it all, it's over. I guess you can do a new game +, but that was not well signalled when I bought the game (if that was even a thing shortly after launch... Hard to say since I first played it just over 2 years ago.)The battle mechanics are interesting and deep, without being overwhelming upfront. They take a lot of getting used to -- though fortunately, only a few things are introduced at a time -- and you always feel super limited in what you can equip (especially early on), but once you've got the good stuff, it gets fun. The sword/narrator is sort of entertaining at times (especially when he's ""drunk""), but this game tries a little too hard to be Bastion 2 and sort of falls on its face because of it.The music is completely unmemorable even though it's done by the same composer as the highly memorable Bastion music.It's a good game, but I'd definitely recommend waiting for it to go on sale to buy it because it's definitely not the kind of game that makes you go WOW.7/10			"

												A beautiful and very sad game with a soundtrack to match. I liked the system, it is an action RPG except that you can pause and program your moves every so often. A lot of the game mechanics are actually explained in-setting, whch I always like in a game. It made me laugh because Xenobalde Chronicles does that and the visual appearance of the sword reminded me a lot of the Monado. I love the main character to bits, especially when she sings along to the backgroud music. The gaming world needs more angel-voiced redhead female main characters with Monados. The cyberpunk setting was very atmospheric and I liked finding bits and pieces of the story by searching the areas properly and using all available skills. The backdoor areas were my favourite parts of the game as those are where both my sound test option and my pet dog/computer virus/thing lives. The game is fairly short but doesn't feel like it needed to be longer, it just isn't a particularly long story. A higher difficulty option would be nice for others - I didn't overload all modules in a single battle throughout the whole game, and while I don't particularly like frustrating games, it might be a little too easy for others. I couldn't get through all the trials in the backdoor area though.			"

												Transistor is a great, short game that combines a unique combat mechanic, very cool art design and music, and a thought-provoking, emotionally-involving story that manages to Show Don't Tell despite the fact that you're tailed through the entire game by a narrator.The narrator, incidentally, talks pretty much non-stop through the entire experience, but manages to do so without being annoying, which may be Transistor's most remarkable accomplishment.

												Supergiant is steadily becoming one of my favorite developers.  Bastion was amazing enough, but Transistor went even further with the strength of its art, music, sentimental narrative (Cunningham's voice is become quite iconic in its own right!), and more than anything, its mechanics with the customizable ability system, setting it apart from Bastion entirely.  Both of their games make me realize why I now prefer smaller companies in gaming: a smaller number of dedicated people making a smaller game seems much more likely to never lose sight of their creative focus, and the end product is often a more memorable and rewarding experience than an big budget pile of trendy mediocrity where things either drag on to the point of tedium, or abruptly end in unfulfilled disappointment.My only regret is that I can't SPECIFICALLY explain why I love Transistor so much without spoiling what makes it so memorable, so I'm stuck with being vague.  All I can say is that I was extremely happy to play this game, despite...well, if anyone's finished the game, they know.  After the emotional reaction I got from Bastion, I would expect no less from Transistor.  They delivered exactly what I was hoping for, and let's just say there's a very good reason why I refused to buy this game without the soundtrack bundled in.  I only wish I could get an artbook to go with it.I really wish I didn't have to be so cryptic, but this is one of those games that you just do not spoil.  It's just so refreshing to see a game like this.			"

												Transistor is a fantastic game: great music, great visuals, great gameplay, and an interesting story.This one hit all the sweet spots, in my opinion. Good length, too - each play through (and it's very much worth recursing/game+'ing the game once) takes about 10 hours.Now, if you're looking for another Bastion, then you may be disappointed. Most of Transistor's combat takes place in a  turn-based mode, where you plan out your movement/attacks, then execute your plan and watch it play out. You can fight in real time (and some of the challenge trials are actually easier this way), but for the most part you'll end up taking too much damage and/or getting knocked out of your attacks to make it a very useful way to play.Difficulty is great, in that it scales wonderfully. By default, you'll have a fairly easy time killing the Process. However, there are 10 limiters that you can choose, which will make the Process stronger, in exchange for faster leveling up. I can honestly tell you that running with all 10 limiters will make for a very harrowing experience.Again, as I mentioned, you should totally play at least twice - first time around gives a good experience, but the second time around - when both you and the Process are leveled up, and you can start stacking functions for extra-brokeness and fun, is what really makes the game.Final word - this is the only game that I've gone out of my way to get 100% of the achievements.

												Transistor is developed from the people who did Bastion back in 2011. In my opinion, Transistor is one of the best indie game released in 2014.In Transistor you play as a singer named Red that wield a talking sword, the game is set in a scfi style future. The game start off without giving a clue on what really happen around the place other than something really bad happened which is similar to Bastion. As you progess through the game, the story will start piece together quite nicely and conversation between Red and the sword are done through text in kiosk machines. The story narrate by the sword, it warns you about hazards around you sometimes. The soundtracks of the game are beautifully made which I find it better than their previous game. The music suits the situation and it transition smoothly as the surrounding changes. As for the gameplay part, the combat allows you to pause the game and plan your move. The number of move and attack you could make is depends on the energy bar at the top on the screen, the longer distance you move, the more energy it will consume and as for attacks, every attack has a different consumption. When you done planning your move, you'll probably notice everything is moving in a slow pace as she attacks them.  The energy bar takes a couple of seconds to recharge before next use. The only weapon you use in the game is the sword, unlike Bastion which provide a nice arsenal of weapon which ranges from spears to mortar. Having one weapon doesnt make the game boring, there are lot of attack that you can choose from, if I'm correct they are called Functions in the game. You can choose up to 4 types of active Function, there some longer range ones like Breach or some which are able to change enemy to be your ally for a couple of seconds but it has to be done in a close range or calling an ally to help you and many more. The active function can be upgrade by merging them to makes thing more interesting, for example merging the long range attack and the ability to change your enemy to ally, whenever you attack using this function it will changes your enemy to be your ally while taking damage and attacking from a long range. There are other combination such as merging a bounce attack with the long range breach, that will produce a long range attack that could bounce off your enemy and attacks other enemy around the area. Each function could merge with additional 2 attacks but it start with 1 open upgrade slot, the second slot comes as an unlock. If you chose not to use it as an upgrade or active function, it can be use as a passive skill. For example, choosing bounce attack as passive skills will give Red a shield to absorb damage. You could put up to 4 passive skill at 1 time but it starts with 1 passive skill slot while the others are unlocks. There is a limit of functions, upgrades and passive skill you can use at a single time, it is all depends on the number of energy bar (cant remember what they call it in game). Certain function takes up more bar than others, at most a single function could take it up to 4 bars. I believe the limit they include is to balance the game and to avoid having full set of overpowerd combination. The enemy variety is pretty good, different enemy may require different approach on attacking them. There are a couple boss fights which are interesting (especially the last one). Overall, I'll say Transistor is one of the best game release on 2014. It has great gameplay mechanics, awesome soundtrack and a rather interesting way of telling a story. If you are a fan of their previous game, you will definitely enjoy Transistor. The game is about 7 to 8 hours long, I complete mine in 8 hours and I remember there are people manage to finish it in 5 hours.			"

												*Steam review, Buzzfeed style*10 Reasons Why You Should Play Transistor1. Gorgeous hand-painted assets and backgroundThe game might not features next-gen graphics, but every asset in this game is beautifully hand-drawn -- IMO, that alone is far better than Lara Croft's hair with TressFX on.2. Amazing soundtrackThe game's soundtrack is simply out of this world. You just gotta listen to believe it.3. Deep, rich and rewarding gameplay Interesting leveling system and skill upgrades. Plus that in-battle pause mechanic is very cool, gives you room to breathe for planning the next attack.4. Amazing soundtrackReally, you must listen to it.5. Well-written, thoughtful storyGood writing extends beyond just good story, and Transistor know that. The characters are interesting, the dialogue and narration is great. And yes THAT DAMN ENDING.6. Immersive futuristic/dystopian settingImagine Blade Runner's neon-lit world married to Ghost in The Shell colorful art but secretly having an affair with art-deco style. Transistor = cyberpunk aesthetic at its finest.7. Amazing soundtrackSeriously, I wrote it three times already.8. Classy voiceover and narrationHey, this game came from the people behind Bastion, so above average voiceover is expected (hint: and then the game went beyond expectation)9. No hand-holdingFrom the get-go, Transistor features no tutorial, no hints, not even a main menu when you boot it up! The game trusts its players to be clever enough to figuring out the mechanic themselves. That's rare these days.10. Amazing soundtrackThat's it.""Look whatever you're thinking, do me a favor: just don't let me go.""Yes, don't let it go. Grab Transistor now.Truly recommended.			"

The voice acting is incredible just like how Bastion's voice acting is but more dramatic. The storyline is great, if you take your time and read everthing and understand it you'll get into the story so much that you will even cry when you beat the game. The soundtrack is eargasmic.

												Incredibly beautiful art style music and stimulating gameglaplay - and the fact that as you aquire new abilities you place them in different slots (Primary, upgrade, and passive) to learn more about them really enouages you to try new fighting styles - but the fact that when your health goes comepletely down, losing an ability temporarily, instead of dying can force the player to consider chaing thier tatics in a middle of a fight.  Would recommend this to anyone looking for a beatiful indie game that holds nothing back.			"

												This is a fairly short, but beautiful game. The combat is very unique and the storyline is pretty interesting if you are willing to read into it. Overall I would scratch this  game into the area of visual novel in the sense that it is more of an artform than it is a game. The only issue I have with it is that it kind of is a 1 time playthrough game and it doesn't really offer much in terms of replay value. With that being said I think it is a must have indie game, but I would highly suggest getting it on sale and not at full price.			"

												A Indie Game that has a creative Battle System, a large variety of Attacks, a beautifull Soundtrack, awesome writting, interesting Characterdevelopment, visuals that will let your Eyeballs Explode, a great Replay Ability and is totally worth its Money ?Here it is Ladies and Gentlemen : Transistor !Made by the people who brought you Bastion (which is a game you totally should have played) this Masterpiece was letting my Heart Beating 7000 times in a Minute !Basic Stuff: The Game is not Hard but it also is not Easy.You probably wont find yourself dying that much in this game but that doesnt mean that the game isnt challenging !Story : As mentioned the writting is great, the Story is entertaining, beautifull and well presented.The Story is not really that long (My Playthrough took about 7 Hours) which is the only lil minus point i can give this game but it is full of Fun and DramaCharacters: The Game doesnt have many actuall Characters which is not a minus point.Each Character is full of emotion eventhough it seems like someone spoke like he was bored as hell while recording, that is what makes some of those characters great eventhough they can speak totally emotionless it fills the impact of their voice for You (The Player) with a lot of Drama and Emotion. The Characters are as interesting as the World they live in.Visuals: Speaking of the World, as i mentioned it will blow away your Eyeballs, the Sci-Fi style that the developers present you is full of interesting Places, Buildings and so on. The Animations are also a Blast ! Soundtrack: The Soundtrack is the Nuke !!! If you buy the game you just need to buy the Soundtrack eventhough its totally unessecary because you can even Unlock the Songs ingame. The Music is themed and emotional and : YOUR HEART WILL♥♥♥♥♥♥BRICKS WHEN THE VOCALS ROLL IN.The Vocals of Ashley Barret are realy fantastic, she is a amazing Musician and when she manages to raise her voice inside the game your ears will bleed Jelly, why will they bleed jelly, you ask ? The Heck i know ! I dont know what you had for Lunch.Actual Gameplay: The Game is a Typical ""Action Role-Playing Hack and Slash"", but it has some nice little Features for example: The CustomizationAs you progress you will receive Abilities through some Events or through LVL Ups.You can use up to 4 Abilities as ""Action-Ability"".The Action Ability can be Upgraded by other Abilities.For example i take the first 2 AttacksCrash: A Normal Melee Hit that can Stun enemies for a Short DurationBreach: A Typical Ranged AttackAt Acess Points that are placed throughout the game you can Upgrade and Manage your ""Loadout"".Upgrading basicly is : You add one Ability into Another Ability, when you add a Ability into another one this Ability wont be able to be placed into other Abilities or as a Action Ability.For Example: If we add the Attack Breach into the Crash Ability Crash will gain the Ability to become a Ranged attack but we cant have Breach as a second attack tho.With later Variety of Attacks you will earn, you can create your own Unique Playstyle !!!Combat: Combat is realy Strategic and Exciting at the same time. You can either fight in the typical Hack and Slash Style or you can switch to the ""Turn"" Mode at every time. The Turn mode will stop time and will allow you to plan Actions against your Incoming Enemy (Your Enemies wont move until the Actions that you selected in Turn will be Executed), many people think that this just slows down the Game entirely but i think that it totally doesnt slow down the game it just gives the Game a Strategic Touch and its not like you are Invincible because of this Ability. While the Turn is active you can only use a certain amount of Attacks/Abilities but without Turn you can repeatly use the attacks all over again and after your Turn ended it needs to Recharge, while recharging you cant use any other Ability and need to wait until its fully Recharged to perform your Actions. By using a lower amount of Abilities the Cooldown of Turn will take accordingly less time.Enemies: Your enemies are ""The Process"" a very special kind of AI that is able to develop itself all over again.There is a Large Variety of Enemies that will Upgrade itself throughout the Game.For Example : The FetchThe Fetch is a Process that looks similar to a Dog and it is realy fast and will catch up easily with you if you dont develop a good tactic against it. However : Later in the Game this Enemy will gain a Hunting Cloak Ability making it a deadly Predator and can change the Fight against this Enemytype a lot.Replay Ability : One this is 100% Sure, you will never get all the stuff in your First Playthrough means, you got to do the Story again to see EVERYTHING Transistor has to offer. The Challenges that you can do to Unlock Music, the Variety of Abilities and all their Combinations.The Game can also be Advanced by Adding Features called ""Limiters"" you can add as much as you like !What do they do ? : The Limiters will make your Game more challenging but this will also reward you with Bonus XP !For Example Doubeling the Enemy Attack Damage but increasing the XP you gain by 4%.Those Effects can be stacked to give you a Big XP Boost or if your just looking for a Challenge then they are also going to help you ^^.I give Transistor a 10/10 it may not be the best game ever made but it still is a wonderfull Experience that you should have played.I hope this Review will help you with your Decision to buy it because this Game is MORE worth then its price !

												If you are looking for Bastion 2, this is not it. Sorry. A lot of the design decisions are similar, but the combat system could not be more different, it's much more linear (you can't advance without killing all enemies, can't backtrack, and the number of fights you can skip are countable using fingers), and the wonderful narrator character has been replaced by one that's merely passable.That said, the game is pretty good if you're willing to accept it for what it is: Its own game.* The combat system has good depth (even if some abilities are woefully over/underpowered compared to the rest, and important hints are only displayed once in a way that you can easily miss them).* The story is ok (though you're left to fill in a lot of blanks on your own). It borrows a lot of cues from Bastion on presentation.* It has an equivalent of Bastion's Gods that lets you scale up the difficulty to whatever level you want at any save point (in fact I like this game's selection better than Bastion's, since it doesn't favor some weapons over others the same way).* New Game + keeps the difficulty scaling and your leveling going from the same point it was at the end of the game (good thing since the story is shorter), as if there were no interruption.* The way the lore unlocking is implemented encourages you to try out every ability in all three possible slots, which is a plus in my opinion.* It is pretty and has good music.Combat is a mix of real-time and turn-based, with the time between your ""turns"" scaling with how much you did during the last turn (though attacking without going into turn mode is a valid strategy and a few abilities are always available). It veers wildly between frantic, fun, methodical, tedious and everywhere inbetween, depending on the enemies and your skill loadout; but usually hovers near ""frantic and fun"". Instead of Bastion's variety of balanced weapons, you mix an match abilities an upgrades. Some are blatantly better than others but there's certainly no ""one good build"".			"

												Story: 5/5The storytelling to Transistor is told through the interactions between Red, the mute singer protagonist, and her weapon possessed by her lover as well as various messages on computers you find throughout the 5-hour campaign. Plenty of blanks are left for you to fill, and the ending, although a bit confusing, is extremely open to interpretation.Visual: 5/5The game looks like a painting that is gradually losing its colors. At the beginning everything is colorful and brushed with bright colors but as the game progresses colors become darker and by the end there is almost no bright color. This beautiful take on artstyle really adds to the mood of the story and its themes. The city of Cloudbank is a beautiful piece of art that you will want to learn about and explore.Sound: 5/5The soundtrack for this game is amazing, especially the songs with lyrics. Every song felt perfectly attached to the mood of what was going on in the story at the time of whatever exploring or fighting being done at the time. The voice acting is brilliant, especially the voice of Red's lover. Sound effects for your attacks and enemy attacks fit perfectly.Gameplay: 4/5The combat system takes a while to get used to due to a lack of handholding, but after the learning curve it's one-of-a-kind. Abilities are obtained that can be used to experiment with various combinations of equipping some abilities to others or using them as passive effects. At death instead of returning to the last check point immediately an ability is lost until 2 checkpoints later and health is restored to max, forcing you to use the abilities you have left in new innovative ways. Time can be slowed down to make strategic decisions on what abilities to use. Limiters can be used to add challenge to the game while allowing you to level up faster. Replayability: N/AWill edit after I replay the game on its ""new game plus"" that allows replay with past unlocked abilities.Verdict:Transistor is an experience I have never had with any other game I have ever played. You will grow to care about the main characters, Cloudbank, and its inhabitants. The presentation value is extremely high with beautiful visuals, amazing sound design, and fantastic storytelling. The gameplay has a learning curve and can take getting used to, but once it clicks it's extremely addicting. Transistor is proof that video games can be art. If Transistor is on sale, you owe it to yourself to buy it.			"

												My, my...this game has been on the top of my most wanted list for quite some time now and I gotta say...It is truly amazing.Pros-Beautiful and detailed visuals-World seems so 'alive'-Fascinating narrator and protagonist-Real-time and turn-based combat style is a good mix-up-Games doesn't make you go through the same thing over and over again, it mixes things up-Intriguing story.-Music is sooo good-Dialogue is so strategically placed-Pretty cheap in fact, having a whooping retail price of $20-Indie and by the same developers of Bastion, what's not to love?Cons-Some visuals during combat are 'not as good'Off to conclusion, this game is good, no its a true masterpiece. I can understand why it has won so many awards, the dialogue, the music, the setting and the characters all of these help it shape the world of 'Transistor'. I'm not here to spoil any part of the story since my aim is to you: the person reading my review. To personally pick up a copy and try it out, its worth the moneyFinal Verdict: Pick it up!Score: 8.7/10Now, Supergiant make another masterpiece game already, please			"

In total on the places: elements of mechanics, giving of a plot, a sound and music in Transistor are combined in incomprehensible harmony. While all of you wait for game about the open world, people of Supergiant Games do a true art.Divinely beautiful music, magnificent art design and  history, touching to tears, do Transistor by a unique adventure. An adventure which it is necessary to see. In the conclusion of Transistor is the best that I saw in recent years... 10\10			"

The artwork is also gorgeous and I love the turn-based RPG gameplay, as well as the fluidity of the combat system - whack some processes around, or take your time planning how you're going to do it! The voice acting is also superb, and I love how they have Red hum the background music while in Turn() mode.GET IT!PS: I played through with a controller, it has great controller support too - although I haven't really played THAT many steam games, it definitely is one that ""fully supports controllers"" for real. But a lot of people would probably prefer playing with keyboard and mouse. Just saying though. :P			"

												My, my...this game has been on the top of my most wanted list for quite some time now and I gotta say...It is truly amazing.Pros-Beautiful and detailed visuals-World seems so 'alive'-Fascinating narrator and protagonist-Real-time and turn-based combat style is a good mix-up-Games doesn't make you go through the same thing over and over again, it mixes things up-Intriguing story.-Music is sooo good-Dialogue is so strategically placed-Pretty cheap in fact, having a whooping retail price of $20-Indie and by the same developers of Bastion, what's not to love?Cons-Some visuals during combat are 'not as good'Off to conclusion, this game is good, no its a true masterpiece. I can understand why it has won so many awards, the dialogue, the music, the setting and the characters all of these help it shape the world of 'Transistor'. I'm not here to spoil any part of the story since my aim is to you: the person reading my review. To personally pick up a copy and try it out, its worth the moneyFinal Verdict: Pick it up!Score: 8.7/10Now, Supergiant make another masterpiece game already, please			"

Awesome game! :DReally enjoyed it, it's super fun and the soundtrack is brilliant. The artwork is also gorgeous and I love the turn-based RPG gameplay, as well as the fluidity of the combat system - whack some processes around, or take your time planning how you're going to do it! The voice acting is also superb, and I love how they have Red hum the background music while in Turn() mode.GET IT!PS: I played through with a controller, it has great controller support too - although I haven't really played THAT many steam games, it definitely is one that ""fully supports controllers"" for real. But a lot of people would probably prefer playing with keyboard and mouse. Just saying though. :P			"

												Oh man i loved this game. I bought this when it came out. The mechanics are so simple you and yet so deep. You just have to combine different kinds of functions and each combination is unique. The combat system is awesome. The artstyle of this game is amazing. The voice acting is incredible just like how Bastion's voice acting is but more dramatic. The storyline is great, if you take your time and read everthing and understand it you'll get into the story so much that you will even cry when you beat the game. The soundtrack is eargasmic. This is one of the best games i have ever played and i highly recommended it. It is a ""must have"" game. I can't wait for the next SuperGiants' game to come out.			"

												*Steam review, Buzzfeed style*10 Reasons Why You Should Play Transistor1. Gorgeous hand-painted assets and backgroundThe game might not features next-gen graphics, but every asset in this game is beautifully hand-drawn -- IMO, that alone is far better than Lara Croft's hair with TressFX on.2. Amazing soundtrackThe game's soundtrack is simply out of this world. You just gotta listen to believe it.3. Deep, rich and rewarding gameplay Interesting leveling system and skill upgrades. Plus that in-battle pause mechanic is very cool, gives you room to breathe for planning the next attack.4. Amazing soundtrackReally, you must listen to it.5. Well-written, thoughtful storyGood writing extends beyond just good story, and Transistor know that. The characters are interesting, the dialogue and narration is great. And yes THAT DAMN ENDING.6. Immersive futuristic/dystopian settingImagine Blade Runner's neon-lit world married to Ghost in The Shell colorful art but secretly having an affair with art-deco style. Transistor = cyberpunk aesthetic at its finest.7. Amazing soundtrackSeriously, I wrote it three times already.8. Classy voiceover and narrationHey, this game came from the people behind Bastion, so above average voiceover is expected (hint: and then the game went beyond expectation)9. No hand-holdingFrom the get-go, Transistor features no tutorial, no hints, not even a main menu when you boot it up! The game trusts its players to be clever enough to figuring out the mechanic themselves. That's rare these days.10. Amazing soundtrackThat's it.""Look whatever you're thinking, do me a favor: just don't let me go.""Yes, don't let it go. Grab Transistor now.Truly recommended.			"

												The game is a little gem aesthetically: art nouveau meets cyberpunk plus awesome soundtrack. Combat mechanics is interesting and the story is engaging - though if you got confused/disappointed at the end of Ghost in the Shell (the movie), then probably the story is not for you. The ending is nice, though slightly predictable - or I'm simply an old geezer who has seen and read too much.The game is not without flaws. Some skills are unbalanced. Sure, I haven't used all limiters, only three, but I have discovered a good build sometime around mid game and ended all late fights in first attempts without more than few scratches - I know, I could have cranked up the difficulty, but didn't feel like. Last 20-30 minutes of the game were a bit stretched and I hoped the thing resolved quickly. Finally, the game is short: 8 hours to complete is not much.Still, I'm recommending it, as it stands out in the crowd. All in all, the story, the style and music, make it worth the money and time spent.			"

												Transistor is one of the greatest games I have ever played. Supergiant proves that lightning doesn't just strike twice, it bursts into a creative frenzy of narrative excellence and brillant game design. The world is absolutely gorgeous, the music exceptional, and the story daringly unique. The combat system allows for seemingly endless variety, and the difficulty curve is very fair. Even the side objectives are compelling in their own right. You are rewarded by completing certain ""tests"" with music tracks that you can listen to in the game. Overall, if you want a compelling narrative, a brilliant soundtrack, and a heartwarming experience, Transistor is for you. I wish I could give this game of the year for the rest of time, but I can't. Dang it.			"

												Incredibly beautiful art style music and stimulating gameglaplay - and the fact that as you aquire new abilities you place them in different slots (Primary, upgrade, and passive) to learn more about them really enouages you to try new fighting styles - but the fact that when your health goes comepletely down, losing an ability temporarily, instead of dying can force the player to consider chaing thier tatics in a middle of a fight.

												After Bastion being as amazing as it was, Supergiant Games really had a lot to live up to. Transistor doesn't quite hit as hard as Bastion did, but none the less it was still a pretty good game.It has a lot of things in common with Bastion-- optional difficulty increases for more XP, multiple playthroughs, a narrator, the art style, etc. It primarily differs in the combat and the setting, although the story does share many similarities with Bastion. There are many in depth story analysis online. I suggest giving a couple of them a read.Bastion comparisons aside, the game is quite good. I'm not super taken with the combat system, but everything else really shines. Supergiant knows how to make a good game.			"

												There are a lot of flaws to this game, difficulty being one of them: There's a save before and after every single monster-encounter. And even if you die, you'd need to die four times at the same battle to have to actually load. The story is short and not as deep. So why am I recommending it?Because it is breathtakingly beautiful. It's a story about love and revenge, and saving the world. It has an ending I really didn't see coming and albeit I said the story wasn't deep, it spoke to me. Throughout the entire story, the voice, the story it told, it was heartbreaking. And slowly, piece by piece, it told a story that touched me.So it isn't long. It isn't deep. If I were to compare it to litterature; I'd call it a short story and not a roman. But if you're a reader, you probably know that short stories often have the most to say, and often have the goal of making the reader think and reflect upon something.10/10			"

With a voiceless singer, the disembodied narration of the eponymous broadsword, and a gorgeous Art Deco meets Cyberpunk world, Supergiant Games have succeeded in tearing down any expectations left by their previous title. Instead, replacing them with something incredibly different. Something smarter, more refined, and thought-provoking. Transistor truly is a glowing Bastion of excellence.			"

												Possibly the best game I've ever played. Everything is perfectly designed and executed; the passion the creators have for every aspect of their craft shows throughout. I didn't think it would have been possible for them to have done better than Bastion (and some of the reviews I've seen don't rate it as highly) but in my eyes it's far superior, and I rate Bastion extremely highly.Two of the things I wasn't a big fan of in Bastion have been fixed in Transistor. Firstly, the narrator: he was great, but I'm not a big fan of voiceovers as a way of revealing the plot. In Transistor the commentary is provided by a companion, albeit a rather unconventional one.Second, the combat. In Bastion I found that once I got a weapon combination I really liked, I stuck with it and neglected the others, and fighting seemed to be a bit hack-and-slash. You can still play this way if you so wish, but the combat system has been expanded in the most incredible way to encourage you to try other things. Attacks can now be combined and stacked, and the effects of each combination are radically different and fantastically awesome. The sheer variety of possible attacks is mind-boggling, and they're all badass -- none is definitively 'the best'. There's also a very clever 'attack planning' mechanic available, which looks a bit like turn-based combat but really isn't. The combat system is quite unlike anything I've seen anywhere else, and I loved it.The art, music and story are so good it's impossible to do them justice in a review. The plot is revealed gently and subtly, and there are moments where a certain realisation dawned on me that required me to sit back and take a few minutes to process it.I didn't just enjoy playing Transistor; I feel genuinely privalged to have done so. This is a short, beautiful game that amply repays the time and cost.			"

												Drat. Its very very similar to Bastion but I don't nearly care as much about the plot than I did with Bastion.So many parallels; A something did something, in this case an evil, organized corperation stole your absolutely magificent voice, whereas, in Bastion, someone divided by zero and nearly ended the world.  Red is clearly as singer, so her voice being stolen might as well be the end of the world. Instead she gets this buster sword that has an eye on it and looks something like a USB, and has that sort of 'very very tired' male voice, where half of his verbiage is breathing sounds. You're a sword. All you do is glow and not one-shot dudes.This game is Bastions more techincal and less gritty cousin, of whom is obessed with planning things out and gets very let down when something doesn't work. The main fights involve you flailing wilding at things that will absolutely move even as your plans are excuted.I guess thats there to make it 'hard' but it moreso makes it 'irritating'.Its fun though, and its not that the story isn't interesting, its that Bastion was better.Also the games art ughIts lovely 6/10			"

												TransistorI was not really a fan of Bastion but this game was cheap and the art was gorgeous (as was in bastion). Gotta say i was not disappointed. The art is phenomenal and so is the music.The story is good , the characters are great and i found the combat really satisfying. A big improvement over bastion or maybe its just that i like tactical combat more than actionTook about 8 hours for me to finish the game but i skipped half the challenges because it was kinda of boring (the wave part, i liked the others more). Satisfying ending too. All in all i would definetely recommend it especially for that price(which more developers should take a look at. Its much easier to bite on things you are uncertain if they dont cose 40-60 euros).			"

												I just started playing this game, and I already feel the need to give a very simple review of the game which is something I've never done before. Let me just say, that this game has beautiful graphics, beautiful soundtrack, and even though so far it doesn't seem like much of a story I am always rather very intrigued. Also, I just love the gameplay of the game! Honestly, I can't wait to play more of it and I'm just simply addicted already. How can a game be so beautiful and absolutely perfect?			"

												TRANSISTORThis game isn't as short as everyone is telling you it is, there's tons of replayibility, and it actually took me a while to beat this game the first time i tried it. I'm not even bad at the game and it took me a whole 7 hours to complete it the first time, because i was busy exploring all the areas, testing out all the combinations, and having a ball of a time. This game is totally worth the full price, but if it ever goes on sale, do not hesitate to get it. The story gets heavy, the music fantastic, and the battles get harder and harder as you go on, but you start to grasp your skills. The final boss fight made my  HEART POUND	 , it's a very intense boss-fight, and there's plenty of buildup. This is a 10/10 for me, and I eagerly await SUPERGIANT'S next game. This is the most pleasant suprise i've had this entire year. The artstyle is superb, the acting is superb, and it runs quite well on my machine. The mechanics in the game feel GREAT to use. And for 20$ it is a steal.			"

												A flawed masterpiece that doesn't live up to its potential. Transistor as game is similar to Bastion(made bysame company) in that Transistoris a singleplayer *topdown isometric RPG - but now there is a pseudo turn based system. You can pause the game to queue up abilties that are then executed in hyper speed (at the cost of cooldown - so not always the best idea). A keyboard and mouse is recommend but a gamepad might be more suitable for some.The GoodAbsolutely gorgeous. Wonderful use of special effects, stunning backdrops of a surreal world, and all art in general is amazing. This focus on the aesthetic also means there is a button for your character to ""hum"" to the soundtrack and to a useless flourish with your sword. You can't get lost in this world because of how the world is designed (it doesn't feel like a corridor game which is good but you may disagree).As an isometric RPG the turn based system is wonderful addition. Your ""abilities"" can be combined or used as passive buffs which is fascinating gives welcome variety.The BadThe biggest problem is that Transistor is allergic to proper story telling. After you start playing Transistor you may be left asking ""why should I complete this story"", and the answer is ""unintelligible gibberish"" which is a tragedy. The story is not inherently bad: there is attempted intrigue and allegory. The supporting cast are all waifish emo characters leaving behind whiny recorded messages, but the biggest annoyance is your own companion sword: courtesy the droning of Logan Cunningham. Yes, the talented voice actor in Bastion is now an annoying sword using every opportunity to say something useless (i seriously want a ""mute the transistor"" option). And if I don't explain the story now you will play the entire game without knowing or caring(which is ok): the world can be recreated on a whim by ""the process"" using the transistor - but this has been somehow corrupted - there is a group of rebels resisting this - you fighting stuff for no reason - The end.The ""it depends""I liked the soundtrack - but I didn't love it. You may hate the lack of enemy variety - but it is not a big issue because the enemy change/upgrade their abilities. Also the game isn't very long at 6 or so hours so grinding is never a problem - but there is definite replayabilty in Transistor using ""limiters"" to make the game harder & because the array of ability combinations.The ConclusionI can recommended Transistor solely on the unmatched visual splendor, the RPG game behind it is pretty good too.

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Transistor 

			Views: 67		

			The world of Transistor, is a sci-fi-themed action slasher from the creators of Bastion.Available Here: Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/237930/ HomePage:...		

Transistor is  a sci-fi-themed action slasher with a post apocalyptic feel from the creators of Bastion. The music in the game, though well done, it isn't woven into the experience of the game and it's mechanics as well as it could have been. Graphically the game runs to a more abstract simplistic feel, though it does carry it's own unique beauty.CombatThe combat can be confusing at first, because it has a hack and slash feel combined with a turn based regenerative time style. This is mostly due to the abilities. You can use four active abilities, but beyond that, the abilities have additional properties that you can integrate into your primary four abilities to augment them. Your choice of what properties you combine determine the new ability that you create. You have 16 different augments to choose from to tweak and synergize  each ability. The game provides a safe area for you to experiment and practice new abilities and traits to find what works for you. While I like this availability to combine traits and create a build that works for you, it has been my experience as I went through the game that in boss battles, you have to go for a more obvious dps build rather than something you have created in order to generate the damage you need to defeat them. I go into more detail about this in my video, which I encourage you to watch if you want further explanation.The story is a bit confusing, and hard to get into at first. There is a lot of information coming at you at once, and little relate-ability and emotional involvement to your character and their actions. The main character doesn't talk during the adventure, but her weapon/companion does. It's been my experience that the companion talks way too much, and is off-putting. Overall I have found that there are some faults to the game, such as a confusing ability interface, having to fall back to traditional dps builds to defeat bosses, and an abstract storyline. Even with these shortcomings, the game is still enjoyable. The story is not a detriment to the game, and the ability to customize your characters abilities makes it intriguing to play, along with the play + mode for longer experiences. I can easily recommend this game.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here. https://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho "

												If you enjoyed Bastion, this one hones a similar style with a more strategic approach to the gameplay.The stories are a bit similar, too. Transistor might be somewhat of a  repackage of Bastion.. But not with any small effort. It's like, they took Bastion and carved out most of the guts, ate the bones, too, and then put robots in place. I enjoyed Bastion, and SuperGiant did an awesome job on the concept of Transistor. The length is just right on a normal difficulty playthrough.Red, the main protagonist is wonderful to play along with.			"

												This game is a work of art. It has been quite some time since I last played a game that was so capitivating or moving.For what it's worth, I have never played Bastion so I won't be able to compare Transistor to it. That said, the game's aesthetics are astounding, both in terms of sights and sounds. The game's story is also very good. It essentially dumps you into the middle of events and you have to unpack it from there, tying most of it up at the end. The game's gameplay is also tied into the narrative in a nice and tight manner. The game mechanics involve using various modules that can be equipped either in active, passive, or upgraded slots. The game encourages experimentation as each module contains lore involving a particular character that can only be unlocked by using it in each of these slots. It incentivizes player experimentation in a keen way, rather than finding one tried-and-true attack. Additionally, if your health depletes in a battle it doesn't seem to outright fail you (at least as far as I've experienced). Instead, it disables one of your abilities and recharges your health. As Two Best Friends put it, it's essentially telling you that whatever you're doing currently isn't working. It's another incentive to experiment.We're only halfway through the year, but this might honestly get my choice as the best game of 2014. I look forward to the replays ahead of me.UPDATE 06/28So I thought about this game some more and I want to add another reason why I like this game so much: Red seems like an actual, living person.This is done masterfully through small things in the story. The two that stand out for me are the fact that we see her eat pizza and we see her go to use a bathroom. And I mean use *use* a bathroom, not like Silent Hill *use* a bathroom where you stick your arm down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to pull out a wallet. We see her walk into a bathroom, a fade to black with a flush, and the game returns.This was endearing to me. Emotions and whatnot go a long way into making a fictional character appear human, but I honestly think it's the small minutiae that ultimately make fictional characters pop to life more. It's not as exciting as drama, but to me it pulses with the true blood of life: the banality of existence. I apprecaited it a lot.			"

												10/10This is the first game from supergiant done completely on their own (Warner Bros. published Bastion) and it is a testament to what indie studios can accomplish when they aren't fettered by a large studio. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with Transistor and while it is the spiritual successor to Bastion a lot of it is very different and everything that it borrows from Bastion is improved.The art style, music, and narration are all in the same vein as Bastion, which is to say they are a masterpiece. The artwork is very beautiful especially during cutscenes and found myself taking screen shots constantly for desktop backgrounds, etc. The music is a big part of the experience as well, and just as in Bastion, both the music and the artwork set the scene. I would not say they improved on Bastion because that would be saying Bastion was flawed in those aspects. And Bastion is more of a western feel while Transistor is very much a cyber-punk game. However, the artwork is more detailed, rich, and beautiful, probably due to the fact that this is a newer game. I also feel that the music is a bit more developed and varied. The narration is also wonderful.The gameplay has changed significantly from Bastion, so if you're expecting the fun but rather simple gameplay of Bastion, you will be pleasantly surprised. In Transistor, you only have one weapon, if you can call it that. Your weapon looks like a sword, but it is more like a computer that you can upload programs to. Those programs are your powers and you pick them up as you progress through the game. The awesome thing about these programs is that they have three different uses. You can use them as active powers, passive powers, or you can use them to alter other active powers. For example, you have an area of effect attack, and an attack that gets enemies to fight for you. You can alter the AOE attack with the conversion attack and you have an AOE attack that converts enemies. This obviously gives you an immense amount of flexibility in combat and very different gameplay styles and approaches to defeating your enemies.These programs/abilities are then socketed onto your sword, which is the Transistor of the games title. In keeping with the cyberpunk theme, your Transistor has a limited amount of RAM...each program uses different levels of RAM...some only take up one space of RAM, others take up more. Another cool thing about your Transistor is that it is the narrator for your game...I don't want to say too much because I don't want to give away the story, but it all makes sense a little while into the game.Another thing that makes the gameplay very fun is that you can pause time on the battlefield. While paused, you can move around the battlefield, and choose which powers you want to use and which enemies you want to target. This allows you to escape when surrounded, or flank your enemies (since attacks from behind do more damage). This gives the game a turn-based feel to it. It does not really feel like a hack and slash at all...you can use your powers in real-time as well, but when facing very powerful enemies, you will die very quickly when using that tactic.I have not actually died yet while playing but I have discovered another thing about the gameplay in almost doing so. When you're health bar gets to zero, you don't immediately die, you simply lose one of the programs you have socketed into your Transistor. My assumption is that you will die after you lose all four programs. This also requires you to carefully plan which programs you use and how you have them modified, etc. Just another thing that makes this game awesome.Finally, the story is very intriguing. You play as Red who is a famous artist and singer. Apparently, there's a group called the Camerati (sounds kind of Mafia-ish) who is angry at you for some reason and they try to kill you. They have also killed the other important people in the city you live in (called Cloudbank). That is all I can say since I haven't played it completely yet, and I don't want to give anything important away. But I can say that the story is very intriguing and every aspect of the game helps tell it.			"

												In the years after ""Bastion"" was released, fans were left to wonder: What if Bastion was a girl?  With the new sequel ""Transistor,"" Super Giantgames answers this question with a resounding ""yes!""In it, you play as an unnamed red-haired girl known only as ""R,"" a professional singer who is forced to turn to professional humming after her voice is stolen by the Yakuza.  The object of the game is to thwart the evil robot gang that is trying to take over the city.Bastion's dad, who has been uploaded into a USB drive, helps her fight crime with powerful magic spells.  ""Dungeons and Dragons"" players will be delighted to see familiar faces such as Lightning Bolt and Charm Monster.  His USB enclosure leaves a trail of circuitry behind as you walk, reminiscent of the Disney cyberpunk film ""Tran"" (hence the title, a portmanteau of ""Tran"" and ""sister"").Veteran Bastion players will notice two things right away: First, that the loading times have improved a great deal.  Gone are the days of waiting for the ground to load at the last second as you're walking toward it; it is now all preloaded when you enter the level.  Second, that the difficulty curve picks up where Bastion let off and ramps sharply upward from the get-go, offering a great deal of additional challenge, and requiring almost inhuman reflexes and quick-thinking strategy to survive even the earlier encounters.There is, however, an unfortunate glitch where pressing [RT] causes the world textures to glitch out and the whole game to lock up.  I presume this is because it was the ""special move"" button in Bastion's engine, but this game doesn't have any special moves to assign to it.  This can be a frustrating experience when it happens in the heat of combat.  Hopefully this can be fixed in an update patch.In the end, we are left with many new questions: What if Transistor could talk?  What if Transistor was a guy (a ”Tranbrothor,"" if you will)?  Perhaps these will be left open to interpretation, but maybe we will be lucky enough to see the developer round out the trilogy and tie up all the loose ends.★★★★★			"

												Let's get the good points down first:Great Art, music and setting. Good story.The not so good points are, it has some great concepts but thats what they are. Concepts. Combat is rather boring and while it encourages deversity in skills, there are some skills that just aren't that useful. While the enemy types are good there are very few of them and they just upgrade them as the game goes along. The planning mode is a mixed bag as its the only way to do seroius damage but it frequently lies about how much damage you do. The story while good feels very bastion and it keeps you in the dark a little too much.I found that the Zero Punctuation review perfectly covered most of what I have said.I can't recommend buying this game but it is certainly worth a play if you can get a free copy or to play it on a friends pc. However if a patch ever comes out that fixes the planning mode to actually be accurate in telling damage, I would change my review to a recommended			"

												Transistor features a very solid ability linking combat system. With a small number of abilities you can create dozens of combinations to suit your combat style. Though, you will likely find a solid combination you like early and only change from it to briefly flirt with other abilities or to complete various tests. It is arguably unfortunate to highlight the combat system in such an artisticly oriented game. Part of why it stands out so much is because the other half of the game, the story, is incoherent at best with characters whose most redeaming quality is their artwork. The good will built by Bastion is whittled away here.			"

Transistor, transits the world剧情简单来讲就是红发黑丝萌妹与一支大宝剑的虐狗故事。与前作不同的赛博朋客和相同的 “啊出发点是好的，结果不小心搞砸了结果世界毁灭” 的灭世设定，结局非常感人：妹子拯救了世界却选择自杀，为什么呢？Transistor, transits the world.战斗方面非常有新意，即时+回合策略合理运用可以事半功倍。节奏比较适中，上手了速通三小时也可以完成。技能方面非常有新意，大宝剑可以吸收各种NPC的意识（灵魂），每个灵魂可以分别作为主动技手动释放，或者被动技与其它意识组合出新效果，亦或者作为属性技能直接装备。画面的话光影和色彩的运用更好了，和前作不同这次基色调偏冷，并更多地使用了3D效果。。相同的是依然可以随手截图就是一张壁纸~哈哈。高潮部分和结局的手绘CG配合剧情效果很震撼。音乐保持了Supergiant Games一贯的高水准，空灵优雅，很符合主角失声歌手的气质和灾难过后空城里忧伤的氛围，个人觉得比Bastion更加好，推荐入OST。总之独立游戏这是第一个能让我二周目的作品，期待今年发布的第三部新作。Gameplay: 9/10Control: 8.5/10Story: 11/10 Salute!Music: 10/10Graphic: 9/1010/10 Would be Penetra-nsis-ted again lol.刚才翻了下YouTube有关这游戏结局的评论，发现不少人不喜欢这个ending,前作是有两个不同的结局可以选择的，而这作只有一个结局。然而多了一个细思恐极的看似是NG+的mode。个人觉得，这是制作组对在前作自己抛出的问题 Do you try and go back to the old world, or try and make it in the new? 给出的一个明确的答案。			"

												This game was amazing! I picked it up because I enjoyed Bastion so much. Its similar to Bastion in that its the same narrator (hell yes), the music (Darren Korb) its got your side challenge missions, the plus playthrough but its so much more. I cant say that I enjoy either game more than the other although after playing bastion to almost exhaustion this game felt like coming back to it in a new way. The art in this game is so incredibly trippy; good stuff. You can just walk around and stare at stuff, haha. The world feels alien at first but you slowly get used to it. Much like the story. You're kinda just thrown into it not knowing much of what is going on, but as you discover this strange world the story slowly unravels. The music could be one of the best parts tho. It really suits the atmosphere of the game. Its one of those soundtracks you can listen to without the game and really enjoy it. Also the music is once again done by Darren Korb (Bastion).Pros+Great storytelling+Incredible soundtrack (The game came with the soundtrack and I listen to it all the time)+Immersive art. Just walking around looking at stuff is fun, haha.+Talented voice actorsCons-The story is a little short (5 hrs)- No leaderboards- No main menu (you are immediately thrown into the game)			"

												After an hour of playing I can just say: ""Buy this Game!"". The combat is  innovative, fun and it works  very good. Also the visuals are, not only due to the setting and the presentation of the game, great.tl;dr : You can hum 10/10			"

												Transistor is a rare game that combines sleek, smart combat, an incredible soundtrack, gorgeous level design, interesting gameplay, a captivating story with great pacing, and some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a game to become something so much more than its individual parts. The functions, upgrades, passives and limiters work together seamlessly, and Transistor trusts that you're capable of figuring out the best combinations on your own. It's just intuitive enough without being condescending like many games recently.For me, the story is what really shone. The writing is consistently fantastic and draws you in right from the beginning of the game. I really felt like I was watching the destruction of a city I used to live in. I experienced a wide range of emotions from hope to anger to a huge sense of loss. The ending caught me off-guard; it's tragic, beautiful and heart-wrenching. It's not a terribly long game (~9 hours before NG+) but that doesn't matter. It's exactly as long as it needs to be.tl;dr buy Transistor it's really good			"

												Too many similar enemies, too much kiting around, not as good as Bastion.  Loved the narrator in Bastion, in this one it\'s annoying, story is not nearly as good.			"

												In many ways I felt the surreal nature of the setting was cover for undeveloped characters and a fairly hollow world. I felt like I was just beginning to get attached to the game when it finished. Bastion felt like a complete experience, this felt like eating half a burger and still being hungry. It just wasn't satisfying for me. Overall it did a good job but it feels more like it should have been a demo for a longer game. "

												Oh gosh, I wanted to like this game so much. However, when a game gives no explanation to any of its charicters or technical terms that it throws around it leaves you feeling like there was a prologue or something that you missed. Still hoping that there actually was.			"

												I quite enjoyed playing Bastion a few years ago and I bought this expecting a similarly engaging though brief experience. That was not to be however because when you take away the haunting soundtrack and the wonderful aesthetic, you have a very short, simple and repetitive game. The hybrid real-time/turn-based combat is interesting and the progression system is somewhat unique. I'm sure as some critics have said, that a second playthrough fleshes out the combat but my playthrough leaves me with no desire to go through it again. Even the short time I spent with it was padded out with backtracking and vague, pretentious monologues. I bought Transistor at a significant discount and I still absolutely regret buying it. It is tough given the positive reception the game has received to give it a definite thumbs down so just do your research before you decide either way. This will be the last time I take some respected critics at their word.			"

												Wow.The english language fails me, at times like these. But yet, I will take on this challenge, a review of Transistor.To say that this game is pretty is a collossal understatement. To the point of lying through your teeth. This game is not pretty, it is a masterpiece, worth a spot in a museum and sold for quite the pretty penny. Alright, down to the actual game. If you are a fan of the company's previous work, you might think this a remake of Bastion-style gameplay, with a fantastic narrator and combat mechanics. In a way, you'd be right. There is a sort of narrator in this game, but it is not a fatherly figure, looking down on you with hilarious commentary. This pseudo-commentator is a part of your character, it holds a relationship that seems incredibly intimate. As you go through the game, you and your commentor go through changes and plot development, some seemingly unimportant and some huge vast gaps of shocking drama. The environment you're placed in is beautifully matched with both the combat style and the way you move throughout the game.  If you have ever played a game called ""Shadowrun"", also on steam here, you might feel a similarity betwixt the two. I sure did. Oh, almost forgot. The soundtrack to this game is to the tier that I actually bought it on steam. BOUGHT. MUSIC. ON STEAM.Do I recommend this game? Hell ♥♥♥♥ing yes.			"

												This game uses approximately 25 KB/s of bandwidth constantly and there is no way to stop it other than putting all of Steam into offline mode which I did and I really saw no difference in the game besides improved performance.  There is no option to disable this either and it made Steam, and my internet connection at large, unstable.Excepting that glaring bug they call a ""feature.""  I really don't have much good to say about this game.  I finished it in under 7 hours with all of the game lock ups from the aforementioned bug, the music is completely unnoteworthy compared to Bastion, the story is either incoherent or not very good (I don't care either way), and the only remotely redeeming facet to the game is the combat but that, by itself, barely rates 3 out of 5.Unless you really, really want to support Supergiant Games, I recommend looking elsewhere.

												Great fun and beautiful game..... But I can't recommend it because there is a glitch that deletes your save files (doesn't effect everyone certainly but it was reported in 2014 and still has the problem for some users. I found that my data was deleted (but it is locatable), however next time I went back to the game I loaded it and it autosaved instantly which meant that the back up was gone too. Really need to fix this. But if you are willing to go through the faff of loading the back up or repeating nearly 4 hours then it's a lot of fun.			"
