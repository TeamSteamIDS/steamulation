												After playing Super meat boy, I started looking out for new games by the same developer. Edmund Mcmillen’s wonderfully strange imagination is an interesting thing to explore through his games, that’s for sure.This game was not a disappointment. At first, I had no idea what to expect, the trailer was very strange but a tad intriguing. When I came across it there was next to no information about the game and the mechanics of it on the store page and back then there was no costumer reviews to go off of. Admittedly I never actually brought it to give it a go off of the information I was given, I ended up with it from a bundle and it’s the only reason I really played it. Although I wish I had taken the leap to try it because it is well worth it.Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated dungeon crawler, one I have heard to be described as “Zelda-like” (I would have no idea about that, never played a Zelda game) you’re a young boy running from his demented mother. Who has been blinded by her hard-core Christianity and believes that the voice of god has spoken to her and told her to murder her son to prove her loyalty. So a very interesting concept, indeed.A short cut scene plays on start-up, which expands on what I just described, you find yourself wandering through randomly generated dungeon floors, fighting monsters, picking up loot and items as you go along that changes how you fight, gives you different abilities and drastically changes Isaac’s image. At the end of each floor, you fight a boss, and move on down to the next floor. It being harder than before, with a bigger space to explore and more enemies to defeat.There’s a large range of items to collect that when found for the first time is added to the “things I found” section in the main menu, so a lovely bit of collecting there to entice those OCD minded like myself, There’s new characters to unlock which vary in stats, challenges to complete and even some DLC that can extend your gameplay.You are given one life and one life only. You can find hearts to heal, but once you are dead, that’s it, you start all over again. So throughout the whole game and especially when nearing the end, it starts to put a little pressure on and gets that heart rate going. I’m not one to be good under pressure so it gets me every time. I FINALLY managed to complete the game a few times over, again, admittedly, only after I gained some “top tips” from my way-to-good-at-games brother. There have been people that have completed the game 10 times over and still not gotten bored. I think that the randomly generated dungeon element to it keeps its replay ability intact. If it were to replay the same levels over and over when you died, the game would be a lot different and no doubt a lot less popular. I have heard from friends that it is quite hard to complete without “doing your research” on the wiki or seeking tips from those nerdy minded like my brother who managed to figure all of it out themselves. I on the other hand find that kind of thing enjoyable, because it beats you every time and you work and research and try to understand the game more to finally get to that ending. I can quite honestly say that the first time I reached the end, my heart has never beaten that loud or that fast in a long time. And that sense of accomplishment you get from finishing a game, is a on a much higher scale when you work to complete this one. The music is great, it fits the setting perfectly and is great to listen to. Rarely have I actually wanted to download a game’s soundtrack, I can give most soundtracks a thumbs up but not often do I actually want to listen to game music outside of gaming.The art, as per usual in Edmunds games, is amazing. And I hear they are also looking to remake the game to have a more “retro” look, with possible multiplayer features. Which should be very interesting. For those interested you can look up “Binding of Isaac: Rebirth”.All in all, it is a great indie game, which is both fun and challenging. Definitely worth trying, I am not usually the dungeon crawler type, but this game is a lot of fun. The only fault that I had with this game, which has bothered me quite a few times now, is that I have lost my save for no reason. The game is listed as having ‘Steam Cloud’ features, but it definitely doesn't work. I haven't uninstalled the game, I haven't touched it. But recently I hopped on and seen all the progress that I had made was gone. And for a game that has no real save points or ongoing plot to keep up with, your stats, unlocked characters and collection of things you have found is pretty much all you have. I was pretty upset to see it had vanished and it’s something I felt I needed to warn people about. TL;DR : Awesome music, fun and engaging game with a slightly 'twisted' side to it. It's a challenge to reach the end and you can definitely end up putting a lot of hours into this. Addictive and awesome all around.			"

												As of writing this I am 500+ hours in and I have to say its one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time, It's really easy to just pick up, yet it also has the ability to make you stay playing for hours on end. Due to all the secrets, items, enemies and most importantly the difficulty it has a ton of replay value. When I say difficult I really do mean it but the more you play the more you learn how to overcome many of the challenges that the game has to offer.Another reason I enjoyed it was the randomly generated levels, this also comes with random enemies, items and secrets, so no two runs end up being the same. The game also borrows a lot from Zelda, so if you are a fan of the level design and many of the mechanics of the early Zelda dungeons and items you will probably be a fan of this.Other than the solid game play it is aesthetically pleasing because of Edmund McMillen's really fun and quirky art style.I really recommend you pick up this title and the expansion pack as soon as possible.

												The Binding of Isaac is a small game with very simple mechanics, but it will catch you with its huge amount of contents, great soundtrack and polished graphics.Sprinkled with humor and nods to gaming's past, The Binding of Isaac is a ballsy game that revels in its absurd moments. Shock value aside, you'll want to play this indie gem over and over again. It's imaginative and  utterly absorbing.I'll put it simply: If you can roll with the macabre toilet humor and if religion jokes don't put you off, AND if you enjoy games with non-optional permadeath, randomized content, tons of secrets and considerable replay value… it's hard to go wrong with The Binding of Isaac. Especially at its low price.			"

												This is pretty much a roguelike dungeon crawler with quite a bit of influences taken from Zelda, and a ton of religious/Satanic overtones and pretty taboo themes, which was probably designed for masochists....And I mean this in the best way possible.Pros+ Fun and rewarding combat+ The game is difficult, but also fair towards the player+ Nice cutesy but brutal art style+ Gameplay is random with its roguelike elements, making it very addictive+ A lot of different items and powerups to mess around with+ Multiple unlockable characters to suit multiple playstyles+ Plot has a ton of social commentary that will hopefully leave you thinking even after you stop playingCons- Can be glitchy at times- Difficulty curve can be very brutal for newcomersQuestionable? If you're a pretty religious person, you may be pretty offended by the game's style, plot, messages and humor, but you may be able to overlook these things.Overall, I would totally recommend this game to other people.

												A stream-lined rouge-like, filled with morbid imagery and religious overtones. Gratifying combat and a punishing yet fair system of bosses and enemies. The few glitches that it holds are more than made up or with a mind bending story, compelling social commentary and a wonderful community. Pros- Consistent, skill based combat       - A multitude of bosses and enemies       - Hundreds of items (Each with their own individual effects)       - Different characters supporting multiple playstyles       - Complex metagame to masterCons- Glitchy        - Learning curve like a brick wall        - Extremely punishing of mistakes and deaths        - Thick subtext (Overkill at time  [Having to literally kill yourself as a boss])A rewarding experience which captures the journey so perfectly, the destination is rendered irrelevent.

												The game is brilliant (and sooo addictive)! One of the best indie games ever. It is interesting, hard, it has exellent dark humor and atmosphere is epic. It is the game you should take with you to a Desert Island. First you will die a lot, but then (if you are curious enough and tenacious) you'll know tricks and secrets, learn every combination and manage to do crazy amazing stuff.  Music is great, very catchy and suitable, the graphics - cute and old-school.PS Mom! I love you mom, I still do :( I will go to the basement, I will meet my inner demons, fight them and win! And you will be proud, right? Or maybe I'll just play with some dead things (that you threw there), get parasites, decide that I am a cat and can fly and kill you, being one happy and absolutely crazy boy! XoXo Isaac			"

												What can I say about The Binding of Isaac. This is by far the best indie games of 2011 I have played. Old school NES Fans, you will not be disappointed. This game has a somewhat resemblance to The Legend of Zelda's dungeons. Even newer gamers will appreciate this addicting, simple yet complex Rogue-Shooter. Coming from the makers of Super Meat Boy, this is a sad comedic gore fest full of surprises. Note that You will die a lot at first but as you keep playing, there are a lot of things to unlock and discover. This game's price value is also a must get for your steam game collection. At 4,99€ you can't go wrong no matter what. Dungeons filled with disgusting and gory, yet funny and sad enemies, will leave you wanting more and more. I found myself a lot of times putting other games aside to go play this game. I will end this review short and simple.A little game with some really good working dark humor. It's very difficult but that's what makes it lasts for soo long. Very addictive game with a high replay rate.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is one of those few games I own in my library that despite its unforgiving difficulty and no saves, always keeps me coming back for more.One of the reasons for this is its gameplay. The gameplay is top down shooter brilliance. While there will be times that the game will pull a ♥♥♥♥ move on you, (it can be quite luck based at times) you won't be blaming your death on a bug of any description. Unless you're a sore loser, but that's your fault, not the game's.While the atmosphere may gross some very few sensitive souls amongst you, it has a reason for being that way and just enhances the (probably short) experiences throughout the game. If you've played Super Meat Boy, you'll feel right at home though, Edmund McMillen's the mastermind behind these two greats, and if you like his work, I also strongly recommend picking up the Basement Collection. Yes, I just recommended a game in another game's recommendation. (Recommendception!)The real reason why I love this game so damn much though, is its stellar replay value. Every single time you start a new game, (and you'll probably start many) everything will be randomized. Enemies, boss fights, of which many are very challenging, items and powerups (good luck getting them all eventually) and rooms (some there to just screw you up with a deadly enemy mix, others with some goodies in) are all always different. Even if you beat the game fully once, there will be more things to do every single time.Be warned though, that the DLC raises difficulty quite a bit. If you feel like you need to be eased into the game first slowly, you should play the vanilla first, and then activate the DLC. Besides that, the DLC adds tons of content and new fights and is most definitely recommended.It has amazing gameplay that keeps you coming back after getting roflstomped, great replay value, and a dirt cheap price. This game is a must in my opinion.			"

												After more than 700 hours I think it's finally time to review this game, since I think I have played a good amount to give my unbiased oppinino on The Binding of Isaac.First and foremost: Yes, I have played Rebirth. I think it was around my 500 hour mark when Rebirth was released and I was hyped like everyone else but my interest for Rebirth died down really fast and I continued playing Classic Isaac (for a more detailed review on why I prefer Classic Isaac over Rebirth, feel free to check my Review for Rebirth.)However, I absolutely love this game. I would even go so far and say that it's the absolute best game I have ever played and I started playing games when I had a SNES, so calling a game that was made in flash my favorite game of all time is a huge accomplishment.The skill cap in this game is something that is insanely good, games where you can feel that you get progressively better are very rare to come across, but the more you play it, the more you learn what which items do how you can get the most out of every single floor and of course dodging, the more you play it, the better you get at it.The cool thing is, that even after 700 hours you might not find any more secrets or anything like that, but the game never feels repetitive, since every run has a different layout of floors, the items you find are different, the bosses you find are different and the drops you find, as well.Also what this game has over Rebirth, in my opinion, is the limited amount of Items.Sure, there are people who say that at some point u just get specific items and just restart a run to the point where you get an item that is useful, so you limit yourself to a certain amount of items. But that's all up to oneself. You can either restart all time until you get your desired item, but you can also start off with a really bad item and get god-tier items along the way. The way how you play a run with a bad item and how you eventually make it work is all up to your skill at the long run.What I was trying to say is, there are less items in Classic Isaac than in Rebirth, so ultimately you have more control and it is more likely that you get an item that you actually like. As I said, some might see that as a negative, since you limit yourself to certain items, but if I play 20+ runs and only get 1 run where I get 1 item that I like, that's no fun to me.All in all The Binding of Isaac is my favorite game of all time, I would even say the benchmark for all Rogue-like games.(Eternal Edition) As far as the eternal edition go (which is an update for Isaac that was released a couple of days ago) I totally enjoy this update. It adds a Hard Mode to the gae, so for people who have played this game for 700+ hours and don't wanna switch over to Rebirth, this is a great addition, because the name ""Hard Mode"" is exactly what it says.There are ""eternal forms"" of regular mobs and bosses who are way tougher to beat. They have more hit points and different attacks. Another thing that they fixed, which they also added for the regular version, is the time you freeze whenever you pick up an item, trinket, pill, tarot- or playing card. The frame in which you freeze and can't move has been reduced which makes it easier for you to dodge enemies.Once the bugs have been ironed out (there is currently a bug where you can't get out of a room when you fight the eternal form of ""Loki"" this update will be even more awesome than it already is.As I said, if you love Rogue-likes, chances are that you already have this game, but if not, you should definitely give this game a try.I already have 700+ hours in this game and I plan to invest more hours in the future. This game never gets old.			"

""Yay cancer!"" - just Binding of Isaac quotesThe Binding of Isaac is a Flash-based roguelike dungeon crawler reminiscent of early Legend of Zelda games developed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl. Inspired heavily from the Biblical story, the game follows Isaac (and a variety of unlockable characters) escaping from his Christian fundamentalist Mother, to whom a voice of God commands to sacrifice Isaac.* GameplayAfter escaping from his Mother’s wrath, Isaac finds himself in a basement filled with monsters. Each floor contains a set amount of rooms culminating with a boss fight that must be cleared in order to advance to the next floor. Along the way Isaac can collect pennies (nickels and dimes as variants) to spend in a Shop or an Arcade, bombs to blow up obstacles or enemies and keys to unlock chests and Treasure rooms. The items found in Treasure rooms, after completing a boss fight and other ways are the core to improving Isaac’s tears (bullets) and fighting abilities. For example, an item can make tears homing, poisonous, increase damage and so on. My favourite is the Ipecac item, which makes your tears explosive and always poisonous. If requirements are fulfilled, Isaac can after a boss fight trade his heart containers to the Devil in exchange for powerful items, or alternatively, avoid taking deals with the Devil to acquire a chance for an Offering from an Angel (Wrath of the Lamb DLC required) which can be useful as well.  The game at first seems very difficult, but as it is completed more and more times, new items, characters, alternate bosses and floors can be unlocked, ensuring there will always be a reason to explore. The game also features many references to McMillen’s other games, such as Super Meat Boy and Time ♥♥♥♥, as well as popular games such as Super Mario, Legend of Zelda and others.* Expansions and the communityWhile the base game is fairly extensive, I heavily recommend obtaining Wrath of the Lamb DLC, which adds 98 new items, a new character, new floors and many other content that improve the experience. Owning said DLC is a prerequisite for the Eternal Update, a free addon developed by Florian Himsl that adds Hard mode, which offers a brutal experience for those feeling the base game was too easy. The Binding of Isaac is very popular and well known, as a result from famous Youtube Let’s Players such as Northernlion and Bisnap. Their unique ways of playing the game have inspired many more to try the game themselves.* Closing commentsThe Binding of Isaac is a very charming (although rather macabre as well) game which is a must have for anyone interested in roguelikes. It can be obtained for 99 cents from Humble Bundles or Steam sales, DLC and awesome soundtrack included. A worthwhile play even after the release of Rebirth.			"

I've played 13 Hours and those games are not even nearly my type of Game.+ You can pick it up whenever you want. You wanna kill 5minutes? Go ahead+ Addictive. You wanna get deeper and deeper into the Dungeon. + The Game even runs on a Potato. Like legit, you can pick it up even on a Toaster.+ you will unlock different characters with specific statistics and abilities. So every run depends on YOU and your Decisions.+/- The deeper you go into the Dungeon, the harder it gets. If you rage pretty fast, don't pick it up!- NONE*RECOMMENDED*			"

												Got this game on summer sales 2015.Played it recently.All I can say is I'm hooked and it's very challenging but it's fun.At first it'll be hard for everyone but once you fully grasp the controls, you'll be fine.Vs Mom is hard but Vs Isaac is harder. Trust me when you get there, it'll be hard unless you've got very powerful upgrades to your character.Also what's nice about this game is you'll never play the same level twice cause everytime you play it'll be different. What I slightly dislike is why does my tears only shoot 4 direction, I want to it shoot where I'm clicking but I guess that is why its hard and challenging I fully recommend this game to everyone simply because it's fun, addictive and challenging.9.9/10			"

												Now, I'm not a fan of these kind of games, but....but...The Binding of Isaac is a game that sticks to you, the game you will play for many days, the game that will invoke frustration mixed with delight, the game that will change your perception on the gaming itself. This is a hard game to play, but it's worth every second of your time. Don't be a stranger - buy it, play it, and after you spend couple of hours playing it, start kicking your head against the wall.

												Where do I start? This game is extremely frustrating to get the hang of. Unless you are a god, you probably can't beat it the first time you play. It took me 42 attempts to beat all six floors and Mom for the first time. I guarantee you will lose your temper at this game at some point. And you might have to do a bit of research on the Wiki or experimenting in-game to find out what every single trinket, activated item, passives and tarot card does and which ones are good or bad for every unlockable character. You might have to take your chances with the pills, as each type is randomly paired with an ability during each run.HOWEVER!The Binding of Isaac is not, and I repeat, NOT, a bad game. As much as it is frustrating, it is really addictive. I thoroughly recommend this to fans of dungeon-styled and bullet hell games. Despite Isaac's innocent look (which he kinda is...look at those big crying eyes!), the style of enemies, rooms and pickups can be incredibly morbid and disturbing. The cries of Mulligans and the appearance of Hives are incredibly distressing, adding to the games overall atmosphere. Nonetheless this really adds charm to the game as a whole. Bear in mind this is coming from the creators of Super Meat Boy, so expect some blood along the way. But what's fun is you never know what to expect. All of the dungeon floor layouts are randomly generated everytime you start a game and aside from Mom being the last boss in the Depths, you never know what boss you will get upon entering its room. There are set bosses for every floor type and the game will randomly select one of these for you to battle. There is a sense of mystery about this game, mainly regarding the bosses, items you can find and what each pill does in every run.Now stop reading this and go buy The Binding of Isaac!!			"

												     Given the upcoming release of Binding of Issac: Rebirth, I have decided to update my review of The Binding of Issac + The Wrath of Lamb. Having doubled my playtime in the past couple of weeks i have come to the conclusion that my initial response to the game was premature.     For those unfamiliar with Issac, the game is a Rougelike Dual Analogue Shooter. this means you controll Issac (or one of his unlocakble alternates) who fights randomly spawned monsters in a procedurely generated dungeon using his own tears as bullets. Issac is heavially inspired by retro titles, especially the original Legend of Zelda, as can be seen in the way each room is a seperate yet in many ways similar mirror of each other with some room s designated as treasure or boss rooms, and the heart based life meter.     The presentation of Issac is that of a Newgrounds flash game on steriods. To be fair that description is fairly apt. the game is built on the flash engine and if it hadn't had the time, creativity, and vision applied to it that is what it would likely have ended up as. That flash comment is not meant in the derrogative though, the game looks and sounds beautiful (Mostly thanks to Danny Baranowsky). Because it sticks to the limitations of the engine rather than attempt more realistic graphics the game looks perfect for what it is.     Gameplay is where Issac truly shines. The controls are simple and tight, keeping the already difficult gameplay from becoming frustrating. The best part of the gameplay though is the items. The randomly generated items ensure that no two runs are the same. These items are most awesome when they work together (Protip-Polyphimus+Technology =Awesome.). The enemies have unique attack and movement patterns that are easy to learn but will always be able to throw you for a loop.     The only problem I have with the game is the same as it was before. The random nature of the item drops and boss spawns can make some playthroughs almost instant throwaways. This is aliviated by the sortness of the game and the rapidity of the respawn but if a few games in a row with a bad start and even I get frustrated. 8/10. Worthy of a checkout before Rebirth comes out.			"

In short, is the game good?Yes, yes and triple yes.Is it worth my time and money?Yes. Considering how cheap The Binding of Isaac + Wrath of The Lamb is, there really isn't an excuse *not to buy it*. You will most definitely sink a lot of time into the game and you will have fun.Is this game for anyone?Considering the quasi-random nature of the gameplay, some of the runs you will do will be a walk in the park, while others may be pure nightmare. If you do not enjoy dying and losing progress over and over, this game may not be for you. If that isn't the case, go for it.Linear, open-world or something else?Something else. No two runs will ever be the same. The room layout, boss encounters, items you will get and overall difficulty are mainly dictated at random. While the set pieces themselves do not change properties that much (maybe aside meeting stronger, ""champion"" versions of monsters), the way it's all set up makes every run a fresh, new experience.Gameplay mechanics, gimmicks?You run around rooms in a 2D top-down view. You collect items that change the way your character behaves (make you faster, slower, stronger, shoot more, shoot faster, etc.). Items aren't really a necessity but without them the run may be near-impossible to do (considering the later levels where enemies deal twice as much damage and bosses have a really high level of health).Graphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?The game has a very dark and cartoony look, in some places even grotesque. Vibrant colours and simplified forms meet with dark and horror-like rooms filled with hideous monsters that look like something out of Lovecraft's or Kafka's work. All of it feels well put together and it shows that a lot of thought was put into the overall design.Audio design and soundtrack?Excellent choices in sound effects as well as in the music soundtrack. Church-like ambiency clashing with hard guitar riffs and sounds of all kinds of hideous monsters go well together, creating an dark atmosphere that is immersive and enjoyable.Plot, story?Quite unique. The top layer of the story is simple, referring to real world topics such as fundamentalism, parenting and escapism. For those brave enough to take up the challenge, the game rewards the player with a deeper meaning to the story and a bit clearer undestanding what is really going on.How does the game run?I have played and ""finished"" (that is, got the last ending, since the game never really ends) the game on my 5 year old PC (Dual Core 2.66GHz, 2GB RAM, nVidia GeForce 9600GT) and it ran without much problems in fullscreen mode and on the ""Auto"" settings. There were instances where I was experiencing severe framerate issues due to the way the game was programmed (Flash has terrible issues when drawing lots of stuff at once, since it's all vector-based). This was happening in more ""crowded"" rooms such as bullet hell-esque boss fights. Changing the settings to ""Low"" eliminated the problem for me completely. So, if you have a similar PC to mine, just set the game to Low or Medium and it should be fine in fullscreen mode. If you have a newer machine, expect way better results.Any details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?Yes, the D6 dice. Brings a completely new meta-game into your runs and adds a layer of careful planning.Anything you didn't like?Yes. First of all, Flash. The game could run way better if it wasn't using Flash as a rendering engine. Then again, The Binding of Isaac was meant to be a side-project so it's understandable that the creators didn't have the time and/or resources to write a fully functional, brand new, custom engine from the ground up. Although that will probably change since The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is set to come out not too far from now. Second, no controller support. While that's not a dealbreaker, it could've been easily patched in. Instead we see a ""recomendation"", in the options menu, to use Joy2Key. That's not a very professional way of doing things. On the other-hand, the game can be played without problems using a keyboard, so it's not a terribly big issue. Finally, lack of item descriptions. I understand that there's an element of learning when picking up items but a short description of what item does what would be nice. Instead, new players (along with myself) had to use the wiki to check if they want to really pick up this or that item.Final score?I give The Binding of Isaac (+The Wrath of The Lamb) a Mom's Knife out of 5.

												Definitely a must-have for any Steam member. I will admit I didn't enjoy the game at first, but over time it grew on me and I soon realized the charm and brilliance of it. Edmund McMillen did great on this revival of the dying genre of Rogue-like games, and added his own element of unique and fascinating artwork, similar to his previous title, Super Meat Boy. Overall, this game is great, because it brings together so many great elements for a game to have into one wholesome title, making it enjoyable for everyone except those who don't take time to see the beauty of a game.

Maybe it's just for me.*No GamePad support. Yes, I tried JoyToKey, and it doesn't work well.Those are all technical issues that I hope will be solved in Rebirth.NOW - the good stuff.Has so much to explore.Gameplay is amazingly fun. DLC adds a lot off good stuff.RANDOM! You never know what's next.I don't have much to say so just, PLAY IT.			"

												Few games can truly claim to walk the fine line between fun and frustration as much as The Binding of Isaac, another hellishly difficult title from Edmund McMillen: the man behind Super Meat Boy. It’s a title that delights in pushing players to the point where they want to start taking swings at their computer before attempting another round guiding its titular tyke through a series of nightmarish and randomized dungeons.A brief animated intro sets up the threadbare plot: Isaac is a young boy living a happy life at home with his mom until she starts hearing the voice of God and hiding him from the evils of the world. It isn’t long until Isaac is permanently locked in his room and awaiting execution at the hands of his mother at the almighty’s behest. Escaping into the basement, Isaac begins his bizarre journey.The Binding of Isaac somehow manages to be disturbing as it is endearing with its balance of gruesome monsters and matching setting with its adorable, wide-eyed sprites. Dungeons are splashed in every foul bodily fluid imaginable—blood, guts, tears, urine, and even an uncomfortable amount of feces. Imagine Hellraiser filmed through the lens of a Saturday morning cartoon for kids. The bestiary is equally grotesque. Armies of maggots and flies are frequent foes, and headless children spewing fountains of blood from their necks are a common sight.Bosses take things a distasteful step forward: fetuses, conjoined twins, fat slugs urinating on the floor, and even Isaac’s mother are just a few of the end-level bosses that need to be dealt with. Keep in mind that the protagonist is also a perpetually-naked boy using his tears as projectiles. The Binding of Isaac is a pretty sick game with aesthetics that would appeal to one’s inner horror fan and Splatterhouse enthusiast. It isn’t going to be to everyone’s tastes, but those that enjoyed Super Meat Boy are probably going to find themselves like McMillen’s perverted sense of style.Since the dungeons are randomized, there’s no telling what you’re going to find whether it be a useful power-up or more monsters. This makes memorization of each level impossible and keeps the experience fresh every time. On the downside, this means success depends on good luck and players will often lose because they were dealt a bad hand. Every time Isaac dies, players wind up right back at the start of the game and even the most patient of individuals will become infuriated by such a design choice. After putting in so much effort and acquiring a myriad of useful abilities, it feels way too harsh.The randomness extends to the power-ups themselves, as there are well over a hundred of them and they don’t always have the expected effect. Some even hurt Isaac and if used in a tight spot are going to guarantee death. At the very least, they can be used in conjunction with other power ups and there’s not much of a limit on how many of them can be used at the same time. Still, there’s nothing worse than getting bad power-ups and items with no end in sight. At that point, it’s probably best to just quit and start again.There’s even some replayability to the title with extra characters that can be unlocked and a bit of exploring to see if there’s anything particularly useful in a given dungeon. The Binding of Isaac is a purposefully short title designed to be played many times over, not just due to its unforgiving nature, that will yield a surprise here and there when players think they’re seen everything. Its ability to keep you guessing is its greatest strength and weakness as it violently seesaws between an enjoyable 2D romp and unbridled frustration.The Binding of Isaac is not for those that are easily deterred, and it’s a safe bet that any Super Meat Boy fans are going to sink their teeth into it. For such a small title, there’s a lot of content packed into it and it’s an experience that isn’t always the same from one playthrough to the next. Players will question whether it was their own skill that carried them through to the end or if it was sheer luck, but regardless of the difficulty it’s an approachable game with a unique charm that boils blood just as easily as it encourages laughter at Isaac’s cartoonish spectacle of childhood trauma.A Must Play "

												Strange is a good word to describe the game overall but that's in the best sense of the word. A lot of fun if you like it's mixture of zelda like labyrinth layouts, SHMUP gameplay plus roguelike elements not to mention the interesting if macabre art direction.The myriad of combinations possible with all the different items you can find in each playthrough really make the game incredibly replayable and a blast to go through each playthrough trying to find new and better builds with Isaac and the other alternate characters that have various strengths and weaknesses relative to the eponymous hero.

												The Binding Of Isaac is an flash indie game developed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl. The game’s storyline and name are both a reference to the Biblical story known also as Binding of Isaac. In the game, the player controls Isaac, a child that seeks safety in the basement after his mother is given a message of God commanding her to sacrifice her own son in order to proof her faith. In the basement Isaac starts going through dungeons located in the basement having to face his nightmares in form of monsters, in order to escape.    The style and game’s gameplay are inspired by Legend of Zelda series and similar to roguelike, where the rooms of all dungeons are randomly generated, being different each time you play, and this is what makes it so special because every gameplay is totally different. On each floor of the basement, the player must kill monsters in order to proceed to the next room. Along the way, it will be possible to collect keys weapons and power-ups which will increase your chance of surviving because each item has a special effect and you can also pick up coins which are used to buy items in shops spread all over each floor, but need a key to be opened.Each floor of the dungeon ends with a boss room, where a boss must be defeated in order to proceed to the next floor. Each time the bosses are different. At loading screens between floors, Isaac remembers scenarios, of his childhood while crying in fetal position, from rejection of his mother, unlucky moments and even bullying from his friends, some can even be Isaac’s own fears, but you’ll never know.The gameplay is easy to master since does not require very buttons and the soundtrack is not diverse, but it does fit very well the atmosphere of the game.One of the most awesome features of this game, in my opinion, and because due to flash limitation, it’s not possible to save, all your unlockables will stay unlocked and such, but you cannot save mid-game, so you will have to start over every time you go back to main menu, every time you lose and every time you close the game. And that is what makes it so hard and enjoyable since you will not get bored because every time all will be different and new!A DLC to the game was also released, “Wrath of the Lambs”, also a religious reference, and it adds all new content including new items, new rooms, new enemies, new bosses and its totally worth it!     This game has me craving for more every time I play it, the creativity of it is amazing and it will make you spend some good long hours playing it. I totally recommend you to get it.   ~ 9/10  P.s: Brace yourselfes, the remake is here!			"

												Only Steam would allow a game where you play as a naked cartoon child who must drown their enemies in a torrent of upgradeable tears, working your way through a questionably large basement until you can face and take down your disturbed Christian mother who seeks to purify you with her foot. And for that I love them, and the creators of said game.Just ... one more playthrough, and then I'll get back to work.			"

You need to know what are they function, to use them effectively and in the right moment.The game is 100% replayable because is never the same on every playthrough, all is randomly generated:-rooms (including enemies, environments, and items to pick), -Boss stages.-Locations of special rooms (which leaves items and others to buy).good sountrack on special partsIt can take plenty of hours to complete :-Fill the vast item collection.-Find the""secrets"".-Unlock all the playable characters (all theirs with unique abylities)-Achieve all endings.

												I have no problem whatsoever understanding why people love this game, but unfortunately, I'm not a particular fan of arcade shooters, rogue-like elements OR permadeath, so I was never going to be its greatest champion. The most I've managed so far is killing one boss and thereby progressing to a second level, and I'm just not ""hardcore"" enough to get much past that, I'm afraid.   So sure, I'm a big cry-baby who needs wimpy things like save-points to find a game truly worthwhile. But if you don't have any such failings, and don't mind an aesthetic as fresh and unique as the gameplay is retro and familiar, then you may well be one of the millions of people who swear by the genius of this product. I'm certainly a fan of Mr McMillen's sensibilities, even if I don't share his skillz in gaming.   A word to the wise, though: apparently subsequent, slightly retitled re-releases of this game are more technically finessed, and the consensus seems to be that this ISN'T the version to buy. So you might want to look into that before forking over your hard-earned dosh (mind you, if you just wanted to give it a quick test to see if it's ""you"", this version on sale may well be the ticket).   Normally I would only recommend a game like this to sickos and weirdos like my good self, but its epic sales figures suggest that the gaming world is comprised of nothing but. Who WOULDN'T love a game about a bawling baby who shoots tear-drops at bleeding-eyed monstrosities while dodging around small mountains of poop surrounded by flies? The world truly is a sad and beautiful place...Verdict: 8/10.			"

Nice art style, well-fitting soundtrack, addictive gameplay, very high replayability and surprisely deep and dark story of life and fears of Isaac makes you play it over and over again.

												The Binding of Isaac follows the bible story of the same name, as you play Isaac, a scared young lad escaping the religious tenacity of his mother. Binding of Isaac is one of my favourite games on Steam. It has huge, huge playability. If you get it, make sure you get the super-cheap DLC too, which essentially doubles the content of the game. It took me 100 hours to fully complete the game (Golden God) and even then I was missing one of the ""hard"" achievements.With the implementation of the DLC, there's tonnes of new content, bosses, items and trinkets to explore and discover. Amazing game for a super, super cheap price. So worth it. The humour is very dark and can be ""gross"", so if you're a little squeemish, you may wish to avoid!-Nilesy			"

												The Binding Of Isaac is a simple but fun indie game.You play as a young boy named Isaac who is forced to face the evil beings of his basement and further on. There are several stages, but to continue each floor, you have to beat a boss. The dungeons and rooms are randomly generated, so that each time you play everything is different. The creator did an amzing job with this point.There are several characters to unlock, by completing challenging objectives to play as them.Lots of items inhabit the dungeons going from a rail from pointless to very helpfull.This game is amazing without the dlc, with so much contect and area to explore each time you play.Few rooms contain slot machines, a devil, and many more.I find this game amazing for its price and would pick it up any day. An absolute well done to the team who made the game.I rate this game 9/10.			"

												At first glance, this game may seem simple; however, it's anything but.You start off with simple levels and enemies, collecting items that will help (or sometimes harm) you, getting you ready to fight progressively tougher enemies. Each time you go to the next level, you are met with different enemies, and all new opportunities to get items. And just when you think you've beat the game...you haven't. I'll let you figure out what that means. The items, enemies, rooms, and level layouts are completely random, so you will likely never have the same exact experience in this game twice. Unlocking new characters adds to the experience, as each one has its own benefits and setbacks, making the game easier in some ways and harder in others. Because of the overwhelming amount of items and enemies, I'd always recommend playing with the wiki for the game open, just so that you never make a bad decision when it comes to picking up items. Still, some things in this game come with a learning curve and you'll just have to find out what items you like to use and which ones will make you rage.It'll be frustrating at first, but once you unlock more items and beat your own personal records, you'll be addicted. Buying the Wrath of the Lamb DLC makes the game even tougher (so I suggest buying it after you have a good feel for the base game), but adds loads of new content, including enemies, items, levels, and more.Honestly, I'd recommend this game to anyone I knew, even with all of the dark humor and blasphemous jokes. When you look past all of that, it's a great game with excellent replay value.			"

												NOTE: This review is just to inform people who plan on buying this game now. TL;DR is: Dont buy it. This game is out of date by now, and worse yet its just too big for flash to handle. The game has moved over to Afterbirth, Which is the far smoother running, more expansive and currently supported replacement. If you were looking to get this instead, I recommend you don't because it most likely will run like crap.EDIT: Since it's evidentally not clear in my review, Afterbirth is not a sequal... it's an addon to the remake (rebirth) using something other than flash. Since flash couldn't handle the original. You will still get all the same story elements by playing afterbirth.  Afterbirth of course includes Rebirth which is the base game.			"

Chock full of references to his other games such as Super Meat Boy, Gish, hell even his game titled *C*u*n*t* is referenced! Now let's move onto the replay value. At the time of writing this I have nearly 150 hours. Don't be surprised if you see 500 or something when you read this. Don't go into this game blind. Go watch youtube videos, streamers, etc. This game is extremely tough too, so if you want to buy the DLC with it I HIGHLY recommend beating the game a few times before you buy it. This game is just a true masterpiece with a ton of awesome bugs that makes it beautiful. The Binding of Isaac is possibly my favorite game of all time on Steam. That is all :)Edit: Some grammatical corrections, and eternal update was released, play without eternal first if you're a noob. Just scroll down in your library and then uncheck eternal edition and you should be set. That is all.			"

												The binding of isaac is one of those games that generate a huge WTF sensation when you first start playing it. You start off as Isaac, a kid whose christian mom decides to sacrifice to Jesus because of reasons, so you run off to your basement to avoid the imminent slaughter. However you soon find out that it is not safe there either, and pave your way to salvation by shooting random monsters with your tears as you progress through the basement's labyrinthine array of rooms. Several power-ups and mom's items (and pills) help you in this battle, while you unlock more of them as well as several other characters with different abilities as you progress in the game. Of course,  you have no idea what each item does when you pick it up and I personally found fun in discovering different items along the way. The binding of Isaac's unique dark humor and artwork have made it instantly recognisable and strangely lovable among other titles of its genre. However it is a difficult and unforgiving game that will send you to your death time an time again.+ Twisted -wtf- humor+ Loads of randomly generated items+ Cool soundtrack+ Great artwork- Can be really hard, especially with the wrath of lamb DLC "

												Time to write a serious review (pfft serious) now that Valve added this review thing. Kay.So, I've always been the kind to really despise games where you win based off of luck and luck alone. And yet, this game does rely on luck, but not to the point where it's all you'll win based off of. A bit of skill is involved, in dodging shots and movement, knowing when to pick items, and when to ditch them. The game play is always randomized, so you never know what you're going to get unless you're using a seed in Spidermod. Anyhow, I'm gonna split this review into two main parts, and then extra things. Plot, gameplay, and then anything extra I'd like to add.Plot: The plot of this game is simple, yet it makes enough sense to be a plot. To keep it short, some little kid named Isaac's mother hears the voice of god, saying how corrupt with sin Isaac is, and eventually God tells his mother to kill Isaac in sacrifice. Simple, but pretty messed up. And in escape, Isaac jumps into the basement, unknowing of what's below. Overall, it's a plot, it makes sense, and it ties into the game. Yeah. I personally like how simple the plot is. Just my opinion.Gameplay: Now, for the gameplay, you're thrown into a randomly generated dungeon, and it plays top-down, similar to the Legend of Zelda for NES. You're armed with nothing more than your own tears at first, and have to cry your enemies to death. The controls are explained to you in the first room, with no tutorial, and you're off. Following the doors, you might find some room with a crown on it, known as a treasure room. You can gain items to become more powerful. For example, you might get more firerate on your tears, some laser you can fire instead of tears, you might upgrade your damage, or even your HP. Speaking of HP, when you first play, Isaac will start out with three hearts. On hit, your health goes down, obviously. Red hearts replenish health. However, you can earn blue hearts, and these blue hearts can go ABOVE your max health. However, once you lose them, these soul hearts, they're gone. Anyhow, throughout more exploration, you might find a dark, ominous-looking door. This is the boss room, where you fight the boss of the floor, and after it's defeated, you move on to the next floor. However, if you die, it's back to the beginning with you. A very true rogue-like game. I'll leave the rest for you to figure out, granted you purchase this game.Anything extra: The soundtrack. Nothing much more to say than it's amazing. Yeah. Also, this game is NOT for the weak of stomach, for there is a LOT of blood/gore.Final remarks: Overall, The Binding of Isaac is a VERY fun, and enjoyable game. Death happens a ton, and you're going to get used to it. The gameplay's fun, yet challenging, the plot's very...odd, but still good, and the soundtrack is just amazing.9.5/10. "

												The Binding of Isaac is a great game. It is very replayable and addictive, and the random elements make every run a little bit different. Wrath of the Lamb only expands on this, and makes the game even better than it was before. I would give it a positive rating...If not for Flash.Flash ruins this game. The performance is about as stable and reliable as a one-legged mountain goat, and the game is rife with bugs. The only graphical settings are the nondescript ""Low, Medium, High"", and the game is locked to a certain resolution. There is no controller support, and your progress gets wiped if you clear Flash memory. If you want to play Isaac, just wait for Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a remake that not only gets rid of Flash but also expands on the game.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is the quintessential roguelike dungeon-crawling shooter. The player will take control of Isaac, a crying naked young boy trying to escape the basement of his home. Isaacs mother, instructed by god to take his life as a test of faith, is the final boss in the game. Each level is a unique randomly generated dungeon, with 6 to 10 rooms and a boss fight. There are six playable characters that can be unlocked, and more than a hundred different items to discover and use during each random adventure. The gameplay is simple, consisting of dodging enemies attacks and firing Isaacs tears and dropping bombs as a means of offense. The game has a dark sort of humor about it, with each stage seeming to become more and more dangerous and depressing for little Isaac. The gameplay is solid, though the story is quite simple. There are no NPC's, no quests, and no real RPG-like qualities. It is a simple and entertaining romp with a high degree of difficulty, that requires a fair ammount of luck. Created by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl, The Binding of Isaac is beloved amongst fans of indie games and dungeon crawlers because of its pick-up-and-play nature and simple setup. For casual players, the game will find a place as a quick and easy shoot-em-up that passes time. Hardcore completionists will have plenty to work for, with a collection system that tracks every item the player has found and many varying and difficult achievements and characters to unlock. The game is single player only, and derives much of its value from the procedurally-generated levels and humorous yet difficult gameplay. If you'd like to see some gameplay, check out AGNBs Let's Play series. PROS: Easy to learn, fun to play, lots to discoverCONS: Very difficult, inherently repetitiveGRAPHICS: 3/5 - Originally a flash game, and it shows.SOUND: 5/5 - Perfectly fitting soundtrack and SFX.STORY: 3/5 - Not a lot in the story department, but not much is needed.GAMEPLAY: 5/5 - Highly addicting ""just one more try"" style gameplay.REPLAY VALUE: 5/5 - I find myself returning to it again and again. Great to play while drunk.OVERALL SCORE: 84/100 - A classic indie piece, well worth the $5. Even better if it's on sale.For more reviews by mowse, check out the mowse talks games Steam Community!

												After little hours that i spend playing this game, i want to review The Binding Of IsaacStory:This is The Binding Of Isaac, where you play as boy who his name is Isaac and  he lives with his religiously Mother.One day his Mother received an order from God to kill Isaac where you gonna see it at the opening of the game. When his mother received the order from God, Isaac was locked out in his room, and Isaac sees her already preparing knife to kill Isaac. His mother kicked the Isaac door room. Isaac dont know what to do and underneath his carpet theres like a cave full of evil things where Isaac gonna escape from his mother, this is where the adventure starts. Gameplay:At first when i play, suddenly i get used to it (yeah because it was easy..). Im so addicted to this gane, even if im always losing, i just want to finish it again and again. After you defeat the boss, you get into the different cave and gonna defeat all the boss again, until you reach the main boss fight. To makes thing easy this game gives you like ability, unique items and power-ups! And make your own Isaac looks weird AF. Well i dont know what to say anymore, its just very good and addicting!Dont hesitate if you're buying this game or not, just buy it people! And its actually cheap for me especially when this game on sale, i got this when there's Hallowen Sale last year. It is worth it...			"

												Brutally good game, and I think the most difficult games. The game has a wide variety of laberints,opponents, gifts.When Isaac’s mother starts hearing the voice of God demanding a sacrifice be made to prove her faith, Isaac escapes into the basement facing droves of deranged enemies, lost brothers and sisters, his fears, and eventually his mother. The Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated action RPG shooter with heavy Rogue-like elements. Following Isaac on his journey players will find bizarre treasures that change Isaac’s form giving him super human abilities and enabling him to fight off droves of mysterious creatures, discover secrets and fight his way to safety. 8/10			"

												Use your tears to kill your mother and her heart, an unborn fetus version of yourself, and dead babies because apparently they are not dead enough already. You can't fool some of these dead babies when you kill them with tears, lasers, and 13th century explosives because they were not born yesterday. After you kill your mother, you can fight Satan or better yet kill yourself AND an undead version of yourself inside of a toy chest! You will spend hours searching inside poop to find pennies! Would definitely recommend to anyone that is not a Jew or a Christian fundamentalist, although Jews may find collecting pennies enjoyable.			"

												This game is so utterly addictive. I don't know what it is, but the procedural generation of dungeons and items so different from each other that they actually change the gameplay is what makes this game unique.Brought to you by the creators of Super Meat Boy and a personal favorite Aether (check it out if you don't know it), this game is an arcade-like dungeon-exploring with progression based on repetition. Some may hate the fact that you need to kill the first boss about eight times to unlock the second boss, and you need to kill the second main boss some times to unlock the third boss, and so on.Personally I don't mind that sort of thing, specially due to the random factor that affects the items you get. A lot is based on LUCK, since there are items that are far above others in quality and power, but overall the game is very balanced and you can get a kick out of it no matter the hand you are dealt.System of achievements, items and challenges is what marks the progression of this game, besides the number of times you defeated the bosses. Each challenge is unique and sets you with a made up combo of items (or no item at all), and it is a great thing to have for end-game players.Overall, this game is one of my favorites of all time, and I couldn't be more excited for the release of the reboot, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. DEFINETELLY worth to check it out, and you are garanteed your money's worth.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a game about a young child, whose devout christian mother tries to kill him. He escapes into the basement through a trapdoor, and then must navigate through the dungeon that is the Basement. It is a 2D Top-down dungeon crawler, where you can play one of several characters. You start out in Isaac's Mothers Basement working your way throughout. The game is strange, but funny and interesting. It feels a lot like The original Legend of Zelda, though most dungeon crawlers do, and it also features co-op play so you can play with friends. I recommend this game if you enjoy adventuring through dungeons! The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is also a fun play if you want to try other games in the series.			"

												This game is basically a masterpiece and a major success in the realm of randomly-generated games.  I found it quite fun to follow the storyline, and am honestly beginning to wonder who Isaac's dad was, and how he plays into the game. :oPros:- smooth, increasingly simple gameplay- AWESOME soundtrack (Cheers to Danny Baronowsky)- A near infinite variety of how the game could play out- Bosses that actually increase in difficulty and pose quite the challenge (unlike some of today's more modern games)- a challenge in terms of preparing and strategizing, depending on the items you have- There are a few references to other games within it.  (SMB, The Legend of Zelda, for instance)Cons:- It can get quite laggy if there are a lot of things happening at once- It's hard to talk to people while you're in-game, as the fullscreen feature doesn't allow the shift-tab combo to access the community, so you'd have to have it windowed most of the time if you want to talk to peopleThat's all. :3  I DEFINITELY recommend this game. :D			"

												Fantastic new school version of old school games like Zelda 1 mixed with Smash TV. The gameplay is pretty simple. a 3/4ths top down shooter that allows you to shoot in 4 directions. There are also alternate power ups and bombs to use. Really simple controls like Smash TV mixed with Zelda. You are Isaac, stuck in a multi leveled dungeon. Each one of these dungeon levels is in the old Zelda 1 style where each room is 1 screen. The dungeons / basements are randomized, every room and enemy combination is randomly generating. The gameplay is fun and addictive. The only downside is no lives, no continues. There are tons of quirky weapons, enemies, power ups and bosses. Everyone should spend the $5 to play this game.I can understand if its not for everyone, because it is an arcadey retro Zelda 1 meets Smash TV sort of game. The graphics are cute and charming, but portray horrifying things like if you were to ever see a doodle of a fetus or a doodle of someone coughing out flies and poop staining the floor. Like a sad disparagingly sort of awesome. You play as Issac who basically has to get out of randomized Zelda style dungeons. There are dozens of unique enemies with different attack styles. Few enemies seem to have predictable patterns. There are also plenty of boss battles.The controls take some getting used to, but they are basically Smash TV controls. You use your directional pad, then you use an attack direction. So you can move right and shoot left or up, or down or right. You have a bomb button, a special findable item and an auxiliary power up button for things like pills. The main attack are bullets... which are really tears. Bombs sit, but you can push them, pills do good and bad things. Some items / power ups give you dolls for extra weapons, or a dead cat gives you 9 lives but the catch is you have 1 heart energy per life. You can also get metal hearts, that count as energy, but once they're gone you can't get them back like normal heart healths.You play through 'basement' floor after floor marked with a boss at the end. You find keys, bomb walls, kill enemies, gamble, visit stores, danger rooms and so on. Just like Zelda 1. The only thing is that it is all randomized. The room layouts are randomized, the rooms themselves are randomized, the stores, the weapons, the items.It is all randomized, so you'll never play the same game twice. This isn't a story based game, so it won't appeal to everyone. Its highly entertaining especially in short bursts of play. For that price, you can't miss this game.I highly recommend the game for its gameplay, cheap price and its never the same game twice with the random dungeons.			"

												English:After 108 hours I finally 100% completed The Binding of Isaac + Wrath of the Lamb expansion (all 84 achievements).The amount of hours you can put into it until you don't have nothing else to do is simply incredible given the price you can pay for the pack with the game and expansion (0.99 on a sale).If you never played the game before expect to finish it completely in 150-200+ hours (depending on your skill in this kind of game).For new players the game will probably be kinda difficult and even more with the expansion content so i would recommend playing without it installed (under DLC tab in game properties) at least until you have unlocked It Lives or beaten Sheol once.After that you'll be able to handle most of the new enemies and bosses, and you will appreciate the addition of trinkets and new items.There are several drawbacks with the expansion. Mostly glitches that it introduces such as enemies glitching through some corners, not properly working Brimstone controls, etc. but with all the new game elements you can easily forget about this.PS. Gorgeous soundtrack if you don't know it yet.Español:Despues de 108 horas al fin he completado al 100% The Binding of Isaac + la expansion Wrath of the Lamb (los 84 logros).La cantidad de horas que puedes echarle hasta que no tienes nada mas que hacer es simplemente increible dado el precio por el que puedes comprar el pack con el juego y la expansion (0.99 rebajado).Si nunca has jugado al juego puedes esperar acabarlo completamente en mas de 150-200 horas (dependiendo de tu habilidad en este tipo de juego).A los nuevos jugadores probablemente les resulte dificil y mas aun con el contenido de la expansion, asi que recomendaria jugar sin ella instalada (en la pestaña DLC de las propiedades del juego) al menos hasta que hayas desbloqueado It Lives o superado Sheol una vez. Despues de eso estaras preparado para los nuevos enemigos y jefes, y apreciaras mas los nuevos objetos y los trinkets.La expansion tiene algunos inconvenientes como glitches que introduce del tipo enemigos que traspasan algunas esquinas, los controles del objeto Brimstone no funcionan muy bien, etc. pero con la cantidad de nuevos elementos en el juego uno se puede olvidar perfectamente de esto.PD. Si todavia no lo sabes la banda sonora es impresionante.			"

												Binding of Isaac is one of the best games I've played on Steam. It has the right level of difficulty, an interesting base story, and a lot of secrets to uncover. Being able to play as a bunch of different characters, all with different stats and starting items, and random items every time you play through the game, makes the game extremely fun and random. Some runs will work, some won't and a lot does depend on luck, but even in a run where you haven't been particularly lucky you still have a chance to pull it off if you fit in a bit of skill.This is one of the first games I played on Steam, and I didn't really enjoy it at first. I sucked at it, and couldn't even get to the first Mom fight. Eventually though, as I played the game more, I got better and learned how to deal with the various enemies. I learned advantages and disadvantages of picking up certain items, and which items were OP so I could hope for one of those. The wiki really helped a lot at the beginning to help me learn the items, of which there are over 100 each with different effects.Though I believe it's intentional for some characters to be more difficult to play than others, it's not a feature I can fully appreciate. I like when all the characters in a game are balanced, which could have been very possible in BoI but some characters are still distinctly worse than others.This game also takes a long while to get the hang of. At first, I played about 2 hours of this game then quit and didn't play again for almost a year. I was then reintroduced to the game, and I started playing it a lot more. It still took me another long time (maybe 40-50 hours) to beat mom for the first time, and then 100 more hours on top of that to beat ??? at the end of the game. It takes practice and patience to finally beat the game, but it's worth every minute of it.The DLC for this game is definitely required. Wrath of the Lamb adds so much important content and it's not nearly as fun without it. There are significantly fewer items, less end-game content, less enemies, and a lot less fun to be had. Although, with or without the DLC, Binding of Isaac is easily worth the price you pay for it at any time. $8 is nothing compared to the amount of fun you will have playing this game.			"

I would argue it is one of the best games of all time. With its high difficulty, enemy variance, different items, and characters, it is infinitely replayable. The different ways you change your play style according to which character you are playing, which items you pick up, or which type of room you walk into always keep gameplay fresh. I strongly recommend buying The Binding of Isaac. It is too good to miss.			"

												Long version:Ok, so this is a great psychological thriller revolving around fears of a child growing up in a dysfunctional family, being raised by a mother with paranoid schizophrenia, who is experiencing imperative auditory hallucinations which are rigidly and delusionally interpreted and provoke verbal and behavioral responses including obdience. Delusional interpretation manifests in, among others, grandiosity, feeling of a mission, delusions of guilt and sin (the latter being transferred to her child). These result in inappropriate and irresponsible actions which jeopardize the safety of her son, Isaac.Isaac, trying to cope with the family situation, is facing his worst childhood subconscious fears. Subconsciousness is traditionally represented as 'basement' (similarly to e.g. Hitchcock's Psycho). His weapon in fighting those fears is crying and thus, relieving negative emotions. As Isaac goes deeper into the subconscious cleansing himself in a psychoanalytical way, he discovers his most concealed desire - to kill his mom. Short version:It's the only game that your wife will encourage you to play.			"

												I would heartily recommend The Binding of Isaac to anyone who isn't too squeamish. While the artstyle is very cartoony it still has some disturbing imagery and grotesque designs. That being said, this childlike portayal of such menacing sights offers a very interesting visual presentation for the game.The proof, however, lies in the playing. This begs the question of how well The Binding of Isaac's gameplay holds up. For being such a simple idea initially to shoot baddies while avoiding being shot yourself a surprising amount of complexity is added with its varied item combinations. One game session you may find yourself becoming a flying demon spitting unforgiving lasers from hell, while in the next you may be stuck peeing on enemies as your only form of self defence. The game also does an okay job of ramping up the difficulty as the player progresses.In conclusion, give this game a spin if you can spare the money and you can handle its graphical style. You may also want to consider picking up the expansion Wrath of the Lamb, it makes it even better.			"

												I have this game for a long time now and with Binding of isaac : Rebirth coming out soon i think i should write a review for the game that started it all.By having playing this game for a long time over and over again the runs are never the same.Completing the game is one thing but the challanges that lay ahead.....Well thats another storyHere are the top points to this game- Randomised Runs- Unique stats system- Replay value- Best storyline- Theres a Racing leauge for this game ( Not kidding it's called BOILeR )Now some negitives- ...............'Can't really think of any'I also recomend getting the Wrath of the lamb DLC for this game just for a real chalange and a chance to get some more skill with the game∞/10			"

												Eerie atmosphere, insane item combinations that can make or break a run, difficulty is potentially brutally challenging, absurd amounts of replayability, and JUST the right amount of sacrilege. MORE than worth the $8 for it and Wrath of the Lamb, and I'm practically drooling over the upcoming Rebirth.I don't care who you are, you need this game in your life.			"

												Great game.  Make no allusions that this game is NOT carried by its graphics but neither was the original Mario Bros, and yes I did mention them in the same sentence.  This game has awesome replayability and can be enjoyed by young and old a like.  Has a moderately controversal theme in regards to religious zealotry which is why Nintendo said ""no thanks"" when they were considering it for their platforms, but as far as I am concerned it is their loss.Lead our hero Isaac deep through the dungeons, either beneath his bedroom, or his own psyche and become addicted to great and suprisingly deep gameplay.Don't just take my word for it.  There is an almost unlimited number of Youtube and Twitch videos highlighting this phenomenal game.			"

These are situations which make for a tense and interesting game to play, and these are the attributes of the exploration in The Legend of Zelda which made it such a massive success.

												Hmm, where should I begin.At first I was quite sceptical, to be honest, towards this game. Running around naked in a maze, collecting mushrooms and syringes, killing flies and spiders. Sounds fuun~~*sarcasm*. NAH-AH mothafacka. Those who think it's 'easy' obviously haven't played it.  It's not repetitive in any way, which I value in an indie/rogue-like games and it's incredibly satisfying to beat the game. Especially for the very first time. Just. Trust me. There is just so much in this game, secrets, treasures, that it's a bit over-whelming. It's like: you think you know a lot about the game (leave alone 'know everything about the game'), but I can almost guarantee that you don't.Oh and it's based mostly around religious stuff and God and Satan and a bit more Satan. Did I mention there's a lot of satanic  things? And Devil + Satan <3All in all, it's one of the funniest, weirdest rogue-like games I have ever played, hands down. Definitely worth every hour I have poured into it. Can't wait what 'Binding of Isaac: Rebirth' has to offer with the whole Co-Op function added to it :3Lastly: There are rare golden piles of crap in the game. Just how awesome is that??!			"

												The Binding of Isaac is an arena style, action-adventure game where it follows the main protagonist, Isaac through the depths of his basement and unknown to escape his insane murderous mother after she receives a sacrifice demand from God. It has an interesting story that is based on events in the Christian religion. This being said, there are many other references such as item names and bosses (Scapular item and Satan boss). You start out with playing Isaac (other characters can be unlocked) battling through six floors until you finally meet and battle your own mother. Additional floors are unlocked with a DLC. The DLC is vital if you want to understand and truly enjoy this game. It unlocks an additional five rooms, all filled with new enemies, new items, and new forms of dark humor, and allows you to generate many more endings, featuring an epic battle against Satan and Isaac himself portraying as a disciple of God.

												The Binding of Isaac is a good way to waste time. Each level is randomly generated and death is permanent; you never know what's in store for you when you start it up. Though dying sucks, you'll still likely feel a sense of achievement as you go deeper into the story and unlock more content. I highly recommend having the wiki open while playing, as there are a ton of items with different and obscure effects. I'd also like to suggest playing the base game for a bit before activating the Wrath of the Lamb DLC. It's a fun and compelling game that's just hard enough to make you want to give it another shot, over and over again. Once you've completed some achievements, you can even change youre starting character. The soundtrack is astounding and the enemies are creative. 10/10Because ""The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth"" is coming out soon, it's probably wise to wait and see if that's any good before buying this. It's supposed to have a lot of new features. The fact that Rebirth exists doesn't make this game any less good but if you can only buy one, you should know you're getting the best.			"

Binding of Isaac may seem like a really simple top down RPG shooter, but trust me when I say that's just a front. If you can look past the cartoonish art style and simplistic look then you'll see a really expansive game with tonnes to find and do.Now first things first: this game is hard. You will spend a lot of your time dying, dying and dying again. If you're gonna whine about a difficult unforgiving game, then don't get this. When you die, that's game over. You start again at the beginning with nothing.Along your journey you'll find a total over 235 items which upgrade your character. I'd say this is what actually makes the game shine, all the items are randomized so every time you play through it, you'll get different items which change how you play. A really nice touch is that the items also change your character's appearance, which is a visually pleasing change.One issue I have with this is that there's usually no indication as to what the items actually do. Unless you have a wiki open whilst you're playing, you're gonna have a bad time. It would have been nice if they at least included an in-game encyclopaedia.Because all the items are randomized, a lot of this game is down to luck which decides whether or not you actually have a successful game which kinda sucks. Overall, considering it's really cheap and a fun game, it gets a 6 out of 10 so pick it up if you have the money!			"

												One of the absolute most brilliant releases of the 21st century. Binding of isaac tells a horrific story with a multitude of disturbing elements that leave you wondering what the designer was thinking when he made this, but whatever he did, it's done in such a way that it gets to people in the best way possibleBinding of isaac is an exploration based adventure with an extremely well thought out progression system, numerous random elements and all that other goodness. The core gameplay can be summed up as ""easy to learn, hard to master"" and the Wrath of the Lamb DLC once again proves this to be a solid statement.Currently the remake is in progress, but this is what started it, and this is what set the standards for similar games in it's genre. Hardcore roguelike elements and a variety of wacky and impressive in game items provide a fresh experience for a loooong time, with a permadeath mechanic that leaves you on the tip of your chair and wanting more and more each time.To sum up this gem of a game, it's now on sale for an all time low. Less than 2 bucks gets you this beauty of a game and the expansion, but in the end it's priceless.No one will regret picking this up. From the die hards to the softcores, there's a place for everyone in the basement >:)			"

												This game is like crack, heroine and meth all in one, making you wish you had never been born in the first place by torturing you with Super Meat Boy creator Edmund McMillen's as(s)tounding design. Being thrown into a rogue-like dungeon crawler à la Zelda filled with profanities left and right, this game will suck you in and not let go of you until you have proven that you got what it takes to make this game your personal ♥♥♥♥♥.It's only you versus the rest of the world.

Each ""floor"" is essencialy a number of ""rooms"", most of which contain various monsters. In order to progress to the next ""floor"", you need to defeat a boss.The character can carry a set of items, some of which are passive, some are activated and some are single-use power-ups.There are also unlockable characters each with unique gameplay style.The story develops as you complete the game numerous times and is pretty much wowen of the Bible references and allusionsThis game is great in terms of value-for-money ratio. Almost endless replayability turns achievements like ""Complete the whole game 9 times"" from a nightmarish grind into a funfest. Well maybe not a funfest, cosidering the fact that sometimes the almighty random makes it really hard to finish your run - you progression is highly item-dependent and all item drops are entirely random.The game features a good soundtrack (which may get a bit old after a few dozens of playthroughs), outstanding and recognizable character design and over a hundred collectible items - some of which interact with each other creating either a deadly combo that will annihilate your enemies or a rather wonky skillset that will hinder your further progression in the current run.Controls and battle system are intuitive - you will get the ropes few moments into the game. The only thing you might find yourself lost at is the huge pool of items - especially considering the fact that not all of them are provided with a full description.So to sum up - this game is a great bang for a buck.

												This is pretty much a roguelike dungeon crawler with quite a bit of influences taken from Zelda, and a ton of religious/Satanic overtones and pretty taboo themes, which was probably designed for masochists....And I mean this in the best way possible.Pros+ Fun and rewarding combat+ The game is difficult, but also fair towards the player+ Nice cutesy but brutal art style+ Gameplay is random with its roguelike elements, making it very addictive+ A lot of different items and powerups to mess around with+ Multiple unlockable characters to suit multiple playstyles+ Plot has a ton of social commentary that will hopefully leave you thinking even after you stop playingCons- Can be glitchy at times- Difficulty curve can be very brutal for newcomersQuestionable? If you're a pretty religious person, you may be pretty offended by the game's style, plot, messages and humor, but you may be able to overlook these things.Overall, I would totally recommend this game to other people.

												Not only is the game based on how well you can adapt to certain encounters with what you have, but it's also based on luck. The layout of the area changes each time you play, so while you may get an awful/useless item and immediately be swarmed with enemies in the next room the first time around, you could get extremely lucky and find consecutive unlocked doors with loot inside that will make the next few floors a cakewalk.It's a very good game, and it can get frustrating at times, yes, but it's very enjoyable to play. If you're alright with creepy, disfigured monsters hanging around in the basement, that is.			"

												What can I say about the Binding of Isaac...It is probably the most frustrated I have ever been at a game, yet I love it all the same. Every run is different, and you could die in the first level, or beat the last boss, dependent partially on your skill and partially on your luck. You never know what you're going to get going into this game. With massive replayability, this is probably the best $5 I have ever spent. The game will slow down every once in a while, as it runs on Flash, but this is usually not too much of a problem.Also, it features absolutely amazing music.If you enjoy rogue-likes, I would seriously recommend giving this game a try.

												What can really be said about The Binding of Isaac at this point that hasn't already been said? A devilish little roguelike wrapped up in a highly-interpretive commentary on relgion and religious iconography with a lot of inspiration from The Legend of Zelda and Robotron/Smash TV style gameplay. The sheer variety of items to find and combine and the massive amount of enemy types and bosses you'll come across make the game's super low price for entry seem almost insane, and even when the game starts asking for multiple playthroughs to finally see the ""true end"" it somehow still keeps tossing new things at you to fight and play with. That said, I don't feel that the game is immediately rewarding and doesn't always make the best of first impressions. The artstyle may not be your thing, the four-way firing mechanics and low rate of fire can make it difficult to really get started, and the heavy reliance on random elements won't always gel with everyone, especially when the game spawns rooms where not taking damage is impossible. It can take a while for The Binding of Isaac to really grab you, and for some it may just never happen. If it does manage to grab you though, you're in for an almost endlessly replayable little treat that just keeps giving and giving. It's also highly recommended that you get as much as you want or can out of the vanilla game before investing in the DLC.			"

												An incredibly fun, Zelda-like, dungeon crawler with art by the always amazing Edmund McMillen, and programming by Florian Himsl. You play as Isaac, a young boy who is being hunted by his mother, who is on a mission from ""God"" to sacrifice Isaac. You travel through a series of randomly-generated basements and caves, collecting a huge variety of power-ups on your way. The religious themes in Binding are a breath of fresh air, providing some provoking, yet subtle storytelling as you play. The soundtrack as composed by Danny Baranowsky, who had collaborated previously with Edmund McMillen on the critically-acclaimed platformer, Super Meat Boy. Baranowsky created an amazing, metal soundtrack with a few ambient tracks as well. All the music fits the gameplay perfectly. With a huge replay-value and quirky yet creepy environment, there's no way I can't recommend this game, especially at the low price of $4.99.			"

(I actually prefer to watch other people play on my friends list and cry silently that I'll never earn those achieves.)There appear to be about a million levels of this basement-initiated labyrinth, of which you fight the spawn of the Devil until you meet Devils-incarnate herself: your Mother... ...Then it dawns on you that technically you're still related despite her bloodthirsty rampage earlier, which makes YOU involved in this somehow - perhaps even accountable in some terrible way, and just what the heck has been going on under your house all these years? and further still, after all of that, you've been fighting evil with tears the size of bathtubs and may need to see an Optometrist.Isaac is a very disturbed child.

												The Binding of Isaac is hard, yet enjoyable. You play as a naked baby trying to get revenge on your mom because she tried to kill you since she's a devoted Christian and heard from a higher power that her son (you) is a sin upon this world. You fight through up to six challenging levels fighting many different types of enemies and bosses. There are a lot of Christian references to this game as well, which I think makes this game quite better, because not many games focus on religious aspects. There are 100+ items to collect on your adventures. Some will make you very powerful while others will be dead weight. Each item has a unique effect so you will want to get every item and see which one suits your tastes the best.For 5 dollars, this game is a steal, it has infinite replayability, it can get very difficult if you don't have the right items, and the atmosphere is pretty amazing			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a bit of an oddity for me to review. First let me explain the game. You play a character who shoots enemies in his basement with his tears. The levels consist of several interconnected rooms, through which you generally fight a group of gruesome bad guys (zombies, mutant spiders, etc.). You fight through enough of them to get keys or coins, which allow you to open up rooms with upgrades or to buy upgrades. Each floor has a boss fight, after which you'll drop down to the next floor, then repeat the process. Now let me talk about the difficulty. You will quickly find this game does not mess around. You start off with three hearts. Each hit takes away half a heart; six hits and you're dead. If you die, you go back to the beginning of the game (absolutely no saves). On top of that, you often face multiple enemies who can move faster than you and can shoot projectiles. You also have extremely little recovery time with each hit. You'll need to explore every room to hopefully find powerups or money so you can pay for a little bit of health. Don't expect to find much health throughout each stage, except after bosses. This is easily one of the most difficult games that I've actually still managed to have fun with. Yes, it is frustrating at times, but it never seems unfair. The game plays by a certain set of rules and will always abide by them. There's a certain amount of comfort in knowing that. The enemies on the other hand, they range from mildly annoying to downright evil. But you'll see that for yourself if you buy this game.The game's aesthetic design is great, the music is great, and the story, while macabre, is pretty interesting. The control is very good and the game is consistent in its dark atmosphere that some would call over-the-top dark humor. The art and level design are, for the most part, pretty simple, but that's okay. The game comes off as cartoony, but I think that contributes to the over-the-top gothic feel. Artistically speaking, it kinds of runs in a similar vein as Salad Fingers.While the Binding of Isaac is repetitive, there's actually a lot of variety. The game mixes up the bosses, each room is randomly generated with random enemies and random items, and there are a TON of different powerups. While it should feel like you're going through the motions again and again, for some reason it doesn't. The story isn't anything deep, of course, and any semblance of an actual plot is non-existent. You play through a floor, then drop down to the next; wash, rinse, and repeat. It's very similar to Diablo in that fashion. Some people may like that and that's fine, but just know that that's what this game is. While this seemingly meaningless trek initially irked me, I've gotten used to it and now I see the game for what it is. It's not really trying to be something it's not, and as far as original arcade shooters go, this one is probably the best I've ever played. The no-save feature is necessary, I now feel, because it encourages retrying and retrying. It builds skill. The random nature of the game is definitely a plus because you never play through the game with the exact map and enemy placement twice. The game's large amount of variety ensures the game has high replay value.I've gone back and forth on my opinions with this game. Originally I had mixed feelings because some of the less conventional aspects didn't jibe with my personal preference. However, it is strangely addicting and fun. The difficulty spikes at the fifth floor and gets to (in my opinion) near-impossible levels without mastery. At the moment, the price point ($4.99 for the base game, $2.99 for the DLC) is very good. It's a fun time-waster, especially if you've got a dark sense of humor. Even though I'm not really a fan of arcade shooters, this one sucked me in, and I can't really explain it. As I said before, the art design, music, and controls are all very good, and while the game gets incredibly difficult, it always seems fair. Most importantly, The Binding of Isaac doesn't claim to be something it's not, so it's important to see it for what it is. I've gone back on my mixed feelings and now say that I do recommend this one if you have a dark sense of humor and/or enjoy difficult games.			"

												One of the best flash player-based games i've ever seen. You can spend hours and days playing this game and it will not bother you, because every time you press ""new game"" - it will always be a random playthrough. A perfect time-killer. Edmund McMillen is a genius. Only one thing that disturbs you during the game - is lags and freezes  even on good PC's. Highly recommend this game.			"

												If you like a challenge this is the game for you. I have fully completed this game and I must say it can be pretty rage inducing at some points and luck determines a main part of how the game goes, but to win you do need to try pretty hard yourself too and overal the game is pretty balanced. If you buy the game you should buy the Wrath of the Lamb DLC with it since it is really worth it. It includes more items and bosses. There is a remake of the game called The binding of Isaac: Rebirth (And Afterbirth DLC) and if you like this game I would also recommend Rebirth since it's mostly the same game but with even more horrors and challenges. This game does have one major addition called hard mode/ ethernal mode which adds even harder bosses and harder variations on existing monsters.In conclusion, the game is pretty hard and if you like a chalenge you should consider buying this game especially if its on sale.

												Highly Addicting Rogue-Like with a cute gruesome storyI would like to point out a few personal criticisms though- All items, rooms, and abilites in the game do not have a description or any information on what they do or used for, there are TONS of different unique items with unique abilities so..you have to pause the game and go look at a Wiki for info (IMO, this is bad game design and is also something I hate about Minecraft)- It's a Rogue-like with VERY RANDOM elements that cause you to fail 9 out of 10 times, and sometimes feels unfair. For instance sometimes you start a run, and you will come across a golden chest, but you can't get to the chest without a bomb, and you can't unlock the chest without a key, and more often than not there won't be any bomb or key pickups on the floor so you are unable to get the chest. (same applies to opening doors, secret rooms, etc.)- As with the previous note abilities are also randomized, so sometimes you can go an entire game without seeing a single dmg + abilitiy making the game feel unfairOther than its a great game that everyone should experience. I know I probably should say more good things about the game, but there's already 99999 positive reviews on the game, so instead I focused on what I didn't like and what I think would make the game better. (criticism = improvements in later games)			"

												Binding of Isaac creator Edmund McMillen who has worked on other indie games like super meat boy. At first glance you will be questioning getting it but is one of the best indie games I have played. The game is a rouge like with hundreds of items to bump into on the way as you go through room after room, floor after floor killing and defeating bosses along the way. WIth 10 different endings that will increase the difficulty each time you beat one and with different alternate endings after increases the play time value giantly. The game does look very dark on the elements but is a great game with refrences to other games Edmund McMillen as made. I would rate this 10/10 with charcters, mulitple endings, hundred of items you will not find that you have done everything and with each room you go into random everytime you will enjoy your time with this game £4.99 well spent. PS a remade version will be comming out early 2014 with new features and better quality ingame.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a fun, cheap and extremly fun game, with a lot of replayability and almost infinite item combinations that make the game even funnier.The game is incredibly hard when you start playing it but once you get a hang of it you won't want to stop, just like McMillen's Super Meat Boy. In the same way as meat boy, Binding of Isaac also has an flawless sountrack composed by Danny B. with kudos to boss themes.The only ""bad"" aspect of the game i can think is that when you die you have to start all over again, which can get frustrating after a while, but what is a good game without it's difficulty?Overall 10/10			"

												Really nice Indie game ! I think The Binding of Isaac is  part of the best Indie games with Super Meat Boy and others.At first, I found this game kinda horrific to be honest, but after a bit of time, I appreciated it, and now, I don't care to see a child kill misshapens childs with his tears.I don't care to see a child kill its own mother heart.I don't care to see a child kill Sat... What ?!Yeah... this game helped me discover one of the best OST ever.The gameplay is really simple, but the game itself is really hard when you use to play at the highest difficulties.- 10 differents floor ( with DLC )--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Basement- The Cellar ( with DLC )- The Caves- The Catacombs ( with DLC )- The Depths- Necropolis ( with DLC )- The Womb- Utero ( with DLC )- Cathedral- Sheol------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot of differents ennemies, and a...

												It was the Winter Sale and everyone was all aboard the hype train. Choo Choooo! I jumped on board.But after hours and hours of playing, I have to say, this is what Extra Credits was talking about when they spoke about the difference between a challenging game and a punishing game. In a challenging game, one is forced to rely on skill, sometimes within a steep learning curve, but there's a high risk reward factor because you know if you do a good job, put in the time and effort to get better, make the smarter calls, you will be rewarded with greater success. There is a system to master, not game or exploit, but master- and when you manage to, you feel like the Master. In a punishing game, like so, you can in one run through be given 2 power ups per room and 2 spiders to defeat per room or NO power ups for 6 straight levels, 8 monsters per room, and every chest gives you multiple bombs that chase you until they explode. Because the effects of the same actions can produce such varying results, the overall feeling over time is that your actions aren't what matters.The end result for me is that instead of feeling challenged, I feel Punished for playing. I might as well have enjoyed rolling a die. To its credit, this has better graphics than just rolling a die and lots of kooky 3spooky5me atmosphere to immerse itself in, good music, and decent controls. But I don't really care if it's a high-spec 120 fps HD sensory feast factory. If the end result is still that it's all a crap shoot, that half the time I should just restart until I get a better first few levels, then there comes a painful awareness the more one plays that the outcome has less to do with me than with all those die rolls.

												Much like the other offerings from Edmund McMillen, The Binding of Isaac is not for the faint of heart or those who are easily discouraged, frustrated, or require a constant, guiding hand to have a good time. The Binding of Isaac will kill you, a lot, over and over, without mercy. However, the genius of its game design beckons to a bygone era where reward and punishment come purely from reflexes, understanding the game mechanics, how enemies move and fight, and a proper utilization of the tools at hand. Because of this design philosophy, Isaac will demand that you play again and again, slowly honing your skill and understanding until you no longer feel small and defenseless. The game can seem impossibly difficult upon first sitting, yet once the wisdom of time accumulates those impossible bosses will suddenly seem like easy prey compared to the horrors you now contend with on the deeper levels.Mechanically, Isaac suffers slightly from its roots as a Flash based game, denying us some of the features and options we have come to expect even from an indie game. However, the gameplay is still brilliant enough to warrant attention and the gameplay is often spot on. Isaac catches and keeps attention with a reliance on perma-death and random pick-ups which can drastically alter how the game is played. One moment you are shooting ineffective tears at enemies, the next you are firing screen extending lasers, the next you are soaring over pits and obstructions with angelic wings. There is enough constant variety available in every play through to keep the game refreshing even on the three-hundredth run, compounded by the introduction of new bosses, deeper levels, new playable characters, and more powerful and interesting bonuses unlocked upon your continued successes.Beyond the addictive gameplay, McMillen has crafted an art style which is often both beautiful and disturbing. The cartoony characterizations mask the devious implications of many of the enemies and items as well as softening the harsh blows presented by the sheer constant brutality of your actions. There is something about Isaac that gets into your head, a fact not discounted by the catchy, haunting music constantly calling you ever further into the abyss. It is not unreasonable to say that Isaac is not a game you can pick up over a weekend, beat, and then forget; on the contrary it will call to you in the waking world, offering one more game, one more chance to redeem all your failed attempts, one more opportunity to immerse yourself in its twisted, witty, and beautiful world.

There are a large amount of items, with the levels changing every time you play, making it never the same game every time you play it.Pros- +Very good price for such a fun game+Soundtracks are amazing+Difficult, but not impossible+Large variety of levels+Large variety of items+DLC, Wrath of the Lamb adds such a large amount, it's almost like a different game- And in a good way.+Looks like a classic browser game, and not a hugely computer intensive game+VERY small download, meaning it should take you less than a good minute (With bad internet) to download+Not very computer intenseCons--Music volume I found could not be changed, only disabled or enabled-Satanic references, but if anything has religion references in it there is bound to be something Anti within itAll in all, this game is worth your time and I would suggest it.So long as you are fine with seeing religion stuff within it.

												I gotta say, this game is one tough cookie. I remember my friend showing it to me a couple years back, and when i saw it here, i thought i would give it a go for myself. I was not dissapointed when i started playing. With the rogue like style and awsome items you can get in this game, it has the most replayability of any game ive played in a while. And to add to all of that, it runs the smoothest out of all the games i have on this computer, so you can bet i enjoy that. If your looking for a tough game you can play over and over and over again without getting bored, then look no further, because binding of isaac is the game for you.			"

The Binding of Isaac is an addictive twin-stick shooter that rejuvenated the roguelike genre and gifts players with a memorable gaming experience, though it is thoroughly hampered by technical flaws, creative limitations and the existence of a wholly-superior successor.In Isaac, you play as the titular character, a five-year-old boy, fleeing from his homicidal mother throughout the realms that exist beneath his basement. Isaac uses his tears as bullets to fire at enemies. He's aided by items, trinkets, pills and cards that he finds along the way, which further disfigure him until he is almost unrecognizable by the end of the game. The full game can be beat on average in under an hour - this is the staple element of the ""roguelike"" genre, which developer Edmund McMillen implemented in Isaac, effectively resurrecting the genre among the indie game market. Roguelikes are exceptionally short, but are also permadeath, meaning that a character's death is absolute. Finally, each playthrough of the game is randomly generated, with no two playthroughs featuring the same items, bosses and floor layouts. This all effectively means that Isaac is infinitely replayable, for there is always the motivation of finding undiscovered, superpowerful item combinations to keep players coming back.The unique thematic styles that the game contains provides an experience that can be quite subjective and polarizing, though those coming in with open minds find that they enjoy Isaac's charm over time. The game has significant connection to the Christian faith: the title of the game, the names of the characters (minus one) and many items contain references to the contents of the Bible. Though these references are not explicitly sacriligious, considering the context of the game (surrounded by a naked crying child and rooms full of poop) and its lore (with divine intervention driving Isaac's mother to hunt him down), those who are deeply devout may be turned off by the game's subject matter. The music is somber and melancholic, underscoring Isaac's desperation throughout his journey. Overarching visual presentation possesses an air of artistry, due to the models of characters and enemies being hand-drawn by developer Edmund McMillen, then being directly transplanted into the game. The wide variety of sizes and styles for enemies and item effects allows players to internalize what certain things do, which in turn paves the way for strategic deveopment and improved play upon practice.The issues that this game faces are great in number, and cannot be solely attributed to the game's genre. Technologically, the game has faults that could even lead it to being described as ""broken"". The limitations of the Flash medium the game was designed on is often attributed as the cause of framerate issues, as well as cases of the game freezing while loading certain levels, the latter of which has become so well-known in the community that it even has its own name (""the Pink Glitch""). The in-game stat screen on the pause menu is known to misrepresent the actual stats of the player, and either way is too vague to be useful. Some item descriptions outright lie to the player, and at least one item and one trinket are known to either do nothing or solely harm the player. There are some interactions that allow the player to fall to negative health. Though these facets harm most players, there is an interesting metagame that exists in the Isaac community that calls for exploitation of known bugs and synergies to literally ""break the game"", by getting every item available or forcing the game to crash while trying to get there. What is arguably more dissappointing than these technical issues are the ample lack of synergies. Though some basic tear modifiers can stack on in large numbers to create crazy effects, the strongest items in the game that change your attack from tears to another format largely cancel each other out upon pickup, with invisible stat changes the only possible outcome. The game punted its opporunity to become great by neglecting to implement synergies to so many combinations.Despite the aforementioned issues, Isaac was still the standard-bearer for the roguelike genre and was a phenominally popular game. However, it has been dethroned by its own reimagining: The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. This recent successor was developed by a new development team and has addressed the numerous technical and synergistic issues noted above. Though the game is not perfect, it is far superior to the original Isaac on virtually all levels. Therefore, in consideration of buyers' finances, if you're new to the franchise then get Rebirth. However, on its own, this is still a brilliantly-conceived title with engaging gameplay and an indefinite lifespan. Considering the price for the original is often so low on the Internet, it may still even be worth purchase now. The Binding of Isaac gets a C+.			"

For $5 you get hours and hours of game play, your life in Isaac might only be from 15-50 minutes but the reason you will want to come back is the randomness of it all!

												I love this game. Also, I hate it. It is just the way it is balanced without even trying to be balanced that makes it really hard and challenging in a dumb, but clever way and any change to any of the mechanics or rates would basicly have the potential to blow up the whole thing. Giving yourself 6 completely random items via spidermod at the very start of the game will nearly always get you a decent set of stuff that is not overpowered and not underpowered- giving yourself 8 or more items will ultimately overpower you in most occasions. I skipped the treasure rooms in these spidermod-runs by the way to make it fair and it was a proof to me that somehow Isaac became a very very complex box of stuff interacting with each other in a very catching way, making you wanna try out new combinations, playstyles, etc. You can play the game super safe for example - or you can just rush it and play sloppy as hell - it doesn't matter. Once you got used to the controls, found out what the items do and basicly go with the flow of the game you can make your own exceptions in playstyle and challenge-stuff. It's a little like maths I guess, but with much more luck involved.			"

												It's dirt  cheap during any sale and it is as gold as everything else Team Meat has managed to churn out. If you are curious what you are getting into it, it's something strangely familiar and incredibly well made. It is basically a top down shooter reminescent of old Zelda games (my favorite kind) with roguelike elements and some twisted humor.*On a side note: buy the DLC, I don't need to add why, its everything you love topped with more of what you love.Roguelikes have been making a resurgence lately as part of the revisionist mantra of ""real gamers like hardcore challenges"". Which is all well and good, sure I like to be challenged in certain ways, but I definitely like to relax too. More importantly it's not just any challenge that gamers should clamor for, it's the good kind, the fair kind. Team Meat has this down perfectly. When ever you die in one of their games it's not a question of a flaw in the game's design, an enemy that is overpower, or an impossible obstacle, the only the wrong is you. The game has a simple set of mechanics and some secrets in gameplay that you can and should figure out on your own. When you lose in this game you should feel that welcome brand of shame that says ""I should've known better"". This game isn't trying to fool, you know what you are playing and you know what you should've done.The real draw from a game that is continously killing you, besides the superb gamplay, is the sense of progress and reward. There is a plethora of secrets to be found in The Binding of Isaac, all unlocked in a variety of ways and adding to the gameplay. The game starts with Isaac, there are more characters to unlock later, shooting tears and running around naked. From defeating bosses, random chests, or treasure rooms, Isaac unlocks various items that alter his abilities. Most of the abilities are passive and stack, and some are useable abilities like cards or a cat's head. These items are all random ( a treasure may net you a spiffy spider upgrade to your tears or just a teleporter) and the levels are procedurally generated. On top of all  the game altering the items can do, they also change your character's appearance into something that is usually atrocious and hilarious.The Binding of Isaac will kill you a lot (and not in the Dark Souls way where  you can still get something back and respawn from the last campfire), but you will never feel like it was a waste. I've had some two minute sessions of this game that netted me a new secret item, and there is always something to unlock in The Binding of Isaac. After dying so many times you will get better, and then you will still keep dying, but you'll enjoy it.  "

												The Binding of Isaac is a remarkably enjoyable game, and deserving of much of the praise it receives. While implementing tougher Roguelike elements, it manages to retain the fundamental accessibility and shallow learning curve that hallmark the most well-received indie titles. This is a commendable achievement, and is probably what makes it a foregone conclusion that this game will be remembered as one of the best indie games of all time. But the game does have a very glaring flaw that is too rarely pointed out. The game is short and the dungeons are small, which has the effect of making progression and completion nearly impossible unless you have a lucky start. This is really the worst that can be said of The Binding of Isaac, though, and the game is fun and rewarding at least as often as it is frustrating and unfair. Make sure that you have a very solid handle on the base game before you even consider getting the Wrath of the Lamb expansion, as it ramps up difficulty considerably.			"

												Probably the first game I've ever played where I can end up both hating it and love it at the same time, it's a cartoony dark souls, you'll die... you'll die lots. You may have a good run where you get lots of fantastic items, and then the next it will be constant rubbish, but half the fun is trying to get as far as you can with the things you have (I'm sure there is a life lesson in there)The graphics are nice, the music is ok but it does get very repetitive quickly, the gameplay is fun but frustrating (vague memories of hurling abuse at the screen), however when you have stupid amounts of failure and then finish it, that is a great feeling of pride. whether full price or on sale, it's a bargain			"

It's a little disturbing in some places, sure, but it brings comedy, horror, and PLOT into the game. You play as a boy named Isaac, a boy who has been doing sinful things throughout his life. His mother becomes insane, hearing that her son is the work of the devil, and he must be saved by being punished. With death. It's godly enough to be a nice rogue like, game.

												The Binding of Isaac is by far the most grotesque and insane game I’ve played.  It’s pure mayhem and requires skill and patience to master. You play as Isaac who had to hide himself in his basement to avoid being murdered by his mother who was told by God to kill him. You venture through 8 levels gathering items, bonuses, and anything you can wield to face your mom. No play through is same because the levels are randomly generated. It’s an insanely addictive game that has huge replay ability and it will definitely keep you entertained for hours on end.			"

												I must highly recommend this game it's simple, fun, and challenging. Trying to get no-damage achievements makes me cry.. okay, perhaps sometimes it's more challenging than fun. I like it though, even then.. Not good for players who want every achievement in a game with low effort - it's not going to happen here. Getting most achievements will take a lot of time - but it feels so rewarding to survive.. and getting an achievement is even more so. The game requires a dlc to finish, still - it's quite affordable, WoTL doubles the game length, increases difficulty - adds more variety.  I feel a DLC is worth the cash, even for those who don't intend to 100% the game. Just be prepared, pick up and win won't happen, in fact it requires quite a few playthroughs to unlock all the items, including a few of the most powerful ones. Though somewhat morbid, this top-down adventure game has definitely earned a spot in my top 5 favorite games on steam.~ Good luck in this game, I hope you give it the time to grow on you, and enjoy it as much as I have. Definitely a 10/10 from me.			"

												Umm... I don't know what to say about this game. it's... Weird. But overall (Even though i played a little on this account, and about 250+ hours on my old account), it's a fantastic, evenly priced game. Gives a Lot of Hours of Gameplay (Reaching the Cathedral is HARD, and takes over 13 successful runs that take a crapton of time >.<), with Many (MANY!) Items that appear randomly through the many levels (Random as well, for Pretty much Endless Fun), And will make you Become pretty much a Tank to anything that comes after You. A thing that's also Impressive is that how The game itself has a Kind of Creepy and Morbid Gameplay, but also Really Fun and Bizzarre, and Still Holding up to Comic-Like Graphics. More things like Challenges, Character selection (Each with its own Special Item and Starting Stats), A Handful of different Enemies, Random Bosses Each Level, Collection of Items, A lot of In-Game and Steam Achievements (With Many In-Game Unlockables to be found), An Interesting Backstory of the Main Character And a Fantastic amount of 13+ Endings, Make the Icing on this Strange But Amazing Cake. Also, You can ""Tear"" Down Enemies. *Da Bum Tss*. Overall, For me it's 9.2/10.			"

												Another beautifully composed game by Team Meat (Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes), a small independent developer who also created top hit Super Meat Boy. The Binding of Isaac strikes a resemblance to the original Legend of Zelda exploration esque gameplay through caves and dungeons, except in this title the main character (and arguable protagonist) Isaac ventures through his basement trying to escape his mother who is asked by the voice of God to make a sacrifice to prove her faith. The game implements great gameplay mechanics (which adapt to your style of progressing through the game to continuously increase the games difficulty), clever visuals, and a great plot to create an amazing atmosphere in a must have PC title.

The only playable one, however, is a kid named Isaac, because all the others champions cost $75 to play. Even so, the champion Isaac has many strengths that help him along his path. He can pick up many items and use them to his advantage to contact Child Services to take him away from his abusive family. Once you contact CPS, your family decides to shoot you, and you die. This game has made me very sad and depressed, so I don't reccomend playing this game at all. "

With that being said, lets get right into it. The Binding of Isaac is a top down dungeon crawler game based off of a story in the Bible. The story goes is that there is a a man named Abraham who is visted by God himself and is asked to sacrafice his son Isaac. This story is a lot like The Binding of Isaac (Discount the monsters and dungeons). Right off the bat you can see that The Binding of Isaac is not just some regular top down dungeon crawler game. It has amazing art combined with a dark depressing theme. Each and every enemy you encounter will shock you, you will have to remember these enemies, how they look like, and their attack patterns in order to advance further into the game. The items are goofy and loveable. Now lets do some pros and cons.Pros:- Fantasic soundtrack that will always keep you pumped up for the next boss- Vague yet incapturing story- A large variety of enemies that will only get harder as you avance further into the game- Unlockable characters, somthing to always strive to- There are indeed multiple endings- Until you've seen all endings and unlocked all characters and collected all items, there is always replay valueCons:- This game is impossibly difficultI know there is only one con but that con is no joke. This game is hard and unforgiving. It's fun at times but it really does suck when you die right before the ""Mom Fight"". It has a deep learning curve and there is no description on any item you get, which means in order to use it right you have to look it up on the wikia. If you intend on buying this game there is a few things to know.1) You are buying a game that is difficult, and there's no way of changing that.2)  If you plan on really going hard at this game, there is some reseach and memorizing involed.3) If you are religious in any way, you may find this game's content to be offensive. My final thought on this game is that it's a well made indie cult classic. I enjoy this game enough to play it every once and a while but not crazy about it. As for the DLC and Rebirth, I do not plan on buying those anytime soon. 8.5/10			"

												Binding of Isaac..Yes, the Binding of Isaac is one of the deepest, heart touching and emotionful game about life of a little boy named Isaac. It has many Bible references, those make the game more mysterious and interesting. Not willing to spoil anything, but it's more like how Isaacs life turned into hell. He just lived a happy, joyful and simple life with his Mother in a small house on a hill. But one day Isaacs Mom heard a voice from above.. The God tells his Mother to prove her faith in him by sacrificing Isaac.The gameplay reminded me a lot of Zelda games - Bombs: used to break rocks, kill enemies and cut Your way through closed doors if needed. Coins: Used to play slot machines, buy items and etc. Keys: Unlock treasure rooms and other locked doors. It is also a very random, no two runs are the same, random pick-ups and enemies. Variety of items - over 250 items! every collectible You pick will be shown on Your character. Make Your shots (tears) stronger by collecting those items to defeat more difficult bosses, make Your Character faster by collecting other types of items, to dodge enemy attacks and so on! I'm definitely recommending it! You won't regret! The soundtrack is also very nice and fits the game. Many endings will keep You satisfied to play more, even if You die (Death is permanent in game).But the game has a deeper meaning to it, wayy deeper, it is what it makes so original and very different, from the other games, even games from the same creator. Yes, it is sad and You'll understand it once You've beaten the game 10th time..Have a nice time playing this amazing game!-Circumflex			"

												I have a personal connection with this game because it combined something I love which is videogames & something I hate which is religion. This game is a breath of fresh air against all the crap in religion & I honestly recommend this game if you have a gloomy day or you just want to let off some steam so if you like classic Zelda games & you hate religion go play this game.

Don't forget to buy Rebirth it's a huge improvement on the original Isaac. http://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/Note: Be prepared for a Binding Of Isaac Rebirth review because I might write one.... and before I forget I love both soundtracks so I'm not going to debate which is better.			"

												Isaac and his Mother lived alone in a small house on a hill.Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys, as his Mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television.Life was simple, and they were both happy.That was, until the day Isaac's Mom heard a voice, from above.""Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!""""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's Mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.Again, the voice called to her:""Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil,and confess his sins!""""I will follow your instructions, Lord! I have faith in thee!"" Isaac's Motherreplied, as she locked Isaac away in his room, away from all the evils of the world.One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:""You have done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to me!To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""""Yes lord. Anything!"" Isaac's mother begged.""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice.Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice.Go into his room, and end his life, as an offering to me to prove you love me above all else.""""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear.Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trap door to the Basement, hidden under his rug.Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down, into the unknown depths below.And thus begins one of the best games I've ever played, on Steam or otherwise.In this game you play as Isaac (or one of 6 other characters who may or may not also be Isaac in different costumes, depending on your interpretation of the endings) and go through randomized floors of the Basement (and the caves, and depths, and maybe even beyond!), collecting all sorts of weird/gross powerups to eventually face-off your Mother.Even if you've played Rebirth, I'd recommend you pick this up, if only just to see where it all began.It doesn't run perfectly (since it was programmed in Flash it's capped at 30FPS, but if you're on a toaster like me, that might be more than you get on rebirth!The soundtrack is superb (and personally better than rebirth's soundtrack IMO), and the graphics just kind of work (it looks like it's all part of Isaac's drawings, which according to the first ending, it is)Pros:-Harder than Rebirth (due to mechanics changes and a lack of SUPER op items that aren't extremely rare to compensate for their power)-10/10 soundtrack (even just opening it up today i found myself subconsiously humming the title screen music!)-Spooky, but in a good way (ie subtlety, and not hamfisted jumpscares)-Replayability (especially with the new ""Eternal Edition"" update, I still haven't been able to beat some of those new bosses)Neutral:-Different styled boss fights than Rebirth (while Rebirth has a lot of bullet hell-type fights, BoI has more mechanical fights, for example, instead of shooting bullet hell patterns like in Rebirth, the 'true' final boss will shoot at you only when you shoot, matching your fire rate, and some bosses like Carrion Queen are more about dodging the ground hazards while making sure to hit her weak point. Some people may prefer it, some may not, it's mostly a matter of personal preference)Cons:-Fewer item synergies than Rebirth (Brimstone doesn't really synergize with anything aside from generic tear effects, Mom's Knife SORTA works with Spoon Bender and other similar effects i can't remember the name of in that the knife sorta wiggles in the direction of enemies, but mostly just keeps its same trajectory)-Lower framerate -No controller support (unless you use Joy2Key)One thing to keep in mind if you havent played it before, is that Wrath of the Lamb actually makes the game harder (by giving you a random chance to get alternate, harder versions of floors, and various curses that can help/hinder you), so if you're playing for the first time, you may not want to get the DLC right away, at least not until you've beaten the game a few times to unlock stuff.Also, you won't want hard mode on unless you're experienced with this game.Normal mode in this is equivalent to hard mode in Rebirth, so it's already decently hard.Overall i definitely recommend this, you basically have no excuse not to pick this up if it's on sale because the price gets pretty low, and if you're like me you'll probably end up with a ton of time in this game (ignore my steam played stats, a lot of my progress was offline or using SpiderMod/Community Remix mod, which is why i'm missing a few achievements and still have platinum god)			"

												The ultimate Bible FPS game. The Binding of Isaac shows great Christian morality and teaches the truths of God. You play as Isaac Newton, master of magnet, who must defeat the 7 deadly sins (Greed, Envy, Metallica, Bill Clinton, Cyberdemon, Evilness, and Mass Debating) and fight the Lord of Darkness himself using only a club and an apple. The game is very challenging, with lots of challenge and challenging moments. However, first time players might have difficulty on the ""Throw the controller at the wall"" part.

But that's basically the fun of it, you have a lot of items to pick up and use and some may be bad and some may be good. With multiple endings, great enemies and bosses, and different types of characters with different stats and abilities. This game overall is great.9/10			"

												At first, you start a new game and die. Then, you restart, and die again. But each time you start a new run, you know more, you have more experience and have more stuff unlocked. So, with a bit of luck (as levels are generated randomly), you can progress further. Your runs are longer, you die later, you reach lower levels of the basement and discover more and more of the secrets (and there are plenty of them, believe me).Very addictive and rewarding game, I don't think I've ever played a game in which dying was so motivating to start all over again.

If none of this is making sense, then just understand that this game is something you will probably stick to for a while, it's a long-lasting game that doesn't go out without a fight to the end.

												A very unique story and gameplay style that is reminiscent of the Legend of Zelda franchise. With many unique abilities but a random level/dungeon generator, it ultimately becomes an addicting quest to be the strongest or fastest or ANYTHING you're going for (it's not like you're going to have a choice) and has a heck of a lot of replayability. Worth the buy, moving over to Rebirth soon.        -Cookie			"

												""Man what kind of f...ed up kind of game is this?""Lemme tell ya, it'll be your life by the end of the day. Which could be today if you buy it now *wink wink*Simple game mechanics, tons of items, randomized stages, lots and lots of dirty little secrets to discover.Three factors on beating this game consistently to reach the very end:> your ability to shoot> your ability to dodge> and your luckTwo of those things are under your control, and it's most definitely not luck.You'll be praying to those RNG gods to give a piece of goodie heaven to make the game feel easier.But other than that, learn to dodge and shoot. Can't dodge and shoot? Go play Touhou or some other bullet hell gameOnce you get better, you'll be able to clear more stages and the playthrough itself. Keep in mind that the more playthroughs you clear, the number of stages lengthen and the enemies get increasingly bloodthirsty.This game launches in a blink of an eye and it will bring 200hrs+ of fun, frustration, and curiousity. Waiting for Netflix to load the movie? Launch Binding of IsaacSomeone is hogging your restroom? Launch Binding of IsaacCooking some turkey? Launch Binding of IsaacShort homework break? Uhh no please, this will further extend the ""short break"" into a ""day off""By the time you actually invested 200hrs, you'll either be a rambling looney, or a person enlightened with the patience and humility of a saint!

												The binding of Isaac is a brilliant little procedurally generated dungeon crawler in which you must make it through each level of your toy box in order to defeat your mother. This game recquires huge levels of concentration and multi-tasking as you'll be ducking around to avoid flies and enemy tears. This game however is not as innocent as it looks though as if you fail or make the slightest mistake it may come back to bite you later when you need just the tinniest part of health. Anyway this game is an amazing sign of just what a small group of people can achieve and you can see to this day that edmund mcmillin has created many of amazing games. This game is perfect for when your kicking back and want just a small dose of this game or want to play hardcore. This is brilliant, I'm giving it a 7.5/10			"

The Binding of Isaac is a two-dimensional Action-adventure Roguelike game, which preforms amazingly well in it's Genre. I will breakdown the components of the game:Story - 9/10The Binding of Isaac's storyline is based off the eponymous Bible story. Isaac (a kid) and his mother live in a small home situated on a hill, both peacefully keeping to themselves, with Isaac drawing doodles and playing with his toys while his mother watches Christian broadcasts on the television. Isaac's mother then hears ""a voice from above"", stating her son is corrupted and must be helped. It asks her to remove all sin from Isaac to save him. She obliges, and takes away his toys, games and even clothes.The voice again calls out to Isaac's mother, stating Isaac must be isolated from all the evil in the world. Once again, she follows its command and locks Isaac in his room. Finally, the voice speaks to her again, and tells her that she has done good, but it still questions her faith and commands she must sacrifice Isaac. She obliges, grabbing a kitchen knife and goes to Isaac's room. Isaac is watching through a sizable crack in his door and starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor under the rug, and just as his mother bursts in, he opens the trapdoor and jumps down it. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which transitions into the game's title screen.The game has multiple endings, all pointing at different ideas about Isaac's life.Gameplay - 10/10The ingame dungeons are procedurally generated, allowing endless hours of entertainment. It also includes random bosses from a list of over 20, 100+ powerups and items, and 50+ different types of enemies.Sound - 8/10TBOI has a great soundtrack and amazing background music which is highly attractive and creates a great atmosphere in this bizarre game.Overall - 9/10 FYI: I have played a lot more of this game than said by Steam as I have played the DRM free version.

												Having just gotten 100% on this game, I think it's time that I give my review. To put it simply, this is my favorite game. Period. Since everything in the game is quite literally random (room layout, floor layout, power-ups, items, enemies, bosses etc.) it provides an immense level of replayability. I have put 270 hours into this game and have had to start from scratch due to a corrupted save and still I absolutely love it and play it nearly every day.I always love a high level of challenge and difficulty and The Binding of Isaac provides this in SPADES.At $8 for the game and the DLC (which is essential, in my opinion) this game is a great value. Better yet, it is often on sale for a couple dollars and this makes it a MUST BUY if you also enjoy a challenging and highly replayable game.			"

												     Após a sua mãe receber uma ordem de deus, pedindo para que ela purifique teu filho, ela decide sacrifica-lo.     O menino por tua vez corre e se tranca no quarto. No desespero ele descobre um alçapão em baixo de um tapete e então decide pular para salvar tua vida.    Ao cair no porão da casa descobre que não está sozinho, e que existem criaturas horrendas e bizzarras... que com o tempo ele descobre ser teus irmãos deformados.   O jogo tem uma dificuldade muito elevada, na qual para cada ""boss"" que for enfrentar precisará de itens decentes... Pelo contrario eles podem se tornar muito chatos.   Outro fator que eu achei bem interressante, é o fato de as stages se criarem randonicamente. Com isso Itens e lugares totalmente diferentes estarão disponiveis sempre que começar um game.    O jogo não possui vidas, nem check-points... então, morreu acabou o jogo. O que torna o jogo insano e extremo no quesito dificuldade. "

												If you look at this game from the side, you might think ""Oh it's another indie game..."" well, I said the same before I bought it.This game is about a kid named Isaac after the bible story ""Binding of Isaac"". Isaac's psychopath mother hears a voice from above, ordering her to kill her son Isaac. Our naked kid Isaac hears his mother rushing to his room, with a knife, and crashing his door while saying ""I'LL DO MY LORD"". Isaac finds a trapdoor under a carped that leads him to the deep horrors. This game is about cleaning monts in rooms, and collecting upgrades. There are upgrades that gives Isaac unique abillities as Homing Tears n' stuff. Did I mentioned that Isaac deals with monsters with tears? Yes you heard me right, you will be using tears as bullets. There's a lot of stuff to collect and even more if you have the DLC. The DLC will make the game toughter and add more loot , monsters and bosses.This game will make you scream and swear hard at the monster who killed you, It's because there's perma-death. After playing this game, you may say it's an humoristic indie game (shooting tears? duh) wich wont have a seriouse 'deep' story. If you'll take your time and check every little thing, you will notice that the game has a really great story wiithin it.I'll put 7.5/10 because perma death is a real pain in the ♥♥♥. Especially when fighting end-bosses. Also the game has FPS drops even if your graphic card is a beast. (Compare to the game ofc).			"

												 Little late to the party, but I want to try out this new ""Steam Reviews"" thing by reviewing The Binding of Isaac. Contrary to popular belief, The Binding of Isaac is not hard, more, unforgiving. Many will be turned off by the nature of reviews stating it is hard and requires much skill. I find it, however, more unforgiving than ""hard"". Yes, there is a difference.""Well, what do you mean?"", says random bystander awed by hearing other's analysis being gone against. Well, you see, anyone who has played The Binding of Isaac can tell you it is a randomly generated game. This aspect gives it a very nice value of replayablility. Luck is a key factor in this generation, so you want a ""lucky"" run. However, anyone with a lot of skill CAN beat this game with crappy items. You see, the challenge does not stem from its risky 1 life gameplay style, as you can restart and get better items, possibly a 1-up to give you another life, the challenge comes from the random generation and ♥♥♥♥ loads of projectiles. However, you can master this game. Like I said before, you can use your skill to beat this game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items. Some strategies such as Secret Room guessing, and knowing how to avoid certain items really helps a lot. The secret to beating this game is to be immersed in its content and variables.  ""So what? You can beat the game if you take into consideration your knowledge of this game. What makes you think more people will buy it?"", says a bystander who keeps getting owned by Peeps. Well, you see, The Binding of Isaac has had a reputation for being an infamously hard game. The real ironic thing is, people can beat it in their first few runs. Then more content unlocks, and they gradually keep becoming better at the game. The game is not hard, its just a thing you can't plow through. I hope this will help people off put by the game's reputation as ""hard"" join in on the fun. I'm sorry this isn't much of a review, I'm really busy (With doing nothing) and I can't be bothered to write a full review. Though to truly know this game, you must play it yourself. Bye, and I hope to see you all again in 2014.			"

												 Little late to the party, but I want to try out this new ""Steam Reviews"" thing by reviewing The Binding of Isaac. Contrary to popular belief, The Binding of Isaac is not hard, more, unforgiving. Many will be turned off by the nature of reviews stating it is hard and requires much skill. I find it, however, more unforgiving than ""hard"". Yes, there is a difference.""Well, what do you mean?"", says random bystander awed by hearing other's analysis being gone against. Well, you see, anyone who has played The Binding of Isaac can tell you it is a randomly generated game. This aspect gives it a very nice value of replayablility. Luck is a key factor in this generation, so you want a ""lucky"" run. However, anyone with a lot of skill CAN beat this game with crappy items. You see, the challenge does not stem from its risky 1 life gameplay style, as you can restart and get better items, possibly a 1-up to give you another life, the challenge comes from the random generation and ♥♥♥♥ loads of projectiles. However, you can master this game. Like I said before, you can use your skill to beat this game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items. Some strategies such as Secret Room guessing, and knowing how to avoid certain items really helps a lot. The secret to beating this game is to be immersed in its content and variables.  ""So what? You can beat the game if you take into consideration your knowledge of this game. What makes you think more people will buy it?"", says a bystander who keeps getting owned by Peeps. Well, you see, The Binding of Isaac has had a reputation for being an infamously hard game. The real ironic thing is, people can beat it in their first few runs. Then more content unlocks, and they gradually keep becoming better at the game. The game is not hard, its just a thing you can't plow through. I hope this will help people off put by the game's reputation as ""hard"" join in on the fun. I'm sorry this isn't much of a review, I'm really busy (With doing nothing) and I can't be bothered to write a full review. Though to truly know this game, you must play it yourself. Bye, and I hope to see you all again in 2014.			"

												Top-down 2D dungeon crawler roguelike.A game that relies on replayability by giving the player different runs every time he plays through the game. By completing the game multiple times, more items and areas are unlocked.The game is structured through floors that consist of rooms, which are randomly generated and can include various things from enemies to special Items.Each floor features an itemroom that includes a passive or activatible item to aid the player in the rather hard rooms filled with treacherous enemies. If the player is unable to dodge correctly, he will find himself getting damages quite often and ending runs preemptively.To progress from floor to floor the player has to defeat the boss of each floor, who also drop passive items that increase health, damage or other stats.Since the release of Rebirth I would not recommend buying the original game, mostly because of performance issues related to the flash-engine that the game uses.

												This game is not for everyone. It's tough as nails and very dependant on luck. If you like roguelikes, exploration, and finding great combos, this is the game for you. Don't touch it if you prefer more casual experiences, if dying bothers you or if you don't like starting for the beginning on each run, without saves.Once you put that aside, it has a very deep meaning hidden behind those cartoonish graphics. The game will keep you on your toes, making you wonder what's next and how to overcome them. Even in adversity, a little of good luck can turn the tide of the battle, and making poor decisions is punishing.However, as you play, you'll develop new strategies, and find combinations and combinations of items that are going to help you survive the horrid world that is the basement. You'll get beams, lasers, chocolate and more to fight your enemies, which get increasingly hard. Even with bad luck, good reflexes and strategy will make you survive each run. "

												At first, once I bought this game, I thought it was quite fun, but quickly it sort of just became one of the games that I don't usually play. When that point in time is reached where you don't really feel like playing The Binding of Isaac anymore, it becomes a great game to play in short, spare time because of quick play. It requires you to really, not use tactics (doesn't help when you can't see what's in the rooms next to you), but to think about how you want to approach the game. This idea of 'approaching the game' includes: the character you choose to play (which affects much of how you play, depending on their stats) or the risks that you wish to take in the hopes of gaining a higher benefit. It might not seem very understandable in the way that I've put it, but any past players of this game should realise what I'm trying to say.This game has a lot to offer for players who want a difference and a challenge compared to other games. Nevertheless, the Binding of Isaac is a brilliant game and I recommend it to anyone that wishes to purchase this game.			"

												Do you like rougelikes? Great. Get this game.Do you hate rougelikes and got BoI to try to make yourself like it? Don't bother. This game will not convince you. It runs on the idea that you WILL go back to it and try to beat level after level. Thats great. Those that like that will love it.The art style has a childish creepiness that I honestly like. Each powerup changes issac a bit to add some kind of progression. The powerups are great by the way.If there was a mod that would auto save after each level I'd actually play it and most likely beat it.As far as I'm concerned this game only makes me wish the refund system existed when I bought it.No, I won't uninstall it. I want people to know I gave it a very fair shot several times.I even bought Wrath of the Lamb, but I do not know what it does.But just because I hated it does not mean you won't like it. if you like roguelikes this is literally the perfect game for you.I did not enjoy this experince. You'll be different. Go and save Issac because i will not bother attempting again.A silly following bomb with a trollface painted on it  / 10			"

												From the makers of Super Meat Boy comes this great, terryifyingly bizarre game. This game mixes overhead third person shooting with the dungeon exploration of the original Legend of Zelda. The is is a roguelike, meaning it has RPG like stats, randomly generated levels, and if you die you have to start all over. Various enemies require strategy and skill, and the bosses have the game feeling like a SHUMP bullet hell game at times. There are TONS of items and skills, that boost stats, changes your ammo, or giving you unique skills like shooting through walls. The game varies difficulty, sometimes being a walk in the park or frustratingly difficult, but it's pick up and play style mixed with the short game time and endless replayability make this a great game at a very cheap price.

												This game offers gameplay that will punish you for your major mistakes but allows you to learn from the small ones and that is where you grow. Most of the difficulty doesnt come from the enemies or the bosses bt it comes from learning how each item works and how to work with it because most of the items  you pick up you cannot get rid of ,meaning  that if you get an item that you hate you have to deal with it. Needless to say a wiki is a godsend when it comes to items and bosses beause some of the effects of the items are barely noticable unless you pay intense attention. Overall this game offers crushing but addictive gameplay , amazingly high replay value , and multiple endings making you wonder what just happened .			"

												At first, you start a new game and die. Then, you restart, and die again. But each time you start a new run, you know more, you have more experience and have more stuff unlocked. So, with a bit of luck (as levels are generated randomly), you can progress further. Your runs are longer, you die later, you reach lower levels of the basement and discover more and more of the secrets (and there are plenty of them, believe me).Very addictive and rewarding game, I don't think I've ever played a game in which dying was so motivating to start all over again.

												One of my favorite games of all time!The binding of Isaac is a rough like game, where you have to go through a sereis of rooms, in order to omplete a level.The game is acually difficult, amnd at times, you will have geat challanges to overcome, like bosses or big pulls of enemyes.The story is simple, you are playing as Isaac (or some of the charectes you can unlock) and has to escape Mom, becouse she is trying to kill you in gods name. The story is not really anything that matters for a game like this, but it is nice to know why Isaac is running around in a creappy basement, full of monsters.The controles are simple, you can move in any direction, and you can shot in four directions, up, down, left and right. Along the way you will find upgrades, that can make you shot in other directions, shot faster, do more damage, gain more life, get friends to shot together with you and many more items.The funny part about the items, is that they don`t tell you, what the item can do. You either have to look at your stats, or try to shot, in order to see what the item did for you. If nothing changes, it can get really diffecult to find out what the item did, and you have to remember what meny items did, so you don`t end up downgrading youself.There are also tarot cards, that do diffrent things like clearing rooms, make enemyes take damage, teleport ypu and many more things.There are diffrent roomes on the map, that do diffrent things.The plain rooms, are just a figting room, you have to kill all the enemeyes in a room, in order to countinue to a nother room.There is a sacrifice room, where you have to take damage, in order to get an item.There is the a shop, where you can buy items for coins, this can be health, weapons, tarot cards, nearly everything.Then there is a secret room, where you have to bomb away a wall, in order to get in. If you don`t have a map that shows you where this room is, you have to bomb random walls.There is an arcade, where you can gamble, with your money and win prices.Then there is a tressure room, where you unlock the door with a key, in order to get an item.And then there is the boss rooms, and this is where the real action happens. To advance in the game, you have to defeat a boss, and the bosses are random selected, based on whitch floor you are on. The bosses can be hard, and some can be easy, but I would say they all are very injoable.So about the diffeculty, it is not only due to hard mobs and bosses, but also becouse it is a rough like game, if you die, you die, no countinues. This can get you very frusterated at times, but it is also the charm of a rough like game. You will end up dying a lot, and if you don`t have the right items, or haven`t found anything speceail, the game will punish you for that.The game has fantastic music! I love evety single track, and I promiss you will too! The music are very atmosferic, and they are good to psyck you up.This is one of my favorite games, it is fun, addicting and overall a fantastc game, thumps up. 8 out of 10			"

THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME and rarely anyone dislikes it. And hey, its cheap so you won't lose a lot if you don't like it. You do spend a lot of time playing this game because its SO different everytime you play. Then if you buy the DLC its even MORE different and adds another 100+ hours to the game. Great game.

												If you liked Super Meat Boy, you'll love this game. The art style and punishing roguelike difficulty are attributed to the geniuses that are Edmund McMillen (of Team Meat) and Florian Himsl. The game is accompanied by the beautiful musical stylings of Danny Baranowsky (who also scored Super Meat Boy). Imagine Legend of Zelda, dungeons only, one life, with a dark, ""cute-grotesque"" art style. The more you play, the more items you'll be able to use. The more times you complete the game, the further you can progress. I can not recommend this game enough. Continually patched to add new things and fix bugs. The replayability is endless.			"

												It will creep you out, and disgust you, and make you wish you could have a physical copy just to burn it. But it's so fun. Think a rogue-like legend of zelda, minus 99% of the puzzles, since items are the only way to progress your character and the only experience points are the ones in steam badges. The bullet-hell style shooting is hard but fair, like the platforming in Super Meat Boy. Plus, now's a good time to buy for the loyalty discount on Binding of Issac: Rebirth. I'll leave the negative stuff to someone else. I hope I helped!			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a very lovely game. Despite its cute gooryness, its a very entertaining game with lots of items to upgrade one of the 5 unlockable characters.It fun to dodge and run trough all the little mutated babies, trying to kill them with your upgradable spit.The variety in items and enemies is really impressive. While playing i'm guarantiing you will be curious to see what comes next in each room you will enter, or seeiing how an item changes the appearance of your character.TIP: when taking an offer from satan, don't pick the cat item, it gives you 9 lives, but 1 life is just 1 heart unless you're looking to increase the difficulty of the game then go ahead:) "

This is the only game where you can defeat devil himself and die to a fly in the next room. Then swear to uninstall the game or swing at your computer but after 5 seconds proceed to play 10 more games.Game has a lot of replay value because of its randomized features and several unlockable characters, multiple endings, tons of enemy types and items and big learning curve.The music is superb, and the art style is charmingly disturbing as is the story.

												The concept behind this game is ridiculously easy to grasp. It's dark, it's light hearted, and you can literally play it forever. It has replay value through the roof, a ton of bosses and items that continually add to the game the more you play it, and it can be incredibly challenging.

												The Binding of Isaac is similar in a number of ways (difficulty, room layout, enemy types) to the original Legend of Zelda for the NES. The main difference being of course that this game is top-down shooter with largely random item/power-up drops, which changes gameplay considerably. I HEARTILY recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a serious challenge, wants massive replay value, and is not going to be driven away by the rogue-like elements and the clever, but unsettling art direction. I've laid out the most pertinent pros and cons below to give a better understanding of whether you'll want to play this game.Pros:Huge replay value (randomization, a number of unique playable characters, additional levels unlocked after beating the game)Great level and enemy design (despite being somewhat derivative of the original Zelda)Medium/High difficulty level (you have to work for it)Brilliant and meaningful achievement system (every achievement unlocks a new item to be obtained in-game)Cons:Occasional fps slowdown when a number of enemies are onscreen (can be fixed by reducing quality settings)Freezes occasionally when loading later levels (simply needs time to fix itself)There are a number of bugs related to ahievement unlocks in Steam, but seems have almost everything right in-game (playthroughs with one character count as wins with another, for example)Art style makes frequent references to abuse and other somewhat taboo themes and can be very unsettling at firstThe sheer number of items available can force a decision between on-the-fly play (with weird item interactions) and having the wiki open in the background to understand your items			"

												Story: A bit dark and filled with jabs at religion. That doesn't bother me, but the game is definitly not appropriate for a younger audience and those who don't take religion jokes lightly.  Also, some of the bosses/mobs are a bit gruesome and distrubing (but I dont mind!!).The game without the DLC has about 7 levels, takes me about an hour (on a good run) to beat the game. Considering that I have more than 20 hours into this game and have only beaten it 5 times :C. The trick to this game is that death is permanent for your current playthrough. Once you die you have to restart at the beginning and pray for good items. IF you aren't accustomed to the perma-death scenario I don't reccommend this game. I enjoy it purely because of the flexibility of the levels and the ever-changing drops. This game is a great game and has a good price imo.			"

No matter what genre you like, the Binding of Isaac is a spectacular game, and once the actual meaning of it becomes apparent as you play, you realize you're playing much more than just a game about a child's imagination.

												Lovingly frustrating but hampered by the flash engine.I love this game. Great artstyle, music and challenge. Finding out what items do and how they work together is joyous. The flash engine can be a pain sometimes and has slowdown from time-to-time as a result but that still can't completely take away from how fun this game is.Buy it.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is one of those games that grows on you. The first time I played Isaac I remember being frustrated and felt that I wasted two dollars. I never bothered to play beyond the basement. It's difficult for me to pinpoint what initially put me off from Isaac, but I chalk up my ignorance to an inability to progress. I didn't enjoy losing and quickly concluded the game was simply not for me. A couple years later one I was introduced to a livestreamer named LethalFrag. He often loaded up Binding of Isaac; one of his favorite games. While playing he often spoke highly of Isaac's replayability, soundtrack, and addictive gameplay. His praise helped me realize that Isaac deserved another look; and now I couldn't agree more with his assessment.  To appreciate The Binding of Isaac I needed to make some progress and unlock items. Dying stopped being so horrible as I faced each challenge and overcame them step by step. I understood that it was perfectly acceptable to lose; that's just part of the process. The trick was to pick myself up and learn from my mistakes. From there I was able to immerse myself in the gameplay. I've now logged over one hundred hours into the original Binding of Isaac and Wrath of the Lamb. I still find myself coming back for more. With the release of Rebirth I play the original far less often, but the newest ""Eternals"" update has got me back for what I expect will be another 100+ hours. TL;DR: The Binding of Isaac is unquestionably the best investment I've ever made on Steam. There's still plenty to appreciate, though Rebirth is now a much smoother experience.			"

												At first, once I bought this game, I thought it was quite fun, but quickly it sort of just became one of the games that I don't usually play. When that point in time is reached where you don't really feel like playing The Binding of Isaac anymore, it becomes a great game to play in short, spare time because of quick play. It requires you to really, not use tactics (doesn't help when you can't see what's in the rooms next to you), but to think about how you want to approach the game. This idea of 'approaching the game' includes: the character you choose to play (which affects much of how you play, depending on their stats) or the risks that you wish to take in the hopes of gaining a higher benefit. It might not seem very understandable in the way that I've put it, but any past players of this game should realise what I'm trying to say.This game has a lot to offer for players who want a difference and a challenge compared to other games. Nevertheless, the Binding of Isaac is a brilliant game and I recommend it to anyone that wishes to purchase this game.			"

												I'm just waiting for the nice men in white suits to escort me to rehab. In the mean time, I thought I would share my experience with future addicts.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It will destroy your life.I have lost sleep, skipped meals and needed to invest in a pee bag because of this atrocity. At no point during the research process was I warned that buying this game would result in a heroin-level addiction.If all the above hyperbole isn't a clear enough indication, this game is amazing, and Edmund McMillen is an evil genuis.You play as Isaac, a creative, imaginitive little boy who plays by himself and draws pictures while his mother watches Christian programming. One day The Lord(TM) speaks to her and asks her to kill Isaac to prove her faith. In his attempts to escape, Isaac finds his way into a cellar conveniently located underneath his bedroom. Now, his only way to escape is to venture down into the depths and battle his way through the hoardes of abominations that wait for him.As you join Isaac on his journey, you will find a multitude of upgrades and items that can help or hinder him on his quest to escape his lunatic mother and battle the wide variety of monsters that stand between him and that ultimate goal. This includes but is not limited to eating pills you find on the ground, consuming dog food (YUM!) and sticking toothpicks through your eyelids.In short, stock up on Slim-jims and Redbull, strap on a pee bag and prepare for one wild trip.PROS:-The controls couldn't get much simpler. Every time I play it brings me back to the days when I would blow my entire allowance on double-joystick arcade machines.-Wide range of upgrades, items, enemies and bosses.-Almost endless replayability.-The game is challenging, but not unfair. Victories are infinitely satisfying, failures only harden your resolve to do better on the next playthrough.-Battle enemies, put out fires and clean sh!t up with the power of tears!-The game is packed full of references, dark humor and WTFness that will make you LOL.CONS:-Despite the simple level and character designs, there are frequent drops in frame-rate when there are more than four enemies on screen. However, I wonder if this was a design choice rather than a bug, as this has resulted in Matrix-level projectile dodging in multiple playthroughs.-The noises some of the enemies make can be grating, but they tend to be dispatched so quickly that this isn't much of an issue.-The humor and themes presented in this game are not for everyone. If you're one of those Little House on the Prairie types, you expereience heart palpitations when people tell off-color jokes, or you take the Christian faith very seriously, choose a different title. This one is almost guaranteed to offend your delicate sensibilities.			"

It runs on the idea that you WILL go back to it and try to beat level after level. Thats great. Those that like that will love it.The art style has a childish creepiness that I honestly like. Each powerup changes issac a bit to add some kind of progression. The powerups are great by the way.If there was a mod that would auto save after each level I'd actually play it and most likely beat it.As far as I'm concerned this game only makes me wish the refund system existed when I bought it.No, I won't uninstall it. I want people to know I gave it a very fair shot several times.I even bought Wrath of the Lamb, but I do not know what it does.But just because I hated it does not mean you won't like it. if you like roguelikes this is literally the perfect game for you.I did not enjoy this experince.

												The Binding of Isaac is perhaps one of the most poorly coded games I've had the pleasure of playing and, despite that, I would heartily recommend it over most AAA titles.The game operates on the premise that your mother is out to kill you and you are trying to escape horrible, horrible death. So, you jump into the basement. This is where the game earns its keep. Isaac is a 2-D Top Down Shooter with randomly generated levels where death means the end of a run and your success can largely depend on the luck of the items randomly generated within those levels.The game is pretty much about avoiding damage while clearing rooms while finding upgrades so you can win the game. It rarely approaches the level of bullethell dodging, but mostly just relies on sheer variety of enemies & bosses to kill you, whether through that one bullet you walked into or the one fly who you ignored who rammed into you. Still, it's pretty much all dodgeable at the end of the day, with a few unfair moments. Still, that's what makes this roguelike so much fun.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a pretty faithful rogue-like title mixed with a twin stick shooter style dungeon crawler. Although rather than using twin analogue sticks you use WSAD and the arrow keys. On paper this only allows 4 directions of fire but the bullets actually respond to your characters momentum so they can be directed diagonally with well planned movement. In addition to being very competent in what it does, The Binding of Isaac has a ridiculous amount of content and secrets to discover.The game plays great and has wonderful replayability, but where it shines is in the background story and the atmosphere. The core theme is a very dark look at a fanatically religious mother and her abused/neglected son. I could easily understand the argument that I'm looking too deep into it, but if you let it get to you I think the story is as impacting and disturbing as the gameplay.			"

												Surprisingly fun, extremely satisfying, and utterly brilliant.The Binding of Issac is a mind-bogglingly simple, yet amazing game. Every dungeon is different, and so are the bosses. The game is never the same twice, and even if it way, i would still play it.Easy, fluid controls make glacking even the most stubborn fruitflies easy. A wonderful treasure room system changes the face of your character as well as your gaming experiance.

												The Binding of Isaac is a dark game as you can see in the screenshots. It's very fun (can get out of hand via ER MAH GERD). Can  be quite tricky and trust me its worth buying. Only $5 so super cheap for a game that is really good. NOTE: for all christians out there DO NOT buy this game because it includes Demons, the seven sins from the bible and your mum heard a voice of god saying to kill Isaac but if you want it, you have been warned! But still great game, I crafted the badge because it was great and I think i'll give it 10/10. This game was outstanding with the design in levels.

												This game... Oh goodness, this game.The basis for this game originates around a small story in the bible, where Abraham is told to kill his son, as an act of obedience; His son's name, of course is Isaac. Upon almost achieving this goal, an angel stops him, letting him know it was merely a test. It is known as one of the most controversial bits of the bible, so I assume that's what sparked the creator's desire to make this game.Your journey begins when your mother hears a voice from ""god"", asking a sacrifice of her son to prove her faith. Isaac hides by dropping into a newly found trapdoor and finds himself in the dangerous pit of the basement. There, he finds what could have been, and what probably will be.This saddening and dark atmosphere is lightened by it's sadistic power-up lineup and cartoony artwork. Items you can grab will give you benefits and change how your character looks, often leading to some crude jokes. Terrifying bosses aren't always this game's goal, instead it lets the gameplay do the talking. Often you'll find yourself not properly equipped to face up a certain room or boss. It really drives the helplessness of Isaac home.You can do multiple runs of this game, with each one never being a copy of one before. Sure, the same items have a chance of appearing, but it ultimately feels like it's own unique run. You may be doomed from the start, or destined for victory; It all depends on your skill and luck.The Wrath of the Lamb DLC provides a whopping amount of content. It introduces a new item type, adds new mobs, new floors and bosses, the works. It's essentially a new game.This game is worth the full $8 to experience it all.

												The Binding of Isaac is a fun and addictive flash game well worth the price you're paying for it.I have already put more hours in this simple little flash of 5 euros full priced than in a ''Next-gen revolutionary'' game.The gameplay is easy to learn and understand and the later levels are always challenging.But all good things must have a bad side.Once you get an fair amount of items the game starts dropping in framerate which can be a bit frustrating.Also the game can get really easy or really difficult depending on certain item drops.Such as the ''Mom's knife'' and ''Sacred Heart'' combo which basicly allows you to 1-shot almost all enemies in the game (Including bosses).Otherwise it is possible to receive only activateable items which you can only carry 1 of at a time, resulting in getting no proper stats making the game near-impossible to complete.All things set aside I think it's a great game which is fun to play or watch others play.The price can drop below 2 euros during steam sales so if you need a fun game that's easy to pick up, look no further!

												If Charles Manson played this game, he would definitely give it a 10/10What twisted minds did the developers of The Binding of Isaac have. How disturbing is a mother trying to kill her son who escaped to the basement, and can kill anything with his tears. Exploring the basement, you come across all sorts of horrendous monsters, decapitated cats’ heads, piles of faeces lying around and of course, your mother’s pads...among many other disturbing things.However once you become desensitized, this little game is pretty good. Going through each level, finding power-ups (or power-downs) to help you with the increasingly difficult monsters, ultimately fighting a boss to proceed to the next level of the basement.There is no continuity, so once you die, you start again from the beginning. Everything is randomly generated, so you will never have the same experience twice.It’s a really fun and interesting game, with alot of little references to other games -  You might find a pixelated pickaxe as a power-up, which of course, is Notch's pickaxe. You might come across a monster that spews toxic green acid, just like the one from Left for Dead 2 - and the list goes on.For the price you should certainly try this game out.My rating - 8/10			"

												In this game, you play as Isaac, a child who is terrified of his mother. Mainly because she has heard some ""divine voices"" that she claims to be God, that are telling her to kill you. As a consequence, you jump into your own basement, scared of your own mother, who has cornered you. In your basement, plagued with weird monsters like flies that shoot blood and spooky skeletons. What do you do to defend yourself from these monsters? That's right, you kill them. With your tears. Your tears.This game has the weirdest story of any game I have played yet, by far. But all jokes aside, it's a great game that offers a wide range of achievements for any hunter out there. The rogue-like action apparently based on early Zelda games is great, and the DLC only makes the game much more enjoyable, long, and about ten times harder. I would reccomend this game to anyone with a few hours (or days) to spare, looking for an enjoyable way to kill time.			"

												When I bought this game I didn't think about spending a lot of time by playing it. But as far as I was playing i wanted more and more. This game is really awesome and have random system that gives player the gift of the lack of boredom.Soundtrack is one of the best parts of this game. Can't stop listening to it.+ Mechanics+ Monsters and bosses + Items and ideas + Soundtrack <3 + Come on it's Isaac!SPOILER!!!!- After defeating Issac we have to fight with ???. These ones are similiar to each so that's not really splendid work, but at least it's harder than Issac itself.10/10 IMO			"

It wasnt untill i didnt play it for about a week after my first time that i started to feel an urge to play it again ( it doesnt help that i was watching a lot of streams of a guy who played it a lot) and this time when i went back to the game i found my self enjoying the game, yeah i was still dieing a hella load ( i think i had around 40 deaths before i killed moms foot for the first time) but i wasnt raging about it, i was just thinking "" huh so thats what this little bugger does well imma getcha next time mister""  and with the randomness of the items and the lackj of explination of what they do, i felt my self enjoying finding new items and figuring out what they do on my own, like an adventure, it was a sad day when i knew what all the items and trinkets and cards did.  For those who are checking this game out because of rebirth i highly recommend you get  this game and play it first, it is a great way to get the feel how the game plays and what it was like before we got them fancy pancy 16 bit graphicsReveiw word of the day : Randomness			"

												Edmund Mcmillian, you did another successful job of making another indie game. Binding of Isaac is an adventure and a lot of relegious things including the title. The story gets better and makes more sensesince the beginning isnt enough. The story is about you (Isaac) and your mother just chillin until your mother thinks God is talking to her and tells her to get rid of everything in your life since they are sins of his life. So she obeyed 'God' and took everything in Isaac's life (including his cloths and your naked the whole game). 'God' now tells her to go KILL Isaac if she truly loves 'God' more than Isaac. Well guess what she literally grabbed a knife and attempted to barge in his room. Luckly, Isaac finds a basement door in his room and your adventure starts.As you go through the basement, you encounter enemies which you kill them by SHOOTING YOUR OWN TEARS (total logic).You also find items which most of them help you by increasing speed, length of tears and damage. and give you wings.There are special rooms like stores, death chambers and challenge rooms this is how you get to those 3 rooms:Store: open it with a key or if theres a secret room beside it, just cheat and blow up the wall beside the store.Death Chamber: a room with only spikes, if your stupid enough (joke) to go to the spike and attempt to kill yourself, you actually can make a chest appear.Challenge room: if you beat the room beside the challenge room without taking damage, you can get in.Health in this game is hard to get since you start with 3 hearts and finding them wont be easy. Now let's see how long you can survive under your house besides being a 2-floor basement.I give this game 9 out of 10 due to the difficulity and the most shocking thing about the game is that theres 7 characters (all mentioned in the bible) and you gotta beat the entire game 32 TIMES IN TOTAL. So have fun i know you can do it (not).			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike indie game devloped by Edmund McMillen, which I have owned for a few years. It presents a unique stoyline, focusing around Isaac, a small boy who it is presumed wishes for his mother's affection. As the game has a heavy religion focus, a god speaks to his mother with the order to end Isaac's life. Isaac, fearful of his mother finds a hidden trapdoor in his room, and delves into the depths of what is under the house. The game itself is mainly skill based, but partially luck based. Certain combinations of items can ensure an easy and victorious playthrough while other item comboes make a challenging and tedious one.  It contains endless tilesets aswell as a total of 11 different settings along with 7 characters. This game is insanely fun, and provides a testament to your dodging skills. There are many more positive things I can say about this game, but I advise you pick it up and find out yourself ;)			"

												The Binding of Isaac is by far my favorite game of all time. The gameplay  is smooth, with a bit of lag from here to there, but that really doesn't matter. Level floors are randomly generated. So many unique items, and such different ways to play. Besides Isaac there are six different characters to play as, each having there own pros and cons. The game is also mac compatible, which is great. The game is only 5.00 and the DLC is 3.00 dollars. I am amazed on how well Edmund McMillen did with this game and I can't wait for the remake!			"

												This game is great. There is a grotesque atmosphere when it comes to the games contents, but the controls are easy and quick to learn. Fans of the gameboy versions of Zelda will find this game to be very enjoyable. There are many similarities between the two games. The game is like a series of dungeons. Each time you beat the dungeon you get one of over 250 power ups. There is a lot of replayability in the game because of the different variations of power ups you can have. Each time you play, it is like starting with a new hero. You just have to make use of what you stumble upon.			"

												Autism is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and verbal and non-verbal communication, and by restricted, repetitive or stereotyped behavior. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old.[2] Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.[3] It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum (ASDs), the other two being Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.[4] Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations, or by rare combinations of common genetic variants.[5] In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects.[6] Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes, such as heavy metals, pesticides or childhood vaccines;[7] the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence.[8] The prevalence of autism is about 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report 20 per 1,000 children in the United States are diagnosed with ASD as of 2012 (up from 11 per 1,000 in 2008).[7][9][10] The number of people diagnosed with autism has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses;[10] the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.[11] Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.[12] The signs usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first develop more normally and then regress.[13] Early behavioral, cognitive, or speech interventions can help autistic children gain self-care, social, and communication skills.[12] Although there is no known cure,[12] there have been reported cases of children who recovered.[14] Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.[15] An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.[16] "

												Pretty awesome game here.  This plus the Wrath of the Lamb DLC will provide many many hours of fun.  It takes a decent bit of learning what items do what, and you'll die a lot, but every run is a fresh take with new things thrown at you.  I really enjoy it and like a good challenge, but sometimes you can just get very unlucky with the drops you're given.  On the other hand you can get very lucky and feel overpowered until you go down deep enough and die anyway from a new boss you haven't fought yet.Overall though, pretty great. 9/10			"

												The Binding of Isaac. Top down shooter roguelike dungeon crawler shoot em up, wakka wakka other stuff. If you're into games with lots of RNG and a bit of skill as well as a healthy dose of morbidity then you'll probably want to pick this up.This game has some pretty solid controls, stylized artwork and great gameplay, but it's a flash game and as a result doesn't run super dooper well even if you have a beast machine.The basic plot is that you're a child and your momma is tryina keel ya. You jump in the basement...which the entrance is apparently in your room...and you go around killing the abominations that your mom apparently keeps stored down there. I can't really say much else as far as that goes because it would spoil the game...kind of...although that's pretty much it. Along the way you pick up random ♥♥♥♥ lying around and ♥♥♥♥ yourself up with it. Literally. At one point you'll probably get the coat hanger and jam it through your skull. I think the whole self mutilation thing is the most interesting aspect of the game because it's not overly done and it's an interesting way to 'upgrade' your character. It's visually fun to upgrade so to say.There's also a plethora of unlockables including different characters and mushrooms and alternate endings. This game has over 10 endings...shame they all suck. As far as that goes, most of the endings are generic 'unlock' endings and then some weird music. The ones that aren't unlock endings are 'left to speculation' which in my opinion is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to be a lazy writer.The controls are simply. AWSD to move and Cursor keys(or mouse) to shoot. Shift drops a bomb and space uses items. Real simple and well implemented. No problems here.Each time you start a playthrough the rooms are randomly organized, but will always be square. The games not 'fully randomized' but follows the generic 'procedurally generated' system with pre built rooms that are randomly arranged with random monsters. Even the monster placement is static, but that's so the game isn't an ♥♥♥ to you and have a monster spawn on top of you I guess.Another great aspect is the soundtrack. It fits very well into the game with a series of 'darker' themed tracks. The best track is ultimately the final few bosses of course, but the rest really set the mood.There are quite a few uppies for this game and not a whole lot of downies.Uppies:Solid controls.Interesting graphics and graphical concepts(upgrading yourself by mutilating yourself).Great soundtrack.RNG is well put together.Fairly well balanced game.Memorable enemies and upgrades/items.Good AI (not great, just good).Downies:Overarching plot is lazy and overal just lame.Level design is bland even for a game that's supposed to be dark and dreary. (Just because it's supposed to be horror doesn't mean you can't have a ♥♥♥♥ING FOREST. SPLATTERHOUSE HAD A FOREST LEVEL AND IT HAD WATER.)Unique bosses are mostly just reskins.And that's it! This game was worth about 15 bucks to me, but you'll likely get it around 2.50 if you buy it on sale. I feel it's definitely worth the 5 bucks. As far as the expansion, it's more DLC oriented as it's 'more of the same', but it's cheap and also worth it IMO.			"

												Edmund McMillen is a freaking genius, Part 2. (For Redux version go here.)'Isaac' is simply the best rogue-like I've ever played. Even with slightly more rogue-like experience under my belt now, I still love to go back to this game. It sets the bar freaking high.Released just under a year after Super Meat Boy, with a jumbo DLC expansion another year after that, the game plays like a top-down dungeon-crawler-shooter with randomised levels - no 2 playthroughs are exactly the same! (Unless you use a certain program that can pull the map seeds, but that's a different story.)The base game itself was very good, difficult at first but gets slightly easier as you unlock the more OP items and collectibles. The DLC adds a ton more content. Not to say that the items take away from the difficulty of the game though - some levels with the new Wrath monsters (and quite a few of the old monsters as well) feel somewhat akin to bullet curtain-like games.The only real gripe I have with this is that I cannot save my game mid-way! It's still a small flaw, and one that is corrected in its remake, 'The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth'. :)In the meantime, to circumvent this during super epic games, I recommend hibernating your computer with the game still running. Okay, well, my computer has survived the hibernation, but I'm not sure about yours...Well, okay, one more gripe - the game engine is in Flash, which is laggy at times and hard to play. For the most part though I didn't have any problems or let that detract from the fun of the game.If you can get this and the DLC for a cheap price, a must buy. It has possibly one of the highest ratios of time spent in game to money spent on game. (Excluding F2Ps, of course.)When to buy In May 2015, an all-new hard mode (Edmund M has called it names ranging from ""Trololololol hell mode"" to ""Florian's ♥♥♥♥ You Mod"") was released for owners of the WotL DLC - and it is hard as heck. You'll probably spend a lot of time trying to beat this mode with all characters, even if you are a veteran. Getting it on a steep discount will give you a lot of hours worth of gameplay for your dollar, but even full price for both game and DLC is not such a bad idea - Florian deserves to be rewarded for his new fiendishly unfair eternal manifestations. I genuinely mean that. It got me to re-look at, and re-evaluate, an old game which I thought I was done with.9.5/10 "

For more reviews and gameplay videos by Morgoth, check out the profile or the Twitch channel at twitch.tv/morgoth0221I'm not sure I can accurately describe how much I respect this game.  And alright, I'll say it, I LOVE this game.  Or to be more accurate, I am ADDICTED to this game.  I want to say I hate it's brutal unforgiving difficulty (especially after you hit the last treasure room and you get the poop or some equally useless item and yes there are more useless items than the poop), but in all reality, it is it's randomness and roguelike nature that made me fall in love with it.  The enemies are incredibly varied for a game style that is so simplistic and yet beautiful.  The story, captivating to the point that it has spawned HUNDREDS of theories on what the hell is really going on in Isaac's nightmarish world.  This is truly a once in a lifetime type of game in how magnificent it is and how well it keeps dragging you back in until you've beaten EVERYTHING.  You beat Mom?  Good job!  But did you really kill her?You beat her heart?  Awesome!  But how many times did you kill it?  Not enough...You beat It Lives??  Wow, you're really dedicated!  But Satan is still laughing at you...Satan has been brought down???  Time for a real challenge in yourself...You killed yourself????  Incredible!!  But the real last boss is still crying in his chest...Of course the main reason I keep coming back are the items.  THE ITEMS!!!  The activated items, the trinkets, the bombs, the tarot cards, every item is unique and forces you to play with a certain strategy.  Yes there are ""crap"" items, but if there is one thing I've learned, it is to never give up on a run.  I learned that one by obtaining the incredible combo of Polyphemus and Brimstone.  And you never know what you're going to stumble upon in Isaac's world.I've put 70 hours into Fallout 3, 45 into Dark Souls, and 70+ hours into Binding of Isaac.  I'm not saying it's a better game than either of those, but those numbers should speak for themselves.  Score: 9.5/10 (damn poop)			"

												A beautifully made game that is amazing in almost every way. Aside from the fact that you can't save, it is still absolutely wonderful! The graphics, design, randomness of the items and location, and the way it increasingly gets difficult. The Binding of Issac pulls you in. It is like an addiction that cannot be satisfied until the game is beaten, and the way that you cannot save just fuels the addiction more to beat the game. Imagine being on the last level fighting against the boss. You are left with only half a heart left and the boss with only less then 6% of health. Almost to the end you get hit. You die. Game over.Time to restart... Again.			"

												This game is so amazing. It looks really boring to people, but they don't understand. This game is so creative, and challenging! You expect so little of it, but it's just a huge game with so many moments that make you go crazy and so many moments that make you so excited and giggly. There are items that can touch you, personally, and they all have their own meaning. Each boss is different and the further you progress the harder they get. It has so much replay-ability as well! I got Platinum God recently, and it's still fun to play! The Binding of Isaac is by far, my favorite game on Steam, and maybe even my favorite game ever. You really should get it, it's such a journey, and it's so cheap. I can't wait for Rebirth, it's going to be AMAZING, just like this is.			"

												A really fun game.  You play as a young child who constantly gets bullied by his mother.  He is ridiculed at school and everyone around him defecates on him.  The goal of this game is to progress through floors of your basement in order to kill your mum - the big poo monster.  It is fun to just chill in your house and play.  There is a wide range of items to collect in the game which help you on a run such as trinkets or cards.  There are also 5 characters other than Isaac which are unlocked via various methods.  Overall I would give this an 8.5/10.  The music and visuals are brilliant.  The levels are randomly generated to some extent.  The one downside to me would be that it gets repetitive but the range of characters can make up for it.			"
