												I gave up WoW (or World of Warcraft) For this game. Why? You only need one character to play every class. The classes build off of eachother to add diversity to your play style as well as to upgade into more role focused jobs. You can craft your own gear, you can make your own food and you can play 90% of the game ALL BY YOURSELF! You don't have to be in a guild or part of a click. The people who play this game are shockingly friendly and supportive. Dungeons are part of a finder in game. The story line is epic and the cinematics are breathtakeing. The opening video almost had me in tears just because I knew what was happening without any words. Square has really outdone themselves with this title and I can't wait to see how they wow me with FFXV!Edit: As per a commented question, The sub options come in 30/90/180 day increments and can be set up as recurring (thanks Pasty858). 180 days is roughly $78.Also, anyone who would like to share in the recruit a friend benefits, message me.SO! Its been a while since I've played. after logging over 200 hours that weren't counted on here, and doing everything short of Savage content, I have to say that I never thought I would play a game that would tug my heart strings so much again. But this game. The most recent MSQ line just keeps the punches coming. It was amazing! If you love FF games, you must give this one at least a one month (or 14day) trial period!			"

9/10 - Would Manderville again.This review was written based on version 3.0Pros:Consistent, large patches about every 3 months.Gorgeous graphics engine. Deep crafting system.Probably the best storytelling in an MMO I've ever seen (but it does take 30+ hour to really get into the meat of it)One of the most friendly gaming communities around.Cross-platform play with the PS3 and PS4, excellent controller support for PC.Possible to play casually and still enjoy/experience the game with hardcore friends.Hildebrand - Game doesn't take itself too seriously and just has fun.Neutral:Game doesn't reinvent the MMO wheel. It is a pretty standard ""theme park"" MMO. That being said, it is extremely polished and everything in the game is executed very well.Subscription model, I was almost tempted to put this in the Pros column. One of the few games to do this model well in a sea of F2P MMOs.Cons:Tens of hours of monotonous fetch quests sprinkled throughout the game. Usual MMO fare.Long PvP queues, slightly unbalanced. (Not enough people play PvP)Endgame content can be very grindy at times. (Ex: Relic Weapons, and ""Run the same 2 dungeons over and over to get currency to buy gear"".)Gil sellers - I realize this happens in pretty much every MMO. This didn't make the list because it happens, it is strictly on the list because of advertising chat spam. On an average day you will see a lot of messages (unless you're like me and are so fed up with it you go /away). Expect the spam to be cranked up to 11 whenever a large piece of content is released. I really feel SE could implement better countermeasures with respect to advertising. It does seem worse than in many of it's other AAA MMO competitors. On a side note, I'm told the JP servers are practically gil seller free. I've never tested this myself however. Overall, not a huge con, but an annoyance none the less. "

												I've never been an MMO player. Briefly played Tera - liked it but found progression slow - and briefly WoW - disliked the combat, just felt like button mashing. I also played Mabinogi for a short while and really disliked the game's mechanics. One day I felt the urge to play one and I knew a friend was planning to start this so I bought it but neither of us started. 9 days ago a friend of mine was looking for people who wanted to start and I decided that if it was in my steam list I may as well try it out. I am now 95.9 hours in according to steam and I love it. I've just hit level 50 and got my Paladin armour and I'm still looking at all the content coming up. As I speak server is going down to patch even more content into the game. So here's the detailed review:StoryThe story is a good one as far as MMOs go (based on my limited experience). I'd equate it to WoW in some ways as FFXIV builds off of an already established lore but is still extremely easy for new players to get into. I don't want to say much about it but Square Enix really put work into making a good story. It teeters a bit at times, especially around the middle (lv30-40 is a bit slow) but it's very enjoyable if you get into it.ClassesCombat classes are fairly traditional: tank, support, ranged DPS and melee DPS. Still within these wider definitions, each individual class is fairly unique. To add to this you are not restricted to the classes that you pick at the beginning of the game. You will unlock the ability to train any and all classses as you wish which allows for a lot of flexibility. But ""Oh, the grind ¬¬"" you say. Nope, all classes trained beyond the first receive exp gain bonuses which really speeds up the process. This is alongside the quick levelling options which I'll discuss in a later section. There's more though! All combat classses have a progression called a ""Job"" which is earned by reaching a certain point in the story, getting a class to lv30 and the corresponding second class to lv15, and then finishing the job quest. It's actually really easy to do and it encourages you to try a different role.All combat classes are unique and don't overlap much at all which is great.As for crafting classes, there's a fair few of them and I have limited experience of them right now but crafting itself isn't just sit there and wait for things to appear. There's an active process and is fairly enjoyable. Just like the combat classes, new skills are unlocked and it becomes a sort of strategic minigame. Quick synthesis for bulk items is available as well so you don't have to do it for each item.Still I can see crafting becoming tedious. repetitive and boring at some point but that's no different from any other mmo. Also, unlike the combat classes, the crafting classes aren't really unique.CombatThe combat system is targetted, which honestly I was sceptical about when first going in as I'm not a big fan of targetted combat but it grows on you. This is mostly to do with how the game feels since you really have to think about movement, positioning, skill orders, skill timing etc. from more or less the beginning of the game. This is a big deal and playing the first 20 or so levels in WoW feels boring and just mashing buttons in a certain order. The 2.5sec global cooldown adds to the strategic element of it too. You have more time to think and decide what move would be appropriate, but you also have a longer window to be punished for choosing the wrong skill. I honestly think this is way more fun and interesting compared to other games with a much smaller global cooldown.Another important point is that this game is very controller friendly. It's on the PS3/PS4 with cross platform support so that would be why. I personally play with a controller and it feels very smooth. I don't feel too overwhelmed with skills and I've unlocked all of them for my job with 3 cross skills in use as well (I have 2 full hotbars but it's very easy to switch between them). It's down to preference in the end but the option is really nice to have.LevellingThere are so many different ways to level it's crazy. Though the main story quest is compulsory, there are loads of side quests available.If you think quests are repetitive you can switch over to doing FATES which are events that spawn that give gil (money) and experience to everyone that completes them based on the level of participation.If that's boring there are many different dungeons to do with solid exp gain on all of them. Duty roullete will give you bonus exp once a day so deffo worth doing that.No? Then you can do levequests which are contracts to do certain things in certain places which you can get by using one of your levequest allowances (which refill regularly). Levequests are available to crafting classes too and are considered the fastest ways to level them.Still not enough? Then Guildhests might be for you. These are very similar to levequests but you're put into a duty (instance) with a party and asked to do it as a group. There's a daily bonus on guildhest roullete as well so that's good.Also, the first time you do a certain dungeon, levequest or guildhest you'll be granted bonus exp which is always a definite plus.Still too slow? Not enough content? Too repetitive? Well if you're that hard to please then I guess I should tell you that there are these things called logs which grant bonus exp for doing certain things. A hunting log will ask you to kill x number of y, while a crafting log will give you the list of everything you can craft. The king of all these is the challenge log which refreshes weekly and gives you a lot of exp for completing tasks like ""complete 3 dungeons"" or ""complete 5 levequests"".Honestly there are so many different ways to level that players can pick something that suits them and though some can get repetitive they're fun for the most part.EndgameYou only need to google the game to see the amount of post lv50 content. The game's been out for about a year and there are things constantly being added. The first expansion is coming out soon so keep an eye out for that. Most people will tell you that lv50 is just the beginning, and they're probably right. I'm only just getting into the endgame and I look forward to everything coming up.PriceWell. This is the one major downside I see to the game. It's very expensive. Though nothing new for an mmo, it is a pretty heavy financial commitment compared to most other steam games out there. Especially considering you can get Tera, Mabinogi, and loads of other mmos for free now. You can buy gametime online from other sellers for a bit cheaper but it's still expensive. I suggest playing the trial to give you a better understanding of whether you'll enjoy it. I highly suggest it and will be playing it, but I can appreciate that a few years ago I could never afford to play a game like this.ConclusionI honestly think this is the first mmo to seriously impress me with its ability to keep you interested. It doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it leave you with nothing to do. Bosses are often really cool and have interesting mechanics, even from an early point in the game. I really do feel that besides the price this game is practically perfect. It's a great game - buy it if you can.			"

												I was a WoW player. I played every expansion, I did HC/Mythic raiding, I spent thousands of hours playing it. If I could go back and get this on launch day instead, I would do it in a heart beat.If you are an MMO players, this  is hands down the best MMO on the market.  I've played every major MMO since Ultima Online back in the 90s. FFXIV has every element you could want in an MMO and executes them extremely well.The class system, all classes being available on a single character, is amazing. No alts, not that you can't have them, you just don't need them.The story is captivating, you actually want to read the quests and see what happens rather than just click through to get the objectives.Speak of quests, there are a ton, even without the myriad of side quests, and only completeing the main story, you can reach level cap on a class. Then roll in dungeons, raids, leves, hunting logs, challenge log, etc etc etc there is never a shortage of things to do, and they have made all of them entertaining.If you like MMOs even a little bit, stop reading and click the buy button. Really, stop.Why are you still reading. Stop it! Go play FFXIV, seriously.			"

												Final Fantasy XIV, the original one, was a mess. The servers were terrible, payments were unfair and confusing, and the game just made it so difficult for you to enjoy. Square Enix realised, ""holy hell, this is bad"" and revamped the game, leading to the release of A Realm Reborn. And boy did they do good.A Realm Reborn is not only a more polished FF XIV, it is a new game. It offers so much more than the original. Better service, better gameplay, more engrossing quests, everything an MMO can offer is in this game. A Realm Reborn is by far the best Final Fantasy of the last console generation, and it is perhaps the best FF I have ever played. It stays true to it's roots, but still manages to not be a total copy cat of previous FF games. It borrows alot from the orginal series, when Final Fantasy was at it's best, but adds a sense of freshness so that FF new-comers could pick up the game and play it as their first FF and still have a wonderful experience.Detail is where this game excells. The amount of effort into making this as refined as possible is staggering. You could honestly sit at the character creation screen for an hour, picking the tiniest things about your hero. The environments are fantastic, and it's hard to believe that an MMO looks this good. As well as being the best Final Fantasy in years, it is also groundbreaking in the MMO genre. It offers so much to the genre as a whole, it has made a name for it's self as one of the greatest MMOs in recent years. It is addicting. It is enchanting. It is simply bliss.Square Enix have really made me regain my faith in them, and I hope that they let future Final Fantasies learn from A Realm Reborn. I cannot wait until more content is added into the game, and clock in a few more hours. Get yourself this game now, even just for the free trial, it's worth it. Even if you're a hardcore FF fan, or a newcomer looking for a game to start with. This is the one.+ Essentially has it all. Near enough limitless gameplay hours+ Environments look stunning, attention to detail is incredible+ Smooth gameplay, easy to learn mechanics+ Makes great homage to previous Final Fantasy games- A lot of fetch quests- Occasional bug here and there10/10. This is a fantastic game. Get it. Now.			"

												TL;DR A fantastic, beautiful, well thought out MMO, with amazing polish, a great community and a bright future! - TL;DR Bullet Points -PROS:+ Great and friendly community+ Good looking and well optimised, with extensive graphical options+ No need for multiple characters, one character can play ANY of the in game classes, and switch at will+ Gorgeous world with deep lore+ In depth crafting system with great reward + Huge main story, which feels like a true Final Fantasy storyCONS:- Loading screens in the world, due to PS3 client limitations (worlds are shared)- Sometimes overwhelming UI - Possible overwhelming number of classes on one character, can be difficult to keep track and keep focus- Monthly fee, which may put some people off- Big time investment required to get to enjoy everything in the game (as with any MMO) - The long written part! -Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is the completely reworked and almost entirely remade version of Square Enix's latest MMO. Initially it came out, just as Final Fantasy XIV, on the 22nd of September 2010. Unfortunately, it was absolutely terrible, and is still regarded as one of the worst MMO's in recent years, if not ever. The UI was particularly bad, but the problems were pretty much onmipresent. Graphcis were gorgeous but ridiculously unoptimised, bad gameplay mechanics, etc. However! This is NOT that game! I can't stress this enough!In December 2010, Naoki Yoshida was brought in as the new Director and producer, to try and make the game better. While some of these changes did start to make the game more playable, Square Enix, feeling (rightly so, some would say) very ashamed about this initial release (which I will call 1.0 from now on), and also worried about the damage it would do to the Final Fantasy brand, deciced to close down this game and completely rebuild it from the ground up. The servers for 1.0 closed on November the 11th 2012. The rerelease, called A Realm Reborn (the current game!), launched on August 27th 2013, with a PS3 version coming out on the same day. With the transition to the new game, Square implemented lots of cool in game lore explanations for the upcoming dramatic changes, and it is now a part of the game's story (which I think is really cool).ARR is a fantastic MMO in nearly every aspect. It does, of course, have it's problems, but I have yet to find an MMO which doesn't (not even WoW). I have been playing MMO's since Everquest, and would say ARR is now my favourite of them all, from WoW to EQ to SWTOR to EVE, etc. I feel they have gotten the formula just right.For the purchase on Steam you get the game itself, along with a month of playtime, so I would definitely recommend this if you think it might be for you (there is also a trial on the Square Enix website, but this would mean you don't have to reinstall if youstick with it!). In terms of gameplay, it follows what I think would be fairly described as a rough following of the Western style MMO formula, with some key differences: - Classes are not ""one-per-character"". On your character you can switch between and unlock every single combat, gathering and crafting class within the game, and even use some of the skills you have unlocked cross-class. It's actively encouraged to do this, and having more than one character is not really of any use, unless you just wish to have characters of different races, or something like that.- Great matchmaking system for instanced content, all instanced content can be tackled using player made groups, or with the ingame matchmaking. It has (for me at least) always been efficient and works well to build groups for all content that needs it.- Levelling feels reasonably varied. There are lots of different ways to level, from simple mob grinding (not recommended!), Main Story Quests, side quests, Levequests (repeatable minor tasks), dungeons, exploring, FATE's (random area specific objectives), etc. If you start to feel tired of levelling your ""main"" class, you can switch and level some of your crafting classes, or a different combat one, etc.- Storyline makes the game feel like a true Final Fantasy game, the Main Story Quests (of which there are many) contain the games main story (although there are plenty of side stories within the games guilds, etc), which, without giving any spoilers, is very enjoyable and definitely held my interest far more than anything like this in any MMO's I have seen, with the exception of maybe SWTOR. Definitely feels like a more story oriented game, which I love. I feel your character has a much more grounded place in the game world!- Combat, combat is somewhat similar to WoW in the most basic sense, abilities come on a bar, and are used in whichever way you want to fight enemies, heal allies, etc. The global tick rate (global cooldown) is longer than WoW, so if you are used to WoW, you might find it a bit slow to begin with. The abilites in game feel varied and are unlocked at a steady rate, letting you get slowly used to the class you play until you reach endgame. - UI, the UI is reasonably good. It provides all of the information you need, but is probably the one point I feel needs the most work. Once you get used to it, it's completely fine, but can be a bit confusing to begin with. It can sometimes feel like there are a lot of menus to click through, but the improvement from 1.0 is so huge, and it does do the job, that I feel it can be overlooked a bit. - Game World, the world is beautiful and full of diverse environment. The world is very large, and definitely worth exploring. One issue, is that (mainly at least) because the game is currently supported on PS3 (though this may change in the future), a lot of the world is accessed through loading screens. If you are expecting a WoW-esque free world with no loading screens, you may be dissapointed. To me, it's not a massive deal, but I know for some it could be a problem. The loading screens are not long and I don't feel it detracts much from the overall experience. It is also something that has been mentioned by the devs which could change in the future. For me, the quality of the world is enough to let me look past this problem, but for you it may be different.- Crafting/Gathering, for me, ARR has one of the best crafting systems I have seen in an MMO. Crafting is done with individual classes representing the different professions, for example Armorsmithing, Cooking, Leatherworking, etc. Gathering is done in a similar fashion with regard to classes, Miner, Botanist and Fisher. The crafting system is very satisying, useful to the actual game experience (not just a money sink, or waste of time), and very complex at the higher levels, with apporpriate levels of reward! The crafting and gathering classes can all be acquired, just like the combat classes, making for a character which is very diverse and can (technically, if you have enough time!) do everything in the game without the need for alts.- Updates, the game recieves frequent, and large updates. There have been big chunks of content added on a regular schedule, which I would say, puts other MMO's, especially WoW, to shame. The updates come frequently and add lots of content, making it worth the monthly fee, and meaning you never run out of things to do.Overall I would give this game a 9/10. I think that with a few improvements to the UI and world loading, aswell as minor things like balancing, this could easily be the best MMO that currently exists, and I would heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre. If you ever decide to play and need a friend, just PM me on Steam and I can help you in game!			"

												Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG. The rebooted/revamped version of the atrocious Final Fantasy XIV, and the 100th billionth game in the Final Fantasy franchise. FFXIV:ARR is much like what WoW used to be when WoW was good. They took much of what made WoW great back in vanilla/The Burning Crusade and used it to shape FFXIV:ARR, adding a modern touch on top. After the failure of Final Fantasy XIV, Square Enix got rid of most of the development team and learnt from their mistakes. What they've ended up with is an amazing MMO with tons of content and fine details to keep you playing for months. The game offers a unique class system much like FFXI, where you're free to change your class at any time you wish, by simply changing your weapon to that of the class you wish to equip. There's 9 classes to choose from, with each playing a different role: tanks, healers, and DPS's. Each of these classes later turn into jobs, offering more abilities for you to gain and unlock. There's also 8 crafting classes, and 3 gathering classes available. The game is filled with various dungeons, raids, and trials which are essentially boss fights. Many MMOs lack true end game content, however FFXIV:ARR is mostly focused on end game content. Many consider the game to not start until you reach level 50 (which takes anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on how you play and how often you play). The game offers many dungeons for leveling, and even more for late game. Many of which are harder versions of leveling dungeons. On top of this, there's multiple raids ranging from your traditional raids with many players (24 in this case), or smaller 8 player raids. Finally, for those who love boss fights there's plenty of trials to keep you entertained. These are mostly primal fights with varying levels of difficulty. There's tons of gear in the game each offering unique looks, allowing for huge amounts of customisation. In terms of character customisation, there’s quite a few options for you to choose from. There’s 5 different races, with each offering two sub-races of sorts. For example, your traditional “human” race has both midlanders and highlanders. The game does not offer sliders for things such as eye shape, nose shape, etc., but instead has four different types for you to select, with each sub-race having a different selection. As well as this, there’s plenty of hairstyles for you to choose from, with a wide range of colours to select as well as a highlight colour. The game’s OST is absolutely amazing, and possibly one of the best I’ve ever heard in a game. There’s tons of tracks with unique songs for each field location, dungeon, trial, raid, and everything else.  I highly recommend checking it out, even if you do not purchase the game.  The game is updated every couple of months adding more items, dungeons, primal fights, new music, and much more. So there’s always plenty to do. FFXIV:ARR is subscription based. You can pay $12/month for 1 character per world, with a maximum of 8 characters. Or you can pay $15/month for 8 characters per world, with a maximum of 42 characters. Though with the way classes work, you won’t be needing more than a single character usually, so the limit is hardly an issue. Some people are turned off by subscription fees, however $12/month is a small price to pay for such a great game, which constantly gets more content. The lack of F2P or B2P also prevents P2W aspects, and usually means the community is better in general. Overall, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn has to be the best MMORPG I’ve ever played. The sheer amount of content has kept me hooked for over 400 hours, and will continue to do so as the months go on. If you’re looking for a great MMORPG to play, and have the money to invest, I could not recommend this more.			"

												I can usually write full reviews for games on Steam, but after playing 2 years worth and nearly 3000 hours of this game it still manages to stump me. I simply cannot explain how much of an incredible feat of the MMO genre this is - honestly. I've played my fair share of MMOs, free-to-play and buy-to-play, but this tops everything.  I have never felt a game be so deserving of a subscription fee in my life. Not even just for the game, but this has by far the friendliest community I've ever seen, and I'm proud to be a part of it. You want to join the game from no knowledge at all? Go and PM almost anyone and they'll willingly help you understand whatever it is you want to know. Don't know the strats in a fight? Shout ""First time here"" and someone will either explain or dive right in to let you have that experience yourself (which is always incredibly fun). The community is just an extremely light hearted and fun one to be around - with a brilliant hardcore section for raiders too if thats your thing!Ever created a character and thought ""Damn, I want to play a tank but I don't want to play it all the time"" ? No worries! As soon as you hit level 10 on your first class, run to another class' guild hall and sign on up! You can literally play every single class and all you need to do is change your weapon to switch it!Getting bored of the dungeons and raids? Leveling an extra class taking its toll? This game has you covered, go to the mother♥♥♥♥ing Gold Saucer and spend your life savings worth of Gil on gambling! Only 1,000,000 MGP for that Fenrir mount! (i still don't have it please end this awful rng curse i have)In all seriousness though, there is so much to do I can't even begin to cover any of it, ask yourself these questions;Do you like Final Fantasy? Are you into playing MMOs? Do you like working to bigger goals and upgrading characters over a long period of time? Do you like events, content patches and daily rewards that are worth coming back for? If you answered yes to any of those, then try it. You get a 2 week long trial of the game, and if you decide its a game you like then you can keep the progress you made on the trial and continue with another 30 days free upon purchase of the game.I can't personally say anything bad about this game, other than it stole my heart and won't ever give it back.10/10 - itsa ♥♥♥♥♥ mastapiece			"

												Overview: Incredibly polished and well endowed MMO. Almost every setting is tweakable and supports controllers as well, you get a game that offers you everything you payed for and witholds none of it.It also uphold the name of Final Fantasy in good faith, probably a lot better than the newer FF games. The combat is a bit repetitive however, you've got a wealth of content to discover and quests that reward you well; dungeons from level 15 and up and lots of end-game content (but be prepared for hardcore type groups for the real end-game content, statics with schedules). Pretty soon there's going to be an expansion and new classes so there's much more to look forward to as the game ages. The developer has done a great job at supporting the game thus far and I've seen no signs of them slowing down.+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                 Here's my breakdown between the positives and negatives of FFXIV:RR.+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-------(Positive things)-------+ Good writing!+ Lots of content! + The Hildibrand questline is the best questline in any MMO hands down. + You've got lots of customization for your character / your HUD / and homes if you're rich enough.+ Generally a nice community for an MMO except for the occasional try-hard who gets unreasonably upset.------(Negative things)-------- This game is fetch quest hell, if you despise fetch quests more than anything then I do not recommend you play this game.- The journey from level 1 to level 50 isnt that exciting. (this pretty much goes for all MMOs)- RNG will occupy the vast majority of your end game time spent. Repeatedly run the same content over and over and over until you get that pretty blouse you wanted to glamour.- If you want to stick to 1 class for running content, the gameplay will get stale fairly fast, which isnt unique to FF, many MMO titles suffer from this. There's no traits or choice options to customize your fighting or spells, just flat stat increases that don't change the gameplay in any way other than just becoming stronger. (And your strength primarily comes from your gears item-level) You will be at level 50 with typically around 3 abilitys you need to use repeatedly for combat, and then 3 special situation skills to use in.. special situations and 2 super abilities you save for oh-♥♥♥♥ moments.This varies between the classes but I played as a White Mage, so basically my job was to repeatedly hit the 2 button to cast cure, and then sometimes use a spell called Esuna to remove conditions from myself or others, and then cast an AOE that made HP regen (which you need to keep refreshing for the party once it wears off). This was not very fun to me, so you have to rely on the game to throw variety in the dungeons or enemies to spice things up. Usually it just boils down to memorizing boss mechanics and hoping nobody screws up. So essentially you're a bot following a strictly scripted fight and if you deviate from that you're most likely going to fail; This might be different for other people, but this is just how I felt after a while of doing end-game content.-------But, feel free to give it a go yourself! There's a free 14 day trial for FFXIV, so don't let my opinions get in the way of a potentially good time when you could test drive it for yourself. As far as MMOs come and whats avaliable at the moment, I still recommend you give FF a try since it's one of the best subscription based MMOs out there right now. But this one just isnt for me. (I Still recommend it for MMO lovers!)			"

「 Impossible is a word coined by the weak. 」(Alright, time to give this review an overhaul now that I've officially given this game 1000 hours of my life. Just gonna add in some extra tidbits here and there.)FFXIV has easily become my favorite MMO. Easily. And it's weird, because I just sort of downloaded it like, (shrug) yeah, I'll check it out, why not. But then after a while, I realized, 'Holy ♥♥♥♥, I'm having SO much fun.' The thing is, I've never viewed Final Fantasy as an MMO sort of game. It was always the main console games for me (FFVII, FFVIII, FFIX, etc.). So FFXIV, and FFXI for that matter, was never something I even looked at or took interest in. But hey, now I'm a full-fledged passenger aboard the FF MMO hype train.I really don't even know where to start with this review. A part of me just wants to go EVERYTHING IS AWESOME THIS IS AWESOME AND THAT IS AWESOME AND IT'S ALL SPECTACTULAR. A+ review. I don't really think I'll be able to cover everything I want to, but I'm gonna take a shot at (some of) it:Stay awhile and listen (!!)Whenever I think MMO, I think, half-♥♥♥♥♥ basic story. And that's fine, because it's all about the gameplay and getting the gear and doing the dungeons and getting your rake so you can go farming. And whenever I think Final Fantasy, I think, five-star story that will leave you with great memories for years and years to come.FFXIV actually has a good story to it. And I got pumped for it when I saw that opening cutscene, a scene that I still watch over and over from time to time. Now, the story isn't out of this world, but I did enjoy it a lot. Everything built up to make the end boss much more satisfying. And there were cutscenes. Tons of cutscenes. So many. Which can be good or bad depending on the person obviously. I appreciated it, and it did immerse me into the story more. Edit: And now that I have gotten much farther in the story and, again, have spent 1000 hours of my life with it, I can say now that I absolutely love the story in this game. I mean, the story was good in 2.X (and got real ♥♥♥♥ing crazy around 2.55), but with Heavensward (3.0), I just sort of realized how much I love these characters, I love the story that's going on, and I care. I HAVE CRIED REAL TEARS MULTIPLE TIMES. I have gotten angry, I have been shocked, I have felt many emotions through the course of this game. Other games I'm like cool, cool, cool, let's get on to the fighting. Here, I will shush the ♥♥♥♥ out of anyone who won't let me finish my cutscene. Like a good mini-movie ayyyyy.Eye Candy (!!)In the manner of my kobold friends, this game is gorgeous, stunning, beautiful! I mean really, I'm not even sure how to phrase how much I appreciate the graphics in this game. I think I was killing this buffalo type creature the other day, and the sun was rising (Yes, there is a weather/day/night cycle system. Yeah, it's awesome.), and you know when the sun is shining in someone's eyes and you can see just how pretty their eye color is? Yeah, well I thought this buffalo looked sweet as ♥♥♥♥ in the sunlight. So that, but transfer it to every single zone and x100 because I can view the zones during night/day/dusk/dawn/etc. Also, the newest zones for the 3.0 expac are gorgeous, except now I can just stare at all the beauty while flying and listening to the banging music and ijustlovethisgame. And I still don't think I expressed how much everything pierces my soul. I can't guys, just. Max settings 4 lyf suck ittttt~~~~C-c-c-combo breaker (!!)Combat to me is great. I have never played a tab-target mmo before, so the entire system was new to me. I came from a somewhat action-combat oriented MMO, but I find myself really enjoying the combat here. However, in the beginning levels, it is a little lackluster. You don't have as many abilities open to you though, so obviously you're gonna be restricted to your basic 1-2 combo over and over (sometimes even less depending on the class). Aside from just talking about combat in itself, there are an array of dungeons and trials to do. 4-man, 8-man, 24-man parties all there. There are roughly around 90 (I'm including all the different difficultly levels plus counting floors/turns as their own) dungeons/trials/raids so far. Some trials have a normal, hard, and extreme version, and some dungeons have a hard version as well (although the hard versions are completely different from the normal version, so it's a whole new dungeon in itself. Nice move SE /proudofyouthx). The mechanics for a lot of these are super fun to me, although a bit daunting when you first start out. Some say it's like memorizing a dance with how crazy some fights get. I dig them, though. A lot. I find myself replaying a lot of the dungeons/trials just because the fight is amazing, not to farm gear or whatnot (finalfightof3.0imlookingatyou)The dungeon/trail/raid private instances aren't just it though. There's still plenty going on in the open world, like FATEs and Hunts. Tons of people party up for those, granted you are in a pretty populated server.  We are Sex Bob-omb (!!)Okay. If you haven't heard already, the music in the game is pretty stellar. Go on any FFXIV boss fight youtube video and people will be raving about how sweet the music is. And it's true. The music, especially for the boss fights, gets you SO pumped (finalfightof3.0lookingatyouagain). It's the kind of music where you hear it as the battle starts and you're just like 'Awww man. ♥♥♥♥'s gonna be intense'. But it's not just the boss fights (although those are what get the most attention). Just about anywhere you go has some nice music playing. And I actually notice it (!!). I say this because there's some music that blends in with the atmosphere, like in most movies/games/commercials/etc., which is great (and perfect for most scenarios), but then there's the music that jumps out at you. That just compells you to look it up on the internet later. And that's the kind of music that I dig. And FFXIV has plenty of that. The soundtrack for the Heavensward expansion couldn't come out any faster. I crave it.It's just not my style (!!)So aside from the aforementioned lackluster combat in the beginning of the game, I figured I should put the couple of things that aren't so nice about FFXIV.When you first play FFXIV, you may notice the lack of people talking in the chat. It makes the game feel dead, but it's really not (so far from it). Due to gold spammers (or so I hear), everyone just moved over to linkshells, which is basically custom channels. So join a linkshell and FC (guild), and your chat will be lively as normal. But that can be a turn-off to newcomers. Heavily populated cities (depending on your server) may have people talking in the shout/yell/say chat as normal though. Also, the newest 'lobby' area that came with the 3.0 expac is very lively in shout chat. Mostly because the gold spammers haven't reached us there yet hah hhahHAHAH HA.That brings me to gold spammers. Depending on the server you choose, you may not get that many gold spammers, or you may get a hell of a lot. And they do PM you or spam the chat from time to time. But, again, this can be a turn-off for some players, especially since this is a subscription based MMO.Cutscenes that occur during party events, but I won't get into that here (!!)(Chorus)(Outro)(Fade-out)I still left out a lot of the tidbits that I just absolutely love about the game, but alas, this totally short review will have to suffice. I surprisingly ended up loving this game, and you should check it out if it sounds like something you're even remotely interested in. I love it lots. Square Enix and Final Fantasy have (again) taken my soul hostage and I'm ok with that.			"

												Final Fantasy XIV is in a tight spot. Following the poorly-received Final Fantasy XIII and carrying on the legacy of Final Fantasy XI, it has a lot to live up to.And originally, it failed to live up to this. With 1.0, it had a lot of major issues including XP caps, lack of group activities and general bad design. This was a major problem that could've caused the death of the game.However, Square Enix did something different. Instead of following the generic ""Make it Free-to-play"" model, they set out on rebuilding the game. Almost completely scrapping the original game and rebuilding it from the ground up, they made a game that can serve as the true XIV that people wanted. This is A Realm Reborn.Following the failure of 1.0 and the implementation of ARR, Square Enix decided to keep the universe of 1.0 semi-canon, with ARR following on. Set 5 years after 1.0, there was a catastrophe that served to bridge the gap between the 1.0 world and the ARR world. With many features such as landmass, NPCs and areas staying almost identical to that in 1.0, the whole storyline is completely a new, almost sequel to XIV, with gameplay vastly improved and expanded to meet those of other modern MMOs.The storyline, although generic, does follow the Final Fantasy formula of an evil Empire ruling over the world with an evil agenda, and you and your companions have to fight against them. With this, it is almost a retelling of Final Fantasy VI, with many story elements shared across the two universes, and this is strengthened in the expanded storyline with locations and characters having similar names.The characters within the game are all pretty unique, although it does have it's own versions of ""Biggs"", ""Wedge"" and Cid"". Each character in the world feels fleshed out, with most having their own questlines and stories separate from the main storyline. This serves to flesh out the universe and make you feel like you're in an actual world rather than a half-baked MMO.Although the storyline is a major aspect of the game, it does serve mainly to unlock additional content, although this is in no way a bad thing. The storyline quests give a good step on leveling up your first character, guiding you through the leveling process whilst not serving to hand-hold the player. Although it is easy to gain levels through quests, it would not be easy for a character to max out by simply completing quests.Instead, the game has a number of different ways to level up, mostly these are through group events.Firstly, one of the most commonly encountered events are FATEs. There can essentially appear anywhere in the field, outside of towns and other sanctuaries. FATEs have a simple objective, often something such as ""Kill all of x enemy"", ""Kill x boss"" or ""Collect all of x"". Usually they involve beating on enemies until the quota is met, which is pretty satisfying. These give the player additional XP and Gil. Mostly these FATEs are level-limited, so many higher-level players would not be inclined to do older FATEs or do them if they are max level, however this has been changed through late-game content that requires players to return to areas and perform in FATEs, meaning that they are available for everyone and serves to keep old content fresh.Secondly, are Leves. Similar to FATEs but for single player, you are assigned them in each town by a special NPC with a unique tasks such as ""Kill x and collect their item"" or ""Plant an item at x"". These are pretty fun to pass the time and have a number of benefits, similar to FATEs.Finally, the most common way of leveling up is through Duty Roulettes. Once a day, the player is given a boosted XP and Gil bonus by performing in the Duty Roulette. By choosing to do this, you are randomly assigned a party for a Duty, which can consist of a dungeon, a Trial (Boss fight) or Guildhest (Similar to FATE and Leves). These are unlocked as you progress through the story, and as it is random you can get assigned to any duty that you have previously unlocked. This means that a maxed player can get assigned to a level 20 dungeon. This ensures that the game is kept fresh and that new players can progress through lower level dungeons without the risk of there being no available players, which is also reinforced as an XP bonus is rewarded for all party members who participate with members who are new to that duty. As you progress, more and more duties are unlocked including high and extreme level, with their own rewards. In addition, once the player hits level 50, an additional reward becomes available as a substitute to the XP.I currently have 150 hours registered to Steam for this game, and have just completed the main storyline. There are countless other things that I must complete, as well as the content unlocked in the latest update coming soon. This will add large amounts content which serves to increase the playability for both high and low level players.Square Enix are very good at announcing and presenting new content to the games, with regular livestreams showing off new content to keep up the hype. This builds good relations between both the players and the company. In addition, the moderation team of the game (GMs) I have heard are very helpful, and can resolve most issues. In addition, in the two times I have contacted Square Enix support I have received an adequate response within a few hours.In all honesty, the game is great. Although it is different from other MMOs I have played, it does have a great playerbase who will help newcomers with any issues. I fully recommend this, even if it's only for the 30 day trial.			"

												Probably this is the best MMORPG you are going to see on Steam at this moment along with EVE Online. If you are fan of Final Fantasy saga keep in mind one thing, this game have more of Final Fantasy than all of supposed games of the series before this since FFX&XI. +GraphicsI'm absolutely delighted with the technical part of this game. I dont understand how all the Final Fantasy's on Steam are so horrible in performance and this one so awesome. A lot of graphic options, full customizable UI, support for multiple screens... Very nice job from Square Enix, It's very rare on pc.+Combat & Boss battlesAt first time maybe the combat looks slow, easy and very simple but you are not going to feel the true difficulty of this game until you face a Primal in Hard Mode. Get your butt ready for die a lot and more if you do it with random people.The battles with the main bosses are super epic, the music it's just wonderful and completely immerses you in the game. I can still hear my screams of the first time I killed Titan in Hard Mode after weeks of tries.+ClassesThe possibility of have all the classes of the game in the same character is just awesome. I cant imagine playing other mmo with a lot of characters for different classes. I am too lazy just thinking about it...The DPS classes are a little bit broken in difficulty and how much dps can do compared to others. This is the only ""bad"" thing I can say about them.+StoryLike I said this game have more of ""Final Fantasy"" than some of previous games of the franchise. The lore is very cool and the main history really grabs you into the game. The way they linked the history before A Realm Reborn and the actual history is wondeful. +High End ContentIf you like the pve and the raids you are going to enjoy so much this game. The entire high end content is oriented to this. The difficulty of the bosses at this point is very hard and if is not enough you have a ""insane"" mode for them and that is almost impossible.+DubbingYou can choose the Japanese voices. YES! (。⌒∇⌒)。-CinematicsA lot of cinematics dont have sound so it's just text and click, click. Except the bosses intros, unfortunately all of them are boring.-MapI didn't played the 1.0 version of the game but I know how the map was and it can be resumed in ""corridors everywhere"". Now is a lot of better but even with that ""remake"" of the map it's still too small for a MMORPG. It's not a constant map and it's divided in zones with loading screens between them. This is very common in a lot of mmo's lately and it's a shame.-PVPIf you are looking for a MMORPG with good pvp and funny this is NOT YOUR GAME. This game is completly oriented to pve and the pvp it's just for get some cool armor skins.-Brayflox Longstop (Hard)I hate you Brayflox, I HATE YOU. (Counter of times I've repeated this dungeon for get the Relic: 99853475212258526)			"

												After Final fantasy XIV 1.0 was a gigantic flop, Square Enix was brave enough to give the title a reboot.With success!A Realm Reborn is really fun. This already starts with the story which is very long in my opinion. The atmosphere and the music are wonderful. Every detail in the game is lovely designed. There are so many possibilities in the game to kill time. For example, there are FATEs which are events where you must fight in groups against world bosses and other opponents. Even if you've reached max level, you can still enter old dungeons because your level gets capped and you can enjoy them with newer players. If you're bored with your current class, then you don't have to create a new character. Just change your weapon, and you can play as another class. I really like that idea since I don't like to have multiple characters.If you're a Final Fantasy or MMORPG fan, then you should definitely give this title a try. It's one of the greatest MMORPG's in recent years. I've never had so much fun with an MMO like with this one.			"

												My best friend bought me the game back in the day, I wasn't expecting anything after having played Age of conan for years.We started to play and I fell in love with this game! All the pro's:-The best community, so hardly any trolling and very friendly people- Raid and dungeon finder that is cross worlds! (quick queues!)- Regular content updates that include a lot of story and many new dungeons or hardmode versions of dungeons- Party finder to do old content has been updated to be cross worlds now too! (best quality of life update)- Pretty environment/music and character creation is very in depth- Very interesting storyline- Many different jobs and the respective skills all look amazing.- Mounts to collect through many different activities that aren't walled off to anyone, everyone can get them.- Raids and dungeons are amazing, they put a lot of effort into making these and you can tell via environment and story that is related to them! - Glamour!- Quests are fun (especially the Hildibrand quest line) and well made!- To help leveling and learning the game a  new system has been added called the hall of the novice, finishing this will end you up with a good level 15 green starter armor set for your class and a 20% extra EXP bonus ring with added stats, you just need to speak to a Smith in the starting towns!- Seasonal events with nice rewards and story- Only one character needed, you can play all classes and even have bonus EXP when you have a max level character, so leveling up alternative classes will be quicker.- Crafting system is very fun in depth (it's a game of it's own!)- New quest icons to make dungeon related (side dungeons and raids) and class/job quests more visible.- Mog station allows you to buy certain glamour items that you may have missed in previous events for very little money (got to support them somehow!)- UI can be fully customized.- You can marry! same sex couples as well in case anyone was wondering! It's free, but for a fee the couple gets an upgraded plan and they get a two seater chocobo (each) and a ring to TP to each other and your guests will receive a minion!- You get a chocobo! not just as your mount, but through a quest also as your battling companion!- Your chocobo is dyeable, yaaaay! - Apartments are available in game for 500.000 gil and there are many to go around! you get a chocobo stable outside and you can have two planter pots to grow two seeds, so everyone can finally dye their chocobo if they are not in an FC with a company house.- Free company housing (this is also a possible negative, read there for explanation) very handy to have when you have a big and active free company!- If you went away from the game for a while, this game is the one MMO I've found to be very easy to catch up again :)- Beast tribe quests and special beast tribe quests for crafters!- Recent update now made it possible to change your summoners' ifrit/garuda and titan egi into your old trusted and above all cute carbuncles!Possible negatives (if you are bothered by these sort of things)- Everything (dungeons/raids/special quests) is locked by the Main Story Quest line or alternative quest lines, you are forced to do the story to advance.- Servers currently are mostly full, most of the time if you start playing, you may be put into a queue for that server :(- You cannot block someone if they are not online or on a different world (so possibility for them to annoy you again)- Certain mounts are only available on the Mogstation and they can be costly £18.00 for one mount, but it's account wide.- Most cutscenes are without voice acting, so a lot of reading- There are some quite long cutscenes or consecutive cutscenes (very long cutscenes do have a warning before them however)- Monthly subscription, although worth to me, it might not be to others (one character per world discounted sub is available at under £8.00 per months  and personally I see the monthly sub as a way of supporting all the new and regular content we get!)- Your game settings and custom UI are saved locally! just wanted to make people aware of this- Marrying can be costly, despite there being a free option, you can also buy for £5.00 or £10.00 per person and have a gold or platinum wedding, however for gold and platinum weddings only, your guests get a minion and the couple to be wed get, beside amazing cutscenes (check youtube) a two seater chocobo and dyeable clothing and a ring to TP to eachother ! not sure if anyone always finds it worth it.- Free company housing as of today still are not available for newer free companies, since all the wards are full and there's a shortage of availability in these- Mentor system possible negative is that one must have leveled a tank, healer and a dps to level 60 to earn the mentor title and privilege, personally I think it's fair enough.And it seems to affect peoples attitudes a little bit, which is a shame to be honest.There are many more pro's and maybe a few other cons, too much to write down, but I feel I've covered most of the important ones! In short summary I absolutely adore the game and never regretted playing it. There is not a game out there in terms of an MMORPG that I feel is so deserving of a sub. It's the most fun and friendly MMORPG in fantasy setting that I have seen that is high quality and just simply amazing and never ceased to amaze me.			"

												Final Fantasy XIV. First off skip to the dashes if you don't care about my story. I started this game hating it. I labelled it a generic MMO because classes barely have anything unique about them when you first start. DPS is DPS, Tank keeps things hitting him, healers DPS because mobs can't kill tank at this level. I went into fields after doing too many fetch quests to count and then I did the same combo over and over until things died. Pugilist/Monk. however after quitting and being nagged back into the game I learned at lv.30 the game completely changes. Your class begins to bloom into this spectrum of variety(except DRG they do the same combo til the end of time) and it makes you want to get farther. What's next? How will my class improve more? Every 5 levels you'll find out. lv.50 your classes change so much that noone who hasn't played your class can possibly understand your struggle. The classes become extremely diverse from others (Yes DRG I know your still doing the same combo with a chance of attacking from a different position) and level60 you get to see how hard the game is when your fellow players pick up FLT(Floor Tank) as their main class in every raid. The game heavily suggests you bring sunglasses (For the Holy spam and flashy SMN attacks) and your A-Game and as you progress through this very very long storyline the missions get to the point where you can't even play casually anymore. You got all these moves you have to properly use to get the best out of your class+boss mechanics and fight mechanics you ahve to obey while managing proper synergy with other classes (I'm not going to diss DRG again you know what you do).--------------Ok so I'm mad you skipped my story but it's ok because I'm the annoying one out of my friend circle. I knew you wouldn't notice me senpai. here are the Pros and Cons of FFXIV.The Pros-Amazing Servers with very very very very little lag, and if you experiance alot of lag its your connection/PC/dont play on PS3.-Amazing visuals and well done particle effects. The game looks just flashy enough and fortunately only 2 classes require Sunglasses to play.-Extremely Diverse endgame classes. No class is the same. The Pros and cons are brutally diverse to where if you didn't play the class, you don't know anything about the class.-Relatively positive community. I get raged on and kicked very rarely for trolls. This brings me to my other positive.-SE CARES ABOUT US! Support Desk sends human GMs to talk to you about accidents. Other day I was verbally assualted by a Russian player who assumed I was a female american with sexual fustration because I played a female character. I won't dare repeat the things said to me but after reporting him, I went to get a drink and upon returning the GM PM'd me to ask me what happened. After a calm chat he told me despite me insulting him once I would not get banned because it's only reasonable that things get like this. The other player was banned because I stopped and realized immediately after my first insult that this is a case of harassment and continued the dungeon ignoring his excessive racial and prejudice insults while we let the ninja tank since he refused to.-Little to no bots. You are pretty much going to see RMT rather you want to or not but SE greatly combats this by monitoring trades and allowing reports of bots. You can block bots and ignore them as they will be flagged and banned. I only see 1-2 per day in each town compared to most MMOs where there are armies punishing low-end PC users.-Realistic Story. I won't spoil but this is the most realistic story I have ever seen in a fantasy game genre and honestly tears were shed.-Standard Final Fantasy Story based progression. Play this like you play any other Final Fantasy. Tons of Fetch Quests, minor forced battles and continuously unlocking new things to do while you frantically run around doing 700+ story quests.-Heaven's Ward DLC has almost as much if not MORE content than the original game. How many games release a $20 DLC pack that adds a whole new game to it? Not many.-Unlocked content allows you to easily level up other classes so you can relearn mechanics from another perspective and play endgame how you want to.-No garbage tier classes. Thank god there is no such thing as a class that is useless endgame.-Strong but not toxic player market. undercutting is normal, but not toxic inflations outside relic weapons.The Cons-The story until Realm Reborn is the most Old English ever in existance. It was virtually unreadable for me and many others.--Game mechanic cons---Weekly Loot in all new content. Everytime they release something they new they force a slow grind by making the latest gear be restricted to only once a week. This stops players from ""beating"" endgame before the next patch on 1-2 classes. This also makes you pick a main class if you don't have alot of motivation to play/access to savages and I don't like it but I deal with it.-Go watch anime, DPS ques are going to take 15-30minutes a piece.--Community Cons---Players will not allow you to do Savages unless you have completed them and have the voice chat of their choosing. Usually TS(Which is problematic for some, but a majority do not have issues with the peogram itself more than a way of accessing it due to lack of PC/Decent Phone). You will need to find a learning party if you want to get the best gear in the game. If your on PS3/4 you will not be allowed by players to do Savages unless your Free Company(Guild) is doing it with you.-Absolutely huge skill gap between some classes. DRG and DRK are very very easy classes to play. PLD is freaking insanely hard at start and doesn't get easier until you pretty much master the class around lv.50. Same for MNK. You'll be doing pretty much garbage damage until you learn Flank isn't behind like most games and learn how to position yourself around enemies in the mist of crazy particle effects and mobile bosses/tanks. Not to mention there are alot of mechanics that only effect certian classes. This is a con only because people get extremely cocky endgame and begin to talk like they are gods because their class is brain dead compared to yours. This applies to what I'm about to say next because this low skill cap on set classes not only draw in beginners who want to learn, but people who feel they don't NEED to learn because healer will cover them and they required much less effort coming up to these points.-When a player is bad... they are fustratingly bad. Hopefully your not as unfortunate as me but 1 person in every random team I get in is absolutely bad to the point where they are literatly halting the team. We are talking ignoring mechanics, ignoring class roles (pull mobs as DPS, only DPSing as a healer, refusing to use tank stances as a tank) This is a community issue and as for my other reviews community issues do not greatly impact my review unless the game is team based.-Heavy pressure on players. I heavily suggest you play this game with no cares because this con is big enough to scare away people who care what others think. This community con is basically when you play any class someone else doesn't like they blame,shame and constantly pick on you for being it. This does not happen often but you will meet people who will purposely get your killed and constantly pick at you for these things. As a healer you will meet players who eat too much damage yet you have to heal them in order to beat the boss. We are talking about people doing optional things to cause you stress and distrupt your ability to play efficiently.These cons may differ on your server/data center.In all if you really love FF games and you enjoy a godlike storyline I heavily suggest this to you. You can see how the game evolves and changes as it both updates and as you progress through the game.			"

												See, I don't normally play MMO's. If I try one, it usually captures my attention for a solid week, then I lose interest, uninstall it, and never play it again.This game? Oh man oh man. This game is great. I've only ever played free MMO trash around the web, but this one is by far THE BEST MMO I have ever played.The combat is like you should expect; if you've played any other MMO, it plays similarly to what you would expect out of an MMO. There are a variety of classes that you can choose from as your battlecraft classes and, the best part, you can have every class on one character. This is especially helpful when you're doing end-game raid stuffs. Form one team, and depending on what your team has leveled, you can form different groups with the same team.When I first started playing this game, as a low level I thought the gameplay was spectacular. Everything felt so fresh, and I felt like there was a bunch of things about the game I had yet to discover. Boy, was I right. Once I hit 50 (the max level for every class BEFORE Heavensward, which will increase that cap to 60), I felt like the game suddenly opened up to me. To this day, I still find that I have a LOT to do.If you're looking for a great MMO to play and don't mind a monthly fee, look no further. Final Fantasy XIV will surely fill your MMO needs.			"

												Well this is an updated review of my last one.. And my opinion changed alot on this game. not in a bad way, but in a great way.. The game has evolved it's become more than anything another MMO can offer nowaday's.. I mean WoW isn't what it used to be. Final Fantasy is on another level in terms of graphic's, story, content, and community. When Heavensward came out the game got so much better, added more content, added more jobs, a new race, harder fights.. overrall, This game deserves a 10/10.. Not just for the things I mentioned here because this isn't detailed enough for you to understand.. Because in my opinion, you should buy the game and see this for your own eyes on how great the game is. Look at the hours I've spent.. It might lean you towards the right direction.			"

												Character creation & terrible inventory organization aside, this is the most solid MMORPG in recent history. Once a practically unplayable mess, it is now staffed by a dedicated team which bring major patches every 3 months. Cons -character creation sometimes requires a 1-time wait to log on in dead hours before being able to play the gamecharacter race/gender features can be quite limited in overall options compared to most other MMOsplayer inventory is a headache, w/ next to no organization optionstab-targeting system sometimes doesn't work as intendedNext to no PVP content (EDIT 1/18/2017: developers have made positive changes to PvP but is still far from an emphasis in the overall game)despite best efforts of new design team a lot of old, clunky features still clot the game in awkward waysNovice-training systems are a step in the right direction but ultimately solve less issues than they set out to addressOnly certain players will like these things -Combat is slower than most MMORPGs, especially w/ the recent ARPG injection to the MMO genresome of the flashier, desirable content at endgame is behind a wall of grindquest & objective-based content often sends players to revisit old contentDungeons oftentimes require extra research from outside of the game in order to not be frustrating for self/othersFree market economy - because of the constant pace of new content the best ways to make money is to learn trade secretsGame is punishing for those wishing to mindlessly kill random mobs out in the world as a means of power-leveling (you must participate in activities working towards pre-definied goals in order to earn xp reliably)Pros -EXCELLENT community - hardcore players are plentiful, yet there are many incentives in place for fair/kind playEngaging story - even if you aren't a huge lore-hound the pacing of the game makes an immersive worldNo add-ons needed (in fact discouraged) - UI provides plenty of features & raid mechanics are an intuitive processPlenty to do - just about everything you can ask for in the world or in an instance, w/ more content always being added""Glamour is the true endgame"" - player characters are a breath of fresh air to the genre w/ insane variety of costumesRole-playing - quality tank/dps/healer gameplay, no reinventing the wheel. RPing is also encouraged w/ numerous social features.Every job can be accessed from one character. Discount subscription plan available for players w/ 1 character per serverNo ghost towns - content often brings players of all levels to cities/towns, making every hub populatedUnlocking content is a personal journey that can be achieved at ones own pace - very little of the game feels like it's either rushing nor slowing you down, allowing you to digest what you want or speed through what you want, when you want it.

												Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn takes place in the continent of Eorzea, on the planet Hydaelyn who shares it's name with the Mother Cystal, who will guide you throughout your adventures as the Warrior of Light. The game starts you off as an adventurer with an unknown background and are sent to talk to the Adventurer's Guild in hopes of something to do. You will start off in one of the three main City-states; Ul'dah-the desert city that houses some of the richest and poorest people in Eorzea, Limsa Lominsa-the port city that houses expirates and peopl who love the sea, and Gridania-the forest city filled with people who love the enviornment and the spirits which inhabit our world. Which city you start in will be determine by your class, that you can change later on in the game, meaning that you can level all 13 classes to level 60 (the current max level) all on the same character. These classes are mostly iconic to the Final Fantasy franchise, with new and familiar ways to play them. In terms of an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) FFXIV hits it out of the park. I am an very experienced MMORPG player having played games such as SWTOR, TERA, Guildwars 2 and Wildstar to name af ew of the more popular ones and coming from 7 years of World of Warcraft. FFXIV, while not completely unlike World of Warcraft, is vastly different. I will mainly be using World of Warcraft as a comparison as it is the game i have the most experience with playing as well as it being the most popular MMORPG atm. Like stated earlier in FFXIV you can play mulitple classes if not all the classes, if you really want to which is different thatn World of Warcraft. In WoW you progress with one character until it becomes stale and you must do everything all over again. In FFXIV, your progression is made with the character rather than the class you are representing, meaning that if I get tired of playing a Summoner and I switch to a Dragoon, I will have lost no progress in the mainstory, any of my achievments or titles or anything else along those lines. The only thing i have to do is level my Dragoon up to whatever level I so desire. If I realize Dragoon isn't for me, I can simply switch back to my Summoner (same level as it was before I switched) completely free or try out a new class all together and keep my progress for both Summoner and Dragoon so I can return later.While I could spend all day talking about this game and all the features it has, it's time for some Pro's and Con's, since unfortunelty this game isn't for everyone.Pro's-Hands down the best story that I have every seen in an MMORPG, it will not only keep you captivated but it also puts you as the center of attention, which is different than how other games such as World of Warcraft do it.-Class system is amazing for someone who wants to try multiple different classes without wanting to re-roll their characters or make alts, it is actually encouraged you try and play all the classes and see what one works for you.-While not the most graphic amazing game, it will certainly blow a lot of games out of the water. FFXIV just looks stunning if you take a second to enjoy all the great features this game has like dynamic weather, awesome backdrops and  a pretty good character creation page.-Crafting in this game is hands down the best I have ever seen in an MMORPG. Some people level one battle class up to max level and then focus the remainder of their time playing crafting and gathering classes. Whiel some games make these activities a side thing, FFXIV makes them classes all on their own and completely viable to spend all your time and money just working with these classes.-You absolutely cannot talk about a Final Fantasy game without talking about the music that goes with it. The music in this game is fantastic in every regard. If you are a music nut you will die for some of the sound tracks in this game.-Finally, this game gets tons of content periodically in patches. The time between patches is roughly 2-3 months at a time (which sounds like heaven if you come from WoW) and each patch is pack full with fresh new content and things to do (and not selfie cams and twitter...)Con's-Although the story in this game is amazing it is a very story motivated game and as such may not interest some people. There is no way around the Main Story Quests (MSQ) in thsi game, you have to do them to unlock the content. Although you can technically rush through all the dialogue and skip all the cinematics, you will be missing a huge part of what makes this game great.-While the end game raids are all fun, they are not what a raider from WoW would expect. Each major content patch (X.0 X.2, X.4) they will introduce 4 new bosses in the existing raid. At the start of every expansion (well we only have Heavensward and A Realm Reborn to go off of atm) they introduce a new raid with 4 bosses, and like I said every major content patch adds 4 new bosses to that raid, which if you come from wow can be a bit bland. Although I think these fights are great I can also see how some people would not like this.-Lack of class customization. This game does not have class specilization like WoW or SWTOR do. If I am playing a Dragoon and I see a Dragoon right next to me at the same level, we are going to have the exact same abilities. This feature is kind of made up from the fact that you can be all classes but it doesn't really. That beign said its not terrible not picking talents and whatnot, its just a cool feature that isn't there for reasons that make sense (no cookie-cutter builds or best paths)-The grind. While no where near as bad as a Korean MMORPG this game has a really really long leveling grind. I basically split the leveling process into 3 major steps. The 1-50 leveling which is made up of the A Realm Reborn story and learning your class and whatnot. This step was made easier when Heavensward launched as they made MSQ give double xp. Not terrible but kinda lengthy. Next is the 2.1-2.55 leveling experience which is by far the worst part of this game. Once you hit level 50 and complete the main story you then enter something similar to a post story. This post story will set up the stage for the Heavensward expansion but is completely manditory and very very VERY slow. If you haven't bought Heavensward at this point you will get 0 exp and if you have bought Heavensward you will probably get one level, maybe. The 2.X series probably takes around 20 hours all together to complete and during said time you will feel like you aren't getting anything (exp wise) but will get little gear upgrades. The final step is the Heavensward part 50-60, I know this is technically a review for A Realm Reborn, but I will talk about it anyways. This step is probably the most enjoyable as you will be introduced with a new story and a new enviornment along with some new chracters. The Heavensward story is fantastic, but you have to slog through the post story to get there.Those are the major things about this game, obviously there are tons more things I could say but to keep this from being a novel, I will leave the review here. Overall this game is a great buy and any MMORPG player should at least try it out. Some important things to note are that there is a free trial if anyone wants to try it before they buy, you will get 14 days to play the game with a level cap of 20. Also another important note is that if you buy this product on Steam you will be forced to buy every expansion after on Steam, which some people dislike since it regularly goes on sale other places and rarely goes on sale through Steam. On the bright side, you can use your Steam wallet to pay for the monthly fee so it has its ups and downs. Finally, the Square Enix website can be a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ sometimes but don't let that discourage you, this is a great game and I hope to see you all in Eorzea! <3 Sarris Wolf, Behemoth			"

												Since I've been at it for a while, and I'm waiting for servers to come back up, I think it's time for a bit of a review. Pros:-Beautiful if your system can run it, but the ability to downgrade graphics settings enough to run on a fairly low end machine makes the game possible for more people. -Great controller support if that happens to be your thing.-Everything feels fluid. Classes are given very large kits and balance spamable abilites with complex rotations and cooldowns. Things are smiple enough to let casual players compete most content but exceptional players exceed and tackle the highest level raiding conent when it's released.-Large amounts of midcore content while still providing hardcore and casual content.-The learning curve while long is actually fairly short compared to most mainstream MMO I've played, and you are able to gain an understanding of things faster due to the ability to level/hotswap out different classes as you please. -Reasonbly diverse class list genrally offers a lot of different and unique playstyles.-The dev team is small, but very dedicated and seem to listen to fan feedback reasonably well and puts out major content updates every few months with smaller minor patches to hold everybody over.-A lot of stuff to do, and plenty of replayability.-Final Fantasy tier sound track is naturally beautiful.-You can have all classes on one character. Hotswapable, including crafting and gathering classes.-Fishing-Catgirls-The game is absolutely full of references to different things and amusing humor. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's not. Either way they know what they are doing tears at your soul and they aren't sorry. I like to think of the Square Enix FFXIV dev team as Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies.-It comes with an actually good story, this is extremely rare these days in MMOs but it will destroy your heart.-Full cutscene/story replay feature for all those people who skip everything and want to figure out the story later.-It also comes with absurd amounts of side content that only exist to amuse you. -Everything is put together so nicely. One of it's best features overall is that it doesn't do anything badly. -Catgirls-Lots of in game events, probably about once a month or so there is some kind of seasonal event. During some seasonal events including Halloween, Christmas, Easter, Valentines Day, and many more they actually update massive portions of the game thematically. These may also give everything for aestetic gear to mounts.-Magnificently done atmosphere and fight design.-Lots of unique content in terms of fight/boss design. Some fights may have overlapping mechanics that were used in other fights but nearly all of the content feels completely different.-It is still very early in the game's life cycle. If it's anything like it's mother MMO, Final Fantasy XI, then we are close to a quarter done with thousands of hours of content already in the game.  -Y'shtolaCons:-The game is an MMO and can be grind heavy. -Some gear is gated behind time gates (ie only a few pieces of gear a week) and while this cap always gets removed after a while, it adds an unneeded wait for gear.-The difficulty spike can get a bit high at times when you are new to the game and running content for the first time without watching a proper guide.-Old content is reused a lot and that's ok to many because much of it is heavily replayable, but the way gear syncing (Limiting stats on gear that has outpaced older content) is done makes some old content far too easy due to stats not being synced low enough and making non-current content faceroll easy. -While the devs are actively trying to fix things, sometimes the ends don't justify the means with gear. The best example of this would be the relic weapon questline where you grind for gear comparable or better to the best raiding gear at the time, but the steps are meant to be a masochistic grind so it kinda fills it's own purpose.-On the North American servers excluding Gilgamesh and Balmung (Which are both often locked from character creation due to high population) have rampant amounts of RMT offers sent through private chat and not enough is done to combat it.-Crafting can often feel trivial in terms of actual combat gear, but as of 3.2, this issue seems to have been eliminated for the most part.-Much of the seasonal event gear is free if you attended the event, but is put in the cash shop after a long period of time downing the exclusivity of having experienced the event. This is more of a personal gripe.-There is a cash shop purely for visual items (Almost only special sets that were free at one time and a few other special items)-Dps que can occationally become unreasonable -The selling system/overflow storage system works off retainers, basically servants that you can customize. You are given two by default which is enough for many players, but they offer more (Up to six) for a small monthly fee. Very upsetting considering the game is purchased plus pay to play although extra retainers aren't that neccessary for most.-You will re-run old content a lot. While this keeps que times shorter for people trying to level alternate classes, it can be old after a while, but you are given many options for how you level. -Still no dedicated damage parsing feature implemented by the devs, but many parsing utilites do exist (Banned but ok normally as long as you don't talk about them in big public chats). This is only essential for end game raiding for the most part. -The game is still young (First expansion was less than a year ago) and the devs are still working on their proper flow, so occationally they will do some experimenting and ♥♥♥♥ stuff up, although they do normally fix things.A bit of a summary: This game really is great. Overall, having played many other MMOs, I think I've never found another that put everything you could want in a fantasy MMO together so fluidly. It's not that it's unique. If you are looking for some super never before seen gameplay then go be a loli with a giant axe in Tera or go warp into a gatecamp in Eve Online. This game's actual ""Uniqueness"" literally comes from how well everything is put together, not because it tried to change the key formula. Visually it is stunning. The music goes above and beyond what anybody could ever expect of an MMO and keeps on going. The atmosphere in fights is absolute insanity. I still get shivers when I think about how amazing some of the 8 man raids were. While some of the older content had been defamed due to the added ""Unsynced"" feature and the lack of proper gear syncing, much of it is extremely enjoyable to go back and play due to the nature of the game. Do not go into this game thinking you are going to be amazing fast. The lack of proper level syncing makes some of the early content too easy and it's unfortunate when new players get haymakered in the jaw because they weren't sufficiently prepared. This is being addressed by the dev team slowly, but it is still a problem that exists. If you can afford the monthly bill and want to ruin your life, then this game is absolutely worth getting. Overall rating: 11/10 I have a catgirl fetish now			"

												A breath of fresh air in the MMO scene, or rather, a reminder of what it was that made MMOs popular in the first place.What makes FFXIV:ARR so good, is not what it does have, but rather what it doesn't.Gimmicks.Ever since World of Warcraft became such a large player in the MMORPG scene, competitors have risen which attempt to dethrone it with new and ""exciting"" mechanics, but in doing so forget what an MMO even is.FFXIV:ARR learns from the mistakes of others and sticks to the known strengths of the genre. The holy trinity of Tank/DPS/Healer, Strong and challenging end-game content, deep storyline and world lore, an abundance of content to sink your time into along with major content patches every 2 and a half months.It should be noted, that major content patches in FFXIV:ARR usually contain the same amount of content an expansion for WoW would contain at launch.Yes, the game has a subscription model, but given the spetacular failures of numerous F2P and Cash Shop MMOs that have popped up over the years, combined with how this money is funneled into frequent and high quality updates to the game, is this really a bad thing? Honestly, it's well worth the money.However FFXIV:ARR doesn't just stick to old core values, it does so while breating new life into them that don't undermine their integrity. The holy trinity of MMOs is refered to as holy for a reason, to mess with it is to dance with certain doom. FFXIV:ARR conquers this perplexing problem regarding the need for re-interpretation without becoming gimmicky by altering the way experience works in the game.In traditional MMOs, you make a character, you select your class and you start getting experience points. As you gain experience, your character levels up thus expanding your capabilities with your selected class, until you hit max level then you move to end-game content.XIV:ARR does away with character experience, instead replacing it with class experience. You have an active class, determined by the weapon you are wielding and any experience gained will go into the experience pool for your active class. You don't level your charcter, you level your class. For example, I'm currently a level 50 conjurer, specialising in the advanced healing class ""White Mage"" and I am also at the same time a level 18 Thauterage, the predecessor to the DPS class ""Black Mage"".This doesn't make me some weird DPS/Healer hybrid, I can only be one at any one time. If I have a WHM weapon equipped, I'm a WHM and I have access to all the abilities of a WHM of my level and can equip gear for my class. I do not however have access to abilities for classes I have also leveled (except certain cross-class abilities which are sort of how this game does talents) nor can I equip gear meant for a Black mage while I have my white mage active. At the same time, when I switch to my black mage, it is as if I am a fresh character still leveling and only at level 18, the fact I have a class at max level does not affect my game play at all.This is great since it allows for alts without having to give up your character, your identity, your friends, your guild etc, you have it all in one place, without ever undermining the holy trinity.FFXIV:ARR shows that it's possible to approach MMORPGs with a ""Don't fix what isn't broken"" philosophy without simply remaking yet another WoW.On a final note? I pre-ordered the imperial edition for The Elder Scrolls Online, that set me back $75 USD, I did that before I started playing this and you know what? I've decided to just swallow that purchase and play this instead.It's THAT good.Saying all that however, the game is certainly not without it's faults.FFXIV:ARR is a remake of the 2010 game FFXIV, which frankly? Was absolutely terrible.The original game suffered from poor UI, poor world design, a dull and slow (Even by MMO standards) storyline and terrible optimisation leading to significant technical issues.There is only so much you can do with this and this shows when we look at the current game world.The current world is made up mainly of what was the original open game world which has had the massive bloat cut from it, the areas worth keeping turned into zones which are seperated by zone transitions.These aren't instanced, which is good, but still it does break immersion a bit.Thankfully, this isn't likely to be an endearing issue as developers have acknowledged the size of the world which though acceptable, could use a bit more to it and have said that we will be seeing significant increases to the world's size in major expansions (the first of which is expected in the second or third quarter of 2014).There are also some key class types which are noticably absent from the game, for example the stealthy ambusher, (thief, rogue, ninja etc), however once again the developers have acknowledged this issue and said plans are in place to bring in new classes in future patches and expansions.Typically, I would count this as a major negative when forming my opinion on a game but I have been very impressed with how reliable Square-Enix are for following through on promises and fixing or introducing things where needed.So I'm willing to take their ""We are aware of this and we have plans in motion to meet these requests"" in good faith, something I am VERY hesitant to extend to many if not most game developers these days.Overall?FFXIV:ARR is the equivilent of a miracle in gaming. Not only rescuing a title otherwise doomed to ridicule, but improving it to such an extent that it deserves a place in the genre's historybooks on account of it's merits.It has it's issues sure, but nothing that comes close to being considered a major con against it's abundance of pros.I highly recommend buying this game, or at the very least, putting it onto a watch list and keeping a very close eye on it over the next few months to see just how well it is cared for for yourself.I'll give this an 8/10 :VTL;DR - This be some seriously good ♥♥♥♥, but it has some things that need attention. Buy it or keep an eye on it!			"

												As you can see I have dumped more hours into this then I'm proud to admit. But my god, I don't regret it one bit. This MMORPG is HEAVILY story based. So if you're the type to skip all the cutscenes you may find this incredibly boring. On that note,  FF XIV has an amazing story and side stories even. They always keep you coming back for more!Depending on the server you join, nearly all communities are friendly. FF XIV is challenging but not so much that the most casual of casuals can't enjoy, however there raids for those that like a hardcore challange. This is a subscription based MMORPG, but it's worth every penny. The servers are well maintained and rarely go down. With that being said, there are updates to keep the player community busy nearly at all times. Seriously, if you're a fan of MMORPGs and Final Fantasy this could very well be the game for you. However, I would go to their website first and do the free trial!			"

												Extremely noob friendly. And you will be a noob for a looooooong time. Take that how you want to. I launch with NVIDIA so  Steam doesn't track anymore. Thank god for that as I appear to be a person with a life to my Steam friends. ""Yo wanna play Arma?"" ""Hey get on Skype we're gonna play League."" ""Where you been bro?"" Me: ""You know I got a girlfriend and a new job and yea everything in my life is too imprtant for video games."" When in reality this is the only thing I do now. Should you waste your life playing this? Absolutely not. Will you anyway? Of course because it has a way better story than real life and pretty colors. Don't play this game. Don't play mmos. But if you decide you want to become a sack I reccommend this vessel to everlasting emptiness. 9 Lol Dragoons out of 10.			"

												I will recommend this game to anyone. My hours are increasing by the days that I play.This game will steal your life and never make you want to go outside. Lol. Just kidding.Pros:NO GENDERBIND. I love this, I can be all the classes without having to make a new character, I don't have to be a certain race to play all the classes. I do everything on one character and it's amazing like that.Crafting is awesome, Most crafting mmos are pretty straight foward. You get the materials, Boom done. That's not it works in FFXIV, In this game, You use your skills, get the materials and use your skills to make the material you're going for. It's like a little mini game to keep you interested. It's a very fun thing to do in game.Community: Omg, where do I start? All the mmos I have played. I immediately go solo, and do everything on my own unless I'm forced to party. This community is WONDERFUL. They're nice, and not rude at all. I've only experienced one rude person in my hours. The guilds are wonderful and want to help new players level up. I was afraid to join a guild but when I did. It was lovely. I was welcomed and offered help when I got stuck. Dungeons, you can't do them alone so having an amazing community is a good thing.Story: The story is literally the only reason why I got this game in the first place, but knowing what I know now. It's a great game all together. The story is engaging, interesting and definately is worth the sub. and with Heavensward. There's even more story now. So it's really worth it to enage fully in the story.End game: Past level 50, or past level 60. This is where this game jumps to the top of my list as Best MMos.Simply because. There's simply NEVER nothing to do. There's so many things to do, to keep you busy. Right when you hit 50. The game opens up even more, You can travel to new places. Fight harder dungeons and earn tombstones for amazing glamours.Music/Scenery The soundtrack is amazing. I find myself listening to it most days when I'm on and taking in the beautiful graphics. When it rains. You can see your avatar wet, when it's windy. Your hair blows. It's very cool to me at least.Races: Also, The races are awesome. You pick one race, then there's two more. Like Miqote. You can be a seeker or the sun or a keeper of the moon. Lots of things to pick from in characther creation. Amazing selections. Lots of hairstyles. Wide Variety of eyes, highlights for hairs and voices etc. It's very nice to have so much selection. ^_^Cons: I only have a one con.Grinding can get repeative, you will have to multiple dungeons, and fight along the same monsters etc etc. That can get boring. But some dungeons are tricky so it's better if you know what you're doing.This game is great. It's worth the sub and worth the extra money to get heavensward. I will continue to play it and tell people to jump into the wonderful world of Eorzea. :D			"

												Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is Square Enix's way of showing that they care about our experience and is the reason why I love the Final Fantasy series.There is no reason why you shouldn't try this MMO. There is a 14 day free demo (with some chat and levelling restrictions but still enjoyable), and if you like what you play, then you can get the game along with 30 more days of free (non-sub) game time! That's a whooping 44 subscription free days! Now let's get into the pros and the cons.Pros: - Fantastic soundtrack (as expected from a final fantasy game) composed by Nobuo Uematsu.- Polite and helpful player base. (Don't know what to do? Ask a bypassing player and they'll usually answer and provide even more help than you would initially expect.)- Role Playing is an option and you can create custom macros!- Enjoyable story to share with your friends- You can play and level all classes with just ONE character!- Frequent patches - Not pay to win- A plethora of side and main content- Controller support (you can also change button layouts from Xbox to Playstation)- CROSS PLATFORM!- New player friendly (story mode is basically a tutorial that teaches you new things slowly as you progress)- Seasonal events such as Halloween and Christmas- The pleasure of making new friends and joining a guild for the first time.Cons:- Small instanced zones (though it shouldn't be a problem after the Stormblood expansion comes out with the end of PS3 support)- There are a lot of kill and collect quests that may become repetitive (but to be expected of in MMOs)- The story almost seems nonexistent somewhere in the mid-game- Non-story quest dialogue is somewhat uninteresting to read most of the time.I am enjoying A Realm Reborn as a fan of the Final Fantasy series and have barely scratched the surface (yet) and there's not much else to say, go try this game out for yourself.

												A little slow to get started but the game is loyal to the Final Fantasy franchise, controls feel polished and are not alien to anyone who is familiar with MMO's. Game play is smooth and although taking alittle time to really feel it gets started is enjoyable and encompasses ideas from many different MMO's.In short if you have enjoyed any of the more polished subscription based MMO's of the past 10 years, e.g. WoW, Rift, DAoC then you will probably find this is well worth a look.

												Honestly, I never review games. All I do is READ them, but this game really caught my eye and I truly believe it deserves one. Final Fantasy XIV has to be one of the most fun MMORPG's on the market to date. You jump right into the story and feel like you're listening to someone read a really well written book. It draws you in and makes you want to hear more and more with every passing hour. First off I would like to point out that Final Fantasy XIV has one of the most beautiful soundtracks I have ever heard in my entire gaming life. It fits really well with every location you reach, and the battle music is one that will bring back memories for all the Final Fantasy Vets who play .Second, I would like to say that the graphics quality is out of this would for any MMO to date that I know of. it may only be DX9 but they gave thee game a full graphics overhaul. Playing on the lowest settings gives you STANDARD DEF CONSOLE graphics, but when you crank up the settings, BAM! you look close and every bit of clothing has texture, every shadow is perfectly cast, and the over all exicution is remarkable.Finally I would like to say that after over 200 hours of in game time, I have made many friends. The community is wonderful. I remember when I was about a level 14 White Mage, I was taking on a level 17 monster and I was low on health. Another Healer out of the blue healed me and a Black Mage helped me defete the enemy and gave me about 5000gil to buy better gear. Everyone playing this game seems to help one another as best they can whenever needed and that is probably the best part of it all. Personal Rating for this game would be a 9/10 just because sometimes when you stop playing for about a week or two and come back to it, you may get confused on where to go and it leaves you to figure it all out. but other than that little disadvantage, I have to say that this is an all around perfect game. And the edition of multi class gaming on one character makes it stand out from all MMOS I have played.			"

												I have put a lot of time into this game since it came out in 2013 and I think a lot of that has to do with the community of the players. I haven't played a ton of MMO's before, but of my limited experience Final Fantasy XIV has the best community yet. People are usually very helpful and, depending on your server of choice, there is almost always a place for you no matter what kind of player you are.The game itself is almost a love letter to long-time Final Fantasy fans in some ways. There are so many references and homages to other Final Fantasy games that the most hardcore fans can really appreciate it. Personally I learned a lot about some of the games I either hadn't played or not played a lot. New content is constantly in development and each patch regularly brings enough content to keep me busy until the next one. Not only the frequency but the quality of these patches has been pretty astounding. Each patch usually brings along with it a whole new set of references as well.Graphically the game is quite beautiful. There are plenty of cracks if you look close enough, but the characters and scenery are very well-done. In the pre-Heavensward areas you would be hard-pressed to find details in almost any zone that seem lazy or unintentional. There are many small, hidden spots with their own little stories to tell through short NPC dialog boxes.The story is easily one of the strongest points of the game. As you level up and journey through Eorzea you can really feel your character being tested and tried to become the Hero of Light. Everywhere NPC's will recognize your strength, whether it be as a seasoned Adventurer who has killed literal gods or as a world-renowned artisan that can craft the finest items in the realm. They really make your accomplishments feel just like that.The combat is probably the least notable thing the game has, but the large range of classes and the fact that you can master every one on a single character is very welcome. So far the Heavensward expansion has increased the enjoyability of all classes, really expanding them to be much deeper than complex than before. My personal favorite, black mage, has especially seen some much-needed love in making it less of a bore to play.This is a lot more than I intended to write, but I can't help myself when it comes to FFXIV. I really love everything about it.			"

												The result of Square Enix deciding to make their own version World of Warcraft. But better.How so?-You can own your own house-Don't need 10000000 alt characters to learn professions (one character learns it all)-Everything is less grindy (leveling, crafting, etc)-Playerbase is EXTREMELY friendly, have not met any rude players in my 250ish hours (I've met a role-player that would not leave me be until he convinced me that he was a moogle and not just a midgit. It was hilarously entertaining)In a nutshell, i can only describe it as final fantasy's World of warcraft. You got chocobos, cat girls, dragoons and airships. Wrap it all up in the fact that the storyline is good aswell, and you've got a game that's 100% worth the monthly subscription, even for a casual player.Only downside is that you'll probably end up getting a life by playing this game since everyone's so friendly and talkative here. Then slowly realize that you're living your life through the game, but be perfectly fine with it.			"

												The best mmo online I've played, I really love this game, many cool classes and races to play, player who don't have many time to play endgame stuff can focus on jobs like alchemist, blacksmith, culinarian, goldsmith, fisher and much more. The graphics is very nice and cured, character customization is wide and you can buy/craft lot of outfits or unlock new ones with the game events, the story is engaging and there are lots of dungeons and bosses to defeat and then there are also many other activities to do and the one I liked the most is the ability to buy a house and furnish it as you wish. The community is very cheerful and friendly, so much that I spent more time to talking than play, there are a lot of things I would like to add but I don't want to make it too long.. so yeah I would definitely recommend to try at least the free trial, I'm sure you'll love it if you like this gamestyle			"

 My thoughts on Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn Pros+ Excellent Storyline and storytelling, definitely feels like a final fantasy game.+ Ability to change classes at anytime (Except in dungeons or raids) without creating an alt.+ Beautiful soundtrack composed by Nobuo Uematsu.+ Fun and challenging endgame content that feels rewarding upon completion.+ Game is constantly updated with fresh content periodically.+ (Mostly) Friendly community.+ Great looking game.+ Combat :D (Only past level 30, otherwise it does feels kinda lame.)+ Clean UI interface that is editableNeutral= In-depth crafting system, although I never really got into it myself.= Game isn't PvP focused. This doesn't bother me but it may bother some people.= Subscription fee of $15 USD/month.= No Oceanic servers for Australian players (You have a choice of 250ms or playing with people who speak a different language).Cons- Some Low resolution textures which are quite visible. Although this is slightly forgiven because of cross-platform support.- Players who are not interested in story will find it harder to get interested in the game- Levelling is rather quick, but still feels grindy. Even with the Armoury bonus for receiving your first 50 class.- No skill trees for class customisation.- Character customisation is mediocre. - Not an open world mmo, there is a large amount of loading screens when going between areas.- Ruins your social life. My friends no longer talk to me but that's ok because I now exist a short, pink-haired lizard girl. Conclusion Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is probably the most fun I've had in an mmo for a long time, having tried games such as TERA, WoW, BnS, Vindictus and more. Most of the cons listed I would not consider to be major, and the pros heavily outweigh them. I would recommend trying out the demo beforehand as this mmo may not be for everyone, especially those who do not enjoy PvE content as much. Overall: 9.5/10  "

												Best MMO on the market right now in my opinion. There's a lot of main story quest which everything is gated behing, however IF you have the patience to get through it and not get caught up in the typical MMO mindset of ""must get to endgame as soon as possible"" then you'll find a story which (while having many filler quests) is as good as every other Final Fantasy game.Coming from other MMOs the combat does certainly feel slow at first (and it is) but I advanced, got more skills that were off the global cooldown, and faced bosses with more demanding mechanics, I found that the slower pace definitely didn't hinder the game at all.A really good feature that I think many people miss out on is how Square Enix treat previous content too. This is probably the biggest problem in a game like WoW. As soon as a new patch,or expansion releases, previous raids and dungeons become almost completely irrelevant. In FFXIV there's systems in place which makes it so that even at end game, all previous dungeons and bosses still provide relevant rewards for the majority of the playerbase, so while you will be repeating the same content often, there's such a large pool of content TO repeat that it stays more interesting for longer than say a raid in WoW does, where you may be sick of it after you have it on farm and have to just repeat it every week, while progressing through the same raid, with the same bosses and the same mechanics, but on a harder difficulty.It should be added that the zones, music and story in general definitely make for one of, if not THE, most immersive experiences I've had in any MMO in about a decade or so.Criticisms about the volume of story quests shouldn't be ignored (especially the unnecesarry fetch quests etc, I wont defend them), but I think people who say it's an objectively bad thing are missing the point that it's meant to be a story that you progress through like in a singleplayer game. And it definitely feels more rewarding getting through the story to access the endgame as opposed to just doing random meaningless quests and dungeons like in other MMOs.Pretty much this game is great, and for people who want a 'traditional' Pay-to-Play MMO that has an insane amount of polish, and a development team who obviously care deeply for the game, I don't think there's anything that comes even close that's currently available.I think FFXIV has pretty convincingly cemented a spot as one of the best MMOs of the last decade, if not of all time.

												I used to be a huge WoW player back in the day, but like many, I found the game ended up going in a direction that I did not agree with.  I like my MMORPG's to requre dedication, skill, and a little bit of luck.  After I quit WoW, I started to get the itch for another MMO, I heard good things about FF14, so I decided to give it a try.  This game is brilliant.  being able to have all of the different classes represented with one character, with no restrictions on crafting, makes this a completionests dream.  I could sit and write about every intricate detail of the game, but it would require a book.  Bottom line is, if you are alooking for an MMO that will proivde you with an overwhelming amount of content, then pony up and give this game a try...you wont be dissapointed.			"

												Day 2: I've started to attract the attention of males of various races.Two guys, not going to mention any names, noticed me as I waltzed into a bar to accept a quest, and started complimenting my rear.I felt sort of violated, so I explained why I was wearing such a skimpy armor. It really just offered me a better defense stat than the armor which covered more of my body.Naturally they didn't mind, so I told them,""Beat it, I'm not your Final Fantasy.""Lo and behold, they felt so rekt they left the bar.10/10 gaming experience.(EDIT: Seems like this actually got some views. I'll throw in my two cents to help people actually interested in buying the game. I can't say much about it, but I'm enjoying it a lot more than any MMORPG I've played. It's an accessible MMORPG with casual elements that also offers a challenge for you hardcore MMO players! The dialogue is fun too, which is a plus. I find myself reading it a lot more than in other games. Another thing I really like about the game is that you can have all the skills in the game on just one character, by switching your main arm. That way, you can start as a Gladiator, and begin Conjuring later on in the game if you wish.)			"

												This game is absolutely amazing!! I am not a huge fan of MMORPGs, but this one definately won me over. -For one thing, the story and lore is pretty deep and engaging. For me, that is a big thing in any game. It is the one thing that I am finding stands out from other MMOs. I have played multiple ones growing up and even recently (Elder scrolls, neverwinter, WoW, City of Heroes, Everquest, Lineage, etc), and I keep coming back to this one. -Second off, the game is just visually stunning. There have been times where I have just logged on and sat my character down somewhere in the forests surrounding Gridania while I talked to people in my Free Company (guild). -I love the fact that while I can play with people, I never feel like I am forced to interact with people except for the mandatory story dungeons. Even then, I feel you don't get left behind in these dungeons as much as you do in other games. -The community is very nice. I played games where you would go and do a dungeon and just get left behind. I don't have the same problem with this game. Yes, there are a few a-holes here and there, but for the most part people are willing to help you out. Don't know the mechs? Ask and usually someone will explain it to you. I have had random people just come up and raise me and heal me when I was out leveling. People I had just met and had just joined the same FC and me would give me high level gear just because they made it and they saw I didn't have it. Also, they are pretty easy going and funny. Can't count the number of times I have come across a random dance party or mount war in game. Makes for some very times. -You can do pretty much whatever you want with your character. Sick of being an archer and want to try out healing? Go do it! All you need to do is go to the guild to start your quest and get your weapon. After that, all you have to do is switch your weapon and armor to whatever you want to be. You don't loose anything from doing this either. If you are a level 15 archor, you stay a level 15 archer until you decide to level it up again. You just equip your bow and the armor for it and you are ready to go. -Even at end game it doesn't feel like I have to search for something to do. There is still plenty to do even after you finish main quest. There are tons of side quests that have interesting stories and even tie in with main plot. You can get some pretty cool things from doing them as well. There is also an amusment park, housing you can save up to buy (yes, you can own your own house), pony farming, and beast quests, and just so much more. -You can get married in game. It is actually a really interesting feature. I married someone in my FC and we go matching rings that allowed us to teleport to the other person's side. We also got a mount and the people we invited to our wedding got minions. There are 3 different wedding options to choose from. There is a free option (you get the matching rings and I believe a wedding dress/suit). The 2nd option (the one I chose) includes what I have just told you, plus an emote, and you can customize the wedding. The 3rd one I believe you can choose different outfits and a bit more customization. Over all, it is a very cool feature that I absolutely loved using and loved going to them (someone bought me a bridesmaid dress to wear to their wedding). The cons-There is a monthly subscriptions fee. It is cheaper to do the month by month if you only plan on making one character on a server. However, if you plan to do standard, buying more at once is cheaper. (good to note though that they do give you stuff the longer you play the game)-People who like to immediately do things with friends will find the game a little slow until they hit level 20 main story quest. You get your first dungeon when you get to the level 15 main story quest, and you don't get your first mount until you hit level 20 in main story quest. I believe level 15 story quest is also when you finally get to travel outside of your home region. -It is more expensive to buy through steam than it is from their website from what I understand. Keep in mind that the one on steam comes with 1 month free subscription. I do not know if the same applys to the one on their website. Best to do your own research. Overall, it is fun and entertaining game that I would recommend to beginner and upward players.			"

												This game is a true gem. It's horrendous start seems to keep this game under appreciated in most mainstream circles and I honestly didn't know about it until a certain youtuber started talking about/would never shut up about his bird squad and next thing I knew I was knee deep in this game and am loving every minute of it.PROS:-1Char=Any class. 1 Character can aquire and play as every class, no need to make one character for each class and this allows a player to ""hotswap"" classes as opposed to logging out, changing chars, logging back in-Recruit a friend. While this is only noticed if you dragged a buddy into your addiction, this feature is great because it truly rewards you for getting other players and the rewards greatly help the sherpas out there (2 person chocobos bro)-Environment. I haven't reached 50 and touched Heavenward yet but just the starting areas are truly beautiful. I run the game on max and there are SO many little details they put in to this game that make it feel more open world RPG than MMO. Whether it be the realtime weather (w/ physics (ftw)), The godrays and dynamic shadows, the very subtle character physics (it took me getting a 4k monitor to even notice the boob physics, needless to say, I was disapointed with myself), The amazing foliage (it's not Witcher 3 levels but its pretty close to modded skyrim), the cities/towns and NPCs in them... I could go on but you get my point-Armors and weapons. I'm much more of an armor guy myself (whats the point of doing it if you dont look good doing it), but both the weapons and armor are really stunning. they base stuff is typical medieval platemail and leather but then you get into some scifi sh!t, I saw a bow that, when drawn, deploys a shield because why not. Some weapons are just light, so whatever your kink, they got you covered-mounts. if you want a plain ol' horse you came to the wrong game, but, if you wanted a giant 2 story tall mecha chocobo or a flying eyeball with wings, then boy your in for a treat. (side note: each mount (for the most part) has their own music and thats just a really nice subtle addition that they didn't need to add)CONS:-Mounts (or lack there of). You have to get a permit to ride a mount, but you have to join a grand company to get the permit, but you have to be alteast 25-30 to join a Grand company... I hope you like cardio. I had 5 mounts by the time I could actually ride one, to be fair, most of them were from events, game time ""veteran"" rewards, and recruit a friend rewards but still... I WANNA RIDE THE CHOCOBO-1st Person. This game has a 1st person option, and that's cool, but its obvious they intended for people to play in 3rd. There is nothing when in 1st, you don't have a body, theres no head bob, you dont see your weapon or the visual effects/cues from your attacks. Overall just disapointing, especially with the rise of VR and my desire for a SAO-esq future-Spam bots. I know every game has them and that there are MMOs out there that are WAY worse but it is hard to read pub chats when totally obvious ""get tons of mooney for free"" ads pop up in the chat box. but thats honestly just a minor preference issueWell I hope this ""totally"" not biased review helps some of you that are on the fence about this game. I know subscritions are a turn off but the quality I've gotten was more than worth it, assuming you're going to play the game more than not at all.			"

In terms of entertainment<->money spent ratio, this game wins over many, many others in my library. To get more into detail:- very casual design, although it offers challenging endgame content as well- many alternatives in terms of what to do, you're not bound to farm dungeons if you'd rather craft or gather items or do something else entirely- wonderful music underlining the game and its scenes- nice graphics, even on weaker machines- crossplatform play (PS3/PS4/PC)- frequent new content- many story-driven dialogs and cutscenes, entertaining for those who are interested- easy-to-understand classes and gameplay but challenging to master- pay-to-play but therefore not pay-to-win- incredibly nice gamepad controls, beats keyboard and mouse even, trust me- devoted developers, yes they actually listen to the community   - regular Q&A livestreams + new content showcasing called ""Letters from the Producer Live""Please note that I own the steam version since its 1 year anniversary (that means I've been playing it for over a year before that already, so feel free to add many hundreds of hours of gameplay to my current value)			"

												Ibuki will start by saying she has been playing this gem since closed beta phase 2. Actual hours are close to 3,000 in game.If you are new to this please disregard Balmung unless you want to be hit on by big black Rogs 24/7 while waiting for a queue to pop. Also Gilgamesh is for the elitists so Ibuki advises against this as well as it creates a bad experience for new players to get told how ♥♥♥♥ they are 24/7. Now that that's out of the way, enjoy your opening scene filled with you stuck in the back of a cart/ship on your way to one of Eorzea's city states, which you pick based on your starting class. Along the way, you are introduced to a bunch of nobodies who become sombodies and then nobodies again when all is said and done. If you feel attached to a particular character, get ready to hate them as soon as the voice acting starts (even japanese dub is bad). Luckily this was rectified somewhat in the HW expansion as beginning with the first quest all NPCs save for a few have new VAs' that are actually british instead of the Sam Riegel and Liam O Brian being hammered into your ear for 3/4ths of the story.When starting out at lvl 1 you will only have 1 skill to use in combat, as you level you'll get more and more skills and eventually your class will become very complex to manage, such as the case of Lancer to Dragoons. Once you get a feel for your class (around ilvl 200) and you've wiped to titans landslides or other easily avoidable AOEs and shouted ""Lag"" in the party chat at least 15 times, you will start to get the hang of prioritizing mechanics over moves. Being able to simultaneously DPS/Heal while a guy shouts THE EDGE IS CALLING TONIGHT and you're getting punched off the edge is truly an experience to behold. If you are less combat focused and just want to fiddle the market with outdated gear so people have an excuse to use gil on something, then look no further then crafting. But unfortunately if you want to make any money off crafting you have to become an Omnicrafter which means getting every crafting class to 50 or 60 (if you like putting razer blades to your neck). The true end game for a crafter is crafting the newest glamour gear and selling them for millions of gil only to realize you have nothing worthwhile to buy and you go back to selling and making more of these things until a new patch comes out that does the same thing. With HW being an Omnicrafter is no longer necessary for the lvl 60 renditions however the new skills that were added in HW for crafters are just dumbed down versions of the other skills, which is bad. Gathering is also another avenue but theres no point in telling you about sitting for 2 hours trying to catch a fish with a green color instead of none.Ibuki recommends this for the constant stream of content and the communication between the devs and the players despite being in different continents across the globe. This has problems atm but at least its not sitting there for almost 2 years with no new content added until the next expansion. As time has shown anything can be fixed in this game as long as Yoshi dedicates development towards it, which he is. My only complaints from 1.0 to ARR are the belts getting removed from the visual model of the character, Mi'qote asses being flattened out and lightning tiered for the sake of development costs, and the fact that when you turn around you instantly snap to ot the animation whereas 1.0 you actually turned around and moved realistically, also the cutscenes were far superior in 1.0.  However everything else was Brendan Fraisered. Oink! "

let me sum up:+ Atmosphere: absolutely AMAZING. Music is top notch, visuals do pull you in. - Character creator: lacking. It's better than WoW's ""choose your head"", but it's choosing from 4 presets for majority of your features. - early gameplay: rather boring. The game is very friendly if its your first MMO as it will be rather hand holding, however you accumulate your skills slowly and up until level 30 nothing amazing happens in the main story. I think I got pulled in by the atmosphere, gathering and crafting system and the players around me, but the early gameplay hours did not leave me the best impression, which I think will be the reason most people will turn away. On the upside there's incentives for high level players to queue for low level dungeons (leveling roulette) so you will not have a problem progressing while leveling. + the story: best story I've ever seen in an MMO. You're the focus of the story, but that means that you get to develop a relationship with NPCs and really care for them. As I'm writing this, patch 3.3 was released which wrapped up the Dragon War storyline. I really enjoyed it! This is pretty much the only game where I wait for patches for the story. That being said you absolutely have to do your story to enter the expansion content and to keep up with the end game, so if you're not a story person you might not like this game. + late game: loving the end game. Extreme primals and Savage raids are my favorite thing to do and they're sufficiently challenging. If you're a casual gamer every second patch is a catch up patch, meaning that your item level will never be that far from a raider (casual gamers can hit 240, raiders 241 currently). Tomestones for 230 gear are capped weekly and upgrade materials for 240 gear are also capped weekly, meaning to keep up with the rest of the population you'll need a relatively little time investment weekly. + random knick knacks that developers keep on putting in: talking about The Gold Saucer (an in game casino like place where you gamble a fake currency that is no way tied to your gold (gil) or real life money), Palace of The Dead (a never ending dungeon that currently has 50 floors, that you can enter with friends of any level and gain experience if you're not level 60, end game tomestones if you are level 60 (currency for gear) and you can get an iLvl 235 weapon for any class that you want from there (otherwise known as the wellfare weapon as it's perfect for end game right now and only takes 8 hours of dungeon to get, so if you and your friends did an hour of it a day, you'll get it in a bit over a week)), aquapolis (a dungeon that spawns from treasure maps. Never used to do treasure maps before, now it's an entertaining thing to do) and the likes. I absolutely love this part of the game and engage in it often. + crafting and gathering: as a crafter or a gatherer you'll get as much skills as a fighting class. Your end game could be just crafting and it will feel very rewarding. I love to gather more than I like to craft, but it was one of the things that pulled me into this game, because it didn't feel like a side activity. other things worth mentioning:+ you can have all the classes on one character. Due to how the gearing up process works, you won't be able to have all the classes geared, but fortunately many classes do share gear sets. All tanks share the same gear (except for weapon) so if you have a tank, you might as well have all 3 for varriety in tackling content, if you have a healer, you might as well have all 3. I have 5 out of 13 battle classes at level 60 (DPS casters and healers) and I'm happy with it. I did not feel the need to roll another character. PvP exists. It's not very popular, but it is there. I know that at least some of my guildies engage in it, despite the 10 to 30 minute queues that they encounter. Overall at least check out the free trial. It's the best MMO on the market for me, hands down.			"

												Where do I begin with this game... FFXIV Is the most polished and fun MMO (in my opinion) I have seen in a while. Although there is the monthly subscription fee it is very much worth the money. Although grinding can be boring at times, dungeons, and story quests are always fun to do. PROS:-Huge amount of content-Able to play with friends-Stable engine-Great graphics-Great story-Easy to get in to-Always getting updatedCONS:-Subscription Fee-Grinding for Levels -Dungeon Loot (it is a roulett so you arn't able to always get the item you need)-Load TimesAnyways, FF14 Is a great MMO to get in to, and for long time veterans, And I would totally recomend it!

												I just want to say, this game is great. However, I do have issues with Square Enix's licensing between Steam and Windows.One thing you must know....the STEAM license is in no way compatible to a WINDOWS license. If you own the WINDOWS license already, then do not purchase a STEAM license. This is the fault of Square Enix on incompatibility, not on steam themselves.To quote a Square support ticket:""If you have 'A Realm Reborn' STEAM license the windows license will be incompatible [...]. To be able to play Heavensward if you have the STEAM license, you MUST purchase the expansion through STEAM and register the 20 digit key code that STEAM gives you on the MogStation.In conclusion you are unable to link game codes if you originally have it linked through STEAM and the same goes with WINDOWS, the disclaimers are known to the customer if you are either about to purchase any license keys on either Square Enix Store or STEAM store.""

												Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn has a spot in my gaming heart. I ventured into Eorzea during its first appearance as patch 1.0. I won't deny how awful the game felt during that time. It felt barren and I truly had no idea what was happening. Square decided to take the game down and guarenteed a promising return - they did so with patch 2.0. The game came back completely revamped with nothing but positive improvements. I returned at the start of patch 2.0 and played for a good six months before I broke off to play..., -sigh- World of Warcraft again. I enjoyed the new changes, the classes had their own unique abilities and the main story kept you interested. I returned once again in 2016 and once more when I purchased the game for my Steam account. This time around I was more unhappy with where my journey in Eorzea ended.Pros:- Engaging story to follow and just the right amount of side quests to keep you busy in other zones and other classes to level.- Easy learning curve - very new player friendly with the active help.- Always something to do and plenty of classes/jobs to level up.- One character is all you need to play everything in this game.- The party finder is one of the best I've utilized in every MMO I've played.- You get your moneys worth when it comes to the amount of content released per game.- Being a part of a Free Company (Guild) actually provides useful benefits with buffs/housing.- Plenty of jobs to level and crafting jobs to keep you going if you ever need to change up from your primary build.- Fantastic UI customization built in. You can move practically everything, disable what you don't want to see and even change the size. No need for UI addons for this game!- Some of the best music you can hear in an MMO. I never get tired of hearing Shiva's theme.Cons:- Patch downloading - I want to really hit this hard on a personal level, because before patch 3.0 there was never an issue getting the game patched up and running. I know people have said their say on the discussion section on how you can get past this, but I should never have to alter my network settings or download a VPN to get a game patched up.- Because I used a VPN to get the patch I continue to receive the error i2501 when I try to input any payment to activate a subscription or even buy items from the Mog Station. I've submitted multiple tickets and had three replies now stating my issue has been submitted to someone higher in the customer service chain. To this day I still cannot activate a subscription.- During dungeons cutscenes occur, and there are times when you just want to get going in a dungeon you will have some new players wanting to view the scenes. I don't hold the new players accountable for wanting to watch these scenes, I just wish they didn't happen before and during the group play. I know in Heavensward they minimized the amount of scenes.- Because of the amount of jobs you can level up, running old content over countless times becomes tedious and extremely repetitive, I'd suggest not trying to level everything up at once to avoid this. I did it my second time through and I got everything to level 30 and became burnt out.- Battles do feel slower in regards to the global cooldown of a default 2.5 seconds. Early in the game it will make fights feel longer than they need to be.- Inventory space needs to be larger. This is a con for now, but it was said when Stormblood arrives we will see an increase for our inventory.- Converting items into materia. I really dislike the approach to this mechanic, because you need to have a spiritbound with the item before you can even think about turning it into a useful piece of materia. Creating a bond with a piece of equipment just feels weird and pointless. If I happen to obtain a piece of gear I don't need, I'd rather just convert it instantly.- The approach to sell your items on the market is tedious. You use two retainer NPCs (or more if you bought more with real money) who will hold up to 12 (I believe it is 12) items in the market for you to sell. I think a general auction house such as something on WoW would suffice. Why make something that just lists your items a pain?There are more pros and cons floating in my mind, but that is just bringing it down to detailed knitpicks. I loved this game a lot, it was just unfortunate how it has ended for me. I wanted to keep playing, but their entire account setup is completely frustrating and more work than it needs to be. However, I will continue to recommend this game as it continues to grow and change. Red Mage job is coming and who wouldn't be excited about that?			"

												Started playing this game with some friends last week, they no longer get on as much.I'm playing this game for more than 7 hrs each day. I'm addicted.Trying to get my friends to play with me.""I'll play it when I want to.""Muh friends.Play alone now.Throw snowballs at strangers.Pretty fun game.I've set aside money to buy the expansion already, if you're looking for an MMO to get into by yourself or with some buddies go with this one. You won't regret it. You also get 30 days free of play time so that's really nice.Also one feature I REALLY enjoy is how you can play any class you want without having to create another character. You just have to hit lvl 10 in the class you started out in before you can start another one. You can even cross-over skills from one class to another!---------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE!Its been a year and about 2 weeks since i bought this and im still playing it, not as much as I used to. I honestly didn't expect to be this into an mmo ever, I don't regret anything. If you're still looking for a game to sink some time into I highly recommend giving FFXIV a shot; I've got quite a few max level classes and can't wait for the new expansion, Stormblood, to drop. :D			"

												A spectacular redemption of the original Final Fantasy XIV, A Realm Reborn turned one of the worst MMOs of all time into one of the very best. FFXIV: ARR combines elements from RIFT, WoW, Guild Wars 2, and a whole host of MMOs to create a fabulous gestalt of MMO mechanics, one that offers more and more the further you go. While TOR is still my favorite MMO due to it's excellent storytelling, FFXIV is definitely my favorite MMO in terms of it's mechanics, though the story here is pretty good too. Set a few years after a fiery apocalypse destroyed the land of Eorzea, the world is just about getting back up on it's feet after the cataclysm. However, the warlike and expansive Garlean Empire has other plans, seeking to subdue the violent and destructive Primals that make their home in Eorzea: by any means necessary. While suffering from a lack of voice acting and an exceptionally slow start, the mysteries and questions of the FFXIV story are compelling enough that you want to see how it all turns out. Overall, while it doesn't have too many ideas of it's own, FFXIV's polish and quality are more than enough to compensate. Looking for the pinnacle of the hotkey based MMO? Look no further.			"

												At the time of writing this, I will have put 1300 some odd hours of my life in this video game. Mostly consisting of the trap that ensnares a majority of the people in this game: jumping around your FC house aimlessly until something happens. (Oh wait, there's a revival in old content from 3.0 and before! Give me your poetics bonus, lets go clear Alexander Normal, I need to get my relic. Better get on the train while it lasts! Need a Coil carry/clear, hit up that party finder and tell em bout your bonus!)It plays too safe, too limited and too strict, reducing player agency and planning to ""Look up a guide and do it like that"". It's not the thinking man's MMO, it's not the even the non-thinking man's MMO, it's the painfully generic experience with no risk/reward scenarios that retirees from World of Warcraft and the people that are new to an MMO love.Player interaction is at best non-existent to barely there, and this is including FC chat and any linkshells you might be in at the time. There's no reward for helping people, no sense of gratification, it's a nameless charity ""spin the wheel"" of dead content you don't want to do, but you do it for the tomes.(Less so the tomes now, with the new relic. It's spamming A1-4N runs like a hamster in a wheel to get a 10 item level increase for people who don't raid. Maybe i210 will encourage people to raid, or maybe it'll encourage them to reflect upon their misdeeds and hours of grinding. Thank you SE.)You'd think, oh 1300 hours is a long time, you must've gotten your money's worth at this point, right?The answer: No.PvP queues (which I signed up for to cap my weekly tomes than rather deal with the brain dead community post-launch) can take upwards of an hour, and games can last an hour as well. Chalk up 100 matches or so and a big chunk of my time was just waiting. Waiting is something you do in this game, quite frequently. Queues in general, if you were late to the party can be a rather thrilling alt-tab experience, in which you can enjoy the lovely scenery and music alongside shout chats filled with ""INV PLS"" or ""check the party finder"" (When hunts were semi-relevant again in 3.0 release, but now that's just dead. It's either memes or B rank daily hunt call outs, pick your poison.)So I took up mining, and botany, and fishing. Crafting, leveling an alt class, and so on and so on, till I was sick of both that and the waiting I did between.Most of the time you play because of an obligation, whatever it maybe, and always hovers very close to peer pressure and addiction at times. Would I recommend this to people who never played an MMO in their life? Yes.Is it an MMO for those that loved XI or really any kind of MMO with social aspects to it's community? No. (Or want satisfying midcore content)Don't play this game with friends unless you don't want to be their friend for very much longer. (Or want to progression raid)EDIT: Look it's patch 3.1 soon to be 3.2. I was never much a fan of new content being trickled out at ridiculously slow pace. Truly this new raid tier will save XIV! Time will only tell if 4.0 will actually be good.			"

												I started on PS3 and switched to PC when things got complicated. When it comes to MMOs, I've played Lord of the Rings Online (a LOT of it), WoW, DC Universe Online, Warhammer Online, Guild Wars 1 and 2, Runescape (yep, mid thousands were fun), The Old Republic, and Rift. I'm probably leaving out some trials or free MMOs that I've forgotten about. This is hands down the best.  The content is great (there's only a handful of coop content that aren't great), the devs absolutely love and care about the players (jumping in-game to say thank you to the players, with verification that they ARE the dev team; amazing), the music is great, it has great pacing, fun even when playing solo (I JUST began running around with a regular group of players and I've been playing since 2013), the storyline makes you feel like your involvement is actually purposeful, there's side content that's there just to be really fun/funny (you know things are gonna be great whenever Godbert shows up), you aren't EVER constrained to one thing (I feel like tanking today; you know what? I want to fling spells today), and there's enough references, inspiration, and reverence for Final Fantasy lore to make any long time fan swoon.I whole heartedly recommend this game.			"

												REGISTERING:I think the only bad thing I have to say about this game so far is REGISTERING. I remember it was the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ experience with FFXI too.If you buy the full game outright you should be okay, it just takes a bit to login to the site and add the code etc.But if you are trying to upgrade from a trial and using steam keyes it can be a pain in the ♥♥♥. For example last night my son downloads the trial and registers an account. He tries logging in and it tells him this account cant be used on a trial on the same day. Wtf right? lol.After some fiddling around I just had him run a copy of my FFXIV folder that i copied to his desktop and it seemed to work with THAT installation. No idea.I also have another issue with another install where it was also registered as a trial. Bought the game and the keys registered fine. However that install does not show a button on the website to add Game Time. Simply no button for it anywhere. Still no reply from SE.GAME EXPERIENCE:Other than that the freakin game is pretty damn fun, and it runs great even on less powerful computers. The only thing NEW players may feel annoyed with at first since it is quite different than most MMOs, is the Class\Job system, and getting use to the map. Also the game is relatively just a slower paced game over all. But I actually like the story and the animations and detail in the characters.CLASS SYSTEM: Let me explain regarding the class\job system (which may be changed in the future according to some speculative sources). Basically you can choose a class in the beginning, which you can take to cap if you want. However most people like to specialize and get a ""Job"" which is basically a specialized version of your class. However to unlock those you need to meet certain requirements. In most cases it involves having the parent class at lvl 30, and a cross-class Class (yeah i know) at level 15 because your specialized Job will use skills from both classes. Don't ask me I didn't design this ♥♥♥♥ haha. The way they did the Job and Sub job system in XI was far more easier and superior IMO.Anyway you have to essentially level 2 classes to acquire the specialized Job you want. What makes it more of a pain in the ♥♥♥ is the fact that if you want to level say Ninja as your main. You need to first level Pugilist (to level 10 however realistically you will probably need to level it to about 15-17 so you can even travel to Limsa Limosa where the Rogue guilde is located), then travel to Limso Limosa and unlock Rogue. Then there you must level it to 30. Finally when you are done with that, you will need to go unlock Ninja.However here is a cool thing about the way classes work. You can do them all on one toon. You can simply switch between them whenever you want (with a small Global Cooldown timer on skills) and don't need to worry about logging in and out of multiple toons. Really the only time you want to make a new character is if you want a new race or gender. Other than that, you should really try to focus on one toon to get the most out of the game's class switching system.GENERAL GAMEPLAY:The gameplay may take getting use to especially if you are use to mostly F2P games. It is less ""actiony"" and IMO more chill paced. I personally like it though. It does have a global cool down of 2.5 which can be reduced if I recal to about 2. Really the core of the battle system isn't so much action and quick reflexes, but more planning and coordinating. Some jobs require a bit more quick thinking than others, but over all I think the combat system is pretty solid albiet different from most.The music is great, and honestly I dont expect anything less from a FF game in regards to music.The animations are really well done too, every character and class has their own animations and they feel pretty unique to their race.The map may be challenging to get use to. It isn't the most easy map to use, but it also isn't difficult. If you arre use to games bread crumbing every single thing with blinking lights showing you EXACTLY where to go etc, you will have a hard time adjusting on the first day. You will notice this especially if you are the type of person that goes on autopilot grinding quests. There's a lot of quests you should probably try to read lmao as they tell you to do something specific and when you get to the destination you realize theres no NPC there waiting to accept your item or whatever. But once you get use to it you will wonder why it was so hard to begin with. You will get use to it trust me. Took me a good day to finally get use to what the icons meant and how navigating it worked.The keybind and macro system is very powerful. If you can get acquainted with the macro system, you will save a lot of clicks and can make some pretty awesome scripts to do things for you in game.INTERFACE:The interface is very customizable. Plenty of options to get it how you want.GRAPHICS:Are very well done. Less bright and colorful than you may be use to from games like Tera, Blade and Soul etc. But I would simply describe it as a bit more realistically colored, not an over exaggerated use of HDR\Bloom. The detail in all the things in the world is also quite awesome. The interesting thing is, as good as the game looks, if you have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer, it still looks good even on the lowest settings.Attention to detail really shows (as in FFXI) when you can see even the jewelry you are wearing as your gear. When you get to level 15 you will unlock quests for you class that gives you a complete set of gear that looks really good for lowbie armor.CONTROLS:Controls are pretty straight forward and standard. However I do like the fact (if you want to) that you can play just about 100% with just keyboard. Everything is pretty accessible with just the keys. Camera, menus, targetting. This is quite rare IMO and unless you played XI, you wouldn't know. I use to play that game with 100% keyboard. However the thing that changed with this game is that some classes require positions for specific skills to be optimal. So you have to move a bit more and a bit quicker, and fully using keyboard may limit this for (monks, ninjas, rogues). Because of this I started using the mouse to control the camera now as it is easier to move in and out of locations during battle.CAMERA:Camera angles are done quite well and aren't simplified like some games. You can zoom out quite well and zoom in. You can also tilt the angle of the camera up or down lef or right which can be useful even just for screenshots. Since this is a standard skill based game, and not targetting, you won't run into bad angles really during combat either.ROLEPLAY:Also the game lends itself to a lot of possibilities for RP if you are into that. Everything from a ton of emotes, facial expressions, sitting on furiture, day and night experience, weather, housing and interactive emotes with other players. I am not much of an RPer anymore but I did recognize the value and thought I'd bring it up.COMMUNITY:I have seen some people have had bad or rather less than favorable experiences in the community, but personally it's been a good change from previous MMOs. Not that they are no trolls or annoying people, every community has that. But there just feels like there is quite a bit less.As a newbie people have helped quite a bit, or have just been friendly and talkative. I really don't have any complaints on the newbie experience with the commnity. I am on cactaur.OVERALL:I think the game deserves a shot if you are looking for something different than the F2Ps that are out there. Honestly I was playing F2P for years and enjoyed the fact they were free (despite still spending plenty of money on their micro transcations) but I felt they were getting boring because they were all starting to feel the same. This game to me feels more like an RPG should feel like. "

												So, I've been around the MMO block more than a few times. World of Warcraft, Star Wars The Old Republic, The Secret World, Age of Conan, both D&D online games, Champions Online, D.C. Universe Online, Rift, and so on... but this one is definitely one of the better ones I've played.Lemme put it this way. I've been a WoW player for the better part of eight years now. I recently picked up this game about midway through the WoW 6.1 content and started playing it right before Heavensward came out, then kept on going with my Miqo'te.So how much have I gotten into this game this time around? When WoW came out with 6.2 -I didn't care-. New raid, new zone, new loot, new mounts, etc. I don't give a crap, I'm too busy going through Dravinia.Pros:- A very strong and engaging story with good characters.- The ability to make one character, but swap between character classes post-creation. This is also used to get the upgraded versions of classes (i.e. Lv30 Thaumaturge + Lv15 Archer = Black Mage).- An in depth crafting system that is very addictive to work with.- The ability to have a chocobo partner who acts as both mount and fighting companion.- 22 Individual character classes/jobs based on the classic Final Fantasy job system.- 11 crafting and gathering classes for making equipment, potions, etc.- Five unique playable races with highly customizeable appearances and two main variants for each race. Six if you get the Heavensward expansion.Cons:- Game will require you to grind via dungeons/levequests around the 40-50 stretch to continue the story (you will constantly run into the 'your level is not high enough to continue' issue).- You can't sell things in the Market/Auction House until around level 20, so making money early on is difficult.- You can only send mail to people on your friend's list, so you can't send mail between alts.

												Game has a special place in my dusty old heart, started when somone dear to me left the country and I felt very lonely. It's definitley an MMO with classes, roles, crafting, etc. You're able to switch classes on the fly after completing the initial lvl. 1 quest. That was cool! It means I don't need an armada of characters to try each job. The story is pretty straightforward, very Final Fantasy, dealing with crystals and summons(primals) and that whole deal. It's not terrible and/or not there at all, so I was pretty happy! There is, of course, MMO grind and there will be frustrated or rude players. That pretty much comes with the territory. But the amount of rude/upsetting players is shadowed by all the friends and helpful players I've met.In MMOs I hate the feeling of slug paced levelling (""At last...in three months I finally hit level 30"" -Me). I've never maxed any levels before in like...any MMO (ever), but in this game I've managed to max out 3 combat and 2 crafting classes...50-60 is rough but not unenjoyable (This is very much MY opinion not everyone finds grinding cathartic or fun etc.). The pacing of levels is fast but not LIGHTSPEED FULL THROTTLE LEVEL 50 IN 10 HOURS fast thanks to story quests, levequests, sidequests, and dungeons/trials.In the end, you get a free 30 days to try the game if you've never touched it. Which is a good chunk of time to test stuff out. Even if you don't like it in the end, you tried it at least! But I do hope you finish your first dungeon or face your first primal and feel the adventure and the teamwork and the general excitement. It's lame but maybe it'll be there. "

												Best MMO I've ever played. It might say right now that I only have a couple hundred hours in, but that not counting the hours I've had on my PS4. So in total around 400-500 hours. Even though it's pay to play its %100 worth it. Each class feels awesome and different. The crafting and gathering classes are extremely fun and rewarding as well. This is a great starter MMO now that it has the mentor system, but its also a great MMO for any veteran MMO players from other games that want a fresh start and something new, yet familar.In short. This game is great.10/10			"

												I liked FF14: ARR up until the expansion. I've played a lot of MMOS (I think at least 30 now) and there are certain things I look for, and really enjoy an MMO having. It doesn't have to, but it gets a big plus in my book if it does. One having interesting and complicated enough mechanics that when you actually finish a boss for the first time, or a dungeon run, it feels like an achievement; that you had to work for it, but it was worth it. The second is having the ability to have different playstyles; the ability to tune your characters closer to how you want to play. The third is an engaging, interesting, and above all USEFUL crafting system.FF14 had 2 of the three; there's no skill trees at all, and not really any way to modify your gear; there's BiS and that's about it. You can do vanity gear over it though, so at least you can look different then every other player the same level as you. Still, the mechanics were awesome, I loved the music and a lot of the themes of the dungeon, and actually LOOKED FORWARD to gathering and crafting, because people LIKED getting HQ gear and useful items later.The world was engaging to look around. The story was... well... decent for an FF game (I don't care for FF games in general myself, I played this because I liked it as an MMO). There was always plenty to do, plenty to collect, plenty to save for, etc.That changed with the expansion. First off, the new maps are a horrid PAIN to get around. They made them HUGE with the intent that ""It'll look cool when you fly around"" and obviously did not give a damn about people who had to hoof it, trying to unlock flying.Oh yeah, you have to hit random nodes and do random quests on the map (including main quest and side quest stuff) to be able to fly. PER NEW MAP. So by the time you unlock flying, you're probably going to be done with wanting to be ON the map.The mechanics are pretty much mostly just ripped from other previous dungeons. One of the first new ones, Sohm Al, we recognized very easily as a 'weenie T6'. And to me, the music was just really boring...As for the crafting part...Apparently Yoshi P (one of the main developers, if not THE main one) has basically stated he hates the fact that crafters figured out how to make things better then dungeon drops. Oh, sorry that the ENTIRE WEEK one might put into making the HQ accesory and the MILLIONS of gil that you might dump into boosting it up to make it SLIGHTLY better bothers you SO MUCH that you basically made ALL crafting completely worthless.Okay, there's pretty much three reasons to craft in games: To make items a cheaper way then just buying them, to make items you actually want to use, and to make unique items you can't get anywhere else.Since quests just THROW high quality gear at players now, and there's NO POSSIBLE way to get the same TIER as dungeon drops, the only item adventurers would really use is food, and there's not really a market for seliing (level 55 gil for 500 gil on the marketboard!). And the only 'unique' items that are remotely worth making are vanity gear, housing items, and stuff for your mounts. Which makes the HUNDREDS of hours both in gathering and crafting completely not worth it, since almost all the housing items aren't that expensive.There's a lot of other things to mention, but basically I felt they ruined the two main reasons I was playing this in the first place. They MIGHT fix it, but I've already been soured on the idea.			"

Top notch MMOFreedom to choose Europa, Americas, or Japan serversGraphically brilliant, uses around 80-90% of my 780ti at 2560x1080 (21:9), maximum settings (+custom post processing) and uses it well.Mouse/Keyboard or Console gamepad both available for use, each with their own specialized interface (Very customizable too).Great character creation, 5+1 Races, with two cultural diversities each.8+1 combat classes, 9+4 advanced specializations called jobs. ALL are available to each character.8 crafting classes, 3 gathering. Again ALL available to each character.Heck, be a full time fisherman if you want. Writing which is rich in story, world establishment and humour of all ranges.Gameplay and story start off easy and at a smooth pace, but eventually amounts to huge depth and progression.Seasonal moods are refreshing and explored in full, all year round.No pitiful pay-to-win or limit breaking cash shops. Simply a costume/dye, mount and mini pet store for the most narcissistic among us.AMAZING COMMUNITY (I play with Japanese players, so I can't speak for the rest)The only thing that might let the game down is that voice acting is reserved for critical moments only, but more is being added quite regularly.I recommend all interested in RPGs, Social functions, and MMOs in general to give it a try, even people new to Final Fantasy will feel welcome. Be warned- You may just get sucked in for the long trip, but I certainly enjoyed the ride.			"

												Final Fantasy is a fun game. Like all mmos there is questing to end game and such. The difference here is; you can switch your class, which I like. If I tire of being a tank, I can do healer or DPS. You can learn all craft and gathering skills. There is a casino to pass the time. My biggest problem with this game is the limited housing. It's been out a while so real houses are gone, so they added apartments and after a month those filled up. It should be unlimited to give everyone a chance to get a house or apartment. I'll still recommend it, but damn... it was a close no for limited housing. Even an old game like LoTRO had housing for all.			"

												If you're looking for a new MMO made within the last few years, this is easily one of the best. Unlike most MMO's on the market, FF14 is actually story driven. While the writing isn't always the most amazing, and the voice acting can be hit or miss on some characters, the overall end product is quite well presented. And the story itself is overall quite good, and does a great job at making you feel heroic and important at appropriate times. There are innumerable non-main storyline quests available if you care to do them. Every class has their own unique story to follow. And some side quests that are hidden away for you to find are true gems. There are hundreds upon hundreds, if not thousands of hours, of content to do in quests alone, depending on your pace and weather you're the kind to read everything offered. (Which I suggest, particularly in regards to speaking with nearby characters during main story quests to get an abundance of bonus dialogue that can often be amusing, insightful, and interesting.) Many of the areas within the game are quite beautiful, making exploration quite enjoyable for new players, and older players who have long since seen everything will find many 'favorite spots' dotted about the game that they can always return to if they feel like it. Some scenes are truely a sight to behold when seen at just the right time.As for the gameplay, for anyone who has played Square's previous MMO, FF11, you might find the grind to be somewhat familiar. Or, some might find it to be conciderably easier. Your milage may very based on personal perspective and experience. In terms of leveling, it's far from as mindnumbing as many other games, as Square included several systems to lessen the time sink involved in leveling, in addition to offering items that can increase exp gain. Casual play could see you through to cap with your first class, mostly by following the main quest, within a few weeks provided you read and watch everything. Rushing hard and skipping everything you could cap within a week, maybe two depending on your free time. Combat, contrary to many shallow complaints by people who likely never saw a job past 30, is not extremely slow. A global CD of 2 seconds is not the end of the world, and becomes largely irrelevant rather quickly as classes accumulate off gdc abilities you can use between them. Without even reaching the original~ level cap, you will find most every class has something you should be doing at all times provided you aren't being deliberately lazy and coasting through combat on one or two buttons whie your party does the work. That's a player problem, not a game problem. While there is mountains more that could be said about any number of things, if anything should be mentioned, it's the flaws within the game. It's not perfect. The game's dungeons and raids can range in difficulty from childishly easy, to eye gougingly, aggrevating, difficult. Especially if you have poor party members. Square's idea to lock some content behind a pre-made party wall makes playing all the end game content difficult without a dedicated group to play with. And depending on what server you join, there may not be much, or any, end game playerbase, while others might consist of nothing but end gamers standing around waiting for queues. As amazing as the game looks, many areas are devoid of relavant content past certain levels. As a result, many places will appear entirely dead because there's no reason for anyone to return after a certain point outside of leveling or rare events like hunt mob spawns. Again, this is largely server dependant, but is~ a problem none-the-less. It causes players to concentrate in select few places over time and leaves the world feeling empty, even when a server is completely full. Playing with Free Company members, or joining newbies that you see and taking the opportunity to level something new can do wonders to avoid this problem. Or be a loner that doesn't care about other players being around. That also works, but is kinda boring to me. Perferences. Once you've spent an inordinant amount of time in the game, you might find that the selection of dungeons, while large, grows increasingly repetative after you've leveled multiple classes and have seen the same boss for the 200th time. It's annoying. While not a problem for new players, or even for most players within the first several months or more of playing. For long, long time players. It's aggrevating. The game needs more dungeons, especially of the lower end leveling kind. The biggest flaw in the game, and the quickest to grow tiresome, are the FATES. Randomly spawning overworld combat events. Square overuses FATES for literally everything they can shoehorn them into. Seasonal/special events? Go do FATES. Grinding end game relic gear? Go do FATES. Grinding levels? FATES. FATES get old, and they don't age well. In a few, rare instances they're done well. While it might occationally be lackluster now, with low player turnouts due to the new expansions and higher lvl cap making the fight easier, coupled with fewer people actually needing the rewards. Keep your eyes open for Odin in the black shroud if you do play. That~ is a fate that was done right, and is still exciting to stumble upon even to this day, where I have long since passed any need to participate in it. And if it's on a good day, you might experience something rather impressive to behold, as others in the past have when finding him for the first time. In summery, the game isn't perfect. It's got problems. At least a few more than are listed here. And some common complaints are often blown far out of proportion by people who haven't, or refused, to get invested in the game or give it a fair chance. But it's got an abundance of good points as well. A great story. Great presentation. Solid gameplay. Ongoing support which will someday amount to an even larger game than it already is. Possibly far larger (hopefully). A growing class/job list that provides plenty of variety, all at your fingertips on a single character, and much more. Of all the recent MMOs that I've played, and I've played more than a fair few. FF14 is head and shoulders above the rest, with a potentially strong future to boot. I'd easily give it 9/10. The flaws it has aren't enough to hold it back from being great, and only really~ impacted me after thousands~ of hours of playtime, and I'll keep playing whenever the opportunities arrise in the future.

												I'm going to review two aspects of this game: The game itself, and the community.The game itself is pretty great. Not many MMOs keep me hooked as long as this one has. The graphics are pretty nice, the job balance is done well, the storyline (though not my cup of tea) has more depth than most MMO storylines.My only real complaint (though it's a serious one) about the game is its end game. Once you've leveled everything to 60 (which can take a while), you're basically just going to run daily dungeons for currency to by some of the top tier gear. This currency caps at 450 per week though. Besides that, you can also run a raid and get a drop once per week for another piece of top gear.After you do both of these things, you may be out of reasons to login for the week. Which is obviously not good.There are complaints about the PvP in this game. It's very casual and does have its problems, but it's certainly entertaining in my opinion.Now we get to the second aspect of the game....the community:The community in this game has been a roller coaster of ups and downs in my experience. Unfortunately more downs than ups.Outside of the hardcore raiding scene, it's not uncommon at all in my experience to run into that one person (or sometimes multiple people) in a group that have to be carried. And I'm not talking about someone that hasn't quited learned their abilities yet but is obviously trying, I'm talking about someone who demonstrates a willful, obvious, almost proud ignorance. Many times these people simply ignore advice or actually get offended by it.I've also encountered trolls in dungeons more than once. Everything from someone using cross-class tank skills to intentionally provoke enemies off the tank to annoy them, to people abusing the kick feature in the game to wrongfully remove someone from the group. There are 4 people in a dungeon group, the person who is being voted on cannot vote. The other 3 can, however since the 4th person can't vote, it only takes 2 people to vote Yes (One actually technically since the vote initiator is automatically counted as a Yes) to successfully kick them. This enables all kind of bad behavior from people who queue with a friend. And basically if there's a disagreement, whoever starts the kick first wins.The server I play on (Balmung) has also had some interesting people. I was once kicked from an FC for talking about insects. The leader's girlfriend was triggered by insects, apparently she has a crippling fear of them (despite playing a game with plenty of large insects in it as enemies). I questioned her, the FC leader lost it and kicked me.TL;DR: The game is good, the community is not so good in my experience. I'll probably get a lot of hate for saying so, but it's simply my experience, the truth of it. Everywhere else I've said negative things about the community, I've been made out to be the devil, but seeing as this is where reviews go I want this place to be more than just an echo chamber.Since I can't give this a 5/10, I'll have to vote not recommended since the community of an MMO makes an MMO as much as the game itself does.

												It's a little pricey (12.99-14.99 a month), however, this game truly feels like Final Fantasy the MMO, and for that I feel that it's worth both the entry fee, and subscription. If you enjoy other square enix titles/previous final fantasies, DEFINITELY give this a shot, there's a 14 day free trial if you're absolutely unsure about this level of commitment, but from what I've seen so far, it's by far and large worth it in so many ways. This game makes a lot of interesting design decisions unseen in pretty much any other game, for starters, you only need 1 character per server you wish to play on to get the full experience, each character can at any point, while out of combat swap to another job/class. The cutscenes are pretty superb, the story is what you'd expect from a final fantasy game, the combat is fluid and feels good, typical trinity of dps/tank/healer, interestingly enough though you can cross over around 10 skills from any other class and add them to that classes line up, so every class is a dual class in a way, even allowing tank/dps to heal a bit.Soundtrack is amazing, open world exploration is great, game looks beautiful, the minigames are great (triple triad from FFVIII returns with plenty of rulesets!) all in all you definitely get your value for the money you pay. *Free trial just lifted their time based restrictions, the game is now FREE TO PLAY up to level 35 in all classes, after 300 hours of play I only have 3 of the 23 classes past 35, (and only 1 if you count the core classes) there's a lot of game to be had, for no cost if you're looking to try the game.

												This was my first MMO rpg and it was fun for a while. However at the cost of the subscription and time i have during the day makes it not worth the purchase. I mean the story of a realm reborn was not very exciting and very linear; plus this game wants you to think it has loads of content, but all it has are level grind after grind just to continue the game. Sadly, this game is nothing but a grindfest and a time suck. I ended up playing 206 hours within two months and reaching level 51. I never even scratched the surface of the 7th astral era or get to even try new dlc. I did experience what the end game had to offer mostly tho and it wasn't that appealing for all the work i  did. Just not much fun and grinding gets old. Don't get me started on the artifact quests... waste of my lifeeeee.			"

												Please note that you are better off buying this game from the vendor, the CD keys provided to me as I have a previous account will not work on the same account. Buying it on steam is only for people who have never even played this game and if you haven't played this game yet, theres a lot to play through and enjoy it. Still for people who have previously played this game. DO NOT BUY FROM STEAM. You will not get a refund or any assistance, they will tell you to talk to IT support at MogStation and MogStation will come around and say the exact same thing about Steam IT support. Just don't do it.			"

												As someone who is burnt out on tab-target combat and hotbars full of skills, I'd always written off FFXIV as more of the same and not worth bothering with. It's always scored highly by critics and players alike though, and is still one of the few MMO's able to command a subscription to play. So after a few steam sales I found myself in possession of the base game and the Heavensward expansion, and I thought I'd give it a try.I can see why people like it so much; whilst the core game is dated, it's polished and well-produced, with reasonable graphics that will age well. Voice acting ranges from good to bearable, and the story (whilst suffering from a lack of interaction on my part beyond nodding and killing things) was enjoyable. I tanked lots of normal-mode and hard-mode dungeons, but not the really high-end stuff, and found that even though I exclusively used group-finder, everybody I met was either relaxed and helpful, or just silent. As someone who is shy of instances with random people because of bad experiences on other games, this was pleasantly surprising to the say the least.Unfortunately as I closed in on the level cap of 60, my fatigue with the combat and hotbars bloated with skills caught up with me. FFXIV is a good game though, and if tab target combat with lots of abilities, dungeoneering and raiding are your thing, then you should check this out.			"

												Final Fantasy 14 is one of those very rare games that embodies wholly what you look for in the MMO genre. I started my experience back in the middle of 2015 and since then enjoyed, almost every step (aside Titan EX). FFXIV caters to the needs of many kinds of players those that heed the call of combat and those that want to craft and relax online. It has open ends on all parts of the scale making sure you have lots to do, without being pressured to do it.The key points for this game include:Playing everysingle class on one character, allows for diversity at times when you need it without taking away your efforts.Great socialisiation, it targets well how people can interract with each other online as their substitute self-Amazing customisation, by god is the customisation good, go a head make your character, you will never find someone that looks like you.Intricate story, though it has had a tendancy to get a little dry at time the primary campaign which takes you through the levels is incredibly enjoyable and the story itself is well written and crafted, though watch yourself if you really hate politics.The combat and leveling,.. the key point of most MMOs, FFXIV has it set to a T. Everything is balanced and created so 'Jobs' can fit in with one another. I my played Archer until I could reach the Bard Job. This primarily made me the support DPS in all dungeons. Whilst each healer and each tank has their own specific uses which each and every ability cater to. This isn't really something I can explain with words so I suggest looking up a few YouTube videos on the classes and Jobs.Lastly the dungeons or Duties as they are called. The main focus of this game as a whole is to prep yourself for Duties which are dungeon crawls, boss battle trials and Raids. All are extremely fun and hold the entirity of the main game within them outside of the storyline. Each dungeon is unique with bosses and units your team have to take down co-operatively, Trials toss you up against one of the big guys which have diverse fighting mechanics you need to learn and master as a team to take down and Raids, well, we all know what raids are...My final scores for FFXIV are as follows Score  Visuals and landscaping  8.5/10  Soundtrack  9/10  Gameplay  9/10  Controls  9.5/10  Dialogue, quests and story  7.5/10  Social aspects and self customisation  10/10  OVERALL  9/10  "

FINAL FANTASY® XIV: A Realm Reborn™I played a lot of mmos before Final fantasy and I have to say... Final fantasy is one of the greatest MMOs out right now alongside whit World Of Warcraft. Both of them are following the same 30 day subscription payment model. And thats beacuse they get a lot of attention from the developers and we get quality polished products.And to be short : [PROS]<-> Good graphics for an MMO<-> Flexible class and crafting system<-> Great music<-> Great storyline <-> Lots of features<-> And a a GREAT community ... The most helpfull and friendliest MMO community that I ever seen [Cons]<-> Montly subscription ( Altought its worth it )<-> You get addicted to it.Well... I don't really found any cons in this game.

												If you like MMOs play this, if you don't like MMOs then you haven't played this one long enough. ffxiv is getting bigger and better than any other mmo and if you want to invest in a game with a fruitful future ahead of it, then this is the one.I've yet to play an mmorpg with a storyline as good as this, the game is considered to have a storyline that competes amongst even their own well-known non mmo games. Combat is sharp, fluid, and the combos work well; especially when you're decently leveled and don't have peasant abilities. The class/crafting system is also outstanding, and adds tenfolds of gameplay that's worth investing in (if you're worried about leveling said crafting/fighting class, then you'll be relieved to hear that exp bonus' are awarded the greater the level between your current class vs your highest).Some interesting aspects about the world and storyline to consider:-The entire planet begins to recognise your character as you gain levels and further yourself, random NPCs will know who you are and its generally pretty cool to come across games that do that.-Story is of  high standard, there isn't much voice acting in the beginning, but once you start accessing the non-3-year-old content you'll realise SE has been putting even more effort into their story quests.-Not just the main story either, each class and job comes with their own unique storyline which also progresses your abilities, these get real intense, probably better than the main story in the short run.(ill be adding more to this review in time, as well as some minor issues)			"

												Wait, where did my life go? I could've sworn it was there a second ago...Almost 200 hours later and I still have so many things to do in this game. If you don't mind paying ~$15 a month, this game offers some of the most amazing MMORPG content I've seen. There's so many mechanics that work so well; the job system allows you to freely swap jobs on the fly without changing characters, the glamour system is cheap and very good at letting you look how you want, the game is very beginner friendly with its detailed information and moderate pacing...If you're a newcomer or MMO veteran alike, this game has a lot to offer. Just don't expect it to be a quick journey to level 60.By the way, if you're considering buying this, DO NOT GET ANY OF THE EXPANSIONS IMMEDIATELY. They don't give you anything until at least level 50. Try the game first - you get one month free trial when you buy it to see how you feel.			"

While I would overall recommend this game, it does have it's pros and cons.Pros: Great graphics and wonderful details.Great story.Fun glamour options.Plenty of casual content.Makes you work a bit for your levels (grindy but not overly).Cons:Content doesn't release fast enough (people taking leave from the game for two to three months before the next patch drops).Not enough end game content.Hard to level alone (can't really grind out levels by yourself, but who wants to play an MMO alone?).Depending on your serve the communities can be extremely toxic (choose your company carefully).

There's two pages of dungeons, 8 and 24 man raids, trial bosses, visually appealing, very helpful community, and most important it is not Pay to Win cash shop items are cosmetic. It has a captivatiing story, that follows the general cross game lore very well, as well as a very unique skill system allowing classes to use skills from other classes you may have.			"

												Tried this game at a friend's behest.  First impressions were nice.  The game is true to its Final Fantasy heritage, and provides the atmosphere you would expect from any FF title.  Graphics were great by MMO standards, but not really up to what you would expect from a current single player Square Enix game.  It sets up a nice story, tho the cutscenes all use in-game models and feel poorly acted/animated.  Overall the mood the game creates is a good one, and one I would enjoy playing in.That is, if the gameplay itself were at all enjoyable.As soon as I got into the combat, I immediately groaned.  It's WoW.  The game sticks to the most basic overdone combat system possible.  Target a thing.  Press your skill keys in rotation to damage it.  It starts autoattacking you.  You take damage from that.  You step outside the AoE markers to avoid taking any extra.  Eventually, one of you dies.  Repeat ad infinitum.  Dungeons follow the same formula too.  Tank soaks aggro because autoattacks are unavoidable, healer mitigates that incoming damage, everyone else kills the stuff that's focusing the tank.  Pull a wave, do that.  Pull another, do that.  Reach the boss, do that with a few extra distractions you need to run and deal with in between hitting it.I wanted to love this game, but sticking in the most samey, widely cloned MMO combat system just leaves it lumped right in the same group as 90% of other MMOs out there.  Why?  They're capable of being innovative.  They could have just as easily made it into a XII-style open-world exploration into menu-based RPG encounters smooth transition, with options to allow nearby players to join in on the players' side and assist.  They could have done a lot of things.  They did not.  Instead, they stuck to the most basic formula possible.Oh, and keep in mind it IS subscription based, tho they DO offer a discount if you limit yourself to 1 character (and since you can freely change between all the classes I see no reason for needing alts).So my final score:Atmosphere: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Sound: 7/10Gameplay: WoW/10Substitute in your own number for that based on how much you personally enjoy WoW-style combat.  For me it's a 1/10 on that, and since combat makes up a majority of the gameplay, whether hunting for levels, killing for quests, running a dungeon or raid, if you can't love the combat you can't love the game. I would maybe return to this for the sake of just hanging out with my friends if it were free to play, but I refuse to spend another penny on a game that cannot keep me entertained during the majority of its gameplay.If you enjoy WoW and all of its clones, I do highly recommend this game to you.  If you're like me and are bored to tears of the same system being duplicated over and over for over a decade, stay away.			"

												The attention to detail in regards to the artwork and music in this game is insane. The music is composed by Nobuo Uematsu as it should be expected by any true Final Fantasy fan. Kudos to SE. Yes, there is a subscription. This is unfortunate in 2017, but you get what you pay for. The servers and connections are buttery, and game is optimized well. I haven't had a hang up or server connection issue that wasn't on my end. I am running everything on highest settings and game does not even hiccup in the most populated areas. The native controller support is fantastic, it blows my mind I can manage to run several bars of hotkeys on my controller. Community is fantastic, and everyone I have run into has been friendly and helpful.As a Final Fantasy fan who has played nearly every game: the main story line is one of my favorites in the series. It is truly a shame it is shielded by a subscription pay wall. Raids are only 8 person parties, but this doesn't kill the size factor. Even with the smaller party size, they make WoW raids seem like childs play.I would rate 9/10, but only because I'm not a big MMO person and I find some of the leveling mechanics pedantic. I'm excited for the new expansion and content.			"

												I've played about 20 hours of this game before I got the Steam version so most of my criticisms will towards that version. On it's own Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn is a fantastic MMO with fun gameplay and a surprisingly good story. After the disaster that was the original FFXIV Online I'm happy to see it vastly improved with ARR, however with that being said you might wanna be careful if you're getting Steam version so let me explain why. One of the big problems I'm currently having is the amount of crashes when launching the game and I've tried numerous configurations and settings but I still get the same result. At the time I'm writing this review I have the game reinstalling so I'll update it once everything is set up again, sadly I can't stress enough how much this process infuriated me. (After reinstalling the game I figured out that I had to go into my control panel and turn off Link Settings, at the very least this fixed all the crashes)The other complaint I have is the activation process, this can be a bit of a chore if you have an active subscription. Unless your Square Enix Account is new the CD Key won't work and that forces you to make another account. Why Square has to make this harder if you already have an active account is beyond me but this really pisses me off and I urge anyone to just buy directly if you want to avoid all these issues. I'm giving this a cautious recommendation based on how good this game is, just don't buy this version if you're expecting the CD Key to work and instead get it directly.UPDATE: After reinstalling the game I figured out that I had to go into my control panel and turn off Link Settings, at the very least this fixed all the crashes			"

												This review is subjected to changes since it's an MMO which goes on a continous implementation of patches. As a veteran player I do not recommend this game. It's super bland grindy at the end game.TL;DR - End Game content (Very important in all MMO): Live letter which boasts and sugar coats about upcoming patch/expansion > patch/expansion gets released > Content worth only 1 week or more of actual fun > Game gets bland and just daily grind heavy even with the new patch > becomes pretty dead for over 2 1/2 month until next patch > cycle repeats..If your new or want to try a new mmo then try this game out. Graphics, story, leveling process and user interface is what will keep you captivated. It becomes only but a grind game at the end game content. Every cycle the director would say a very big update that is coming will improve the game.At the end...it ends up being the same grinding content with the same agenda to kill a monster or do a dungeon (where you kill a monster too), or other similar elements that is sugar coated in different animation/graphics. Example in game - Diadem.Many Veteran players have left this game and many have unsubscribed who resubscribes when a patch gets released which brings their hope up that the game got better but then unsubscribes disappointed. The majority of the players now that are recommending this game are players who have recently just started the game months ago and don't understand the cycle and brags how good this game is with having no experience on the entire game. Also some loyal fans.Pros and Cons of this game:Raid - If you are a hardcore player, you'll be disappointed from the fact that these raids lasts about a week and a half until hardcore players complete it. After completion, the next set of raids do not get released for another 2 1/2 month or even more. In other words their short. This applies to the 24 man raid as well. In heavensward expansion there has been twice where no raid content was released for 6 month each. Making it 12 month total now. They usually release 4 8-man raids every patch and 1 24-man raid every 2 patches. WoW on the otherhand has raids that lasts for months or a year because they release it in Huge contents and content itself is much harder then this game.Dungeons - This is joke. Lasts about a day or two and then it becomes a simple repitiion and grind. The problem with dungeons is that every new dungeon they release, which is about 2 dungeons each patch, makes the old dungeons obsolete which they seem to take out of blizzard text book. However, a good element of the dungeon is that they do bring a new style of fights usually which is displayed on the boss fights. It's another grind just letting you know.Crafting & Gathering - In no way, this element within any MMO is the Bread and Butter. It's useless and a game can be entirely enjoyable without it. This is just another form of grinding to make money within the game or make gears so players stay subscribed longer. The unique part though this game has a different style of system for crafting and gathering which makes it like you are actually fighting a monster with crafting skills. It requires some brain and once you get it down you can just make a macro, and sleep over night and let it do everything. That's all there is but let me say this element isn't the one to draw people to the game and people who say it is...haven't played other MMOs before and haven't tried all other content to it's fullest in any MMO.Character/Leveling - One of the Best in the game because one character can do everything like one character can become Mage, Lancer, Paladin, Warrior, etc. You can switch any time, and level each one individually. Every time you level a different class, you get a 50% more experience if you have another class that is higher then the current class your leveling.User Interface- ANOTHER BEST THING iN THIS GAME by far. You can literally customize it the way you want and save it in 4 different slots. Load up one slot if you changed to a healer example. Controller support - had controller support back in FFXI and it works out pretty well in here too.Netcode - it sucks. Play as a caster to get a visual experience of it when casting and moving. You can get a friend to see movement between both screen also to get the idea.Player Versus Player Classes - Classes in this game are very imbalanced. Warrior and Summoner being the strongest.Player Versus Player Arena - Called Feast(Score Match) and Wolves den(Death Match). First due note that the netcode sucks in this game so get ready to experience some server lag. Also, they haven't resolved to deal with the cheaters that boost points during a season. Every season lasts about 1 patch and some people at the top 100 are involved in cheating to boosting their points higher. The FFXIV team did nothing to deal with them. Instead left them alone which you can see in the forum. The Score match Arena modes are based on Guild Wars 2 style. Needs lots more polishing. There is no pure PVP death match because they made it obsolete with the release of Feast and advertising it. Also, every arena requires one healer, one tank, one range and one melee. So you can imagine how que time can be...It's worse in frontlines. Player Versus player Frontlines - Or Open field fights. They absolutley do not know what they're doing with this. It's legit terrible and they haven't fixed anything in this regards:1) 3 way team and if your in a Team that has a large population in the data center then expect a hour long que to just get in to a frontline match.2) All of the frontline is usually the same with heavy RNG involved except secure mode which was the first frontline to exist. 3) Every patch that contains a new frontline, they make the old one obsolete just like blizzard does. You'll never experience the old Frontline content because they don't care about the players.4) Finally Fourth - They do not listen to community feedback regarding to removing 3 way team both on Japanese and Global forums. Examine the forums, they have widely petition to remove it to improve que time but the FFXIV Team just ignores it. QUE TIME AND GRINDING ARE THE WORST thing in this game.Feedback system - cater to japanese/new player mainly and barely listen to any feedbacks except for those people. That's why we have grind content still.. Director doesn't know what he's doing since heavensward and doesn't learn.Cash Shop - It's becoming ridicolous now. They have a mount for 30 USD bucks. Cosmetics and other stuff as well. They are using it for milking cash from the loyal people.Events - These Events are lined up during the 2 1/2 month drought period to keep people subscribed. Like literally, it's the same grindfest. For example look at the current Yo-Kai Watch event. Heavy grind for 2 month.Marks - All your doing is farming for these at the end to get the latest gear. Before you know it next patch comes and the gear you have becomes useless...seriously happens to everyone.Bags and storage - Item storage is really the worst in this game to a point that you won't have no space and IN CASH SHOP YOU HAVE TO BUY A RETAINER WHICH YOU PAY ""3 Dollar per month"" to have more space..yeah more subscription money.Community - Excellent for new players. When it comes to discussing the dark side of the game, you'll see those topic silent. Listen to LimitBreakRadio and their community cuz they keep it real about the game.Fanfest event will either break or make it for me. However, be very cautious about the stuff they say and show because it's just another grind content. There are huge content droughts since pre-expansion and Director is only making content for new players.*Update seems like the players who started playing recently during Heavensward are downvoting this. They have no experience of endgame contentGrinding Fantasy XIV Ladies and Gentleman!			"

												Has Triple Triad. 10/10EDIT (3/5/17):I have decided that I have put enough time into the game to give a real review now.This initial part is just my personal story regarding this game, the TL:DR review info is below.To begin, I believe this game is very well put together. Following that, I also find the game incredibly boring. It follows the MMORPG trope of being an incredible end-game grind with no signs of relenting until you've wasted countless days of your life trying to get a single horse (or bird) to complete your irrelevant collection. Beyond the optional grinding, there are weekly locks on a dozen or more progression items, making sure that the player does not progress beyond their peers. This in a way, rewards players for being 'first' to do something. Though personally I find it incredibly frustrating to have to follow theses standards, and return every week, every day, to progress a fraction of a percent.So I find myself asking, ""why do I do it?""Why would I torture myself with such miniscule changes, so little reward for hours of work. My answer, it turns out, is incredibly silly.I first came to this world, with prior experience in the Final Fantasy Franchise, and this game was everything I had hoped it would be from a Final Fantasy MMO, post Playstation 2 era, I played every single day of my 30-day free trial, and when it ran out, I immediately bought more. I continued to play it every day. This trend has continued to this day, though I'm a bit busier now and I do occasionally have to skip days. I had so much fun exploring this new world, meeting new friends who I would still call friend to this day, mastering the mechanics of the game, and following the beautifully crafted story of this game, that even now, I yearn to feel that feeling again. I play, in the hope that I will feel that again, I miss being new to Eorzea, I miss meeting the new NPCs, I miss learning new skills. This was my first MMO that I truly have dived into, and I feel as if it will be the last one I will enjoy.For reference, other MMORPG titles I have played :WoW Cataclysm (Private Server)TeraThe DivisionTree of SaviorNeverwinterNow as for an actual review-Overall: 8/10FFXIV: A Realm Reborn successfully captures the feel of what a Final Fantasy world is supposed to be, combining the fantasy world of dragons and magic, with the future technology of the Allagan, but fails to hold through to the end. With lack of ingenuity in an already stagnant genre, the gameplay closes the curtains on an otherwise magical experience.Music: 9/10Nobuo Uematsu does it again ladies and gentlemen. Uematsu once again creates a captivating array of orchestrated pieces for every and any situation. From calm seas, to the strongest of storms he has written a piece for the occasion. This music becomes a driving force behind the story, and the major encounters, setting up these incredible landscapes of sound for the player. Gameplay : 5/10If you have played another MMORPG, you know exactly what you are getting into. With the exception of the armoury chest system, which allows you to play every class on a single character. If you are new to the genre, you may find yourself intrigued by the active battles, need for positional attacks and use of cast timers and group buffs. These are all things that will inevitably tire the average player, they stay the same the whole way through with slight changes to the animation and numbers they produce. The gameplay is basic to put it bluntly. That being said there are quirks to it, there are of course ways to min/max everything you do. So if you take pleasure in that, you might enjoy it more. Story  : 7/10 Final Fantasy games have always tried to create a story driven experience for the player, and A Realm Reborn is no different. This has by far the deepest, most thought out story from any MMORPG that I have played. The characters have unique traits, they laugh, they love, they cry. Throughout the game you will meet new heros, villians, and the occasional idiot. You may hate some, love others, or even completely ignore the story all together. That is why I think this story deserves praise, without getting into the actual content. This game is completely enjoyable with no knowledge of the story, and they even offer to show you the cutscenes at a later time if you wish to view them. This allows players to play at their own pace, if they are tired of watching hours of cutscenes after every quest line, they are free to skip it and come back later. Community  : 9/10I once played World of Warcraft with a few friends of mine, and as you do, I added them to my friends list in game. When I finished playing, at max level at the time they were still the only people on my friends list. I found the community of that game to be incredibly dry. Now this is my personal experience of course, but if anyone had something to say, it was more than likely something rude. Comparing this to FFXIV, I find myself constantly lost in conversation with people in one of the main hubs. People who I have never spoken to before stopping by and talking about local happenings in the real world, and in the game world. You could go to any populated region and ask a question or concern you had, and get a reasonable answer. Well, maybe after one or two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but they are usually in jest. The one point deduction on this score is due to the fact that people act different when it comes to dungeons and raids, that is where you will find the elitist crowd. These people are not examples of the whole community, but one small fraction of it, that has a hell of a loud voice.			"

												So I just tested this game for a bit and I have to say it is a very good game. Though I tested a lot of mmo's this is the only one beside World of Warcraft which kept me playing for longer than a month. It has some similarities to other mmo's but also some differences, which in my opinion make this a better mmo than other ones.Pro:- you only need 1 character- nice graphics- awesome community- tactical gameplay for raids (some are very tricky)- multiplatform- much pretty stuffs :3- LalafellCon:- much instancing of areas due to console supportSo i don't really have much negative to say. For people who come to this mmo from other mmo's might be a bit upset about a ""slacky and slow"" combat due to a long global cooldown. But for me after a while playing this it is not a problem. Due to many mechanics some bosses have it is very good to have a longer gcd to react to the mechanics and it also makes the fights much more tactical than in other mmo's. I think it is for everyone to decide if u like this kind of combat and gameplay. But for pretty reasons this game is awesome and also Lalafell.For people who don't want to instantly buy this, there is a free trial version you can test out. Just give it a try and decide for yourselves. Though it get's even better when you buy the full version and get to max level.I hope this may help some people to decide.I wish everyone a good night and enjoy your games.			"

												I came from SWTOR, looking for something that would capture my interest since I'm starting to lose interest in SWTOR. I gave this game a shot & have been enjoying it ever since. It has a decent story that picks up later on. Gathering/crafting can be frustrating sometimes but also rewarding. The class system is excellent imo. You just need to equip a different weapon to change class & once you save your equipment, you don't have to go looking for a particular weapon to change class. You just click on it from a list & you're good to go. There's plenty to enjoy about this game. I'm definitely glad I made this purchase. Also helps that I'm a Final Fantasy fan. :P			"

												Very entertaining game. I find myself coming back to this mmo after years of trying to find others. Was a big WoW players and after finding this game i keep coming back for the game play, beautiful graphics, and fun community. SE has good updates that keep players interested. While actually trying to grind for end game gear is rather long its well worth the grind. I would recommend this game for those MMOers out there that are looking to pass time with a pretty game to look at :D			"

												I have been playing MMOs since starting on Everquest and moving on to Guild Wars and World of Warcraft and unfortunately for several years there haven't been any games which have really been able to grab my attention in the way the earlier MMOs did.  Modern MMOs seem to have devolved into a quick single player race to maximum level where there is no incentive to even read a quest log, before jumping onto the gear grinding treadmill and ultimately running out of things to do shortly afterwards.FINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn has finally changed that, this is the first MMO I have played in recent years which has an interesting, well written story line and actually forces you to complete multi player content in order to progress from time to time.  The crafting system in this game is also incredibly well thought out and rewarding, it is not simply a case of gathering a few materials and pressing a button instead you have to think carefully about strategies to craft each item.  The other thing that also grabbed me about this game was just how beautiful the world is, from the scenery to the chaaracters the game looks stunning and the soundtrack is also top notch.The game isn't without its faults, one of the main issues at low level is the combat system has a very long GCD and until your character gets some extra skills which are off the GCD this can make combat seem very slow at first.  I think the developers should have introduced a few more 'off GCD' skills earler in the levelling process for some of the classes as this was my main gripe at low level.  That said it doesn't take too long before things start to improve and later on in the game once you have all your skills you can often find yourself wishing the GCD was a bit longer!One last point worth mentioning is that the community seems to be great, obviously I can't generalise for everyone playing the game but I have found most people are very friendly and helpful.  This goes as much for people outside of your Free Company (guild) as those in it.  I have bumped into more random strangers who have offered to lend a helping hand and explain things in this game than any other I can remember.  To sum it up this is a great game that you can really immerse yourself in.  It has plenty of depth and everthing before maximum level seems tangible and enjoyable rather than something to grind through.  This means you can enjoy the journey rather than worrying about the destination.			"

												One of the best MMORPGS since The days of vanilla WoW and Everquest II. One of the things that sets this game apart from current mmo's is the idea that your character is a person just like you. What I mean by that is that your character is not defined as a Mage or warrior, but rather someone who has learned how to be a Mage or warrior; in FFXIV, you can have one character that masters all classes and all professions.Professions (crafting classes) are very unique in that each crafting profession gets skills to help them in the world, for example, the fisherman profession around level 10 gets a sneak skill so they can traverse the world without being attacked. The fighting classes are separated into decouples of war, and decouples of magic; each with gear specified uniquely for it. The fighting classes include gladiator, pugalist, marauder, lancer, archer and rogue. The magic classes include the thaumaturge, the conjurer, and the arcanist. What is so incredibly awesome about FFXIV is how all of these classes can be combined with another to create a more powerful and unique class. For example, you can create a paladin by getting your character to level 30 with a gladiator, and getting to level 15 with the conjurer, to create a slight mix of the two. This game will forever be in my heart as the most immersive MMORPG and the mmo that has truly been worth a monthly payment. If I talked about everything in FFXIV, I'd be here all day typing, but in short, if you are questioning the value of this game, give the trial a try and you will quickly find out if you are a fan. Specs wise, the game runs beautifully, and for a game made quite a while ago, it graphically has withstood the test of time. I would recommend this game to any gamer who is searching for a great community, a great immersive experience, and a great breathe of fresh mmo air.			"

												There's not really much new I can say about this game from the other reviews my friends have done (which are spot on by the way), but for about 10 months before even starting to play FFXIV I've had one or two people begging me to give it a go, for those 10 months I never did but ♥♥♥♥ing hell I regret not trying it sooner.People have been calling this game the best MMO to ever exist and I can see why! You never run out of stuff to do and there are countless ways to level up your classes and jobs, the very best part of the game to me is the story, the main story quests aren't filled with fetch this and slay this filler ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the story itself is genuinely interesting. Each and every dungeon has it's own mechanics which are both fun and mostly easy to get the hang of and the combat itself requires quite a bit of strategy especially in team-based instances. The one real ""problem"" I had with this game is starting out, trying to learn everything while taking your first steps into the massive world handed out to you can be really intimidating but learning the basics and getting a hold of what you're doing is well worth the hassle.This may not be the most well-written review ever made, but hopefully some people give this game a chance!

												FF14 is a great game and I suggest buying it, I already have 1000s of hours on it (non-Steam version). Although a word of warning if you already own the non-Steam version do not buy the Steam version. Your character is not-interchangable and you can't use the Steam keys on your Square Enix account. You will have to start a new Service Account and you will not retain your old characters. I bought it on Steam during the sale in hopes of getting the expansion for cheaper but it doesn't work that way for previous owners. However, if you are just now deciding to pick the game up this is a great offer and I recommend buying it here and saving the money.Nice class selection, awesome soundtrack, amazing dungeons and raids, brillant story, great social system, able to swap classes freely (no alts needed!). Overall it is one of the best MMORPGs out there, have fun. :)			"

												UPDATES FOR 3.21*Perspective of a WoW loyalist since vanilla*""Probably the best quality MMO since Wrath of the Lich King WoW.""BOTTOM LINE: If youre a PVPer, ignore the reviews prior to 3.2, PVP is slowly gaining popularity and the new modes have a ton to offer. You will be almost overwhelmed with things to do in this game. Theres a lot to offer for everyone.Pros:---Beautiful design for all of the zones, cities, and dungeons.---Awesome sound track I actually enjoy hearing each unique dungeon theme (most of wow was played sound off)---Balanced (for the most part) PVP. This game did what WoW should have done since vanilla. Theres a separate level up     system for pvp that gives you specific skills used solely for that mode. It fixes the whole PVE vs PVP balance conundrum most MMOs face---THE FEAST: This is probably what saved it for me long term. Just release this past week was The Feast which is a competitive PVP mode with rankings. Matches here gave me more of a thrill here than playing in the 2.4k arena bracket in WoW---The ability to play whatever class you want on a single character. This function also allows you to bring in skills from other classes to further customize your playstyle---High quality and difficult end game content (unlike WoW, which has people farming the content within a week of release)---Great communityCons:---People love the story but for me.... meh a lot of it was blah blah chosen one and tons of pointless fetch quests (like really homie i just saved the kingdom now i have to fetch water for 3 privates?)---UPDATED: PVP was originally dead however theres been a resurgence with a competetive pvp arena mode added with seasons (as said above).---Lack of Battleground diversity (However this is slowly and allegedly being addressed by producers)---This game forces you to choke down 15-20 hours worth of dead level 50 content in order to even unlock the expansion pack "

												After experiencing all there is to offer, I can't honestly recommend this to someone looking for a faithful paid MMO in its current state. Sure, it's pretty fun for a while, but it gets too demanding and monotonous to enjoy playing in the long run, unless that's what you're into. Heavensward, the $40 expansion, is a well played joke. Multiplying the exp requirement for leveling and making you hike across massive maps* makes up more of this expansion's playtime than actual content. Significant updates are few and far between.*Flying isn't unlocked for the area until you've activated every Aether Current across the map and awarded via quests, and by that time you're moving on to the next area anyway, where the process repeats.TL;DR : A fantastic aesthetic, amazing soundtrack, accessible combat system and engaging story masks a life draining waiting simulator plagued with bad dev choices and Chinese RMT bots.I'd like to hear from those who still stand by this game, as I can't fathom why.

												Do you like Final Fantasy 14?Their early work was a little too unfinished for my tastes, but when Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn came out in 2013, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole game has a clear, crisp gameplay, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the game a big boost. It's been compared to Guild Wars 2, but I think FF14 has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.In 2015, SquareEnix released this, Heavensward, their most recent expansion. I think their undisputed masterpiece is the fight against Ultima Weapon, a boss fight so enjoyable, most people probably don't dodge all of his abilities. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the developers themself.Hey Paul!			"

												TL:DR Honestly if you need a MMO and don't mind a sub fee, check this one out. IMO it's worth itThe only other MMO I've played seriously was GW2 and with over a thousand hours in that game, I had to let it go. I couldn't find the energy to play anymore and so I went looking for another MMO. I had played a little of FFXIV right before the expac released but the daunting task of completing the story drove me back to GW2. Once again got sick of GW2 and resubbed to FFXIV. I've sunk so much time in this game, this past week alone, that I don't know why I dropped the game a year ago. The story is good and lvling is fast if you follow the story missions and do the fates in between. Lvling the other classes after the first is super easy because you get extra exp because of your higher lvl class. The dungeons are fun and engaging. The comunity so far, has been nice for helping me through some of the rougher content. All in all I think it's worth your time to check out "

												*Editng the Review after investing more Hours into the Game*Final Fantasy 14 is a game I discovered back in the days of looking for another MMO to get into while loathing a lot of things that came with WoD, WoW's expansion back in 2015. I saw a trailer for this game and felt it looked like a solid game to try. Keep in mind that at the time when I discovered this game, I was not a fan of Final Fantasy franchise simply because I didn't play a lot of FInal Fantasy games before that. As someone who is fresh to the Final Fantasy universe, I can easily say that Final Fanatsy XIV: A Realm Reborn made me into a Final Fantasy Fan!I loved everything from races to classes and jobs, crafting, gathering, and the ability to be every class as one character! Best feature ever in an MMO! The story is so good, I got invested into it instantly and felt myself feel for chraracters and events that happen in the game. I love my character's presence in the story. The music, althrough something that I am new to, gets me right into the mood of things! I feel badass when fighting bosses, I feel adventurous when riding my chocobo to new areas, and the music does well to emphasize emotions and actions in story quests. The Heavensward Expansion just goes to expand and complement what ARR did and I love everything about it so far! One of my favirote expansions EVER from any MMO out there!I made a little video for the game here, feel free to check it out and leave feedback:

												If you're a fan of MMORPGs, Final Fantasy XIV is the perfect game for you. Though it is a subscription based game, as of this review, it has surpassed many Free-to-Play MMORPGs out in the sea of games already with a blend of certain ingredients. Starting off by making your character, you have multiple choices of races you can become. From a regular human, a midget, cat people, elves and even huge peoples. There are many options to personalize your character if you choose to do so, such as eyes(heterochromia), tattoos, and even hair highlights(which was a first to me), You might be wondering if this is when you choose your class now, and you're right. To my amazement, your one character can master ALL the classes within the game. All you need to do is simply reach a certian level and you can accept to join all the class guilds. After that all you do is switch weapons and become that class.(Amazing right?) After you perfect your character, you are immediately thrown into the beautiful world we know as Eorzea.Putting the amazing transition SE has went with the end of FFXI to FFXIV aside, the story of your character begins in a slow pace. Most people will be put off by this slow beginning, but the story does start to get interesting to the point you want to learn more about it. Anymore information and it might end up in spoilers, so you decide whether to pay attention to the story or blitz through quests exclusively for experience towards your character.The last thing I'd like to mention is about the dungeon system. You have finders which will automatically find you dungeons/parties, this can be a good or bad thing. So far from my experience, the community is nice to new players and will help you out and then we have some that are not so......nice. Either way, you can decide to use this or play with your friends within a party up to 8 people. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock more harder and interesting dungeons in which your team of friends can have fun  participating in. You might be wondering if there is anything rewarding from doing these. Besides receiving entertainment, drops such as weapons or armor might be a eye candy for your character. Another big thing would be the music. The music in this game is superb.TL:DR - Buy or at least try the game(free trial is up to 2 weeks). You will most likely enjoy the game and music and join the community, if not....at least you tried it....			"

												Don't download or buy Final Fantasy from Steam. Buy it from their website.1. Steam doesn't keep Final Fantasy's version up-to-date, so if you go to verify integrity of game cache, it'll always give you the error 'Failed to vailidate 44 files, will be reacquired' or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t along those lines.2. If you try to play it with the outdated 2.15 version that Steam fails to keep up-to-date, it will still prompt you to RE-DOWNLOAD it, even though this is what.. My fourth day now? Don't buy this game over Steam. Steam doesn't deserve Final Fantasy's money for a game Steam refuses to keep up-to-date.tl;dr, Don't get this game from Steam, they're lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that don't keep ♥♥♥♥ up-to-date, get it from FFXIV's website.

												I won't lie, I was skeptic. Heavily skeptic. Like, I thought this was worse than Dead Island skeptic.Square-Enix's track record has been far from amazing in terms of Final Fantasy titles as of late. Final Fantasy XIII almost cemented my lack of trust in them, and watching the disaster that was XIV 1.0, I just stopped keeping track altogether. They'd lost their magic much harder than I could imagine.This game is lucky I knew someone else who was into A Realm Reborn. At first, I had to laugh at the fact he was still paying for a lousy, broken, boring MMO, but then I started watching. I hadn't realised XIV had ended it's world and restarted again, and I was confused when I found the game to be a lot more interesting than I remember. It shut me the hell up.I decided to dive into this head first, give it a shot, see if it would be something I could get into. After all, I knew people playing it already, it would be a party based activity, something I haven't done in a while.But as you can tell by the amount of hours currently sunk into it, I didn't really need to know anyone prior.This game sunk it's teeth in. Hard.I'm not someone that comes from a massive MMO background. The last one I had played and gotten into was almost 10 years ago. It would be difficult to know if I could recommend this game over other MMOs, or even other games. Although you would probably do this anyway, I recommend looking at gameplay footage and deciding for yourself. I can personally say I've had more fun with this than I was expecting, and keep coming back.Community is pretty good (on Cerberus anyway, and from what I've found from watching other players). Yes, there are a few bad eggs, but considering the MMO and other online games I've come from, this isn't a problem. Every community will have the ragequitters, the griefers and the thieves, but they are so scarce. PvP is probably the main place you'll find these people, if at all.There are a handful of nitpicks, most of them are rather minor, such as the voice acting at points sucking the emotion out of a moment, usually in a single word (this seems to be a SE staple(seriously stop hiring the worst actors to play big roles)) and the HUD does not scale with windowed mode, so it's very easy, if you're running a smaller window, for your screen to get cramped with icons, even if you do shrink them down. But they are nitpicks, nothing that stops the game for me at all.All I can say is, there is a large chunk of time that I have sunk into it and I do not regret it*.*okay I regret it a little. I could've been saving the world or learning to speedrun a game or something else with the time I've spent on this.			"

												I just got it because i was pretty bored and because I always liked Final Fantasy, especially Part 9.So I used (Or actually still use) the free Month that comes with it.The Graphics are awesome in this one (I got a lot of Screenshots already on my Profile) and i was lucky to find an awesome Guild, which makes the Game way more entertaining.The IMO best Feature is the Class System. I love it! No more handling 6 different Characters.As with every MMO though, playing alone is no fun. I luckily got a mate to also buy it when it was cheaper on steam and now we're both playing together and it's so much I can't really describe it.So if you want a MMO that has awesome Graphics, really good gameplay and awesome Story - get this one, even if you're not a Final Fantasy fan.

												So I am four days into this game and thought I would go with a `first impressions` type review.Pros: Amazing graphics and art styleBrilliant sound trackIncredibly useful help system that guides you through every new game system you encounterFATE's (read random world encounters with various objectives and multiple players)Crafting system is a breezeBe any class you want quickly and easilyFriendly communityTons and TONs of sidequestsChocobos !Cons:Honestly I cant think of any. I have spent all my play time with a smile plastered to my face.I cannot for the life of me think of any other game that has such a wealth of useful active  hints other than maybe SW:TOR. There is even a series of mini tests that teach you how to participate in Dungeons at level 15 that rewards you with a really nice set of gear and a ring that boosts your XP by 30% until you hit level 30.I shall update this once I have got my Blackmage and taken part in a few raids. SO far so good though and I would highly recommend it.

Updated:Ok so I have decided to actually go for the Bard advanced Class (Job) as I really like the way the Archer class plays. I figured a mix of ranged DPS and Support seemed a fairly safe class to play while I get the hang of the game mechanics.The amount of side activities in this game is amazing and I keep finding more and more things to do. Having discoverd the Golden Saucer I have been spending wayyy to much time doing the chocobo racing and playing Triple Triad. Every area I visit is incredibly good looking and I am going somewhat mad taking screenshots at every opportunity. I have played alot of MMOs over the years but I have to say this is hands down the best I have played for the incredible amount of Depth it posesses.What are you waiting for ? Just get it already. If you happen to join the Cerberus Server hit me up in game if you like : My Character is called Huarya Gonacall :)http://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/14516293/ "

												CuteFish Review: Longish review, pro/con list, closing thoughts. Just skip ahead if you don't like reading! :3   FFXIV: A Realm Reborn is a game that aimed to polish and refine the 'WoW-era' MMO instead of hamfisting in a slightly different spin of the genre. A story based leveling system (at first) that leads into a content rich MMO that has appeal to, quite literraly, any form of player who likes the genre. Very challenging group-based endgame PvE, good PvP, and an abundance of 'things to do' that makes for a very gratifying time sink.    Aesthetically, the game has a clean look similar to the other current-gen Final Fantasy games. It runs rather well on my machine and pretty decently on lower end machines, but it's definitely an art style that loses quite a lot of its charm when you start setting graphical settings to 'low'.   The combat system is the standard tab-targetting most of us are likely accustumed to but actually at a slower pace. The game has a 2.5 second global cooldown between abilities. Early on, this feels incredibly slow (because it is) but later on it feels much more meticulous since each ability use is quite a time commitment. I feel much more weight to use the 'right' ability than any other MMO I've ever played, and a big part of using the 'right' ability lies in understanding the fight. This makes the game far less 'go through your rotation based' and just thought-provoking enough to make you forget you're even waiting 2.5 seconds between spells and it's wonderful.   The game has a unique system in which 100% of the content the game contains can be completed on one single character. Every class, job, craft, quest, etc can be completed on one character to the point where there is genuinelly no practical reason to ever make a second. This makes for a unique attachment to that one special character who will likely be with you from beginning to end. All classes (including crafts) can be changed at a whim (outside of dungeons and PvP) by simply changing your weapon. You're given a bonus 25 slots per gear slot to hold every single piece and an easy 'gear set' system to quickly swap between entire sets of gear for your variety of classes.  FFXIV has a pretty decent story with likeable characters and hit-or-miss voice acting. The only major complaint is how you're supposed to be the 'hero of light'... along with all the other thousands of players on your server. Even looking past that, it delivers a classical Final Fantasy adventure that hits all the right notes possible in the MMO setting.   Leveling is rather easy and straightforward; but at the same time allows for an impressive amount of freedom in how you want to go about it at all. Your first class/job will primarily follow the main story line supplemented by FATEs (randomly spawned group content in the world) and dungeon queues to level at a solid pace. The pacing was excellent and was a rather mild curve in the time between levels as you progress. Part of what makes leveling great is that after progressing a little bit into the game you gain access to 'Duty Roulette', which allows you to queue for a random dungeon and upon completetion, receive a tremendous surge in xp on top of the already solid dungeon xp. This allows people on time restraints to level at a very reasonable pace as all you really need is about 35 minutes. After having one max level class, all future classes gain +100% xp to almos everything, partly because they dont get the main story and partly to speed you along.  This is an MMO with a definite PvE focus, as the dungeons are execellently crafted progression of difficulty from the start to the end. A complaint does lie in the first set of dungeons aquired very early on as they were very devoid of mechanics and give a bad impression of future content. Lategame PvE offers a multitude of challenge tiers to accomadate what you as a player are looking to do. Duty Finder raids, unlike other MMO counterparts, don't offer an easy mode, and its nice to see the game respect the playerbase by demanding a minimum skill requirement to start getting your hands on decent gear pieces.   A special mention should go out to this games crafting system. While earlier I mentioned this game has a strong sense of polish to the genre, this area was given a revamp compared to virtually every other MMO with a focus of creating depth, choices, strategy, and a purpose. The crafts are actually classes with their own gear avaiable to them to boast the crafting potentional. Every craft class has their unique spells used during the hard-to-describe act of actually crafting, which plays almost like a classical turn based game balancing many factors such as the progress towards actually finishing the item vs the actual quality of it, among other factors. Craft classes also have certain abilities that benefit other crafts, encouraging you to do them all even if you only really want to use one. Honestly if you've ever wanted to go hard on some crafts, this is DEFINITELY the game to do it.   On a final note, this game has the best soundtrack and the most cinematic, epic bosses in any MMO I've played. I genuinelly don't want to really spoil any of by showing you, but it's pretty freaking great.Pros+ Single-character system builds strong bond with your player character.+ Content that will appeal to any audience that already likes the MMO genre, and many newcomers (are there still any?)+ Combat that requires some actual mental usage regarding what abilities you're using.+ Best MMO on a console (but you're reading this on steam...)+ Great story that blends into the game almost seamlessely.+ Heavily teamwork-based group PvE content.+ The content updates are HUGE. The latest one (3.2) required a hefty time investment just to read through all the patch notes.+ Heavy timesink game based around progressing the overall state of your character rather than locking you behind time/grindgates. Always something to do~+ Most fun I've had crafting in an MMO to date.+ Amazing soundtrack that makes bosses feel larger than life. Many bosses have multiple songs, with one even having 5 whole songs. FIVE SONGS!+ System in place to help new players learn the game, from decent tutorials to a whole network of matching new players with highly experienced ones for guidance.+ Amazing community from my personal experience.Cons- There's a large divide between emptier and fuller servers. Definitely do your research before commiting to a server.- Early game dungeons are pretty awful.- Endgame gear/stat choices for each job is very linear. This is lessened since you can play all 13 classes on 1 character.- The gathering classes are really runescape-y in their grind... but I mean theres not much you can do with collecting rocks.- Some of the voice acting in English sucks. Some of it is pretty great. But mostly mediocre.- When you reach level 50 theres a 100 quest slog to get through before you can start the Heavensward (50->60 content.) It's pretty rough, not gonna lie. At least you only have to do it on one character!Closing thoughts: This game is epitome of taking the fundamentals of a game type and making them perfect. If you're feeling a little burned out by games like WoW or any of its plentiful clones, it may be time to give FFXIV a whirl. If you're just looking for a really comfy game to play and always have stuff to do when you log on, this game is great for that. If you want that classic hardcore PvE content found in the earlier days of WoW, this game delivers on that front too!Overall rating: 9/10			"

												I haven't reviewed this game yet? Must have been too busy having fun :)431 hours already... Yeah, definitelly having fun. The game is great. Polished like a diamond, and with enough content to build a great wall of China. It's stable, bug free, servers are solid, everything you would expect from a AAA title.THe game is great, and it puts back the RPG into MMORPGs again. Do not go into the game if you want to skip all text and story, and just do quests and advance. Go to WoW if you want to do that. The story in this game is a big integral part of it, and it IS done really well anyways. So try it out, it has a 15 day free trial, but if you get in it. do take your time, and play it like an RPG. Enjoy the story, the world, and the game will certainly give back :)			"

												Coming from someone who hasn't played much MMO's, I recommend this game to anyone who is into the world of FF games. Make sure to take your time and experience everything this game has to offer. I know, you don't want to waste your subscription time but really, best approach is to play it slow. Look around, dance with a NPC, talk to a role-player, anything to keep yourself amused. READ! it's a FF game so try to soak up as much lore as you can. The more you know the more it adds to the world and your experience. I also recommend changing the audio to japanese, the voices are just WAY more intense and the english audio is just a little corny. Def worth a try for FF fans looking for a MMO to play "

												Players fresh to Final Fantasy XIV will be thrust into a gorgeous world and told to take part in run of the mill questing. So far, so generic, until you start unravelling the obscenely ridiculous amount of 'extra stuff to do' and take note of just how stupidly well optimized the engine is, and how great the game sounds along your travels.My only complaint as a new player was the levelling process, which usually emphasises a brain-dead 2-3 button combo that you'll spam for practically 20-40 levels... However, this may vary depending on your chosen starter class. Those who stomach the levelling process are in for a treat when they unlock cross-class abilities or even level other classes and professions from scratch (with no character swapping), meaning that the slowness disipates the more you work for all classes/roles. Professions can give your lowbie class an edge, as can said cross abilities, so levelling (again) is nothing like how it was starting from scratch. In short, it's horrible as a level 1 newcomer, but very rewarding for those who can put in the work.Combat leading to end-game is pleasant but basic... And then you enter Hard-Mode dungeons and realize just how much a tab-target MMO can actually feel like an action-combat MMO when your world starts filling up with danger zone galore. In short, if you try the game and find yourself bored by the early game -- don't worry, it does pick up, almost drastically so, usually starting after level 40.What else does it do better than other MMORPGs?Minigames to enjoy at your leisure, professions that actually feel like professions, inherent achievements that reward you for your efforts, hunting logs to encourage some light exploration, content that doesn't just get recycled (eg. a normal dungeon is not even remotely like their 'hard' counterparts - not even close), story and cut-scenes that actually make you feel that your character is part of the damn story (how many MMORPGs have you played where you play as some mute-grunt shambling around? Here in FFXIV, you're the star of the show and they'll remind you of this over and over). Dungeons & Raids (level 50 onward especially) get really fun/frantic and almost no two bosses are the same in any way whatsoever. There's all manner of little touches you'd just need to see for yourself.If you want a game that is TEEMING with things to do, spliced with lovely graphics and sound, on a smooth engine that could probably squeeze 60 FPS out of a brick, later complimented by fun combat and bosses with you as the hero -- give it a try.However, don't wait too long... You have a long road ahead of you.			"

												*No spoilers*The Good:-Great gameplay with very few flaws (I'll put those in the bad cat.)-Story that is immersive-Visually amazing.-Job/Class system that is perfect for the Altaholic-Long and hard Dungeon crawlsThe Average:-Like in most FF games, the voice acting and chat functions are pretty meh. -Very complicated for a first time player to MMO's (I've been playing MMO's for about 15 years and there were things that even I was confused about)The Bad:-The UI is cluttered all to hell. There are literally 3 locations to see target health bars and you can disable all of them, but the UI is just horrendously big for a game this visually stunning. -Dungeon mechanics normally consist of ""Tank N' Spank"", or ""Don't stand in this shiny circle""-GOLD SPAMMERS, Holy hell When I first logged on and completed the first cutscene I had 12 tells from spammers. You can disable tells but that dramatically impacts gameplay when someone is trying to talk to you in private.-Amount of time to level: I'm 48 hours in to the game and I'm level 37, they do give you a benefit to other classes and jobs, but the original job takes forever.Overall I'd give it an 8/10 with this caveat: If you aren't willing to invest the time or effort in a game that will eat up days of your life while you pay them 15 bucks a month stay away. But if you are an experienced MMO type that revels in the dungeon crawl, raid grind for gear, and alt spamming, it's way worth it. I've played WoW, Elder Scrolls, Eve, and this, and I'm only sticking with this right now. Great game.			"

												The first MMO I played and really got into was WoW. I quit playing it for good about half a year before Pandaria's release. Since then, I drifted from MMO to MMO, never finding one that really captivated me... until I decided to give the rerelease of FFXIV a spin (after absolutely hating the 1.x version of it): FFXIV A Realm Reborn. And oh boy, it is a huge improvement over FF14 1.0 and an absolute delight to play, even for someone with zero Final Fantasy experience like me. After roughly 1300 (3200 at time of me editing this review) hours of gametime since the rerelease, I can honestly say that this game is absolutely amazing and well worth the money!Edit: Roughly 2000 hours after initially writing this review, I can still say I am completely in love with this game. An absolute must buy! If you're not convinced, there's a trial you can find of FFXIV here on Steam which gives you a little taste of how the game is... sadly enough, it gives you a taste of the early game. The weakest part of FFXIV. The endgame is where it shines, but you'll have to put in more time for that! Again, I can't recommend this game enough!Edit: Another edit, it's now been over 4000 hours and the first expansion (Heavensward) has released, and it is a great addition to an already great game. I really can not urge you enough to at least give the trial a go -despite low level being the weakest part of the game, as I mentioned in my previous edit-.-Ciaran Dango & Sena Tempus, Moogle			"

												I have played Final Fantasy for a Very Long Time. Final Fantasy is not so much a videogame as a feel of a videogame, a specific set of familiarities and tones that amass into a notion of strange particularity. It’s hard to separate the act of playing Final Fantasy from our perception of what a game like Final Fantasy is: its look, its feel, the sound of a familiar melody at the title screen that tells you yes, this is Final Fantasy, and everything is going to be okay. Final Fantasy is not a game, but a smell, a memory, a compulsion. I have been playing Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn a lot, to my own surprise. This new rendition of a previous disaster which I have not personally experienced is seamlessly, indulgently playable. It is a game of unrelenting maximalism— every single Final Fantasy mainstay is hurled at you indiscriminately with reckless abandon— while at the same time being totally relaxing. It’s like plummeting into the ocean only to realize that it is the exact same temperature as your body. Unlike something like Call of Duty, which is equally big and playable but requires muscles tensed and brain on edge, FF14 washes over you in a warm crystalline blue glow of fantasy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.I played FF14 while catching up with a friend on Skype. I planned a ♥♥♥♥ing camping trip while playing it. Final Fantasy just occurs, if you let it. Do you know what else does this? Evil.You can play Final Fantasy forever, if you want to.			"

												I love this game.  I think it's one of the best video games I've ever played.  It's weird, though, because it's not a game that comes without a load of the problems typical of MMOs.  (This is totally my opinion here, so if you're a reader who loves everything about MMORPGs and you disagree, that's totally fine.)  For long stretches of the leveling game, combat can be extremely dull depending on a variety of things: what job you've chosen, whether or not you have any companions (e.g. solo questing as a gladiator/paladin is going to be feel pretty slow when it takes you a moment or two to kill anything), and you're going to be sitting in queue after queue waiting for your turn in the dungeons.  Combat for some jobs is not very interesting until you're level 50 or 60 and you have access to dungeons and raids that will test your skills (often with boss mechanics that seem weird or even overwhelming at first, but are satisfying to pull off as a group overcoming a unique challenge), and that's an investment I'd want anyone to be aware of when getting into something like this.  You'll spend a lot of time pressing a few keys in sequence while you whittle down the HP of this or that monster.Thankfully, most of the queues are pretty short and there are tools for getting people together for something even if the Duty Finder isn't pulling together a party for you.  And there's plenty to do while you wait: keep on questing, do some gathering or crafting, play Triple Triad.  Very importantly, for me, it's a world that feels good to hang out in.  The first and larger paragraph up there probably seems overly negative for a game I'd recommend to others, but here's so much that I enjoy about Final Fantasy present here — my bard's equipment is glamoured to look like early FF character designs by Yoshitaka Amano, and there's tons of armor (and other designs) in the game that support this style and atmosphere.  It is a legit as heck hangout/comfy game.  The challenging (hardcore raiding) stuff is there if you want it.Just some thoughts here; not really a full review or an attempt to convince anyone to play.  It's my jam, tho.  I may come and go, and frankly I'm extremely relieved that it's a game I only want to play for a few months at a time between extended breaks, but when I'm into it... well, I'm pretty into it.			"

												TL;DR Play it if you like MMOs or come from WoW. Very fun game, and is the second most popular ATM but it should be most.This is the most fun I've ever had in an MMO. It is pretty similar to WoW, but some slight changes like the GCD is 2.5 seconds by default instead of 1.5 or so in WoW.There is so much to do in this game, the End game is MUCH more fun than WoW and much more rewarding. It is a themepark MMO so don't expect to not have to do Story to unlock much of the stuff in the game. It is the best way to level your first class and unlock new things. It's also very interesting so DON'T SKIP IT! Another thing that makes it much better, is you only need one character (I believe there is a very good reason to have 2 characters if you get heavily into crafting, but I haven't so idk), but you can play every single class in the game on that character. This makes the game much more fun to play and not having to do the same quests over and over again to level your class. I would recommend this game to Anyone who comes from WoW, or is just interested in a new MMO in general. So much fun.			"

												This game is not for everyone (even though it probably should be). Short summary opinion is at the end for those that want to skip reading a longer opinion.The quests in this game are much more diverse than in many other MMO games. They range from investigation style quests, to NPC interaction quests, to your cookie cutter fetch and kill quests and more. Some require you to run dungeons and other require you to take part in mini raid style battles on the world map (you dont need a party to participate in these).It needs to be understood that this game is extremely heavy on storyline content to the point that some may feel like they are reading an interactive book rather than playing an MMO. This means quite a bit of single player questing and even single player instanced battles as part of many questlines. For some this may be a source of irritation but for people that are familiar with the Final Fantasy brand, this is an amazing chance to become engrossed in the realm of Eorzea.If you are planning on playing this MMORPG just to skip every dialogue and run to every quest mark, you will probably start feeling either annoyed or confused at what is going on with the quests and frustration may result from that. This is because the main story quests play a large part in character progression in terms of unlocking areas but they are also very detail oriented in terms of conveying a personal story to the player rather than simply grinding out exp to level up.The storylines, both main and side, reflect some of the best writing to come out of a Final Fantasy game in a very long time and you can very easily forget you are even playing an MMO at times. There is a rather large drawback however, depending on your point of view...  This game demands that it's players EARN practically everything. You are NOT given a mount for free when you hit a certain level, you have to meet certain conditions to earn the right to ride a mount or stick with cheap taxi mounts until you do. You are NOT given access to your full ability tree as you level up and instead must take part in quests / storyline unique to your class in order to earn additional abilities and even a job class unique to your base class.You are NOT given access to dungeons in the game until you either follow the main story quests to the point they are unlocked for story reasons or until you find the side quests that unlock them for story reasons.The list goes on but you probably get the idea... things in this game are earned through hardwork, not through mindless grinding or by getting carried on the coattails of a high level friend that can just shower nice items on you (but that second one would still probably help alot if you are that lucky).The game is great, The story is amazing (both powerfully dramatic and enjoyable comical at times) and the gameplay mechanics are enough to challenge even seasoned MMO vets in the level 50+ dungeons and trial fights.

												240 hours.240 hours I have spent of what I think is the best mmo made thus far. This game is amazing for many more reasons than I am allowed to type down in this review. So instead, let me just give you my top 5 reasons as to why I think this game is amazing.5. fluint animation and amazing graphicsMost mmos put all there money into gameplay and story writing. Not that theres anything wrong with that, but this leads to lack of visual presentation. Take wow for example. How long has it been out? Longer than most mmos. Has it updated its visual quality since its release? No. It looks the same as its always been. Now take a look at ff14. What do you see? 60fps gold encrusted in gorgeous platinum grade textures. And the best part is square knew they didn't have to try. ff11's looks are on par with wow. So why did they try? Because they care.4. no limits on how many classes you can haveIn the beginning, you choose your one main class. However, when you complete the level 15 quest from your guild, you are free to take on as many other guilds as you like. There is no need to make a second character unless you REALY want to. Square did this because they knew that it would have been tedious to have many characters under one profile due to class limitations. With just one character, you can suit the needs of all roles. Wether it be tank, healer, or damage dealer.3. NON-elitest communityHow many times have you been kicked from a raid in wow because you had the ""wrong"" armor on, or you put your attribute points in the ""wrong"" spot. True there is an optimal way to play ff14, as there always is with video games, but if you dont have a perfectly specced, perfectly outfitted, GOD among charcters... nobody cares. You can shove all of your black mage attribute points into strength, you can equip robes and a wooden sword as a gladiator, you can ignore your skill hotbar as a monk... and nobody cares. No matter your level, attributes, euipment, and mmo skills in general, you will never be dismissed from a game provided that you are respectful and you at least try to do your job. ff14 has the best community of all mmos ive ever seen.2. amount of dlcJust about every mmo gets there largest sum of profit from dlc. The temptation of new classes, races, side quests, main quests, and the increase of your max level is hard to ignore. Now, how much dlc does ff14 have? Take a guess. On second thought don't. I know you would have guessed wrong anyway. The amount of dlc for ff14, as of now, is... 1. That's it. Just heavensward. Other than that, the base game has everything else. Now don't take it the wrong way. this game has plenty of content. In fact, almost all races, classes, side quests, and main quests are added in the main game via PATCHES. I mean, what other mmo does that? Just giving you free stuff because you own the base game? can't think of any? Me neither. It's pretty clear that square cares more about the communitie's satisfaction than their profits in the making. thanks square.1. are you ready fo this... IT'S CROSS-CONSOLE!Yup. You heard me. The pc and ps4 ports of ff14 share the same servers. Servers that are filled with over 5 MILLION happy customers accross the world, and accross different platforms, The ps3 verson of the game is a minor exception, considering that heavensward almost broke the system because it was not built for such content. so its obvious why ps3 needs its own exclusive serverse. But other than that, YAY FOR CROSS-CONSOLE!ff14 is by far the best mmo I have ever played. Even without the 1 dlc that is out right now, you can still enjoy this game for hundreds upon hundreds of hours without getting bored. Infact, you can almost be certain that square will patch in new content to keep you playing.All in all, i recomend this for those who like rpgs, mmos, final fantasy, and any other square related rpgs.Now if you excuse me, i'm going to ride my black and green chocobo into the sunset. along side my titan-egi, of course.

												There is so much I love about this game, and would recommend it to any Final Fantasy fan. Fantastic combat, awesome dungeons, beautiful art style, killer looking battle skills, one of the best crafting systems in any MMO to date... It could have been perfect except for one problem:The ABYSMAL story quests. Go across the world, talk to person nobody cares about, come back, then go there again, maybe fight five trash mobs, go back, repeat five times and hope you finally get to the next dungeon so you can actually fight and use your awesome combat skills. And guess what? If you want any of the cool new classes or expansion content, you HAVE TO DO IT ALL.The weird thing is that many of the side quests and class quests are more fun and interesting than the entire main story quest combined. It's tragic that a Final Fantasy with such great characters and lore chooses to ignore that for 90% of the story quest, instead making you do menial tasks for faceless npcs you won't be able to remember if your life depended on it, while trudging back and forth like some kind of mailman.Despite this tragic waste of potential, I'd still recommend picking it up. The community is great, the gameplay (when it lets you actually get to it) is fantastic. I'll continue dreaming against hope that the Main Story quests get streamlined and sheared to hell, but I suppose it's a testament to the rest of the game's quality that I'm willing to endure it.

Simply put, it's the best story-focused MMO out there and one of the best Final Fantasy games ever made--even as an MMO. I can't get enough of it. It's refreshing to see a game in this genre put so much heart into the characters, writing, lore, etc.There are still plenty of grindy parts, but there is enough story to enjoy between them that it never feels cumbersome. There is simply so much to do in this game. Lots of variety. One of my top ten games of all time and certainly one worth playing especially if you enjoy the Final Fantasy universe or would like to get into it.The only negative I can think of is that the combat is a bit slow for my taste, but the rest is just so good that it doesn't bother me much, and the fact that you can switch classes by simply changing weapons always keeps things interesting.9.3/10 "

												Where do I start? I guess I could start back when Final Fantasy XI was released. My first ever MMO. But, nah, that game bored me. I quit that to play Star Wars Galaxies, and boy, was THAT a game! So now that we have the fact that I'm a SWG Vet, and no MMO has ever really caught my attention, or hooked me in, that should tell you how good this game is. DISCLAIMER: Fellow SWG Vet's, this is NOTHING like Galaxies! Except the MMO part. And the fact that you can be any class, whenever you want! Twelve combat classes, that merge into twelve more advanced classes, that you can blend and mix skills to have cross-class abilities, and then you can switch between them on the FLY!. Oh, and the crafting? Eight crafting classes, and three gathering classes! Crafting is very much like Galaxies. Scan for, or buy, mats. Find the best quality mats, and craft the best quality gear!There are dungeons, raids, and an amazing storyline that one would expect from a Final Fantasy game. The characters are very well developed, voice acted, and diverse. Everything falls into place.Before you purchase the game, and as with any other MMO: Do your research! Read up on th game, read reviews (like mine!), find out if there are free trials and friend codes. If you want a friend code, just send me a message, I'll be more than happy to show you around the vast world of Eorzea. It;s a beautiful one			"

												I bought this when I had a PC that couldn't run it. Lost a month but never cared. Finally got a PC that can run it very well and I've regret wasting the month now. It's a great game to pass time. The story is nice but I've gotten more interested in just playing the side quests and trying to get along with the people on my server. Takes time to get used to playing and getting from place to place is confusing sometimes but after a week or two, it gets really easy to transport across the world. Not for everyone but still a great game for those interested in an amazing MMORPG.			"

												The original version of Final Fantasy XIV was, to say, a disasterous release from Square Enix. Problems from glitches, bad economies between the players and NPCs and being flat-out unfinished.Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (or version 2.0 onwards) fixes so many of the problems and the game itself has good controls, an easy-to-use interface and HUD and beautiful sceneries and locations (with areas like Coerthas having been altered altogether from the original version). Each class has their own advantages and disadvantages and unique abilities that they learn upon levelling up or completing class-exclusive quests. Upon learning an ability that belongs to a specfic class, for example, Raging Strikes from the Archer, it can be used by other classes providing they're within level range to use it.The game offers many quests and dungeons as the story progresses, with new dungeons and harder variants of the bosses unlockable post-story (as of ver. 2.1 onwards). If you're a completionist-type of player, you will have plenty of things to collect and complete throughout the game.You will have to pay a subscription fee for this game, but for each period of subscription, you will be rewarded exclusive items, better known as Veteran Rewards. If you have a friend who wants to give the game a go, but doesn't want to spend anything yet, the Recruit-a-friend campaign allows them a 14-day free trial to see if it suits their fancy, furthermore, if your friend subscribes, you and your friend will get rewards only obtainable through this campaign.Old and new players will find plenty to do in this game, and if you're looking for a good time in an MMO I would definitely recommend Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.

												Realm Reborn is a sequel to the previously released Final Fantasy XIV, which wasn’t received very well, and this is even conveniently explained in the game’s plot: there’s an apocalypse which ravages the whole realm and begins a new era. Personally I hadn’t played the previous game but this sequel is said to offer significant improvements over the original across the board, it's essentially an entirely redesigned game of its own.The plot is fairly generic save the world kind of stuff: you are an adventurer brought into one of the game’s three big city-states with a special ability to attune to crystals which hold some great ability to hold off evil. You perform tasks for the city-states and eventually rise to become an envoy between them and even serve them. Similar to single-player games, the main plot and many of the other quests are filled with cutscenes, and in the main story’s case, the significant ones are also voiced. It’s all easy to follow and they’ve tried to put a bit of story into everything, for instance all of the game’s class guilds have a storyline of their own that advances as you gain levels and do guild quests.However this kind of plot is well suited for MMO and something as complex as Final Fantasy XIII’s super messy plot obviously wouldn’t work here. Rising in guild ranks and joining armies feels like an accomplishment, and you get treated to far more heroic stuff like taking on massive primals (think summons from previous Final Fantasy titles) rather fast. The game overall plays much like a singleplayer game story wise: the story is focused on your personal character and many plot advancing quests have certain “duty” sections that can only be completed with your own character, such as taking on a boss battle. This can be reversed too in some cases: some boss battles and dungeons instead put you in a party with others. Most of the game can be soloed if you want, but the option to do stuff in a party is totally there too, you’ll only ever be separated for brief periods at a time.This focus on your own character is what sets the game apart from other MMOs in my opinion and makes the game more interesting. The cutscenes are also no worse quality than in singleplayer FF titles and the game’s graphics and particularly animation are fantastic. All characters are lively animated and seeing your character pull off all kinds of stuff like stupid faces in cutscenes is really fun and involving. The game is also really well optimized, running on a large variety of systems and even having its own preset settings for laptops for instance that take your specs into account. The user interface in the game is really good too, super easy to use and slick looking, I was never at a loss to find something.Gameplay is similar to other MMO titles and the difficulty level is really good across the board, you will be challenged at every level and you can always find more dangerous or easier opponents and quests. As a nice twist your character can be literally any class in the game – you can use and level any one class at a time, provided you have joined their guild, and certain class abilities can also be used by other classes. For instance, Gladiators that have leveled Conjurer can cast Cure, which they normally wouldn’t have access to, so cross-classing a bit is encouraged and even required to get Jobs (specialized mid/late-game classes) later on. To swap a class you just swap to a different gear preset, which you can create lists of. At the most basic level you just need to change a weapon to switch to another class.The game is easy to get into as well, there’s a 15 day free trial that offers leveling of a single character up to level 20, but you can cross-class him/her as much as you like, and it’s definitely enough to get a good look at the game. The free trial is best played with a friend that already owns the game though, because you cannot set up your own parties in it, but other subscribed players can invite you to theirs. Marketplace and trading functions are limited but otherwise there’s no significant restrictions. The game is available as a digital download on the website and on Steam, as well as on PS3 and PS4 on the consoles, the multiplayer is cross-platform, and new buyers of the game automatically get 30 free game days. Steam users will also be happy to know that the monthly subscription can be paid with just Steam wallet money, assuming you also bought the game from Steam.TL;DRIt's great. Don't compare it to Square Enix's other new FF games. It's a traditional MMO game with Final Fantasy flavor and one well designed one at that. I enjoy it tons more than the recent main series FF games. And I wrote this review originally for something else in mind, if you're wondering why it's so long and detailed. :P Give it a chance, it deserves more PC Steam players. And, it has a ton of content in a large world. I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what it has to offer so far at the moment of writing.			"

												Uhm, this game is very different from other MMos and that is why its so popular. The monthly subscription fee is reasonable given to the possibilities you can have ingame. If you want a game, where you are basically like living in and where you can even relax, sure its a good game.+ Story is literally breath taking and unrivaled+ The crafting here is brought to whole different level (in form of minigames, quality based depending on how good u are with it) and you can literally craft everything (not even joking).+ The level balancing is also really well done ( a high lvl player can always start a new job and go out with his friends who are starting with the game)+ Cross skills in form of a Job ( literally the end game is about having one character maxed lvl on all classes).+ Well thought system+ Freedom of choice what do you want to play the most, if you dont like one specific type, just switch to other and you dont have to reset your progress.+ Most friendly community I ever seen. They embraced me everywhere with a smile, helpful and not raging, even though i just started the game and knew literally nothing.+ huge amount of mini games ( so you can do alot of stuff and relax ingame while waiting for ur dungeon qeueing or so on).+ While are you leveling your low lvl class, there is a vast amount of ingame interaction that you are not bored even though you are nowhere close to endgame content.Cons:- I became a no lifer and shut in, always addicted to just ffxiv.- more like a PvE game, PvP here is very limited to just group vs group (small group or large group). No duels. After some time, you will not really miss it.-sometimes the leveling is rly linear, but which MMO is not? If I should compare it to others, ffxiv still offers alot of different ways and minigames to at least kill the boredom a bit.			"

												This game will take your life away, your health, your job, your significant other, and give you gil.  This is how an MMO is supposed to be done, constant steady updates, more game content than you know what to play with , and the ability to do EVERYTHING from 1 character.  If you say you leave this game because ""hurr durr there's nothing to do"" then you're obviously not playing anything.			"

												Strikes a very satisfying balance between RPG and action game. Classes and skills themselves are very simple, much moreso than ones you'd often find in other MMOs. The simplicity allows for the player to focus harder on individual fights rather on stats and builds. This means that, assuming you're properly geared, you have only yourself to blame for death or messing up. You didn't put an extra point in a bad stat, you didn't level a bad skill, you just messed up, and the next step is learning how not to do the same thing again. Or you lagged. Titan HM/EX, every time.Mechanic memorization may not be everyone's cup of tea, but in my opinion it is much better and more satisfying to clear a boss or a raid because you knew what to do, when and how, rather than because you're a big bad min/max'd dude with perfect stats and a perfect skill build. You get to where you are through practice, through learning, through experiencing. You can't just invest a bunch of time/gil into BiS gear and expect to do good at everything if you haven't tried it yet, and that's why I really love this game.			"

												logged 571 hours over a couple of months at the time of writing this. Which doesn't seem like a lot but the way I play games (play for a few hours, stop, play, stop) it's a lot of time to dedicate to one game.I haven't played an FF game I enjoyed since X. That is, until XIV came out. I've played a lot of MMOs including WoW and none of them held my interest for long. In FFXIV there are a lot of things to do and the community is the most enjoyable one I've encountered.One of the things I enjoy the most is that you don't have to stick to one class. On my  main I started off as a Lancer and instead of remaking and loosing all that time you can simply go pick up a new class (which gets upgraded to a job once you complete the level 30 quest). If you get sick of your character appearance you can use a potion that you get as part of the vetran rewards to change everything about them (or you can buy one). If you're just sick of their hair/makeup changing that is as simple as coughing up 2k gil for a makeover. (which is nothing at all later on, especially if you craft)Speaking of crafting, that's a feature that held my interst for hours. It's rewarding, although often expensive. In addition to making weapons/armor/clothing for your character you can also make furniture if you have a house, which you can buy personally or by joining a guild called a Free Company that has one. The only gripe I have is super long DPS queue times but that's less the games fault so much as the fact that I play DPS mainly.It will trash your life and suck up your time. 10/10.			"

												Final Fantasy XIV is a MMORPG set in it's own realm. Welcome to Eorzea, Pros.Endless gameplay nearlyLarge veriety of activities from Raids to simple crafting and the casino!Free add ons Patches 2.1 - 2.55 all have major content updates that give new gameplay features, story, and modes For free. An MMO with a story! ikr? It's so rare and unique to find an MMO with a good story and out of Guild wars, WoW and Rift FF14 has the best of the best!Cons,Mixed playerbase: Due to multi platform release you have a large mix of Pro players from other MMOs and newbies from the consoles who won't listen to anything you say or even reply causing some issues in low lvl dungeons and gameplay.Learning the game: while somewhat easy learning truly KNOWING what everything does will take some time and can be quite dificult overall.Limited exploration: While the world may feel large compared to 11 or 1.0 It's quite smaller than what it was with each area a limited size due to console version limitations.Server login / character creation limitations: If you wanna join your budy on a High populated server GOOD LUCK either stay up till 3am in the morning and pray Or buy a server transfer for 20$ ontop of your existing 20-30 for the game and first free month.

												Final Fantasy XIV is an MMO that takes the common tropes of many others, polishes them up and delivers content on a fairly regular basis with an open producer and a lot of community involvement. With MMOs being largely community driven, the fact that the Final Fantasy XIV team is willing to share as much and as often as they do (going so far as to describe the problems they had in the original launch of the game and how they worked on them) is a breath of fresh air.The failure of Final Fantasy XIV Online was something of a reality check and with the two years spent redeveloping the game we now have a well written story surrounded with an excellent series of challenges to keep people busy with. The game is visually impressive and runs many times better than it's failed predecessor. Combat is at a fair pace with a number of different classes that you can change to on the fly just by changing your primary weapon.While Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is primarily a PvE game, the development team has done an excellent job at bringing in content in a timely manner, providing for quality-of-life adjustments, and has been extremely effective in documenting and implementing a lot of the playerbase's wishes.If you're looking for an MMO, Final Fantasy XIV isn't a bad one to look at. With it's entry price being half that of other new MMOs, and the subscription offerings being more flexible than others, the game is not only well cared for, but hard to beat for it's price of entry.

												Im only a couple hundred hours in, but I feel that I have enough experience in the game to write a review about it.   Good graphics, at least for an MMO, good mechanics, good story.   Lots and lots of things to do, never a lack of content, and there is a new expansion that has been announced recently.   There is mount collecting, minion collecting, dozens of dungeons, many trials, plenty of raiding, seasonal events, I mean you name it.   One of the very biggest strong points of this game however is that you can play ALL the classes on a single character. (There are 13 different classes, more will arrive with the new expansion.) Not only that, but there are several jobs/ crafting classes that your character can be as well, at least seven that I know of.   As for the world size, there are currently 30 zones throughout the game at this time, there are a couple zones that are a little smaller than others, but for the most part the zones are of very good size and if you enjoy larger worlds than this will scratch at least some of this itch. You will not feel like the world is small. (Even if youve played WoW for years and are trying this for the first time.)   Good, helpful community, some people are jerks, but there are some in every crowd.   There is lots of room for hardcore and casual players, or those that are both, and furthermore, if you like a game where you can solo a lot of content, this game scratches that itch as well.   I hope this review helps.			"

												Final Fantasy 14 is ""THE"" true MMO expereince of the part few years. Its build upon the foundation that WoW set years ago and keeps become one of the best RPG experiences you'll have in a MMO setting. There is so much content that at times it will seem overwhelming. There is content for all types of players, from PvP, gathering and crafting, end game raiding and many more. I can go on and on but the fact is that if you are searching for an MMO to really get into. Final Fantasy 14 is the way to go.On a side note, you are never too late to start. Square has made an excelent job for new players to catch up and jump into the most relevant content.			"

												AwesomeWhat took me in was the Job system, no alts no multiple accounts just one character and you can have any class you want anytime you want, want to play tank just equip your tank item set it's as easy as clicking one button (its how the sets work, u equip item create job item set with one click and now you can even put shortcut button on your quickbar for easy access)Entertaining combat system sucked me in, each class/job has its own thing and its own twist on basic gameplay, Ninjas have mudras (like in Naruto, you combine three signs and cast skill that comes from this combination), Monks are position based so you want to move around a lot attack from flank and from the back, and they get faster and stronger the longer fight lasts, Dark Kinghts are aggresive tanks that use loads of mana, overally its great.Now quest design...that is probably the weekest part, quests are mundane and often totally boring, like go to dude ""a"" and take fish from him, bring that fish to dude ""b"" who gives you fish stew, now you have to run to dud ""a"" and give him a stew so he will send you to his 3 soldiers that need the stew.But loads of content, tens of dungeons, tens of trials and boss battles all easilly accesible via  ""duty finder"" tool make it hard to get bored.If You like MMO's you cang go wrong with this one.

												I would defiantly recommend giving this MMO a try if you haven't already.The story is great with lots of cut scenes to keep you fully immersed, really nice music that fits with zones well, zones are really beautiful (especially the higher level ones), dungeons can be challenging from an early level, you can play every single class and profession on one character so there’s no need for alts, queue times aren’t that long because of the amount of people playing the game, it’s available for both PS3/PS4 and PC, people who play on console can play with those on PC and it has a nice community.However I found that around level 40-50 there’s not that many quests to complete and you may have to do fates or dungeons in order to continue with the main storyline. Then at end game it becomes a little grindy. "

												Hello everyone!So after about 150 hours in the game I decided to write my very first Steam review. I want to mention that I have not yet experienced the ""engame"" of the game. I've been leveling a few classes (as in every MMO i try out lots of different classes before actually leveling one to max-level.  If you are looking for a review of the endgame, this is not it. So far I played White Mage, Paladin and Ninja. What I like about the game  Classes  Nice classes with interesting combos/mechanics.All classes playable by the same character (you can switch to the different classes without creating a new character). Style Beautiful spell effects.Nice monster, weapon and armor design. Mechanics Very good transportation ingame. Once you have visited the different zones and activated the crystal there you can teleport to that crystal for a small fee.Chocobo mounts! These can actually be leveled and fight alongside you, tank for you and can even heal you!Customizable interface. You can move around anything you see and decide how big or small you want it to be. Community Very friendly community. I know that this is not necessarily because of the game but I feel it should be mentioned. I played a number of MMOs before but this has to be by far the nicest community I've seen in an MMO. What I think could be improved  Map  The map takes a bit getting used to. Sometimes it is hard to see where you have to go for a quest that spans across different zones. Abilities  Depending on the class there is a bit of button bloat. Some classes get very niche spells that rarely get used. Leveling  Once you leveled up a few classes you might start to run out of quests. This is because you still have to level the other classes up but can only complete each quest once. So if you did them all while leveling your first few classes you might end up having no quests later on. Luckily you can do FATEs (similar to the events in Guild Wars 2 for example) and repeatable Levequests to level up. Level Sync  The game has a level sync system that lets you do lower level content and still earn experience. This is a nice feature, but I still put it here as I think it could be improved. Let's take my Ninja for example: You get a very nice mechanic at level 30 that lets you combine different hand signs to cast a Ninjutsu. This is when the class starts to get really interesting because different combinations will let you cast very different spells. Now if you would enter a Dungeon that is for level 20 characters the game will de-level you to that level. This means that you will not have access to spells over level 20. In the case of the Ninja this will lead to very boring gameplay. Conclusion So far the game really impressed me. I played a few MMOs before but the style and gameplay of Final Fantasy XIV really drew me in. I recommend you at the very least try out the free trial.			"

												I'll make this review straight to the point and blunt as possible, I love this MMO. I've played wow, rift, vindictus, conquer (ew), runescape (cmon we all did growing up!) I was a wow player since vanilla, this game is a lot more laid back with it's playerbase on Tonberry JP, the end-game is more actionbased and requires quick reaction times, this makes SoO heroic and Highmaul Mythic look bloody pathetic.If you're looking for a challenging MMO for raiding? This is your game.If you're looking for gorgeous visuals and to just mess around instead of end-game? This is also your game.If you're looking for a final fantasy game? lol this is also your game.If you're looking for PVP? Look up which servers have the most.			"

												Though I no longer play, I guess this deserves a review with the time I put in.PROS:* The storyline and cutscenes are every bit as good as any other Final Fantasy, even though your main character is generically referred to as the ""Warrior of Light."" The characters surrounding the story have their own arcs, all of which are interesting, especially in the expansion. Tasteful bits of humor, throwbacks to previous games, and a generally well-put-together campaign make for a game that will have you playing well into the night and early morning. * Beautiful and varied environments, great animations, UI leaves little to be desired, everything visually (and functionally) has that polish you'd expect from Final Fantasy. Also, it might just be my rig--it's decent but not amazing--but I almost always floated around 60fps unless I had my camera on a heavily saturated marketplace.* Plays amazingly well with a controller for an MMO with a decent amount of moves for every class. Granted, I think this was meant for PS3 first anyway, but still, it optimizes perfectly with a PC/XBox controller.* Very few ""tank and spank"" boss fights, though most of them aren't very hard if you just know where to stand. 99% of charged boss attacks have visual callouts on the ground, the other 1% only have the charging bar. Still, there's almost always something interactive to keep every party member on their toes.* As usual, the venerable Nobuo Uematsu among other composers make some amazing tracks, many of them experimental. There *will* be times where you enter a dungeon group for the first time and thirty seconds in you're like ""damn, this song is good."" Or you might think ""damn, this doesn't seem like it belongs in a Final Fantasy game, but I like it!"" OST is awesome, long story short.* Very flexible visual customization for your character.* Class system is a bit restrictive, at first. Mechanically, there is almost no difference between those of the same class, but with all the tools every class has available, there's a lot of ways *to* play them. It's like instead of having to choose what you do all the time, it's about adapting to the situation. For example, most classes have some sort of ""toggle"" ability that switches up their function, such as tanks being able to turn off/on their aggro generation to deal more damage, healers switching from doing slightly less healing to more damage, or black mages alternating between fire/blizzard to drain/regain mana at will.*** For a more specific and personal example, I played almost exclusively Dark Knight when I FINALLY got it, and prioritized my gear 3 different ways: pure tank, pure DPS, and off-tank (a combination). Since tanks can freely turn off their respective tanky moves, and it's not particularly hard to get a lead on threat (protip: there's a built-in aggro meter), I would usually go with my slightly higher damage setup and gauge how well the healer can keep up versus how much threat I've got. And since turning off Grit (DRK tanky toggle) allows for the use of Blood Weapon (bonus attack speed/cooldown reduction), the damage alone usually still kept my threat up to speed. I would usually save my tanky cooldowns for that switch to compensate and ease the healer into it.NEUTRAL:* The voice acting is good, but completely changed in the expansion for ALL characters, mostly for the better... mostly. There's some spotty acting in both OG and HW, but what really didn't make sense for me was Tataru's voice in Heavensward. We go from a tiny, cartoony female voice befitting a tiny, cartoony character, to what sounds like a British woman in her mid-thirties. Was very jarring to hear the first time and every time throughout.* Some dungeons can be looooong, making grinding for a specific item or simply for experience a massive undertaking. The combat is fun enough to make it not feel grindy though.* Gathering, however, is grindy, but overall profitable since a lot of people who already have money don't wanna do it. It's only really hard to level when multiple people are in the only spot you can reliably skill-up at the level you're at.* Triple Triad is back, and as much as I love it, I hate the way they implemented card restrictions. Until you've collected a certain number of unique cards, you're limited in how you can construct your deck based on the rating of the cards (i.e. at the start you can only have one 3* and four 2*s, rank up for one 4* and four 3*, then a 5* and 4*s). I guess they were encouraging you to have to look up where you can find unique cards or something, because you have no way of knowing what cards can be dropped from NPCs you beat.I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing this game, and recommend it to any MMO fan, Final Fantasy or not. The only negative thing about it is, well, endgame is kind of repetitive. Once I was done with pretty much everything, got all the gear I wanted that I didn't wanna grind the rest of my life for, I just spent my time helping people in my free company with quests and leveling. That in itself is rewarding, so find yourself a good FC and have fun!			"

												There is so much things to say about Final Fantasy XIV that I will try to make it fast!Even though I am upvotting this game (because of my 2078hrs+ and because I have hope that they make this game better in future), I do not recommend this game to every kind of players!It would only depends on how patient can you be!Let's get started!--- GRAPHICS ---+ Pros:- The graphics are decent,you do not need a strongcomputer to run the game!- Some areas can look wonderful- You can run the game with a PS3 as well! (Soon to be removed, though.)- Cons:- Some maps (especially Heavensward's one) can look terrifyingly uggly. ><- Aion (I did not played very much but enough) looks better and it is Free to Play (while this game is money greedy but  I'll talk about that later!)- Your character can't be uggly (if you ever wanted to make a hideous character, it'll be complicated)--- Gameplay ---+ Pros:- You can switch classes any time you want- Past-level 30 you can unlock your class's job- Different gameplays for every classes (Also for crafting / gathering classes!)- Cons:- Gameplay is poor: You have to use a spell to sprint, you don't have access to double jumps or anything original!- There is a lot of invisible walls which is pretty frustrating- Classes gameplay can be repetitive (Many spells are identical. For example, every tank classes has a few %dmg reduced spell for a certain amount of time)- Too long cast-time for caster classes- Dungeons are super slow and most of them are pretty boring to play--- END GAME CONTENT ---Oh boi, I feel like I might put a lot of down sides to it <.< (I don't know what I will type in advance)+ Pros:- Release patches with some content. (About each 3 months I think?)- Cons:- Farming MONTHS to get scripted items. You don't get to make a original <build> to your character since you willbe told what to buy by the system.- Always the same (and continuously) patches: A bit more of MSQ, 1 or 2 dungeons, 1 raid, 1 trial.- Farming but for what? In fact, there is ABSOLUTELY NO POINT to get the highest items.It won't be usefull. If you go in a low level dungeon to help someone, your level and stats are syncced.PvP is a 4V4 team or 8V8. There is also another one with bigger amount.But once again, STATS syncced!There is legit no point to farm. This is my biggest reproach to the game.- If you don't have anything to do, you can level up every other classes max. But it's repetitive. <.<;;Otherwise, you can do their events:It'd be like a small 30 mins story for christmas / or / halloween or other moments.To either get a emote, or -most of time- uggly clothes.Nothing really exciting. Sometimes you'll get 1 event per month, sometime nothing for 3 months!--- Scenario ---(You will discover soon enough in the game that you are not just a normal person and that you have ""special"" powers making you stronger than most people. You will be siding with < the good people > to protect it from < the bad people >)+ Pros:- Original story, making you look like a badass in cutscenes- Lots of cutscenes!- Cons:- Lots of filling quests, it's pretty annoying!- In Heavensward, they will repeat over and over some stupid things about being in war since 1000 years. But like, VERY oftenly. Ruinning the immersion <.<;;- There is a voiced cutscenes, but then, out of a sudden, no more voiced cutscenes for a while. - You have to clic on voiced cutscenes to continue the dialogue/cutscene making it frustrating when you want to see it kind of like a movie <.>--- Social aspect ---If you are, like me, a League Of Legends player and can't stand the community,you will probably enjoy some of Final Fantasy XIV's servers because the community in game can bepretty open-minded and nice to you! It is one of the reason I like this game and still play it.Plus, the game is good enough to make some cool FFXIV content on YouTube.Growing a community from FFXIV is probably the best since you'll see many nice and open-minded peoplewhile if you play League Of Legends, their players would probably say things like ""you suck i'm a better [character's name] than you!""--- THE COMPANY (SquareEnix) ---This is probably the biggest down side of that game.Square Enix is INSANELY money greedy.To play the game, you will have to pay monthly $15.If you want extra-retainers, you have to pay an extra amount monthly (like.. $2 or 3 per retainers per month)They barely offer anything to the players. (As mentionned earlier: Events are rare and you don't obviously get nice things every time.Most of time it's just some clothes. While in games like ""Summoners War"", they offer a lot of things you could get by paying, even tho the game is 100% free)They will make some cool stuffs, but you have to pay to get those.Emotes (/playdead ? $7!) Zantetsuken? $100!W- what? $100? How come?Riiight. Because you are forced to pay a status coming with the emote.You want some cat ears? You need to pay a $40 meh plushie.How much does that cost to server transfer? O-Oh.. $18 only. TeeheeThey already make so much money, refuse (most of time) to listen to community and will still makelots of things paying exclusive.Errr.. Okay. :X¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It is saddening. Well, I think I am done!While hoping that this game gets better in future with the in coming extension!It is a bit long, but I tried my best to make it fast without getting in details.As I said, there is A LOT of things to talk about, for that game! ^^'Also, don't mind my English. I am French. I'm aware it is not the best! X.XThank you for reading!			"

												Being new to MMO's as a whole, this game was a perfect entry point for me. I've played The Old Republic which as fantasic story telling but was lacking in actual MMO content. The story content in this game seems hours between content but trickled in just enough to keep you wanting to play to find out whats what. The game play is very simple to the point my wife whom is not even good at games in general is playing and has twice the amount of hours as me! Not the perfect game by far but I feel that's mostly opinion based at this point as the story is far from done and I hate grinding which is a key point for all MMO's. Worth the pick up, don't get heavensward until you get a good feel for the game and want to commit. Particuarly since there is a 15 bucks a month subscription.			"

												I love this game so much, I wish I had more people to play it with, I spent a 135 hours into it, and barely scratched the surface, there's so much you can do, the tradecraft leves are amazing, and its easy to level up. Sometimes the levelgrind can get infuriating because it can be a grindfest and it will consume most of your time, the crafting system is awesome too you can choose a lot, I actually dumped World of Warcraft for this, and trust me, it's worth every penny. I dont want to give out too much information about it, because there is spoilers in this game, also the progression system does feel like you are actually progressing, Guild Wars 2 and World of Warcraft fails to do that. Would I recommend this to my friends? Yes, yes I would.			"

It makes all those free to play games feel very cheep and budget built. FFxiv takes FFXI and imporves on it in every way. For fans of the MMO genre this is your game. Try the free, 14 day trail and you'll see that this game is well worth the monthy subscription.

												I'm blown away by this game and everything that comes with it. The visuals, audio, gameplay, writing, events, community,  and merchandise are all top-notch. It even has controller support and is cross-platform; something you nearly never see done well, especially in MMORPGs.Every sidequest has a unique story with meaningful dialogue, and the game is full of cutscenes if you like believable worlds. For those of you who just want to get to the gameplay, everything can be skipped and viewed at another time. If you end up loving the game, there are free desktop/mobile wallpapers and ringtones; as well as tons of high quality merchandise.There is a subscription fee to pay of course, the cheapest being £7.69/€10.99/$12.99 for 30 days. The basic subscription only allows 1 character per server, but this doesn't matter as characters are not limited in what they can learn. It is entirely possible to max out every class on one character if you have the patience.There is nothing negative I can say about this game, it's perfect in my eyes. Download the demo and give it a shot, it might not be for everyone but it certainly does it for me. Oh, and if you still aren't sure; go look at some game art, listen to the soundtrack and watch some gameplay. The passion of the team behind this game speaks for itself.			"

												*tagged as a Drunk Review*MMOs are incredibly hard to review.They require a very different consumption model than the one which follows any other game constuct.As having almost 4000 hours played would imply, I have a deep invesment into the game if, anything, to prove that I have not wasted over three months of my life playing it.But it is far more enjoyable than any MMO I have played in the last 10 years.Being able to play one character who can level anything? Godsdamned priceless.A crafting system that (before Heaven's Ward) rewarded multiclassing? Superb.Gathering that is wholly necessary to advance crafting returns? Essential to a proper balance of skills and classes.A variety of class roles and requirements, wholly integral to endgame content? Fascinating and complicated.This is the MMO that brought me back after nearly 7 years of exile from WoW.Enjoy it, love it, find solace in the various game design decisions that benefit the solo player and bring so many options to the multi-player.But don't get too invested in PvP. It is an afterthought that, while moderately balanced, is not nearly as fun and intuitive as the rest of the game is,Lula Moon, Faerie server, Lv51+ in every job/class available.			"

												Well what can I say that hasn't been said yet. ALOT is good about this game. Just a few things are bad. FFXIV has got quite a fun endgame after you finish the main story line. I keep returning to it. I'm level 60 for ages now, but there is so much to do. Mainly gear progression for me. Which is grindy but not to much. There are different endgame options for different kind of people too. For example you can get 'relic/anima weapons' which are end tier weapons. These can be gained purely by grinding-like mechanics. But there are gear and weapons you get by doing dungeons and making sure you get your weekly cap of 'X-currency' (tomestones). There is also hardcore raid gear to be gotten, for the peeps who are more serious in doing the hardest raids. I'm not much of a hardcore 'savage difficulty' raider. Not doing them isn't handicapping me in a huge way either.Just a few cons about the game for me:Story quests are dreadfully boring at some times. Storyline quests shouldn't involve 'fetch this or that' or 'talk 10x times to citizens around town' quests.. This get's WAY better after 3.0 though and I truly hope, for new players, they remove/alter some earlier quests. Because otherwise you will get a habit of skipping thru half of the stuff you have to read.I miss an immersive feeling with this world. This is because the whole 'world map' consists of multiple 'instanced' area's. Which do have loading screens in between. It's something that will probably never change. I accept it now but it took me a while. Most area's are very beautiful though!And I really miss oldschool FF prerendered absolutly astonishing cutscenes! There are a few, but I want more! :PAll in all, the game feels very relaxed and has a good balance between difficulty levels. It's a game for everyone, but will take a lot of your time :)			"

												Tab-targeting slow combat, pretty standard themepark world with little interactions and forced holy trinity, so I'll go through the reasons why it's at least worth a try.Well, first of all, while the questing system is ""every WoW clone ever"", it does an amazing job in keeping you invested with some impressive writing. I ended up getting hooked by the story as it went on and I still want to play to see where it will lead. There are many twists and turns and even the small optional quests have their own small story to tell. Unfortunately, the writers wanted to say a bit too much even when it's not needed so the fluff can get tiresome sometimes.Second, the game provides instances that are linked to quests, making it mandatory to give them a go and beat them. On top of that, it's very easy to get a group for said required dungeons, even big raids as even high level players will have some reason to go through them, making the matchmaking a breeze. This is both a blessing and a curse as it makes the game feel more like a Single Player game in an MMO environment. You won't really have to depend on others to have fun as much, but at the same time there would be basically no reason to interact with other players out of dungeons.Another thing that is interesting but kind of a hit and miss is that you can take on all classes and professions on the same character. And while you might not be interested in becoming any of the said classes, every single one of them has a storyline through class specific quests even up to the max level. The ""miss"" part is that there is no further customization really. While you can change a class on the fly, said class doesn't have special trees or builds for it. Can't even chose the gear really to spice it up via slightly different stats, just have to pick ""the best"".On the matter of classes, the crafting and gathering classes are not the usual ""no-brain-get-materials-and-craft"" stuff. You are required to use certain skills and craft materials in a certain way using a mini-game. It can get tiresome as it gets longer to gain a level the higher you go, but at least it's way more interactive than the usual ""go there, get this, press button, repeat"" crafting and/or gathering. Unfortunately, you can't really focus on crafting and ignore fighting as you pretty much have to at least finish the story quests and all of them require fighting only.Finally, the game is amazingly optimized. It takes a very dense city and/or fight to have the framerate drop bellow 60 on maxed out graphical settings at 1080p. While that comes at the cost of having a very instanced-based world, the fast loading times combined with the general structure of the environment nullify the issue as much as possible. There are still some times that you will get annoyed by the loading screens you have to go through, but they are not that often in my opinion.I'd go through the issues the game has, but if you've played any other MMORPG, you probably can imagine what could be said. The world interactions and gameplay are nothing to write home about despite the developer's best attempt to make it as interesting as possible without any real attempts at creating something trully innovative and unique. But still, can't take away what's good about it, with a big amount of good free content (not requiring you to purchase DLC or expansions every update), it's hard to argue against trying it out if you have a lot of time to waste.

												Hello everyone!So after about 150 hours in the game I decided to write my very first Steam review. I want to mention that I have not yet experienced the ""engame"" of the game. I've been leveling a few classes (as in every MMO i try out lots of different classes before actually leveling one to max-level.  If you are looking for a review of the endgame, this is not it. So far I played White Mage, Paladin and Ninja. What I like about the game  Classes  Nice classes with interesting combos/mechanics.All classes playable by the same character (you can switch to the different classes without creating a new character). Style Beautiful spell effects.Nice monster, weapon and armor design. Mechanics Very good transportation ingame. Once you have visited the different zones and activated the crystal there you can teleport to that crystal for a small fee.Chocobo mounts! These can actually be leveled and fight alongside you, tank for you and can even heal you!Customizable interface. You can move around anything you see and decide how big or small you want it to be. Community Very friendly community. I know that this is not necessarily because of the game but I feel it should be mentioned. I played a number of MMOs before but this has to be by far the nicest community I've seen in an MMO. What I think could be improved  Map  The map takes a bit getting used to. Sometimes it is hard to see where you have to go for a quest that spans across different zones. Abilities  Depending on the class there is a bit of button bloat. Some classes get very niche spells that rarely get used. Leveling  Once you leveled up a few classes you might start to run out of quests. This is because you still have to level the other classes up but can only complete each quest once. So if you did them all while leveling your first few classes you might end up having no quests later on. Luckily you can do FATEs (similar to the events in Guild Wars 2 for example) and repeatable Levequests to level up. Level Sync  The game has a level sync system that lets you do lower level content and still earn experience. This is a nice feature, but I still put it here as I think it could be improved. Let's take my Ninja for example: You get a very nice mechanic at level 30 that lets you combine different hand signs to cast a Ninjutsu. This is when the class starts to get really interesting because different combinations will let you cast very different spells. Now if you would enter a Dungeon that is for level 20 characters the game will de-level you to that level. This means that you will not have access to spells over level 20. In the case of the Ninja this will lead to very boring gameplay. Conclusion So far the game really impressed me. I played a few MMOs before but the style and gameplay of Final Fantasy XIV really drew me in. I recommend you at the very least try out the free trial.			"

I can go on and on but the fact is that if you are searching for an MMO to really get into. Final Fantasy 14 is the way to go.On a side note, you are never too late to start.

												AwesomeWhat took me in was the Job system, no alts no multiple accounts just one character and you can have any class you want anytime you want, want to play tank just equip your tank item set it's as easy as clicking one button (its how the sets work, u equip item create job item set with one click and now you can even put shortcut button on your quickbar for easy access)Entertaining combat system sucked me in, each class/job has its own thing and its own twist on basic gameplay, Ninjas have mudras (like in Naruto, you combine three signs and cast skill that comes from this combination), Monks are position based so you want to move around a lot attack from flank and from the back, and they get faster and stronger the longer fight lasts, Dark Kinghts are aggresive tanks that use loads of mana, overally its great.Now quest design...that is probably the weekest part, quests are mundane and often totally boring, like go to dude ""a"" and take fish from him, bring that fish to dude ""b"" who gives you fish stew, now you have to run to dud ""a"" and give him a stew so he will send you to his 3 soldiers that need the stew.But loads of content, tens of dungeons, tens of trials and boss battles all easilly accesible via  ""duty finder"" tool make it hard to get bored.If You like MMO's you cang go wrong with this one.

												I would defiantly recommend giving this MMO a try if you haven't already.The story is great with lots of cut scenes to keep you fully immersed, really nice music that fits with zones well, zones are really beautiful (especially the higher level ones), dungeons can be challenging from an early level, you can play every single class and profession on one character so there’s no need for alts, queue times aren’t that long because of the amount of people playing the game, it’s available for both PS3/PS4 and PC, people who play on console can play with those on PC and it has a nice community.However I found that around level 40-50 there’s not that many quests to complete and you may have to do fates or dungeons in order to continue with the main storyline. Then at end game it becomes a little grindy. "

												Let's look at MMO companies these days. The trend is cater to the extreme casuals -""nothing can be hard or we complain""- so the game gets dumbed down. Then there's the more rare, but present, companies who refuse to listen to players and totally hose the game. Like Archeage in how Trion ruined what would have otherwise been a fantastic game. Or Eve online, which hemorrhages players left and right nearly every year after updates that break the game- except with Eve, the hardcore fanbase will always play or come back eventually, maybe not all but enough to keep it from going F2P - despite the company CCP continually screwing over the playerbase. It's a sandbox with nails, folks there are generally used to getting tetanus so the company being ♥♥♥♥♥ is like w/e.Final Fantasy XIV MMO on the other hand, had a bad start yes, but the company did something very very rare; they listened AND fixed the game to the point where folks now are saying its the next MMO worth spending a monthly fee to play. No its not the 'game to replace the original WoW' (not the shell of its former self that it is now) that will cure all things, but it is a damn good game.Have to hand it to the company for bringing this MMO back from the brink of its bad release. With how many MMO's come out (SWOTR, TERA, Wildstar, Archeage.. to name a few), promise the world, fail, then go F2P, it's really saying something these days that a company can listen to feedback, take it in, and fix the game to make it a success.This review sums it up pretty well:

*Original review after 460+ hours / 1 character restoration and resubription*After 250 hours I deleted my character in an attempt to stop playing. Then a couple months later I heard rumours of character restorations. $14.99 and a month later I was 450 hours in. I didnt re-subscribe again after that month, but I think about it regularily. I also didnt delete my character this time. I bought the game on sale and it came with a free month. So $45.00 total got me 3 months / 450 hours of some of the most enjoyable gaming I have ever done (loooooooong time gamer here). As someone who started with FF1 on NES I can honestly say that this is my favorite FF game of all time (I've only played 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,14). It is the most complete, the most challenging, the most satisfying FF game I`ve ever played. And the best part is it never stops growing. Since I left they have added 2 new classes and a new Primal to fight. Not every element of this game is exciting. Some of it is straight up boring, and some of it will have you screaming with excitment / raging and throwing your controller. But the fact is you get to choose what you go on and do every day. Its up to you. The lack of voice overs is a little underwhelming, but at the same time its how most FF games I`ve played have been. 10/10 Would delete and restore character again.			"

												Eh who need a degree anywayI used to play wow a long time ago.  As an older wow player who grew bored of it after it lost it's charm, i'm happy to say i found a new charm within this game. Now i was scared jumping back in after the disaster that was FF14 1.0 and a guy who pre ordered the collectors edition. But i took a leap of faith and i wasn't dissapointed. The game can played almost alone which i like because i don't meeting people online and making friends with them. However i do like to play this with friends which i do. I can explore the world on my own and do awesome dungeons with friends. One thing i'm very impressed with is the cross play with ps3 and ps4 players. I like it when people do this it brings us together and fills up the servers. Unlike some other mmo (cough elder schools online). It's worth the subscription, and i have a feeling you find a warm connection with this game.One thing i would like to see though is the ability to do dungeons on your own without a full party and not scale either. Let me go in as a level 30 for example  and see if i can do the first dungeon on my own as the dungeon normally is.			"

												Basically, best mmorpg I've ever seen.The shared cold down time is a pain, however, the endgame content somehow fixed that. I did not find it too uncomfortable when I do my raids and trials, so I would say that system is actually not that bad.The choice on different jobs on one single character is really good system. I've been so tired to lvl again and do the main story again and again to get a new job. Although the lvling for jobs after the first job is really painful, I prefer that than watch the same story again and again.The gathering and crafting for me, is the best design in this game. I am not a hardcore player, so when I feel tired on doing my raids, I usually just go fishing or something else. It left the choice for player not only to fight, but somehow live in this game world. Furthermore, the Gold Saucer is also another way to take a rest. I think ff14 really provide player anothe world to live in, not only a tons of boss to kill.I do not pvp a lot, and I never liked pvp before, so I cannot tell anything about the pvp system.At last, my grading for this game is 95/100, I hope you would give this game a try after read my review. :)			"

												I've played WoW on and off for years, and I've also played Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2, and dabbled with WildStar and numerous other MMOs. After all my expierenes with MMOs, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is my favorite, and it's the game that made me stop playing WoW.The first thing you'll notice when you launch the game is just how gorgeous the world of Eorzea is. Gameplay wise, the combat is interactive enough; it may not be as involved as a game like WildStar, but you're constantly using skills and dodging attacks which makes it very entertaining. The main story is interesting, and is full of likeable characters. The voice acting is pretty good for the most part, I haven't encountered anything that really stood out as bad like a Jill sandwhich.As much as I do love this game, I still have some criticism (since after all, nothing is perfect). The most glaring issue is the slow pacing players will encounter at the start. It can easily turn new players off of the game as they will be bombarded with meaningless ""go there, talk to person X, go back to quest giver, get reward"" type quests, and getting those out of the way before you get to the combat is pretty boring (though you do have the option to skip those and go straight to the combat quests right away).The ability to have access to every class in the game on a single character removes the need for alts, and is neccessary for the job system within the game. Jobs are essentially advancements of a class, and require class A (the class that is being advanced) to be level 30, while having a specific class, class B, be at level 15. This allows you to have new abilities, and access to job specific quests form levels 30-50 (60 with the Heavensward expansion), each with their own story, much like the class quests that you'd encounter from levels 1-30. The only gripe I have with the ability to change classes on your character, is the lack of quests in the game. Since you'll eventually run out of quests to do to get XP, you'll end up doing the same dungeons, FATEs, and levequests repeatedly, which can get dull.Overall this is a great game, and well worth the subscription price in my opinion (there are two subscription models available: Standard $15 a month with no restrictions, and the Entry level for $13 a month which limits you to one character per world). It's a good game for Final Fantasy fans and non fans alike, though fans of the series will probably get a bit more enjoyment out of it due to the bits of (non-intrusive) fanservice sprinkled in.

												Having played World of Warcraft on and off for the better part of a decade, I can say that this game (even with its similarities) is a refreshing change to the fast paced job that wow seems to have become. Final Fantasy XIV has a very epic and engaging story, not often seen in MMORPGs. Cross class ability's, plenty of professions and tons of dungeons to explore with friends or with the very helpful duty finder. You also have the ability to play all classes and jobs with one toon, making your avatar feel more personal than ever.The community here is amazing and full of wonderful and helpful people.  Oh and End Game is great too. There are a ton of lvl 50 8 player ""full party"" instances and 24 player raids to keep you busy. That is untill the first expantion comes out in a few months. Buying Final Fantasy XIV will also come with 30 days free so for $20 its worth giving it a shot, if anything just for the story!			"

												I've played WoW on and off for years, and I've also played Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2, and dabbled with WildStar and numerous other MMOs. After all my expierenes with MMOs, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is my favorite, and it's the game that made me stop playing WoW.The first thing you'll notice when you launch the game is just how gorgeous the world of Eorzea is. Gameplay wise, the combat is interactive enough; it may not be as involved as a game like WildStar, but you're constantly using skills and dodging attacks which makes it very entertaining.

												Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn and Heavensward, a great game if you invest the time into it.  I began my Journey into Final Fantasy XIV a while ago, now with over 300+ hours invested, I feel that I can finally leave a decent review.  Final Fantasy has a bit of everything for everyone.  If you prefer to hang out with friends, make new friends, forge relationships, and become a leader....you can do that.  If you prefer to play alone and do your own thing, you can do that as well.  This is a monthly subscription based game and you have 2 membership levels that you can decide upon.  A $12 rank that allows only one character per server or a $15 rank where you can have multiple characters on multiple servers.  I choose the $12 rank as I only play as one character on one server.  The one character that you create is really all that you need.  You can be every class and hold every job as your own character.  If you would like to Tank, DPS, or Heal....you can do all of that by simply switching classes.  Need to apply materia? Need to chop a tree? or Need to make armor? Switch to the correct Job class and fire away.  The only thing that it will cost you is time.  You have to level up each class and job in order to become stronger and sell better items.  Money or Gil as called in game is needed but not necessarily a huge focal point in Final Fantasy XIV,  Gil will allow you to make purchases off of the Market Board (AKA Auction House for you WoW fans), purchase armor, weapons, and you will need some Gil to repair your gear.  Gear will erode after battling for some time and you also have to pay to transport to other areas.  Fighting is pretty straight forward.  Research your rotation for you class, stay out of attack circles, and make sure you attack whatever the tank is attacking while in Dungeon, Raid, or Guildquests.  Leveling up is fairly balanced and there are Levequests that you can obtain in areas to help you level up further and faster.  FC's (Free Companies) are the ""Guilds"" in Final Fantasy XIV.  It's worth finding a FC that you connect with.  This can save you time in que waiting on people for dungeons/raids/guildquests.  FC's also add a bit of entertainment value and comraderie.  You can make friends and hang out at the Free Company houses located in various safe zones.  All in all I recommend Final Fantasy if you're a fan or a MMORPG enthusiest.  The game is fairly balanced, constantly updated and a refreshing escape from World of Warcraft. Being able to play with a controller is a plus in book as well.  If you find yourself interested, I hope the information I've provided has been helpful and I hope to see you in the game!			"

												This is easily the best MMO I've played in years. The graphics are beautiful, the character creation is very in-depth, and it actually feels like you're involved in the combat instead of just sitting there tapping buttons until you fall asleep. The crafting system is unique and fun (albeit frustrating sometimes), too. If you get bored of questing, dungeoning, and crafting, you can go play games and race chocobos at the Golden Saucer, if you're so inclined. You'll never run out of things to do in this game.And if you're a roleplayer like me, Balmung has a huge and varied roleplay community--you're more than likely to find what you're looking for, no matter what your RP style is.The only thing I don't like about the game is the character creation restrictions. If a server is overpopulated, you can't make a new character on it, and have to wait until the populated is a bit lower, which is usually really early in the morning (if you're in America). This is a huge problem on Balmumg, which really stinks if you're looking for an RP server. Other than that, though, this game is great and totally worth the $15 a month.			"

												This is not the same FFXIV you tried before. Square-Enix went out of their way to redo the entire thing.This game is great for those of you that wished MMOs had cut scenes. At first the story seemed really bad but if you push through it is AMAZING. I'm not a PvE person. However, FFXIV's PvE has me hooked. The various ways you can level. Now they have an endless dungeon. It is just too good. On top of all this you must check out the Hildebrand quests. It will teach you the ways of a Gentlemen.			"

I WILL be back for Stormblood and I did not leave simply because I got bored with the game.  It's still fantastic and hands down my favorite themepark MMO.  Only thing that challenges it for my favorite MMO spot is EVE Online, and because they are so different I'm not even going to compare them.  Seriously, if you like MMOs this is one of the best ones out there.  Great community over on Cerberus (chaos data center, EU) so if you're EU I highly recommend Cerberus.

												I'm not an MMO guy, never have been. My only previous effort was getting a quarter of the way through the original Guild Wars and promptly stopping. I got FFXIV original, and like the vast majority of its userbase, despised it for its lack of effort and genral uncompleted state. I also am a longtime fan of the Final Fantasy series, however since XII had been steadily declining in praise for the series and how Square directed it. All these things meant that, while buying ARR on sale to give it one last chance, I was filled with a kind of half-dread.Imagine my surprise, then, when FFXIV single-handedly made me a proponent of MMOs, made me forgive the $70 I wasted on vanilla XIV, and restored my love in Final Fantasy and all that that means. A Realm Reborn has so much flavour, flair, and engaging gamplay that it's kept me obsessed for, frankly, far longer than any one game should. Its beautiful, lived-in world, mismash of Final Fantasy's most memorable concepts and motiffs, and liquid-slick skills-based gameplay has changed my thinking in regards to an entire genre! I can't recommend XIV: ARR enough. It's beautifully constructed and lovingly maintained, and despite its dark history, shines through to form an exemplary entry in a once-again exemplary series.

												Pros:- Great crafting system!- Great character costumization- You can pick all the classes you want on one character- Nice spell animations- Very addicting- FATES! -> World events, like you have in GW2- A lot of Final fantasy influences, you would definitely recognize if you've ever played Final Fantasy- Really nice graphics! :D- Housing system for guilds, and looks really awesome!Cons:- Long GCD ( global Cooldown ), makes the combat a little slow. ( Especially when you're used to WoW )- A lot of Cinematics not voice acted, which is a shame. ( Some are, but it is pretty annoying when you're in a cinematic and 50% is voice acted and the other 50% just text )- Long Grind- You wont really get good looking gear until higher levels- Dungeons que can be really long- Sometimes very overpriced AHOverall, this game is really great!It's very different from a lot of other mmorpg's, The one thing that still annoys me sometimes is the GBC, but that is just me. They do have PvP in the game, I havent tried it out yet, just because of that GBC problem, haha! 2,5 seconds is a bit too long for my taste. But the PvE is really nice!			"

Outside of the combat content you have your standard crafting clases/gathering classes. The slow and steady feel of the game is really nice besides that nothing in the game really stands out.

With a vastly superior plot and excellent soundtrack, a particular favorite of mine is the Black Shroud area which has a Secret Of Mana vibe to it.FF XIV is also far more accessable than most other MMO's and with the abilities to enjoy every single class with in the game on a single character means you don't have to worry about commiting to the unlikable  play style when you first begin.The only downside for me is the lack of voice acting and no doubt some would be put off by the subscription fees but when the updates are as big as they are and the quality is as high as it is I find it perfectly reasonable.I'll most likely update my review as I make more progress but for anyone who enjoys MMO's or is fond of the Final Fantasy universe, this is definitely recommended.

												Bought this months ago for $10.  Of all the MMORPGs I've played, this is the only paid one that I like.  I've only played free-to-play MMORPGS up to this point.  Shares some similarities with WoW, but is much better looking.  Main storyline is enjoyable in parts.  Quests are like you'd expect from an MMORPG, but not as taxing (instead of 'go kill 20 of this enemy', it's 'go kill 5, then talk to two NPCs')  Community is welcoming and helpful.  And if happen to be into role-playing, there's a vibrant community of that in here, as well.Kinda wish the Heavensward DLC wasn't silly expensive, tho.  Its next DLC, Stormblood, is coming next year, I think.FYI, monthly fee required.  If you want just one character per server, it's $12.99 USD ($17-ish CND).  If you want up to 8 characters per server, about $15-$16 USD (well past $20 CND)I'm on the Balmung server under the IGN Krick Etune.			"

												I've played this game for about 3 days now, and it's absolutely amazing. Please note these are my own personal opinions on the game, and I still have a large majority of the game to uncover.Pros-Breathtaking graphics.-Skill animations.-Roleplaying.-Replayability.-Story.-Inventory-Sountrack-Armor/MountsGraphics - Absolutely wonderful, especially for what is coming up to be a 5 year old game.Skill animations - Nice, fluid, look awesome; very eye appealing.Roleplaying - A large of roleplaying can be had in this game, especially with the requirement of a Forename and a Surname.Replayability - Literally 20+ classes you can all level up on one character and switch between, really awesome idea that works amazingly.Story - Super in-depth, and really worth-while taking your time on your first playthrough to explore the world.Inventory - Literally THE best inventory system I've ever seen in any game. Seperate inventories (literally 20+ slots) for every armor piece, then another 100 for junk/misc, and ANOTHER for quest items.Soundtrack - Beautiful sountrack from Square Enix, as is to be expected.Armor/Mounts - THE best plate armor I've ever seen, weapon designs make sense, along with some armor. Mounts look cool as ♥♥♥♥ as well. Great amount of custimization.Cons-Global Skillcooldown-Confusing at first-Map system-Teleportation is a bit odd-Learning curve-Voiceovers-Tab targetingSkillcooldowns - After every cast, whether instant or a 2-3 sec. cast time, you have a set amount of time before you are able to do another action. Feels a bit awkward at first, and still does right now, but something I disliked.Confusion - Game throws you in, no ♥♥♥♥s given, and it can be a bit overwhelming, take things one at a time and it'll get good.Map system - Feels clunky to use, hard to tell where some locations (i.e. exits, towns, quests) are.Teleportation - Teleporting feels like it should be done at ""Aetheryte Crystals"" allowing you to go anywhere, but they limit you to zones. Teleportation is done as a skill and costs money, just feels weird and unexplainable.Learning Curve - Big learning curve, but once you get over it, it's very rewarding.Voiceovers - Some of the most random cutscenes have voice overs, and ones that feel detrimental to the storyline have none. Just feels weird at times; inconsistent.Tab targeting - Tab targeting SHOULD (in my opinion) be the closest monster towards you, and it isn't. I don't understand the mechanics and it can cause unnecessary aggro on monsters due to misclicks.TL;DR - Great game with a bit of a hard learning curve. Worthwhile in the end. Fat Chocobo/10			"

												I bought his on steam just to review it. Currently sitting at around 5000 hours, this game still hasn't gotten stale. With a consistent update scedule (major patch every 3 months) it is absolutly worth the monthly fee. The game stays far away from P2W which the community has agree on, the only thing to purchase are cosmetic. (clothes for glamour, mounts ect.) While combat may feel a bit slow at lower levels, there is a huge curve to skill so both casuals and hardcores can enjoy the game thuroughly. Speaking of hardcore, if you are a raider this will challenge you more than most games can, with extremely well balanced savage mode raids.If you are a fan of Final Fantasy or MMOs as a whole do yourself a favour and pick it up. Level a character up to max level and dive into the amazing content. The community is one of the nicest, least toxic communities in MMOs (looking at you WoW).Enjoy! :)Edit: Do yourself a favour and buy this from the SE store, judging by all the negative experiences people have with the steam version. It also makes preordering expansions actually possible.			"

												A realm reborn is nothing like when final fantasy XIV came out, if you are one of the few who played it before they updated to current version it is a complete 360 in design, led by a talented team of developers and with great backgrounds. The work shows to attention to detail. If you played ffxi then you won't be disapointed, it does feel very diferrent but its another title in the final fantasy series. You have to give this a shot, I would look out for summer/thanksgiving,christmas sales, or wait near the time of final fantasy fanfest. even if you do pick up full price what your getting is a amazing mmo for as little as 12.99, i don't think you can watch a movie in the theater for that cheap unless its a special showing. it could even been cheaper if you pay yearly and they give you bonus items for staying subbed. I played ffxi to death and am working on this one now. I sometime visit ffxi but in our modern age those graphics feel old.			"

												Of all the MMOs I've  played, and I have played a good number of them, this is one that sticks out as the game that truly has kept me coming back for more after this much time.  On top of that, I've been playing MMOs for so long that I've played a good number of times with subs and non sub games and I sort of got burnt out on subbed games just because none of them seemed to keep my attention long enough to make the payment per month worth it.  In spite of that, FFXIV: ARR is one that I actually returned to even with a sub, because it is well worth the money.  More specifically, FFXIV is for one, a very beautiful game and although graphics alone cannot make a game great, it is a factor at least for me.  Even if a game has great gameplay without decent graphics I probably won't remain interested.  The opposite is true too but in the case of this game, it has good gameplay mechanics along with absolutely stunning graphics.  The stories, let's face it, many times a lot of mmo players skip through the dialog and story to get to more quests and level up fast and while I'll admit there is some of that with FFXIV, for the most part, I find myself interested in reading and enjoying the main story more than most other games of the same genre.  Aside from those things, the class system, the ability to learn multiple classes and the jobs are detailed and interesting enough to really make it stand out for me.  I love that the crafting isn't a simplifed style where it's just click and create like so many other mmos have done.  There is far more I can say about this game that I love but you get the gist of things I hope.  If you're an MMO fan, looking to try something new it is absolutely worth your time to at least give it a try.			"

												Closest you're ever gonna get to a truly solid MMO experience.  I came from TERA, i promised myself i'd never play a game with tab-target again.  But here I am, 150+ hours,  While questing you'll spend a lot of time blazing through quests, and for the most part, I didn't feel bored by the story, the combat was engaging, and he quest themselves were decently written and weren't tedious to manage or complete; my only complaint is one must resort to FATES once they hit hit that point of ""GOTTA GET TO 50 ASAP""Luckily endgame content in FF14 makes you work for your gear, but makes it easy to accomplish and is not a time sink (for the most part)One can attempt to hunt monsters with a full 8-man raid, along with many other raids to get specific currency to obtain that gear, and it takes a good 5 hours to get all that currency for decent gear to PREPARE for endgame content.  Once you're properly equipped you start facing many challenges that do take skill in your class, and communication with your party to accomplish, such as Hard Mode versions of boss fights in the story mode whilst you were leveling.  The main thing to note about this game is that it is very hard to NOT suck at your class, every class is incredibly unique, espcially when one is allowed to get a job (Specializing in that class role) but the game makes it very easy and simple to do a specific role without much screw ups, levels 1-49 preapre you with very brief 30-40 minute dungeons that give you a proper conditioning to be a healer, tank or get a sense of your DPS rotation, so you won't get your ♥♥♥ handed to you when you first start out.Free Company's are FF14RR's guild system, and it not only serves as your help hotline, it serves as your home as well... literally, FC's are allowed to acquire houses for all their members for a small payment of... 2 million gil.... >.>  and 10mil if you want a swag pad, FC's in turn give you plenty of leveling bonuses for new players, and the more new players do FATE's, the FC in-turn ranks up in their residing Grand Company of 3 Grand Companies.  Get this game, it's a full package, engaging story, plenty of customization (More hairstyles when you're lvl 20 C:), and traditional but SOLID gameplay.  You won't be dissapointed if you love MMO's.   "

												A fantastic breathtaking adventure from start to finish which of course is pretty much endless. From the great in depth create a character system to the job systems to the music graphics and virtually endless amounts and types of quests you will never have something not to keep you busy. Nothing really groundbreaking but then again if it ain't broke don't fix it applies here in regards to a great MMO experience. Good old fashioned addictive fun.			"

												Best P2P MMO I've played in recent years. Been a few months since I have played so this might not be completely accurate. Here are my positives (+) negatives (-) and neutrals (o).(+) All classes on one character, each levels individually, Mix and match (some) skills from one class to another. For example, if you plan to play a healer, ""Swift Cast"" from the offensive caster is absolutely required so you can revive people instantly.(+) This is the ultimate callback game for fans of the more classic Final Fantasy games, though you'll find a little bit from every game here. You probably don't need to be an FF fan to enjoy this, it stands up on its own mechanically. I would basically describe this game as ""WoW done better.""(+) Level scaling for Dungeons and FATES (Fates are over-world events that people can take part in as a community.) So no matter what level you are, you and your friends can play together. However, you cannot level scale on the overworld unless you're inside a FATE.(+) Party Finder. It works wonders, just queue up and do most anything else while you wait for a party to be automatically formed for a dungeon. You can also join overworld parties. Tanks and Healers will be matched quicker because they are not as commonly played, expect to wait if you are a DPS.(+) Glamour system, make any piece of equipment look like another. You can only unlock the ability to glamour at level 50, but people can do it for you before then. It IS possible to look like a classically colored Black Mage, if you have the currency for it.(+) Mechanically difficult and exhilarating bosses. Knowing how each dungeon and boss fight works before going in is essential to success. This is a double-edged sword, however, you could be stuck on a difficult fight, wiping multiple times with a pub party that doesn't know what they are doing. Sometimes it can get a bit too stressful, you'll always be on the razor's edge, late game. Different classes and roles are easier or harder to play, I wouldn't recommend rolling a tank for your first class. (+) Guilds, Guild Houses and Homes. I highly recommend finding a good guild, there are benefits to reap. Decorate your own Guild House, Personal House or Apartment Room inside your Guild House. You could make your own guild, but I recommend joining an existing one that has some legs and good community.(+) Chocobo Companions. Train a Chocobo to fight alongside you on the overworld, good for soloing. They can be mix-ups of Tank, Healer and DPS. Though the tank isn't all that good, last I heard.(+) Gold Saucer and Minigames! Gamble, collect cards and play tetra master across the world (love it or hate it), race Chocobos FF7 style, earn currency for rewards.(+) Retainers, get one of these as soon as you can, you get up to two for free. They act as your bank and you can send them out on missions to get items for you.(o) Crafting is still kind of a pain like most MMO's, you do not draw from resources directly from your bank like in GW2, so it's an inventory management headache, but there is money to be made and it's far from useless. Each crafting class works mostly the same, but each has some unique skills that can cross-class like combat classes do. Many of which are necessary. It's worth a try.(o) Arena and Mass-Scale PvP is available, though I can't comment on it since it's not my playstyle. EDIT: Recent update added 1v1 dueling.(-) Ability Icon Clutter, a carry-over from WoW. This can be mitigated with good macro building and UI customization management, though.(-) Main storyline isn't interesting until around level 50, which is max level before the expansion. Before that, there are some highlights, but it's mostly a slog through lots of political dialogue. Post vanilla is a vast improvement, though. Also, side story arcs are a lot better, for example, each class has its own story arc.(-) No cross-server play. If you have a max level character on one server, and your friend is on another, one of you will have to make a new character or pay money for a server transfer.			"

												The feeling when you're eating that delicious meal your grandmother cooked with love.That's what you get when playing this game.What trully distinguishes this MMO from other themeparks is the polish, the attention to detail, and the frequent content updates that it gets. It's a game you feel was done with care and is still being cared for.""FFXIV:A Realm Reborn"" stands completely in contrast to it's initial disastrous release ""FFXIV (2012)"".Naoki Yoshida trully pulled a ""Final Fantasy"" on this game, much like Square did with the original game in 1987 which ended up saving the company from bankrupcy.

												So let me start by saying I played this game on the ps3, and on the pc before it's launch on steam. - I'll start this review by saying the original concept was horrible... the game lacked so much and needed a complete overhaul. Well SquareEnix listened to the fans and brought in some familiar faces to help make this new Realm.So you create your character, the game has subscription, but it's definitely gorgeous and fun to play. The readded the summoner class which was my absolute favorite in Final Fantasy 11. You have a vast world to explore, to adventure in and the game is more suited for solo play along with parties. You can go do instances together, have a blast playing with friends or just even hanging around and chatting. Now there is some cons with this game.I don't like the instances as much in this game as i did in Final Fantasy 11. I also liked the auction house more in 11. I noticed there isn't any dlc for this game or if there is i didn't come across any. So im wondering if they are just updating the game like GuildWars2. So i will probably update this game more, but one of the biggest things i must mention is take advantage of the events they have. You get cool items and it's a very memorable experience.			"

												Decided to update my review, just because I love this game so much + my last one didn't do it justice. Going to break the main points down, so it's easier to read.GAMEPLAY: Like most MMOs, you have the holy trinity of dps, healer and tanks. In this game they are divided into classes, which can further specialise into jobs. Cross class skills are used, so lets say I'm a White Mage at level 60, I can use cross class to access some skills from other classes/jobs I've leveled. Classes/Jobs are also handled differently. Your character can switch between any of the classes/jobs as they get unlocked, allowing you to completely change your playstyle should you choose to in the future. There's even classes like Fishing, Blacksmithing or Alchemist if you want to work the markets, or help your Free Company build an airship! Gameplay is like most MMOS, except it can get quite challenging as you get to a higher level. IMO this game has some of the hardest content from any MMO out there. There's the typical ""Run around and quest"" style gameplay, you can do a main story, there's lots of little ""sub stories"", trials, dungeons, fates in which many people randomly team up to complete a mini objective etc. Gameplay wise the game definately isn't lacking. The actual combat is quite good, players aren't just taught to stand still and smash buttons. There's lots of movement during fights, as you move away from aoes, deal with specific mechanics to handle bosses and move to specific locations to help team memebers. Apart from the obvious leveling gameplay, there's a lot of other things to go and enjoy. There's sightseeing logs, hunting logs, Gold Saucer events + a lot more. STORY: What surprised me the most about this game is just how good the story is. Not just from an MMO perspective, but from a Final Fanasy one. Generally, it's put together really well. Ofcourse there are a few tedious bits, but for the most part it's extremely enjoyable. The story helps guide you to places you should level, introduces you to more of the world and characters in it. Another thing to note is how well some of the characters are built up throughout the story, you really get to know + like them. Again, content wise you're definately not short, especially with Heavensward just released. There's easily more than 50 hours of story content available at the moment, and the best thing is that it's constantly being added to through content updates. The story is split into mini chapter type things, some with overlaping issues, so certain issues don't overstay their welcome and it doesn't get stale. VISUALS + OST: This is a Final Fantasy game. Even people that haven't played Final Fantasy know that a lot of effort is usually put into these 2 areas, and it applies here. Visually, the game is extremely impressive, especially now with DX11 support. The zones and enemies are extremely diverse, filled with a true sense of imagination and thought put into them. The music complements each area well, with a great range of types used. Lots of different types of musical styles are used for certain situations, from J-POP, smooth jazz and heavy metal. Even if some music tracks don't fit your fancy, theres bound to be plenty more that will.ENDGAME:Decided to give this it's own section aswell, as most people are interested in this. There's a ton todo at end game. There's tons of dungeons, raids and extreme primal encounters you can fight for gear, mounts or glory. Some of these get extremely challenging, to the point that you'd need to form training parties to help train yourself + your team to beat an encounter. There's also a pvp arena, which I confess I haven't used, dailies through beat tribe quests or doing any of the logs I've mentioned above. OVERALL QUALITY: IMO The overall quality is just great. There's so much todo content wise, it's just unreal. With so many possible playstyles and things todo it's hard to not reccomened this to any MMO or Final Fantasy fan. I'd honestly reccommend it just for the story alone. This review really doesn't do it justice, so if you've read this and it's interested you I'd really reccomend watching some videos of it on youtube(Just don't spoil the story for yourself!) and checking out the free trial. Just be warned, this game is an absolute timesink that will steal your life.			"

												Where to begin?First off I am a huge Final Fantasy fan, I own and have played through every FF game to date. My alias is Mog and I typically go by Moogle Assasin7. That being said, this is my SECOND favorite FF title to date. Don't get me wrong though, I do have some gripes about this game which is why it's only my second fav.What you need to know about this game is that you have to buy it and it has a subscription (BOTH are required to play). I didn't realize this until my free trial ran out. Very dissapointed that they left that tidbit out of the discription. However, I still play because its awesome.Next is the game itself. Very repetitive... you tend to do a lot of the same stuff over and over. The trick is to mix up your game play and switch up your focus. There is a massive amount of story and there is always something to do. Voice acting is great. Plus the devs are constantly adding new content, which helps keep you engaged. Community is great, I have yet to have a problem with a single person. It's easy to drop in and out. This is nothing like FFXI, you CAN actually progress through the story line and you'll do it almost completely solo.I use a midgrade laptop that runs on windows 8.1 and it handles fine. (usually around 11fps) I know that isn't alot but this game doesn't require much. Biggest drain on fps is the hunts.Bottom line 9/10 for massive amout of content, easy to learn, hard to master, great story but repetitive. Totally worth the 15 bucks a month. Highly recommend.			"

												A damn entertaining game true to Final Fantasy themes. It does have a slow start and will most likely get some time getting used to, but after getting to around level thirty on your first class everything starts opening up. You're going to be confused, run around on foot, most likely get lost a lot, and fragged by enemies much higher in level than you when you leave familiar territory to go see that unexplored area at level ten.Oh, and FATEs. Watch for appropraite level FATEs. 9.5/10 "

												As far as MMORPGs go, FFXIV is not at the same level as it's main competitors. Yet. The world is still lacking in scope, the endgame needs more variation, and lots of features like player housing hasn't been implemented yet.But I still give it my wholehearted recommendation. The graphics are great, the content that IS there is really fun, the production values are as good as any MMORPG I've ever played, and I can't stop playing it. If you're the type of player who rushes through content, you may find yourself hitting a wall at some point, but if you dial it back to somewhere between ""hardcore"" and ""casual"", this game is a true gem. Heck, even if you DO breeze through it all, it is a game that grows with every patch, every content update, and every (eventual) expansion pack.The monthly fee might seem discouraging, but not since Final Fantasy XI (also an MMORPG) have I ever got so much playtime and content for my money. If you love Final Fantasy and MMORPGs, you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try.			"

												I have always been a fan of MMOs, from my early days of Star Wars Galaxies, City of Heroes/Villans, to Free to Play MMOs like Blade & Soul and Tera. For the longest time of my life i have been a stickler of pay to play MMOs in the current gaming age and I will tell you, as a guy who has played MMOs since he was about 12, THIS GAME IS WORTH THE SUBSCRIPTION! It has an engrossing story, worthy of a single player FF game, beautiful music, grand landscapes and plenty of things to do both solo and with friends and party members. Rarely will you meet anyone who can be considered a jackass until end game (which is currently level 60 with Heavensward) and the next expansion Stormblood is dropping in June. The combat can feel a little slow right now but SE says they are revamping it with Stormblood so we'll have to wait and see what it becomes. But, if you are looking to scratch that classic MMO itch, this game has 200+ hours worth of gameplay IN THE BASE GAME ALONE! NOT COUNTING HEAVENSWARD!!! If you are an MMO fan like I am, do yourself justice and give this game at least a try. There is a reason people hold this game in the same regard as WoW, it is the best MMORPG to release after WoW did, and that's saying something			"

												The MMO genre has seen several failed attempts in recent years, and only a few have managed to really shine. Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn manages to rise to the ranks of great MMOs like WoW Burning Crusade. Where do I start? Character customization is filled with hundreds of potential combinations. You could easily spend a good hour or so mixing and matching to find a character that suits your taste. You even get to give your character both a first and last name. You have your standard three main roles and classes that fit into them, but the brilliant part is that you can become all of them on a single character. Never more will you have to juggle resources and time between characters just to fill multiple roles, as you can simply switch whenever the need arises. Combat uses the standard auto-attack and skill system, but has plenty of actions that require you to pay attention and move around. Several enemies use AoE attacks and your character can gain damage bonuses depending on his attacking position. The graphics are stunning for MMO standards and add to the beautiful realm of Eorzea. The story is very strong within the game, but it doesn't fall victim to the problem of Tortanic where it was too single player focused. There is plenty to do between main quests, side quests, FATES, dungeons, and primal raids. And the crafting system even manages to be exciting through the unique crafting process. Trust me, I've gotten hyped about being able to make a boiled egg when it almost failed. While the subscription fee can be discouraging, this game provides quality that more than justifies it.			"

												The graphics on this game are amazing. It also scales well across old and new technology.I am a die-hard WoW fan, and will probably always play it on-and-off until it ends, but this game might be the first major MMO to catch my attention. It all just works. The first few levels are a bit disorientating, but after level 5 it starts to make sense. The community is also young (as the game is new) but very polite and helpful.There's a decent variety of classes to start off with, and those who hate alts will love that they can switch classes just by changing weapons after a certain point in the game. (Level 15?) WIth some hybrid classes only being available after you level two individual classes to 30/15 respectively. There's almost a guarentee of many many more classes coming over from the previous FFXI title. Ideally it would flesh out every primary class with two specialization choices-- like how Arcanist must choose between Summoner or Scholar. Classes famous from XI include: Samurai, Black Knight, Corsair, Theif, Red Mage, and Blue Mage.So far quests are varied and interesting, the enviroments are vibrant, and the world feels alive. I have not experienced any lag client or server side. If you like classic Final Fantasy, you'll love this game. It's a very solid title and worth a shot.			"

												This game has a great art style, awesome sound effects, and the game just looks amazing. The combat is smooth but it is a traditional MMO combat which is fine. The story is easy to follow and the side quests are decently entertaining. The skill system is epic and kind of remeinds me of runescape, you have your combat skills which you can level each of them up, you also have fishing, cooking, mining, smith and ect, that each have there own guild and you can practice any of them. So your aren't stuck with one class or job you can do what every you want.When you level up you just attain the skills no need to go buy them, there are some skills that requires a quest to use but I like this a lot better then some other MMO where you level up and then have to go buy the skill which was very annoying and usually just a waste of money.So all in all its a pretty basic MMO but I love it.

												I picked this up to give it a shot, having heard that the newer version was far improved over the original 1.0 release, and man am I happy I did. The game is gorgeous, entertaining, and does a fantastic job of pulling you into the narrative, and making you care about the npc characters. The ability to level all the classes on one character is a blessing and a curse, but overall I like the way it feels.Biggest downsides for me are the lack of chat bubbles, and the need to grind xp to finish the main story/cap your character once you surpass level 35. There's also a fair bit of gold spamming, and having to type out a ticket to report it every time is very tedious, especially compared to WoW's one button report spam feature.Overall, very happy with my purchase, and the ability to pay for subscription via the steam wallet. It's well worth $30 to give this a try and see if it's right for you!			"

												Yes. It is finally here. Final Fantasy 14, the next part in the ever-so-popular series isfinally out for the gamers of the world to enjoy. As for me, i was a bit sceptical about it at first, as i don't really like MMO's. But as a huge fan of FF games, decided to give it a shot. And believe me, i was not wrong. I was hooked right at the moment i entered the main menu: The guys from Square Enix managed to make even the menu look beautiful and soothing, accompanied with all-too-known musical theme. The graphics are amazing, even on the lower settings, and the landscapes are gorgeous and well-planned. The game itself has many clever designs, such as different view on crafting, dynamic battles, party and dungeon finders, daily quests, the all-new multi-class system.... Etc. Etc. And the game always manages to give you something new, more different things to keep you from getting bored. If you still have your doubts about giving your money monthly to play the game, then i will say you that: If you want a solid MMO experience with plenty of traditional FF goodness and recognisible characters - then think no further, just go and pay for it. You won't be dissappointed.			"

												I am not one usually to leave a review as I find other people have already spoken my opinions but I have been infuriated by the amount of crap I went through to try and play this game. Initial set up was easy - bought through steam, get game code. FFXIV makes you set up an account with Square Enix which is fairly normal for an online game. It takes the usual information like email address, screen name then your name and birthdate. Then your address, and a personal security question. Captcha's on every screen by the way, hard ones too. I do my usual thing of putting in crap because you don't need my damn address or birthdate. Then after that I log in, filling another captcha in as I go.This was around 2 years ago, I play the game and use up the free month before moving on and not playing again. However, recently I decided to start playing again as my friends have picked it up. Forgotten password, so go through that system of password recovery but it doesn't work. I recieve no email with reset details. So I try again, figuring I spelled something wrong. Nope, nothing. More captcha's each time too. Now, they do say it can take some time for the email to come through, and after ""considerable"" time waiting, to try again. 4 days later the email comes through but has an expiry time on it. If you don't click on the contained link within an hour of recieving it, it no longer works and you have to try again. And so I try again, this time it comes through 6 hours later when I am at work, I was lucky enough to be on a break and click the link. But it won't just reset my password, oh no. It wants my bloody birthdate, security answer and address. Ridiculous hard captchas on EVERY DAMN PAGE. Failing to crack my own answers I make a new account, a new email address to send information to and write everything down this time. Before stopping, putting my pen down and setting fire to the paper. The damn game has a registration key that links with the damn account. So I need to buy the game again. No thank you, enjoy your day.			"

												A lot has changed since I played so I'll change my review to reflect what I experienced in Heavensward and what I assume hasn't changed about the game. Dungeons: They're incredibly linear and shallow. Boss battles can be mechanically satisfying but the majority of your time is spent grinding mobs with a lot of health. There's really nothing fun or rewarding about them. You'll find yourself spamming queues for them in order to level up after the story stops leveling for you. All of these issues wouldn't matter too much if the combat this game has to offer was fun. There is nothing enjoyable about cooldown dependant combat. Especially if your class has buff micro-management. Raids and trials: Essentially giant sponges that have a long list of mechanics to memorize. You'll find your party wiping tons of times. Drops are rolled on so good luck getting what you wanted. There is nothing fun about completing the same battle over and over again. Why not add longetivity elsewhere? They're another aspect of the game negatively affected by the limitations of the combat system as well. Fates and hunts: Look, I know you want to give people a reason to revisit locations but collecting items and grinding mobs is not a good way to do it. Yet another aspect hindered by the combat system. PVP: It doesn't have much to offer, desperately needs more maps and more of an incentive to do them. You'll have to convert your friends to your grand company as well. Relic weapons: Probably the most boring, time demanding aspect of the game. Trust me, it's not worth the time and effort. Crafting: Literally useless for armor and weapons. Really just a tool for running the economy. Gathering: I'll admit, I like fishing. It's good when you just want to relax and take a break from what should be redundant. But the others, all you do is run around and press one button. Just WTF...Weekly capped gear: This is my biggest complaint about the game. There's gear that gets released with every update and you have to collect tomes by repeating already completed content in order to get them. By the time you have the set the next one is out so you feel like you wasted all of your time doing something boring and repetitive.IL: Item level, it's important as it dictates a lot about what you're able to do in this game. Forget skill, it's all about having the best gear in the game. That's why the game pulls in a lot of people with a superiority complex. Instead of getting better at the game through experience with the combat system, you get better by remembering patterns and getting a just as studied group to do raids all day (Or get the somewhat inferior capped gear)... Queues: Yep, you don't need any friends, play with random people from other servers.... Mostly easy stuff anyways. Story: Probably the only reason to play, ♥♥♥♥ endgame. So, do you want to do the same boring content over and over again for months just get better gear or do you want to play a game where every victory is rewarding and every challenge is engaging and satisfying?

												DO NOT buy the steam version of this game if you can. You'll be tied to only upgrading via steam and the steam price SUCKS. There's constantly huge sales on the regular PC version of FFXIV & Heavensward and you'll never be able to use non-steam keys once you purchase the game. You ALSO can't buy any of the physical collector's editions of the game - unless you want to buy the game multiple times. If you buy the physical collector's edition, it ONLY comes with a regular PC key, not a steam key. If you buy this game via steam, you're screwing yourself in the long run.As for the game itself; it is amazing and I absolutely adore it.

												Note that this is for the base game, not the game plus expansion.Pros: Loads of content, loads of stuff to do.  Easy to get into multiplayer content, incentives for veterans to help rookies out, storyline quests progress your levels quite efficiently.  Interesting crafting mechanic, no-fuss travel, lush scenery and classic Final Fantasy aesthetics.  Loads of punny quest titles and memes hidden throughout.  A marriage mechanic that does not restrict (or even ask questions about) gender combinations.  Multi-rider mounts so you can haul your friends around.  Tons of quests and collections, a completionist's dream.Cons: Extremely technical, precise, minmax-y and a lot of poor communication, both between the game and the player and between player and player.  Terribad voice acting, overly flowery and verbose script, a plot that is hamfistedly dramatic and full of predictable and frustrating tropes, ugly ""basic"" gear practically until max level with few to no alternate options.  Gear-gated content and rng-based gear acquisition (this is a con, to me, take that as you will.).  Story quests force you to solo content, even in a game where no class is built to safely run solo.  Passive-aggressive elitism in the community.I ran out of game time, and I won't be renewing it.  This game is not for gamers who play games to have fun.   This is an MMORPG that is designed for people who feel good about themselves by getting very good at, or completing, extremely difficult or complicated content.   I'm not what one calls a ""hardcore gamer"" and thus the restrictive, overly specific Holy Trinity of RPGs gameplay left me feeling drained more than refreshed.  After failing a solo story quest duty five times in a row, and finding that I was doing everything right, I just simply should've gotten hit less, I decided I wasn't the kind of player Square-Enix had in mind when developing this game.I'm told Heavensward is much better story and much nicer mechanics, but if you can't even make it to the Heavensward  expansion's content, which begins only after you've completed your entire A Realm Reborn story quest, it's not worth even the cost of the base game.  I'm not going to muddle through a difficult, unsatisfying and frustrating game just in the hopes that I can pay more money to see if the expansion is more to my liking.I game to have fun, not to hate myself.

												This is certainly a decent MMO, one of the better ones currently available, however, I find I can't recommend it.I really wanted to love this game, and the crafting was really great...at least until you got into higher level stuff.  It was with great sorrow that I realized that the higher tiers of crafting had some bizarre, invisible-except-for-certain-times-of-day mechanic putting my happy gathering spree to an immediate, screeching halt.  I understand the need to make things rare in order to maintain the economy, but seriously?  Faced with the choice of standing, waiting for hours for a single node to spawn or buying it from the market, buying it from the market seems a much better choice, at least, until you see the prices, and realise that it would take you just as many hours of harvesting regular things to sell to afford one.  I suppose this is 'balance' but it certainly wasn't fun, and crushed my hopes as a crafter.The game will also 'force' you to participate in queue-for-group dungeon content to advance your main story quest, and I found unless you queued as tank or healer, you'd be waiting sometimes hours for a group (which may or may not even stay together to finish the dungeon!) just to advance your main, storyline quest.  I eventually made it to the end, but after that I was left with just a sense of overall disillusionment.  Add that to the pointlessness of the crafting at higher tiers, and well...As I said, it is one of the better MMOs out there, but I don't feel it has anything for the 'long haul' - unless you fancy queueing for groups and sitting afk at node spawn points for months on end, which ultimately killed it for me.  Perhaps if you have unlimited playtime to do the time-sink routine it'd be worth a play.			"

												FINAL FANTASY® XIV: A Realm Reborn™(My hours in-game are not representative as I have played the game off steam a lot longer)If I had to describe the game in one sentence: ""One of the best MMORPG's out there, beautiful, challenging, complete!""""In the beginning there was Final Fantasy XIV, and it was not good. For most games, the story would’ve ended there. But Square Enix, perhaps feeling that its prized franchise's name was in danger of becoming too literal, undertook a mammoth effort to keep Final Fantasy’s legacy from being marred by such a disaster. Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is the resulting do-over, and it’s a huge success on PC, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4. Beautiful, fun, and only a bit uneven in the late game, this dramatic reinvention easily establishes itself as one of the most sincere and effective apologies in gaming history."" - IGN""The juggernaut Final Fantasy XI grew into was a tough act to follow, but no one predicted such a spectacular failure. Square Enix took note and responsibility and made a resolution to learn from its past mistakes, releasing Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn as a ""rebirth"" of sorts for the massively multiplayer online role-playing game that could. It has used its own personal Phoenix Down to come back fully revitalized, and the gorgeous new MMORPG is now a bustling world filled with curious players ready to get lost in it."" - GAMESPOT""Final Fantasy XIV Online, massively multiplayer online role-playing game — an MMO barely alive. Square Enix rebuilt it. They had the technology. They had the capability to build the world's first relaunched FF title. A Realm Reborn is that game. Better than it was before. Better, stronger, faster."" - KOTAKU""Final Fantasy XIV Online was a unique experience.""""Supreme. The best MMORPG""""Can't stop playing!"" - FansIf my opinion has any value, FFXIV Online is a great game from many aspects. I do not like getting into gameplay details. That is part of the fun in discovering a new game. It is game that will continue to grow and I recommend it without any doubt!Take it easy!!			"

												I am not an avid MMORPG player, but this game definitively gets me going. I love the depth of the story, which I lay huge thought on when I play games. The actual things you do in quests is more or less the same as in any other MMORPG, kill quests, place item quests, talk-to-someone quests, but this is compensated by the great story. I'd say do not play this game if you plan on not reading the story.			"

												This game has to be my favorite of all time, there is constant updates to insure1: Quality, they always keep the gaming working extremely well, with little to no issues ever.2: Content, there is always something to do, with major content drops every 2-3 months.If you enjoy pve, this is definitely a great game, with high end (slightly low accessibility) raid tiers if thats what you are into.  There is also excellent crafting and gathering.  The only real negative is the pvp.  Its there, and they said they are going to continue to refine it, but it just doesn't feel right, some find it fun, but it is different from person to person,			"

												I don't have an extreme amount of hours but I feel like I have a decent amount to write a review for it. I have been hunting for a good MMO for a very long time. I came across this game before and to be honest it was a little different than most MMO's that I have played and I was a little confused with how everything worked so the first month I just got scared off and went to hunting again. Months later I said you know what I'll give it another shot, I actually took some time to get through the game and I currently have a level 50 Monk and 45 Ninja. This MMO is absolutely phenomenal if you just give it a chance. Almost every MMO I have tried in the past year+ I have just left after a couple days but this game I cannot get away from. There are so many things to do in this game and the Community is honestly the best I've had in an MMO. You don't get punished or talked down to for doing bad or messing something up 99% of the time, people understand you are new and would rather teach you through it so you know for next time and guide you on what to do and what not to do while playing in a Dungeon, or just playing your class in general. For a pay to play title it is very much worth the money to get. If you don't believe me just read the reviews with the players that have over 5000+ hours. But this is coming from someone fairly new to the game so I have a solid say as I am not end game yet, but from what I have heard the end game gets even MORE addicting! Which I am excited about.Pros:- This game is BEAUTIFUL for it's age, honestly it's absolutely amazing- The Community is great from what I have experienced so far, last community in a game I found so great was City of Heroes- The STORY, I won't mention anything in the Story itself but, The beginning there is no voice overs but as you go along there's actual Voice Dialogue and it's GOOD- SO Many Classes, and you can swap classes ON THE FLY, one character can be all classes at once, no need to make a new character for each class- Cross Class Skills - High level players can play with lower levels in the low level dungeons at any given time! So you can jump in and help with anyone new you play with- The Classes are actually COMPLEX, you don't just sit there and button mash your best skills, you have rotations and you play the class how it is MEANT to be played unlike most games- CONTROLLER SUPPORT, ALSO THIS GAME IS CROSS PLATFORM WITH PS4- The music is awesome and helps the game feel like a Final Fantasy Game- Some Dungeons bosses actually have moves you gotta learn to dodge and mechanics you gotta learn in order to complete it successfully without wiping, making it more fun than just tank and spank. Not EVERY boss has mechanics though- The game gradually teaches you how to play your role with class specific quests, and a novice training hall for your role- Fat ChocoboCons:- WE NEED MORE TANKS AND HEALERS- The quests can get a tad bit repetitive but trust me you'll get through them- Not as much of a casual sit back and play game, you need all attention if you wanna do good in the end game content- Early on the game feels really slow and trust me I felt it, but when you gain more skills and get to farther content you won't feel as bad- Glamouring your items (aka: reskinning your armour to make your own look requires you to be level 50)- Inventory is too small in my opinion- RMT SpamMixed:- Side Quests are almost necessary your first time playing through, if you don't do it you will be underlevelled for some of content and will have to grind out Mobs/Fates/Etc- Crafting can be complex to some plays, you either really enjoy it or you tend to push away as far as possible fromNote that there are a lot more I can list for both Pro's and Con's but I honestly can't think of anymore on the top of my head. This game is Amazing in my opinion and is my favourite MMO at this point. I will update if I can think of anything else though!Give it a shot guys I highly recommend it.Note: I have not even accessed Heavensward yet so this is solely based on A Realm Reborn!			"

												This is my fave mmorpg.

It will be a great boost and will make your time worth much more. I am not saying it is boring alone, no no.

FFXIV: A crafter's review.Note: My time-played is actually about half of my actual time-played, as I tend to launch the game through the base launcher instead of Steam. Steam says I don't have any time played this week which is... Laughably inaccurate. FFXIV isn't like other MMOs. Some reviews will focus on its amazing ability to keep a Final-Fantasy quality of story despite being an MMO. Some will rave about the spectacular Armory and Class system. Me? I'm a crafter. And hoo boy, does this game deliver.FFXIV doesn't limit you to one class in combat, and that thankfully extends to crafting as well. If you want to dabble in alchemy and weaving? You can do that. Decide you want to make some pretty jewelery? You can do that too with no penalties to your other classes. This game not only allows you to level every crafting class you please, it also offers some useful shortcuts for levelling in the form of levequests and, later on, collectibles. These systems reward you for striving towards quality in your crafts, instead of mindlessly grinding. And speaking of quality? The crafting system itself is amazing. FFXIV does not have a one-click crafting system like most other MMOs. Each class has abilities and rotations, similar to what you would see in a combat class. Some would argue (and I would agree) that the crafting in this game requires more strategy than the combat. So if you love to relax and make things for other people, or make some hefty profits playing the markets, this game might just be for you. To illustrate: I have exactly two combat-oriented classes at 60, and they really only count as one for this purpose as they both level with the same exp bar (Summoner and Scholar). On the other hand, I have every gathering profession (botany, mining, and fishing) maxed, and every crafting class nearly at cap. I just really, really enjoy the crafting system. It's hands-down better than any other MMO I've played. If you're ever on Balmung, feel free to hit up Lilligan Freshwater!			"

												Logged in, made my character was surpised to find this was the one MMO i've played where i could make a character that came closest to my IRL appearance (slightly different colored green eyes), started playing, immediately drawn into the story (rarely happens in an MMO for me) decide to Rp regularly on the character i made. Several hours i got tired and decided to go to sleep, so i go the the inn, request a room, and hop ni the bed to log off. Yes, your read that right, your charcter can go to sleep in a bed to log off. ABSOLUTE BEST method to log off in an MMO i've ever seen, which is why i always do it, even made an outfit specifically for going to sleep before logging off.			"

												If you like MMORPGS look no further, for you have found the game and the series that is the god of RPGS, FFXIV: A Realm Reborn offers a massive online role playing game that still holds onto a soild story mode quests as along with great side quest, it offers Free Companys which act as clans or guilds if you'd say, the graphics and controls are perfect along with great battle mechanics. i suggest evenif you dont like RPGS or MMO's to still give this a try because i used to not love these kind of games but one game can make a difference and with all the games that Final Fantasy has produced you will forsure have hour and hours of fun with the titles. hope this helpped anyone!.

												FINAL FANTASY® XIV: A Realm Reborn™(My hours in-game are not representative as I have played the game off steam a lot longer)If I had to describe the game in one sentence: ""One of the best MMORPG's out there, beautiful, challenging, complete!""""In the beginning there was Final Fantasy XIV, and it was not good. For most games, the story would’ve ended there. But Square Enix, perhaps feeling that its prized franchise's name was in danger of becoming too literal, undertook a mammoth effort to keep Final Fantasy’s legacy from being marred by such a disaster. Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is the resulting do-over, and it’s a huge success on PC, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4. Beautiful, fun, and only a bit uneven in the late game, this dramatic reinvention easily establishes itself as one of the most sincere and effective apologies in gaming history."" - IGN""The juggernaut Final Fantasy XI grew into was a tough act to follow, but no one predicted such a spectacular failure. Square Enix took note and responsibility and made a resolution to learn from its past mistakes, releasing Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn as a ""rebirth"" of sorts for the massively multiplayer online role-playing game that could. It has used its own personal Phoenix Down to come back fully revitalized, and the gorgeous new MMORPG is now a bustling world filled with curious players ready to get lost in it."" - GAMESPOT""Final Fantasy XIV Online, massively multiplayer online role-playing game — an MMO barely alive. Square Enix rebuilt it. They had the technology. They had the capability to build the world's first relaunched FF title. A Realm Reborn is that game. Better than it was before. Better, stronger, faster."" - KOTAKU""Final Fantasy XIV Online was a unique experience.""""Supreme. The best MMORPG""""Can't stop playing!"" - FansIf my opinion has any value, FFXIV Online is a great game from many aspects. I do not like getting into gameplay details. That is part of the fun in discovering a new game. It is game that will continue to grow and I recommend it without any doubt!Take it easy!!			"

												I've played quite a few MMORPG's, and Final Fantasy XIV is one of the best I have ever playedDuring the content draught in World of Warcraft during the Warlords of Draenor expansion, I decided to give this game a shot and it was totally worth it! Though, this game is different from other MMO's as in there is a 2 second Global Cooldown, which may take some getting used to if you've played lots of other MMO's, another thing that is different is that their is a huge emphasis on story. In order to unlock dungeons/raids/etc. you HAVE to do the Main Story Quests. For example, once you get to level 50, you aren't able to just immediantly hop into the Heavensward expansion, you have to do the rest of the quests from the vanilla game, including quests that were added in patches. It may seem like it kinda sucks, but it really isn't bad and I personally enjoyed it, though I will admit that this isn't for everybody.(Note: I only have 8 hours of gameplay because I originally played the non-steam version of the game, but then bought it on Steam so that I could track gametime.)

												This MMO is a lot of fun, and the setting, storyline, and graphics are great. The group finder is a nice addition and makes finding groups for dungeons and raids very simple. The class/job system is very unique, and you can level all classes and jobs up on one character. This can be very useful since there are a lot of cross-class skills that you can use as well, though I split them across two characters, mostly for RP reasons. I enjoy the crafting system the most, with its own skills that you utilize while crafting, trying to increase the quality of the item while not failing to create said item. I'd recommend giving it a try, at least. Just keep in mind that you cannot link a retail-bought game to your Steam account, and vice-versa; this has caused a lot of confusion and isn't well-stated.

												Oh how long it has taken for me to actually recommend this game.I would be embarrased if this thing would show my playtime with PS3 too. :PWould probably be going around 10k. '-' I think I am being too humble with my playtime guesses.So I started playing this game almost right after 'A Realm Reborn' had come out and it has been nice to see this game improve so much and even nicer to see that it has improved from the flop of an original Final Fantasy XIV.I will go through cons first, because they were easier and shorter to list:- Leveling can be quite annoying and slow (if you aren't into grinding a lot)- Combat can feel like you are spamming the same abilities all the time. Exception to this are usually highend raids.- If you aren't into crafting things or gathering materials, you will probably have a hard time earning gil (money)- Even though the class system is really nice, it feels like some of the classes are better than others in the sense of outgoing damage.- Damage dealers (DPS) usually have to wait really long (around 10-30 minutes usually) to get in to a dungeon or a raid unless you have a premade team. (this is not the games fault to be honest, just too many people as DPS)- Quests are usually boring. Exception to this are ""unique quests"" that have cutscenes or something different than the usual 'fetch, gather, kill' quests.That's all I can think of.Pros will probably be much longer, because I have so many good things to say:- NOT A PAY-TO-WIN GAME. <3 Pay-to-play tho- Graphics are really beautiful- Class system is really nice. You can change from healer to tank to damage dealer anytime you want to.- Really beautiful world... like one would expect from a Square Enix game.- Races are really diverse. You can be a kitty, dragonish person, tiny midget baby, an elf as tall as a building, a wall-like orc or just a meh human.- Dungeons are really pretty and primals (standalone bosses) look really interesting. There's a boss that looks like a stone... made out of stone.- I forgot to mention music early on, so let's just add it here. Music is really beautiful. Opening scenes have the best songs imo.- Big updates about every 2-3 months, little updates like some quests about every month.- You can magically make your ugly costumes beautiful... or your beautiful costumes ugly. You do you.- You can gamble. Tho it's not as addictive as FFXIII-2's slotmachines. :P- Specified Limit Breaks for every damage dealing class look awesome. If you are a healer left alone with your team dead and your team has full lvl 3 limit break, you can bring everybody back to life with full health. Not broken.- You can be lazy and do level 30 dungeon with level 60 character solo to get loot for my other classes. B)I am too lazy to write more pros, but maybe someday I will finish this list.Anyway, if you are thinking of buying this game... BUY IT.If you are thinking of moving from a console to Steam version like I did... DO IT. Much easier to get playtime or other cosmetic stuff.			"

												there are many fun things to do in Final Fantasy XIV Online: A Realm Reborn, Heavensward patch 3.4 Soul Surrender but to tell you the truth not all of them are fun; one time I was arrested by the Eorzean police department for fishing without a fishing permit and had to answer some moogle trivia, unfortunately I had been slacking on my moogle dailies and couldn't answer correctly so I had to go to jail.the duty finder feature is excellent, as a dragoon player I have to wait around 10 minutes for each dungeon queue to pop so I have plenty of time to make a sandwich, which begs the obvious question of 'how do I have enough time to eat it'? Thankfully as a dragoon player I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ I am doing and will spend most of the instance dead so I have plenty of time to eat.some people may be turned off by the fact that you have to pay a monthly subscription in order to play this game but I can assure you, thanks to the beneficial effects of the sunk cost fallacy you will spend too much time convincing yourself that it's worth it to even consider unsubbing!all in all a truly excellent game, thank you yoshi p 10/10 i love content AND japan			"

A great storyline, you feel like you are the hero, and that you actually make a difference. It also has a great soundtrack that just takes you straight into the world of final fantasy. And ofc you cannot forget the graphics, it is just awesome and pretty AND I am too tired to actually do this, so I guess I will write a much better review later on that actually makes more sense.

												I do not have much experiences with this kind of MMO, nor with MMO in general, as the only two MMO Games I played so far are Vindictus and Wakfu. The Gameplay in itself is not that exiting from the perspective of somebod who prefers either mor heavily action based games or Games that focus more on strategy. As a Mage you get a bunch of Skills that mostly do nothing more than some Damage and set a global cooldown, as a healer you also get a few skills that heal as well as a skill that changes your stance between healer and DPS stance. Crafting is quite unique as far as I can tell as it involves you using skills to improve your chances in getting a high quality product. The weakest point of this game is the Leveling system. You get a main quest line that developes your main role (the first one you picked) alongside itself, so that you always have the appropriate level for the next Main quest. However after a certain Level you open up all other classes for your character to choose from, all starting att level 1. If you did not need one side class to progress your main class above level 30 and some key skills from certain other classes for your main class, this would not be a problem, but the number of sidequests that are available as well as the EXP they give is quite low, so that leveling comes down to grinding overworld events that most of the time are minutes appart from each other. Thats not talking about the leveling of gatherer classes which is litterally grinding stuff you do not need and can't even sell because all the other gatherers have already oversaturated the market. Also most of the quests are rather boring, as they mostly consist of ""Kill x local mobs"", ""Talk to somebody far away"" or ""Give person x this item"". I can remember one Main storyline quest where I had to talk to the same guy 5 times as he ran away and respawned about a minute of walking time away each time in an area where mobs that aggressive mobs where quite common. So why do I recommend this game?Well, at first, once you reach lvl 15 with any class you open up Dungeons with this class. Those are just really fun and well designed. Really, there is not much else I can say about it. The player roles are handled well and each class and roll feels useful in every dungeon I played so far. No mandatory tutorial. There is one, but I never saw it. That's something more games need to do. The difficulty curve is crafted exceptionally well (at least up to level 30) so that you pic up all the skills necessary as you progress through the game. And finally the Community. As a new player you are marked with a sapling next to your name. Also the game actively encourages skilled players to help newcomers. Where in most other games  most people dislike playing with a noob, in FF XIV you get the feeling that most do like teaching new Players the techniques of the game. There is a newby network where new players can ask questons to skilled players and I have always got accurate answers right away. The playerbase is friendly and encouraging. Nobody rages when your mistake in a dungeon has your group repeat a boss fight. Thats what Multiplayer games should be like. Therefore, I give my full recommendation to anybody who likes MMO and is looking for one with a great communityTL;DR:PROS:- one Character, All the classes- Crafting- cross class skills- great difficulty curve- good dungeon design- nice story for an MMO- AMAZING COMMUNITY!CONS:- early game fights are rather boring- a lot of boring or annoying quest- secondary classes need level grinding			"

												It's an awesome MMORPG that surpases WoW in several ways. Initially my girlfriend pestered me to play with her and eventually I said okay about the beginning of 2016. I had planned to only play it while I was playing with her, but after a few times of playing I was hooked and couldn't put it down! I played for a good 10 months before I got burnt out and needed a short break. I had games piling up on my xbox that needed to be played lol. I will be back for the Stormblood expansion for sure! Although it may be subscription based, it is fairly cheap and so worth it! Continuous updates and content and an awesome community! Highly recommend!			"

												Of all the MMORPGs out there, Final Fantasy XIV has one of the most in-depth, incredible stories. This is the closest to its roots Final Fantasy has felt in many years, and I highly recommend it. Between character customization and the main story quests, there is plenty of content that non-MMO players can play with little to no need for other players interference. And for those who like the social aspect, there are Free Company's (guilds), lots of dungeons, and an amazing community of players from around the world looking to have fun and make friends. All in all, this is an amazing game, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a golden years Final Fantasy experience.			"

												As someone who hasn't really given MMOs a fair shot as a genre due to not having a huge interest in it from the get-go and being a bit skeptical of pay subscription models, I am very glad that I was talked into picking this up by a friend. It is by far one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played, and having only picked up the game last week (at time of writing), the 27.8 hours that I already have logged in should be considered as a good indicator of just how enjoyable this game is, and how easy it is to be entralled in the universe that is Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. Due to my inexperience with the genre, perhaps I lack the keen eye to be able to spot what makes an MMO truly great. But as a newcomer to the genre, and perhaps yourself too being on the fence on whether to try this MMO out, hopefully my words are relatable and equally as helpful as those who are veteran MMO players: Pros: - Stunning visuals;- Class Fluidity (being able to change classes on the fly; not having to worry about being pidgeon-holed into a class forever);- Many classes and subclasses to choose from; variety ranging from combat, magic, trades, and artisan roles;- Engaging storyline; - Free 30-Days game time for newcomers;- Very healthy population for a game that is already 3 years old;- New content, patches and expansions still being released by developers (new expansion coming in 2017 for e.g.)- Good guild support (in the game they are known as 'Free Companies');- Party System to play with friends;- Support for both Mouse and Keyboard, and Gamepad play; - Player-run economies (nice bit of micro-economics between players if they wish to use their classes to develop products/ items and sell to others in order to make a bit of money. Also makes for good banter between friends); - Nice balance of PvE and PvP content - you can quite easily enjoy both or pick one or the other if that's what you prefer.Cons: - Voice acting is a little lacking but otherwise great; there will be times often enough where you are just reading lines of text which can be a bit boring and/or skippingly tedious;- Game is arguably and substantially more enjoyable with friends than it is without.

												Final Fantasy XIV is a good game. Visually it looks amazing and the gameplay is really fun. However there are a couple things that take it away from being at the top spots for MMO's i've played. Firstly the world size, although there are plenty of zones to explore they are all instanced. This means to go between each zone requires a loading screen which doesn't seem that bad but there also 2 areas in each major city meaning you have to load every time between them. Also unlike other MMO's the zones feel rather restricting. By that I mean that there's a set area you can walk in and there's a lot of predetermined areas you can't walk over where its just an invisible wall all the way around the object instead of letting you freely explore over it. This is minor really but it makes the world feel smaller.Secondly questing. Before you can move on in the game at all you must complete the Main Story Quests with over 180 between level 1 and 50. Once at 50 you have to play through exactly 100 more quests before you can even enter or use anything heavenward related. The quests still continue after that currently going post 60. This quest system isn't bad but after getting to 50 you have to spend way to much time going through pointless quests unless your interested in the storyline.Now that aside it is a really fun game. It has a fun class system which allows you to have 1 of every class on one character allowing you to switch between them when your not busy. Each of them requiring its own leveling. This system means that your not tied to one class and allows ou to play what's needed at the time. The boss fights are really fun with the Sync system meaning even people higher level than the boss will be synced with gear and level to help you so you get a more rea experience as to what it was like to do it when it was first released. Lastly just look at this game it looks stunning and that's all that has to be said on that.I would recommend this game.			"

												I don't have an extreme amount of hours but I feel like I have a decent amount to write a review for it. I have been hunting for a good MMO for a very long time. I came across this game before and to be honest it was a little different than most MMO's that I have played and I was a little confused with how everything worked so the first month I just got scared off and went to hunting again. Months later I said you know what I'll give it another shot, I actually took some time to get through the game and I currently have a level 50 Monk and 45 Ninja. This MMO is absolutely phenomenal if you just give it a chance. Almost every MMO I have tried in the past year+ I have just left after a couple days but this game I cannot get away from. There are so many things to do in this game and the Community is honestly the best I've had in an MMO. You don't get punished or talked down to for doing bad or messing something up 99% of the time, people understand you are new and would rather teach you through it so you know for next time and guide you on what to do and what not to do while playing in a Dungeon, or just playing your class in general. For a pay to play title it is very much worth the money to get. If you don't believe me just read the reviews with the players that have over 5000+ hours. But this is coming from someone fairly new to the game so I have a solid say as I am not end game yet, but from what I have heard the end game gets even MORE addicting! Which I am excited about.Pros:- This game is BEAUTIFUL for it's age, honestly it's absolutely amazing- The Community is great from what I have experienced so far, last community in a game I found so great was City of Heroes- The STORY, I won't mention anything in the Story itself but, The beginning there is no voice overs but as you go along there's actual Voice Dialogue and it's GOOD- SO Many Classes, and you can swap classes ON THE FLY, one character can be all classes at once, no need to make a new character for each class- Cross Class Skills - High level players can play with lower levels in the low level dungeons at any given time! So you can jump in and help with anyone new you play with- The Classes are actually COMPLEX, you don't just sit there and button mash your best skills, you have rotations and you play the class how it is MEANT to be played unlike most games- CONTROLLER SUPPORT, ALSO THIS GAME IS CROSS PLATFORM WITH PS4- The music is awesome and helps the game feel like a Final Fantasy Game- Some Dungeons bosses actually have moves you gotta learn to dodge and mechanics you gotta learn in order to complete it successfully without wiping, making it more fun than just tank and spank. Not EVERY boss has mechanics though- The game gradually teaches you how to play your role with class specific quests, and a novice training hall for your role- Fat ChocoboCons:- WE NEED MORE TANKS AND HEALERS- The quests can get a tad bit repetitive but trust me you'll get through them- Not as much of a casual sit back and play game, you need all attention if you wanna do good in the end game content- Early on the game feels really slow and trust me I felt it, but when you gain more skills and get to farther content you won't feel as bad- Glamouring your items (aka: reskinning your armour to make your own look requires you to be level 50)- Inventory is too small in my opinion- RMT SpamMixed:- Side Quests are almost necessary your first time playing through, if you don't do it you will be underlevelled for some of content and will have to grind out Mobs/Fates/Etc- Crafting can be complex to some plays, you either really enjoy it or you tend to push away as far as possible fromNote that there are a lot more I can list for both Pro's and Con's but I honestly can't think of anymore on the top of my head. This game is Amazing in my opinion and is my favourite MMO at this point. I will update if I can think of anything else though!Give it a shot guys I highly recommend it.Note: I have not even accessed Heavensward yet so this is solely based on A Realm Reborn!			"

												I have too much love for this game to be able to summarize it in words. It's an MMO with story, fantastic music, adventure, epic battles even at lower levels, deep combat, plenty of good humor, and enough weeaboo garbage for everyone. If you're looking for any of these things, Final Fantasy XIV has it all in spades, with longevity to boot. This game never gets old. The monthly sub fee is 200% worth it. And if you're a long time fan of the franchise like me, you'll enjoy this game all the more. Such a pure gaming experience. Please, try it.			"

												Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn is a new version of the original game, just called Final Fantasy 14 Online, which came to be considered a complete failure. The title, available for PS3 and PC, did not disappoint in his recovery and has met the expectations of fans.  Realm Reborn is a very appropriate name for the game, as he was redone from scratch and this is already felt in its first minutes. Not just the game system, but also its history, characters and operation. Even those who were at advanced levels in the previous version here returning from scratch, entirely renovated.And so resumes the story of Eorzea, where goes the adventure. Entitled to reset characters and a new mythology, the player gradually gets involved in the action and drama lived by this world. Arriving with his hero in a city, out of nowhere, it needs to give their all to be recognized as someone of value.The character creation system is well done and complete. Even in the PS3, with commands totally focused on the joystick, it is possible to find and not get lost in the confusing menus. The game does not disappoint in this initial step and is quite complete in everything from races options the initial classes, through appearance setting.The introduction also fulfills its role well, with a story narrated in the third person and scenes breathtaking, setting the stage for what the player must face over the next few hours - and they are many. As a true MMORPG, Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn has a lot of content.As in any game genre, the evolution of the characters is due to the missions to be accomplished and advanced levels. Here the experience levels are back (remember they are gone in Final Fantasy 13?), Then the progression is natural. At each level, new skills and more news are unlocked, but there are some surprises.The first is the possibility of moving level with each class available in the game and others that can be enabled. Unlike other online RPGs, it is not necessary to create several characters to test other classes of heroes. Here you can simply decide that tired of being warrior and changing careers, becoming mage or archer. Of course, this will reset the level that chosen profession, but the former remains.This kind of change only adds personality of A Realm Reborn, striving to be a MMORPG different from the others, even though some follow successful trends - such as own missions. Fortunately the class system works very well, recalling the classic Final Fantasy Tactics at times - after all, many professions require various levels in others and so on, just as you learned in PlayStation 1.In fact, much in the Realm Reborn seems to have been inspired by previous games in the series. Elements ranging from the class system up to some spells, elements, materials and so on. Overall, the game risks trying to please enough who is long-time fan, although it can be availed by those who favor recently.We will not lie, the gameplay of Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn fit like a glove to the game. Everything is very well fitted both on the PC, as the PS3. Play on either platform is a rewarding experience, which is even more impressive for console users.It is worth mentioning that everything works well in DualShock 3 control, and even the PC version is fully compatible with an Xbox 360 control plugged into the computer. Commands are natural, menus can be easily accessed and attacks are activated easily, quickly and accurately, as a struggle requires.This type of adaptation is played master of Square Enix, since the game can be availed on both platforms with just one account. Unfortunately you have to buy it twice, once on the PC and one on the PS3, to play with them, but later the first month tuition - $ 15 every 30 days - goes for both platforms simultaneously. A nice plus.In addition, all the characters, friends list and historical are saved in both the PC and the PS3, the online server of the producer. This happens because the game is exclusively online, of course, but there is an advantage in this.A Realm Reborn has decent graphics to be called a legitimate representative of the Final Fantasy saga. With the right effects jaw-dropping, neat monsters and spells with many special elements, the game does not make ugly, despite the PS3 version lose a little - just a little - the title on the PC.Another point that stands out are the very cities. Some, at first, are very small, but then it changes exponentially. The player soon stumbles upon megacities, stuffed characters, either other players or the computer, but what matters here is the visual. A quick Internet search reveals, for those who do not have the game, as he is really beautiful in their environment, something that is difficult in a MMO, in many cases.			"

												A beautiful, easy to play, time-consuming to master, approachable MMORPG. There are tons of things to do, seasonal events, plenty of PvE, and even some PvP for those interested. The models are very well done, and the whole thing can be played in 1st or 3rd person. As usual, it's the kind of experience one can get lost in, with a strong social aspect. Indeed I've found it can be terribly boring to play alone once you've had and lost a close group of friends. There are many good times to be had here.			"

												Genuinely one of the best MMOs I've played since quitting World of Warcraft a few years back. Reminds me very much of the old WoW style except with a lot more variety in the roles and classes. The dungeons are tough and challenging and give a sense of accomplishment once completed and the overall story of the game is very compelling. Although it is possible that there's a little too much content as the grind can seem somewhat daunting and difficult to get through. However it is worth it in the end.			"

It has a lot of pros and a few cons. But only downside I must say is that it is 15$ a month. At the time I played this every single day, nowadays I haven't playing been playing it.

												I have never liked mmorpg's in general though i have tried a few like WoW, Guild Wars 2, and some F2P titles. I thought the pacing and grinding was awful, i could never get past lvl 30 because by then I was too bored. This game however is something else. I'm a lvl 54 paladin by now. Here's why: there's a very captivating storyline, the gameplay mechanics are awesome (although the global cooldown might be a bit slow for some), the pacing is brilliant; you level quickly due to the main scenario quests and a thing called dungeon roulette (the game throws you in a random dungeon for an exp reward).Perhaps the most important thing (for me at least) since I never got to the endgame of an MMO before: the community is extremely helpful for new players, be it the guild you're in or the randomly selected partymembers with which you have to clear a dungeon. People were always ready to help out. There's also a lot of nostalgia-bombing for fans of Final Fantasy, but you absolutely don't have to have played the games beforehand.Overall I recommend this game for newer MMORPG players as well as older players.

												Introduction:By far this is one of the better and possibly the best MMO out there and the best I've ever played. Theres so much that you can do in this game that you will spend days on (*Which is a good thing for an MMO Scenario) and it does most everything with a new refreshing style and with a lot of fluency. You won't regret making this purchase if you have an open mind and are willing to put some effort into it. Here are a list of personal pros and cons.Pros:+Easy for Casual/New-To-MMO Gamers to Pick Up (There's even a impleted ""Novice Network"" for Q&A)+VERY Friendly Community (I got invited into an FC (Guild) in literally 10 minutes after I started, as opposed to my previous MMO which took weeks to get a guild)+One Character Can Literally Do Everything+Simple Learning Curve to Classes/Jobs (Start off slow, and get faster as you go)+Active Community for All Content (No Ghost Towns)+Long,Interesting (and Funny) Story+Strong Role-Playing Community+Intensive Crafting Systems+Breath-Taking Graphics+Consistent Patches (As of this review, 3.5 is being implemented)+The Subscription Model (You get ""Veteran Rewards"" for each month you are subscribed)+Well Optimized (You are not required to sell that arm and leg to run this game)+Superb UI+Multi-Lingual Support (You can switch languages on a whim, no need to install a 'different' version)+Lots of PvE Content+Beautiful Music+Square Enix (They're great and helpful people!)+Gambling/Chocobo Races and Generally Fun Minigames +Easy to Follow Quests+Lots of Tutorials (Even ones for Roles)+Tons of Gear (Even Cosmetics for you Fashionistas out there)Neutral (Along with my personal opinion):+/- No Addons: Some people may find this as a put-off, but there are no add-ons whatssoever for this game, in fact its pretty much taboo to use them. (Personal Opinion: To me, this is a good thing because I think add-ons like DPS Meters etc., while they give you numbers and a basis to work off of, they also contribute to a hostile community, not saying everyone who uses them does but there is always those people who attack new players for not doing 'good') +/- +/- Grinding: Everyone's Love/Hate Passion(Personal Opinion: While personally I believe this is a good thing because it keeps you working towards something, it can also be very determential and ""burning"" to players+/- Map Size(Personal Opinion: Yes,i its decent sized at best, but with the constant updates, there will be more)+/- Global Cooldown - 2.5 Seconds Compared to 1 second to Accomade Controller Users(Personal Opinion: While A lot of people may have hate for this, I think its a good thing for slower reacting players AND they dont leave out the controller community)Cons:-Gil Bots/Spammers (They happen,but they arent as bad as some MMOs)-The Player Market (There are unfortunately a lot of trolls or people who just crash the market by selling items lower than vendor price OR,the polar opposite, price something very high because of monopolization. That being said it isn't a total loss)-Economy (Kinda Steep for what you earn,but Gil comes in Decently, Still a Con)-Occassional Bugs or Issues-Minor Issues involving Clarity (It doesnt happen often but when it does, you need Google.)Overall: This game is a great refresher compared to most MMOs out there. It does many things SO right that just makes it great if you can look past the Cons. The way Square Enix excutes a lot of things in FFXIV:ARR is done very well. If you are looking for a new MMO to fancy you or if you are new to MMOs in general, I can whole-heartedly say that i HIGHLY RECOMMEND this gameSquare Enix, You have really outdone youselves. I give this game a 9/10 "

												""Now! This is it! Now is the time to choose! Die and be free of pain, or live and fight your sorrow! Now is the time to shape your stories! Your fate is in your hands!"" - AuronMMOs have innovated greatly and has always been the staple of open world traditional fantasy gaming since their conception more than a dozen years ago. All MMOs suffer the catastrophic sympton of the level treadmill and Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn is no exception. What separates a great MMO to a good one is a subjective one, and while FF14 doesn't bring anything new to the table, it does what it does extremely well.While not the most impressive MMORPG I've ever played, it certainly does grant a plethora amount of content to do. At first, I was afraid that FF14 was simply riding on its brand loyalty and kept my expectations low in case it was just another lackluster and half-hearted mess, but what I found instead, to my surprise, is a high quality MMO with superb art direction and average narrative. You are not limited to a single class or a single craft and are able to freely change between them at your leisure. While you are not granted as much freedom as you are in WoW, FF14 is still a worthy contender that deserves your attention.I have played dozens upon dozens of MMORPGs over the years, starting from EverQuest II, Maplestory and WoW, to Japanese and Korean MMOs which are not available on this side of the world. Most of them are plagued with toxicity in the community or unfaithful publishers and developers. Fortunately, FF14 seems to have kept these pitfalls to a minimum and for the most part, are quite pleasant. Of course, nobody can really control how the community evolves and it all depends on the server you chose to reside in.One of the most glaring issues I have found in FF14 so far is the lack of character customization options, which I think is mostly due to the fact that this game is still being supported on old-gen consoles. Many MMORPGs, even pre-2013, are able to support more options and basic sliders. Hopefully this will be improved in the near future. Another issue which personally I don't mind, but some players might, is the lack of evident PvP options and activities. Final Fantasy was always about collaboration and PvE content so I was not too disappointed by this.Overall, Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn is a solid MMORPG with very little flaws and should be praised for its high production quality. There are no free or paid MMO which is similar in vein, and should you be an MMORPG fan, at least give it a try.4/5Technical Tips for everyone:If you are planning to get this game, be aware of which version you buy. If you buy FF14 on steam, you must buy everything else on steam. If you buy it off the official Square Enix site, you must also buy everything else on there. The customer support will not help you if you manage to muck up one or the other.There are also numerous issues with the patcher itself as well. If I factored the patcher's quality into the score, it would be more like 3/5 or lower because of its glaring issues that needs immediate attention now. If you are getting errors of [30413], [25008], or within the 5.26 - 5.27 patch dates, you must use a VPS to solve it. Once you are past these patches, you may download the game via your normal speed again. I have a decent internet of 30/5 down/up, and it took me about two days to download the entire game due to this issue.			"

The game looks beautiful and not only that but the story is interesting. So if you have played an MMO before or want to get into one, then I highly suggest giving this game a try!			"

FFXIV: A crafter's review.Note: My time-played is actually about half of my actual time-played, as I tend to launch the game through the base launcher instead of Steam. Steam says I don't have any time played this week which is... Laughably inaccurate. FFXIV isn't like other MMOs. Some reviews will focus on its amazing ability to keep a Final-Fantasy quality of story despite being an MMO. Some will rave about the spectacular Armory and Class system. Me? I'm a crafter. And hoo boy, does this game deliver.FFXIV doesn't limit you to one class in combat, and that thankfully extends to crafting as well. If you want to dabble in alchemy and weaving? You can do that. Decide you want to make some pretty jewelery? You can do that too with no penalties to your other classes. This game not only allows you to level every crafting class you please, it also offers some useful shortcuts for levelling in the form of levequests and, later on, collectibles. These systems reward you for striving towards quality in your crafts, instead of mindlessly grinding. And speaking of quality? The crafting system itself is amazing. FFXIV does not have a one-click crafting system like most other MMOs. Each class has abilities and rotations, similar to what you would see in a combat class. Some would argue (and I would agree) that the crafting in this game requires more strategy than the combat. So if you love to relax and make things for other people, or make some hefty profits playing the markets, this game might just be for you. To illustrate: I have exactly two combat-oriented classes at 60, and they really only count as one for this purpose as they both level with the same exp bar (Summoner and Scholar). On the other hand, I have every gathering profession (botany, mining, and fishing) maxed, and every crafting class nearly at cap. I just really, really enjoy the crafting system. It's hands-down better than any other MMO I've played. If you're ever on Balmung, feel free to hit up Lilligan Freshwater!			"

												Logged in, made my character was surpised to find this was the one MMO i've played where i could make a character that came closest to my IRL appearance (slightly different colored green eyes), started playing, immediately drawn into the story (rarely happens in an MMO for me) decide to Rp regularly on the character i made. Several hours i got tired and decided to go to sleep, so i go the the inn, request a room, and hop ni the bed to log off. Yes, your read that right, your charcter can go to sleep in a bed to log off. ABSOLUTE BEST method to log off in an MMO i've ever seen, which is why i always do it, even made an outfit specifically for going to sleep before logging off.			"

												I love this game! All the Final Fantasy characters and monsters! You don't need a new character to play a different class/job! The music is amazing! The story quests are easy to track, and put you at the center as the Hero of Light. Everyone is fighting for the same casue, no good vs bad, so you don't have to worry about being in the wrong place and getting smashed by another player. There is pvp arena's for those who like to. Plenty of things to do, like hunts, treasure maps, the Hildibrand story line, Chocobo racing. Speeking of Chocobo's, you get one early on for a mount, and it doubles as a companion to fight with you. The Duty finder is helpful to get into instances when your friends or Free Company members are not around. It also looks to other servers to find players, as well as being a cross-platform with the PlayStation version. Thats right, controllers and KB/M playing side by sideYour are rewarded for your total subscription time, no need to pay every month if you don't want to, you still get the rewards when you have meet the amount of days payed (exp. your first 30 days payed earns a reward, you can not play for a year, and when you pay again, you get the 60 days reward. After a few, it starts to take more time between rewards).Fighting in this game requires you to move to not be hit by mobs attacks. Even as a caster, you must pay attention to what is coming your way, and sometimes it is just a matter of knowing where to stand to get spells off before you have to move again.Everything in this game looks great, the characters and equipment, mobs and bosses, zones and backdrops, and of course, the cutscenes! Oh and the spells and ability!! There is even a Limit Break system while in instances. A shared guage that builds up to 3 levels, and the different class groups (exp. casters, healer, tank, dps) have a different limit break. A level 3 healer limit break will raise all dead party members, casters cast meteor. Time it right and save the day!Crafting, almost forgot crafting! You don't just click a button and wait for a bar to fill. You have skills to use as a crafter. Skill rotation helps determine output quality. Plus quests for your craft, and the gear just for crafting. Some of the crafting gear is also styled around what you are crafting.Gathering jobs are  miner, botanist, and fisherFree companies have houses that provide a place to grow crops for cooking or feed for your chocobo, training dummys to practice your rotation, and a few vendors for repairing equipment, buying regents, or just selling junk.All of these things (and so much more) tie together wonderfully, and give (me at least) a sense of place in the grand scheme of things.This, compared to one other mmo I played a lot of, is a huge difference. I just didn't feel the other game gave me any drive to ""do great things"" other than to complete a quest, or run a instance for the fun of it. I never felt like I was part of the Big Picture. Kind of hard to put into words, and maybe I just did not play with the ""right"" players, and I never made it to end game raids.Over all, FFXIV is Best MMO I have ever played, and still crave to play! I Hope you find this review helpful. :)(If my review has helped you decide, and/or you just like it, maybe you could toss some change to my steam wallet. HAHAHA)			"

I put in a solid 88 hours and got a lvl39 Ranger/Bard, I enjoyed every minute of this game, from dungeons, questing, guilds, meeting new people, it's hard to say if there was anything I'd say stay away from, even the sub price isn't bad at all, fairly cheap in my opinion, so would i say get this game? if you're a fan of long RPGS with good worlds, good characters and a good story, then yeah, I'd say go for it, enjoy every minute of this game during a 30 day starter sub, you will not regret it..

												I'm generally not into MMO's but this one is something else. It manages to blend the pacing and fun of a singleplayer RPG in an MMO like world. It's also exceptionally long  (I've spent more than 200 hours and more just on the main quest). While this may seem like a lot, the plot is actually very compelling and has probably the best writing the franchise has ever seen (voice acting is exceptional as well). FF 14 also manages to be a huge love letter to fans with lots of easter eggs and references to previous FF games. You also get to battle awesome iconic bosses including summons.Finally, and this is a personal plus, the game is super controller friendly. I've actually played the whole way through with a gamepad on my laptop and it feels very comfortable. This again reinforces the idea that this was an MMO designed as a singleplayer traditional FF game. There's a free trial so give it a go. You won't regret it.			"

												FFXIV:ARR is a fascinating mmo that is easy to become quickly absorbed in. There's a large variation of classes and dungeons to partake in with a vast variety of people to meet in the process. The game is very grind extensive, but it's an mmo so it's expected. End game is where must of the fun is to be had, but it isn't a challenge to reach end game. Overall, Final Fantasy XIV: ARR accomplishes what many mmo(s) already accomplish, but it does so within a realm related to the final fantasy series which makes it succeed more than other games. It is definitely worth your money and you will enjoy playing this game for many hours.			"

												Story driven holy trinity MMO with a decent amount of content. Graphics are a bit simple, but look good overall. 9 starting classes, can later become one of 10 jobs. Jobs are fairly balanced, though some feel slightly stronger than others. Crafting system is rather unique, requires immense effort to truly make useful. Gathering system is boring.Early levels can feel very slow because of the initial lack of skills and the long global cooldown. Starts to get better after level 15.Story content must be completed to unlock the majority of content. The story between the first ""arc"" and the Heavensward expansion is a 100 quests of mostly filler, prepare yourself.Most content is very casual-friendly, only a handful of endgame raids really challenge players.Open world activities are a bit limited, most interesting things happen in instanced areas (dungeons, raids etc.).PvP is almost barren, worth it only for vanity armor.Lots of enjoyable side quests.Lots of references and fanservice to fans of the Final Fantasy series.I like it.

Ok now for the cool stuff. Very cool boss fights. very atmosperic dungons. super kick ♥♥♥ music of past FF games remixed/modenized plus new music added with each patch. new patches bring new content/features and refinments to gameplay.

												Honestly my favorite modern MMO. I've put countless hours into it and still find it endlessly enjoyable. The classes are all fun and unique, the crafting is active and interesting, and thanks to the job system you can experience everything the game has to offer with a single character.I took a break after finishing end game and getting all best in slot gear for my main class, but when I came back I found out that there was almost double the endgame content as when I left. This game is ever changing and ever expanding, new content is being added quite regularly, and it's not just new raids or dungeons. Whole new story quests, expanding on the lore, are added extremely often.I'm going to sum up my feelings in a list of good and bad from my perspective,******************************************************************************What's the good:The combat: It's slower then most other MMOs but that is a benefit, giving you more time to make a choice on what to do next and how it will be effective. It flows naturally and feels satisfying with just the right amount of power. Later in the game a boss fight stops being just a harder monster you need to work through, but instead becomes a kind of dance, each member of your party having their own role on the stage.The Quests: Yes, they are a lot of fetch quests and breadcrumbs, it's nothing special in the MMO world... But it somehow is. With all the dialog, lore, and the streamlined loot system, the quests in this game somehow transcend the ""Go here and do this"" standard. The first major thing you might notice? The quest givers know damned well what you're there for, the world has a long history of adventurers and questors, everyone knows you're there to help them with anything and damned if they are not going to take advantage of it. This makes for quite a fun experience as you do the most basic tasks for someone too lazy to pick up vegetables that are literally 5 feet away, and they acknowledge it. If you play and get to level 50, I HIGHLY recommend the ""Hildibrand"" Quest series started in Ul'dah, it will have you laughing till the end.The Dungeons: The dungeons in this game are basic, but awesome. Each able to be run in about 20-30 minutes and comprising of 3-4 bosses and trash. But they have a ton of atmosphere and charm, each one clearly was carefully crafted to be both visually appealing and challenging. And don't be fooled when you see the labels of ""Hard mode"" when you get to end game, Hard mode dungeons are not in fact just more difficult versions like in other MMOs, the game designers in fact go back and remake a dungeon from scratch, using the same location but a different path, with different trash and different bosses. Every Hard Mode is a whole new dungeon with a whole new story to it, causally taking place after the events you caused in the normal mode.Community: Other then a few bad eggs and elitists the community is extremely helpful and kind, you should never lack any help if you need it just by asking around. The game actually incentivizes high levels to help low levels with the Syncing system where a high level in specific situations can scale his/her level down to match a dungeon/quest/fate.*****************************************************************************What is Bad:Global Clock: All actions by players and mobs are on a global clock. This gives the game a somewhat turn based feel to it where everything is in time and synced together. Why is this bad? Because for more then a few classes in order to get the most out of your abilities you need to time them PERFECTLY based on this clock, and the fact that you can't see or interact with it means that you'll be guessing based on the countdown on your abilities. Best example of this being a problem is on the summoner Job, where timing your dots right makes the difference of 100% of your damage or 80% of your damage if you get it wrong.Insanely difficult dice roll quests: At end game, there is a series of quests to get your ""best"" weapon. This is... the most bull ♥♥♥♥ you will ever have to face in a game. You have to win 12 random dice rolls, and failing one means having to try again... Did I mention that each dice roll happens AFTER you finish one of the many random events around the world? That you have to wait up to 15 minutes for? Even with higher drop chance it is still Bull. (My best time for completing this quest.. 6 days, friend took more then 2 weeks) Lucky that this is optional.Character creation limitations: What's that? Wanna play with a friend who already plays the game? What's that? They are on the Levi Server? Well FK YOU! Servers every now and then (some more then others, to the point of being closed more often then open) will close their gate to new players, this is done to keep the servers from being over loaded, but this has the nasty side effect of keeping players from playing together on the servers they want, specially the more populated ones where you have more people to interact with and more options for guilds/fcs. Why is this done? Well that brings me to my last problem.Gold Spammers: Yup, the ever present MMO issue is here but 1000x worse. These pesky parasites will spam all chats, all areas, all the time. They even personally PM you with their virus ridden web links, promising massive amounts of gil for your hard earned money. This is done through the in game player search, where they just have to go alphabetically to find every single one of us and spam us one at a time. Of course they get banned, only to instantly make a new random name account and get right back into the game. they come in the thousands and they want all of your money, and in my opinion is the sole reason that servers are rotated the way they are. It's annoying, it's frustrating, and no mater how many of them you block there are always 5 more to take their place. Every now and then Square does a mass Hardware ban and that quiets them for a week or so wile they buy new computers/servers but it's only a temporary fix to a permanent problem.**********************************************************All in all, in my opinion, the good outweighs the bad. This game is an experience, an amazing experience. I've never had more fun with an MMO in my life and I'm not sure I ever will. No one would have thought that after the disaster that was the original FFXIV that this would be what comes out of it. I ask any of you reading, at LEAST give the 2 week free trial a chance. You have nothing to loose but a whole world to gain.			"

												FFXIV is the first MMORPG I actually invested time in (although, compared to many other players, the time I wrote this review (149 hours) isn't much). This game is absolutely amazing. The gameplay is like WoW, the graphics are beautiful (although not the best in the market), the music is absolutely amazing and so is the community. This game isn't for everyone though. I don't like MMORPG's that much but fell in love with this game. I reccommend getting the expansion Heavensward if you intend on staying (although it's only worth to get it around level 50, unless you REALLY want to play as Au Ra, in which case buy it with FFFXIV).

												Final Fantasy 14: ARR is probally one of the best P2P mmo's I've played in recent years, even moreso in my opinon than WoW etc.I've put a fair few hours into this game and played to max level at the time I left (lvl50). This game offers so much content and so many ways of playing that it is worth the £7 sub fee per month. Admitidly I did buy this game during a sale ( I picked it up for around £6) and it was worth every penny. However I can only base my review on my experience that I gained and of course you get what you want out of the game.Things I loved:-Each class levels up seperatly meaning that reaching max level with one class doesn't mean the end of the game.-Being able to switch class just by changing weapon/crafting item means seemless fluidity.-Being in a large Free Company (guild) is very enjoyable and many players are very friendly.-Even if you are not a huge Final Fantasy fan this is still a great MMO.-A nice loot greed/roll system that is done by class rather than all rolling on loot to stop people grabbing gear.-Daily quests/trails/challenges.-Fat chocobos.Things I didn't like so much:-Difficulty curve can be quite high and the ingame macro system isn't explained as well as it could be.-High level dungeon grinding for high level gear can be tedious especially as some gear can only be gained once per week.-All games have idiots and griefters on them, this is no exception.-£7 can be alot a month if you don't have alot of time to play.-Language barried can be a problem especially in dungeons.-People farming the later story missions skipping the cutscenes ruining it for first timers.Overall I can highly rate this game from a MMO point of view and while it does have it's downsides I put many happy hours into the game and met alot of nice people. Even if you are not a final fantasy fan, this game is a very nice MMO that is easy to pick up and enjoy!			"

												I strongly recommend this as an immersive, beautiful, extensively narrative-driven experience, to the point even the crafters and gatherers get their own storylines! While the combat is simplified, it's neither too simple nor too frustrating, and the native controller support is an absolute joy. More depth and complexity can be found in the crafting and gathering systems, although the game is still quite easy to understand.The world, while only consisting of a few maps, is gorgeous, memorable, and full of detail, both in characters and environment.The music is also fantastic, expressing a broad array of emotions, from the tender to the grand. The boss music as well is varied and intense and uses a variety of styles and instrumentation.Achievement hunters might find the game a bit of a grind, as some of the achievements are literally just grindwalls, especially the ones relating to the game's minigame hub, but the fact that most game systems have achievements attached to them, and the sheer array of activities that can be done, mean achievement-hunting is fairly involved and interesting from an intellectual point of view.

												I love this game! All the Final Fantasy characters and monsters! You don't need a new character to play a different class/job! The music is amazing! The story quests are easy to track, and put you at the center as the Hero of Light. Everyone is fighting for the same casue, no good vs bad, so you don't have to worry about being in the wrong place and getting smashed by another player. There is pvp arena's for those who like to. Plenty of things to do, like hunts, treasure maps, the Hildibrand story line, Chocobo racing. Speeking of Chocobo's, you get one early on for a mount, and it doubles as a companion to fight with you. The Duty finder is helpful to get into instances when your friends or Free Company members are not around. It also looks to other servers to find players, as well as being a cross-platform with the PlayStation version. Thats right, controllers and KB/M playing side by sideYour are rewarded for your total subscription time, no need to pay every month if you don't want to, you still get the rewards when you have meet the amount of days payed (exp. your first 30 days payed earns a reward, you can not play for a year, and when you pay again, you get the 60 days reward. After a few, it starts to take more time between rewards).Fighting in this game requires you to move to not be hit by mobs attacks. Even as a caster, you must pay attention to what is coming your way, and sometimes it is just a matter of knowing where to stand to get spells off before you have to move again.Everything in this game looks great, the characters and equipment, mobs and bosses, zones and backdrops, and of course, the cutscenes! Oh and the spells and ability!! There is even a Limit Break system while in instances. A shared guage that builds up to 3 levels, and the different class groups (exp. casters, healer, tank, dps) have a different limit break. A level 3 healer limit break will raise all dead party members, casters cast meteor. Time it right and save the day!Crafting, almost forgot crafting! You don't just click a button and wait for a bar to fill. You have skills to use as a crafter. Skill rotation helps determine output quality. Plus quests for your craft, and the gear just for crafting. Some of the crafting gear is also styled around what you are crafting.Gathering jobs are  miner, botanist, and fisherFree companies have houses that provide a place to grow crops for cooking or feed for your chocobo, training dummys to practice your rotation, and a few vendors for repairing equipment, buying regents, or just selling junk.All of these things (and so much more) tie together wonderfully, and give (me at least) a sense of place in the grand scheme of things.This, compared to one other mmo I played a lot of, is a huge difference. I just didn't feel the other game gave me any drive to ""do great things"" other than to complete a quest, or run a instance for the fun of it. I never felt like I was part of the Big Picture. Kind of hard to put into words, and maybe I just did not play with the ""right"" players, and I never made it to end game raids.Over all, FFXIV is Best MMO I have ever played, and still crave to play! I Hope you find this review helpful. :)(If my review has helped you decide, and/or you just like it, maybe you could toss some change to my steam wallet. HAHAHA)			"

I put in a solid 88 hours and got a lvl39 Ranger/Bard, I enjoyed every minute of this game, from dungeons, questing, guilds, meeting new people, it's hard to say if there was anything I'd say stay away from, even the sub price isn't bad at all, fairly cheap in my opinion, so would i say get this game? if you're a fan of long RPGS with good worlds, good characters and a good story, then yeah, I'd say go for it, enjoy every minute of this game during a 30 day starter sub, you will not regret it..

												I played around 20-30 mmos, ranging from f2p to p2p titles like for example aion, lotro, eso, guild wars 1 and guild wars 2, age of conan, the secret world and ofc the many many f2p titles out there like maestia, shaiya etc. you name it. most of these games i did not play long, maybe for a couple of hours, because i was kinda biased through guild wars 1 which was until now my all time favorite mmorpg. ff14 is challenging this, because it is just ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. i can't even begin to describe this game. im even having fun farming resources and crafting stuff, because it is completly different to other titles out there. im dead serious i hate farming and crafting, i find it really boring, but in this game? nope im having so much fun. and the best part for me is, that i can really learn EVERYTHING with one character. i like this freedom. in gw1 you could essentially use all 1250 skills avaiable and try out so many different combinations, granted that's not the same as in this game, you have much less skills, but still it reminds me of this freedom to go and just try stuff and experiment. i missed that much. this game is giving me exactly that. so if you like freedom in a mmo concerning your character then go ahead and try it out. it's just 10 bucks and you will find out in 1 month if you like it or not ;)			"

												Started playing it after quiting WoW and then SWTOR and... I'm completely sucked into it! To be honest I wasn't expecting FF XIV to be so exceptionally good and I'm so positively surprised. Almost everything in this game feels perfect: story, gameplay, graphics, music, class system with jobs, crafting, end game content... The only one thing I found so far I dislike is voice-over in some major story points but fortunately it does not happen so often:) I can only recommend this game to all mmorpg fantasy fans.			"

												This game... is addictive.I have not played much endgame, I'm sure it's fantastic, this is a run-of-the-mill MMORPG however. You played Tera, Aion, Rift, WoW, Guld Wars 2, etc, you'll see the familiar elements, the grinds, the farming, etc. So I'll list some pros/cons below:Pros:So much to do (explained below)Graphics""Engaging"" cinematics, for real, this game has the most cinematics for a MMORPG I've seen yet (and I played SW:KoTOR)Cons:Semi-clunky (combat, movement, etc)Same old grind, if you want an MMORPG without some type of farm/grind, keep looking and good luck.So much to do:FIrst, the class system is fantastic. Anyone can be any class, crafting, and gathering profession. You wanna be a cook? Go for it, wanna be a warrior and a mage? You can (just not at the same time obviously).This, for me, was one of the things I was most warry about, but ended up loving. Finally, I can play an MMORPG game where I can do whatever I want with no consequences. All it takes is a switch of gear (your main-hand weapon determines you current class/profession). Of course it has a well-done gear swap system as well (can save gear sets, etc), and furthermore there's a ""reccomended gear button to auto-equip you for your current class/profession, fantastic.The sheer multitude of classes, professions, and 3 gathering professions is amazing... you will NEVER search for something to do. Along with little quests, dungeons, scenarios, a ""game room"" type area you will not want.Now... if your goal is to reach endgame and do that content.... you may find the above frustrating and in your way. If you want to immerse yourself in the lore, enjoy the world and characters and various things to do, then you will be satisfied as I was. I've been playing for 71 hours, still haven't reached max level (even for the base game), but I've been levelling 3 classes, 5 professions, all 3 of the gathering professions).On that note, the gathering system and crafting system is the best I have seen, very in-depth. Fishing not only helps other professions, for example, but you also have a fishing log, showing you various areas you've fished at, fish found there, etc. If you like filling out logs and collecting ♥♥♥♥, this game has you covered.The crafting system also has abilities (like combat), to improve and craft you items. You don't simply hit a button and wait for a timer to craft! However, if that's what you want then yes, there is a ""quick-craft"" button that does that :)About the CLUNKY aspect. The overall feel is clunky not in a bad way, but compared to other games (WoW, Wild Star, etc) it falls more in line with GW2 for movement and combat, but slightly less fluid. There is a weight to movement and actions, the weight is not bad, but it's like the difference between playing Gears of War and Halo or Team Fortress 2 and CoD. Every button in FF14 has a purpose, every movement a reason, and you can feel it.Overall, this is one the most addictive MMORPG's I've played in a while... and I've played a good amount. This is the FIRST one besides WoW that I actually cared about the lore, and the first game where I've actually said ""Wow... this crafting system is actually nice."" Hell, I even enjoying fishing, fishing! If you've ever played WoW and levelled fishing to 700+ you'll understand what a feat it is for me to actually say I enjoy fishing in a game (that isn't specifically designed solely for fishing).Anyway, review too long and bulky, my work here is done.

												A beautiful, easy to play, time-consuming to master, approachable MMORPG. There are tons of things to do, seasonal events, plenty of PvE, and even some PvP for those interested. The models are very well done, and the whole thing can be played in 1st or 3rd person. As usual, it's the kind of experience one can get lost in, with a strong social aspect. Indeed I've found it can be terribly boring to play alone once you've had and lost a close group of friends. There are many good times to be had here.			"

Anime: The MMORPGIt shares a lot of good qualities with WoW and if you can find a few friends this game is a blast.

												I thought I would never really enjoy a MMORPG again, but this game managed to change that.I played a lot of MMOs for a lot of time in the 90s and 2000s. But in the last few years, whenever I tried a new MMO, I usually thought to myself: ""there are some really cool ideas here, but meh... I can't invest the time to really feel interested in actually playing it"". In other words, I could appreciate MMORPGs, but couldn't really get myself to play them again.But I can play and enjoy FFXIV easily. It's hard to pin-point why: the game isn't very innovative, most of its mechanics have been used in multiple western and/or eastern MMORPGs before it. But it blends them well, and everything feels very polished and sleeky. And the Final Fantasy style gameworld, full of fan-service for fans of the series, lends itself well for a relaxing experience with gorgeous scenary. To help with that, the community seems to be more pleasing and much less toxic than most other MMOs, too.			"

												FFXIV:ARR is a great game in my opinion. Graphics look great, fighting is fast and exciting, most of the community is helpful, crafting and gathering is fresh and has many perks. Que times can take a while but if you join a decent FC people are usually willing to help, especially since you get bonus Gil/Exp/Currency for helping someone run a dungeon for the first time. I love that you only need 1 Character to level all the classes.14 Free day trial or up to level 20 is a pretty generous trial for a game of this magnitude My only complaint is the amount of kitty people. But that's not really SE fault. tl:dr Game good, free try, unga bunga, much cat people			"

												Genuinely one of the best MMOs I've played since quitting World of Warcraft a few years back. Reminds me very much of the old WoW style except with a lot more variety in the roles and classes. The dungeons are tough and challenging and give a sense of accomplishment once completed and the overall story of the game is very compelling. Although it is possible that there's a little too much content as the grind can seem somewhat daunting and difficult to get through. However it is worth it in the end.			"

												FFXIV is the first MMORPG I actually invested time in (although, compared to many other players, the time I wrote this review (149 hours) isn't much). This game is absolutely amazing. The gameplay is like WoW, the graphics are beautiful (although not the best in the market), the music is absolutely amazing and so is the community. This game isn't for everyone though. I don't like MMORPG's that much but fell in love with this game. I reccommend getting the expansion Heavensward if you intend on staying (although it's only worth to get it around level 50, unless you REALLY want to play as Au Ra, in which case buy it with FFFXIV).

												My original review was SO LONG that it became a novel… That soon became a trilogy… That was eventually released on blu-ray DVD.…That’s how much I love this gametl;drThe game comes with a free month, which is more than enough time to give it a try. Despite the lackluster fighting IMO (read below), it doesn't detract from the overall gameplay. FFXIV is an absolutely gorgeous and vast world, and one of the best subscription MMO's I've played. I would recommend this game to any of my friends.---COMMUNITY:FREE-to-play MMOs are like highschool. You’re often surrounded by people who could care less about you or the community, and only a select few people who do care. One of the biggest reasons I play any subscription based MMO is for the community.SUBSCRIPTION based MMOs are like university. You’re at a hub where like-minded people gather, who have paid for their entrance, and in doing so will most likely try their best to thrive; the only way to do so is to become apart of the community.My first day on the server I was invited to a free company (a lesser form of a guild), and I was chatting up my FC mates like no tomorrow. We shared stories, got to know each other a little bit, and some of the max level players came out to help me quest for fun (they even gave me a free pet). We also went to the FC house and chilled in a hot tub, at which point we began to /dance naked without equipment. Needless to say, I felt like the community was incredible.Granted, everyone will have a different experience and some might not be as lucky as I was (although I still vouch for the community since my brother and friend were in thriving FC’s as well). GRAPHICS:I bought the game cause my friend said I could make a hot female character with an even hotter merchant retainer... He didn't lie. But seriously, the graphics are stunning. So often did I catch myself stopping to take in the scenery before I continued on with a quest. And even more often did I catch myself marveling my own character (and others) during cutscenes. From equipment and weapons, to the vast cities and it's inhabitants, I could spend hours just roaming around taking it all in; and that's saying something.ATMOSPHERE:I'll be honest, I'm very biased here, so I'll say it straight; I'm a huge FINAL FANTASY fanboy. From the lore to the cameo's, and all the familiarity that is FINAL FANTASY, I LOVED this game. But I'll try and be objective. IMO, this game isn't afraid to be cute and light, and neither is it afraid to be dark. This is reflective of the writing and plot, to the characters you meet and enemies you fight. Unlike most single player RPGs that become far too cute, or completely dark with no hope for salvation, or ""try to hard comedic"" with jokes that bash you're head in, this game is a combination of every world, and in nice moderation. I felt after my time spent in the game, I got to see its dark aspects, but never forgot how cute it was. Especially with the immense varying between areas. I adored how one city made me feel fresh and relaxed, while others made me feel rigid and attentive. The same goes for the characters you meet along the way. Even the monsters have great diversity. Although I'll stop there, because the sheer nostalgia of seeing a huge ♥♥♥ Malboro or Ifrit will turn this review into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.GAMEPLAY:Alright this is the bad part, and might be a deal breaker for you. There was nothing wrong with the gameplay. In fact, I actually prefer FFXIV’s approach to the job system where all you need is 1 character to enjoy all the classes (this also removes the bs of having to start another alt if you messed up a skill tree or something). What I felt was this game was very REACTIVE as opposed to PROACTIVE. I was constantly waiting to react during fights, either waiting for my cast bar to finish and react with another skill, or reacting to a boss attack field by moving out of the way. Many MMOs have you proactively moving to avoid damage rather than reacting to a boss attack field. And those same MMOs don’t have a cast time for every single skill, thus creating a rhythmic flow to attack skill rotation (PROACTIVE) rather than waiting on dreary cast bars (REACTIVE). In general this made my gameplay feel lackluster at times. But this never detracted from overall gameplay. Mind you, mastering cast bar skill rotation (and skill rotation in general) is an art form all its own.CONCLUSION:I would highly recommend this game. Even the gameplay which I just bashed isn’t a deal breaker (for me at least). There is nothing wrong with a reactive style of play. Keep in mind this review is just my opinions. FINAL (fantasy) verdict:8.5/10			"

												Final Fantasy 14: ARR is probally one of the best P2P mmo's I've played in recent years, even moreso in my opinon than WoW etc.I've put a fair few hours into this game and played to max level at the time I left (lvl50). This game offers so much content and so many ways of playing that it is worth the £7 sub fee per month. Admitidly I did buy this game during a sale ( I picked it up for around £6) and it was worth every penny. However I can only base my review on my experience that I gained and of course you get what you want out of the game.Things I loved:-Each class levels up seperatly meaning that reaching max level with one class doesn't mean the end of the game.-Being able to switch class just by changing weapon/crafting item means seemless fluidity.-Being in a large Free Company (guild) is very enjoyable and many players are very friendly.-Even if you are not a huge Final Fantasy fan this is still a great MMO.-A nice loot greed/roll system that is done by class rather than all rolling on loot to stop people grabbing gear.-Daily quests/trails/challenges.-Fat chocobos.Things I didn't like so much:-Difficulty curve can be quite high and the ingame macro system isn't explained as well as it could be.-High level dungeon grinding for high level gear can be tedious especially as some gear can only be gained once per week.-All games have idiots and griefters on them, this is no exception.-£7 can be alot a month if you don't have alot of time to play.-Language barried can be a problem especially in dungeons.-People farming the later story missions skipping the cutscenes ruining it for first timers.Overall I can highly rate this game from a MMO point of view and while it does have it's downsides I put many happy hours into the game and met alot of nice people. Even if you are not a final fantasy fan, this game is a very nice MMO that is easy to pick up and enjoy!			"

I will update this review probably once I reach 1000+ hours. My hours are 160 at the time of this review.So you probably want a review from someone who doesn't play MMOs, or at least, didn't. I played Runescape back in 2007 with some friends. That was the only MMO I've ever played. FFXIV was still easy to learn, and I just didn't feel a stranger at all. It's impossible to not enjoy this game unless you just hate MMO's, or are impatient.I bought this like a month ago and I just reached level 50 dragoon. It's all so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. The story is incredible, the music is stunning, the art is amazing, graphics are ridiculously beautiful. The classes (fighting classes, crafting classes, and gathering classes) are all uniquely rewarding. With that said, you can literally play as ANY class in the entire game with a single character. Wanna be a gladiator? Equip a sword. Miner? Equip a pickaxe. Wanna just ♥♥♥♥in cook? Equip a skillet. The community is wonderful. I'm no veteran hence my hours played, but I'm in a great Free Company (like a clan in other games) with great players that make me feel at home.However, this is definitely not a game for everyone. It could be quite intimidating to the average casual gamer who doesn't understand the basic principles of most MMO games. This game requires quite a bit of your time and patience. So, I would absolutely recommend looking up gameplay videos to understand the combat system if you're really questioning this purchase.I guess the only downside is I wasted my entire summer on a single video game. In the real life that sucks, but in Eorzea, it has been so wonderful.			"

												I thought it was about time to write a review for this, since I've put quite some time into it.Final Fantasy 14 is really freaking amazing. There is always so much content for you to be doing.FF14 was my second paid MMO, first being a... RUNE game... Yeah you know the one. Anyway, this game just seems so much more superior than the other MMOs I have played. Both free and paid.When I first started playing this, I was clueless on so much. The game throws a lot at you in the beginning but it's also not difficult to catch on. I started in Ul'Dah, and for those who have played the game might know how easy it is for a newbie to get lost there in the beginning!The game has multiple classes you can play as. You can start as a Gladiator, Lancer, Arcanist... Anything available, really! And to make it better, once you reach level 10 (I think...), you are told that you can now change class whenever you wish. That's right, you read that correctly. So if you started as a Gladiator and then was having second thoughts, you can go ahead and change your class to whatever you want. Anything!There are also multiple crafting classes and gathering classes. Again, you can become these whenever you please. Crafters will make things like armours, weapons, foods and potions. And believe me, your gatherers and crafters are fantastic money makers.Now onto the content. Final Fantasy 14 is FLOOOOOODED with content. You really won't get bored. (Seriously, look at my time played ._.). The story is amazing, and I won't talk much about it to avoid spoilers. But IT'S GOOD. There is plenty of side quests for you to enjoy too. Some of them are quite funny, like the Hildibrand sidequest. Ontop of the quests, there are loads of dungeons, raids, primal fights and even PVP.You definately will not get bored playing this game. You'll always find yourself being able to do something. You might wanna go kill things to level up, run a dungeon, go and explore the world or sit down by a lake and do some fishing.The choice is yours, Adventurer ;)			"

												If you liked Final Fantasy before, you'll like it even more with FFXIV: A Realm Reborn. It's everything you've loved about the Final Fantasy Series and more. One of the highlights is being able to switch classes without making  a new character. The world is huge and full of adventure. Gameplay is smooth and works well even on low settings. This is a purchase you won't regret!			"

Unlike the FFXI where they had made so many mistake, SQ took it on themself to see those problem and fix them inside the FF14 a Realm Reborn. From the main story to the class quest, going to the guild and granc company mission, there months of playable time in here!			"

												Final Fantasy 14: ARR is probally one of the best P2P mmo's I've played in recent years, even moreso in my opinon than WoW etc.I've put a fair few hours into this game and played to max level at the time I left (lvl50). This game offers so much content and so many ways of playing that it is worth the £7 sub fee per month. Admitidly I did buy this game during a sale ( I picked it up for around £6) and it was worth every penny. However I can only base my review on my experience that I gained and of course you get what you want out of the game.Things I loved:-Each class levels up seperatly meaning that reaching max level with one class doesn't mean the end of the game.-Being able to switch class just by changing weapon/crafting item means seemless fluidity.-Being in a large Free Company (guild) is very enjoyable and many players are very friendly.-Even if you are not a huge Final Fantasy fan this is still a great MMO.-A nice loot greed/roll system that is done by class rather than all rolling on loot to stop people grabbing gear.-Daily quests/trails/challenges.-Fat chocobos.Things I didn't like so much:-Difficulty curve can be quite high and the ingame macro system isn't explained as well as it could be.-High level dungeon grinding for high level gear can be tedious especially as some gear can only be gained once per week.-All games have idiots and griefters on them, this is no exception.-£7 can be alot a month if you don't have alot of time to play.-Language barried can be a problem especially in dungeons.-People farming the later story missions skipping the cutscenes ruining it for first timers.Overall I can highly rate this game from a MMO point of view and while it does have it's downsides I put many happy hours into the game and met alot of nice people. Even if you are not a final fantasy fan, this game is a very nice MMO that is easy to pick up and enjoy!			"

												Sorry for this long review, if you dont wont to read, then all the other ine sentence reviews should convince you to get this game. this is pretty much just details on the game itself and my thoughts on them. i dont think i get really specific so if you wanna know more just go to the wiki or the play guide http://store.steampowered.com  Pros (in my opinion, obviously) Most Classic RPG experiance in an MMO that ive had in a while. its its pretty rare these days where you start off as an actual  normal adventurer and get quests from an adventurers guild. these days most mmos are just replica of ""you are a chosen one! now go fight evil"" sorta thing. The combat system is about the same as the standard good old formula, has som pretty animations for combat as well. The Gear and weapons have a nice aesthetic feeling to them and they get the look of the gear right as well, going from begginners gear to higher level gear, it actually matches what it looks like in comparison to the level. no flashy beginners gear. to bad that there is no costume slots so you can use the image of old gear, but most of them look great to begin with. A great part of the class mechanics is that once you reach lvl15 on your first class, you can choose to pick up any other class and conintue with that, of course starting from level one again. but if you dont want to do this you can always start a new character, since they give a generous amount of character slots per world (at least after the ifrst month of paid sub). The Story is quite typical of a final fantasy game, chocka block full of characters and plot. since i play most games while listening to something,  i usually dont pay much attention to what the npc's say and just follow quest obj, but this has probably been one of only 10 or so games that i dont do that. Animations, Graphics and Design of Final Fantasy 14 are quite good, if you look around you realise that every npc, wheteher they be friend or enemy, has a ton of idle animations and animations while being interacted with. for me who uses a pretty low end pc (basically what the minimum it states, maybe a bit lower) its still looks quite beautiful. The Environment and world itself is quite expansive,though it is section off into different regions. For example Thanalan (name of whole region) -> split into North, South East, e.t.c There is thankfully no game breaking pay to win gear. though there is gear that you can by with real money, its aesthetic stuff like mounts and costumes. basically all you can by with real money is -> The game itself + paid DLC ( which so far is only heavensward), the sub needed to play and aesthetic stuff like premium dyes, mounts, nostalgic costumes and little pets that will follow you around.Also if you happen to be a japanophile like me you can hav Jap audio with english sub. just saying, but theres nothing wrong with the english voice actors, they're acutally pretty good. Cons i wished that they would add more voices to the cutscenes and general talking to npcs, because so far only important mission cutscenes have voice.maybe no sub fee or a lower one, its pretty heavy on my wallet since i play alot. hahahasometimes around really big updates the launcher freaks out and does a bunch of erros and you'll end up redownloading it or searching the internet for an answer.

												I thought I would never really enjoy a MMORPG again, but this game managed to change that.I played a lot of MMOs for a lot of time in the 90s and 2000s. But in the last few years, whenever I tried a new MMO, I usually thought to myself: ""there are some really cool ideas here, but meh... I can't invest the time to really feel interested in actually playing it"". In other words, I could appreciate MMORPGs, but couldn't really get myself to play them again.But I can play and enjoy FFXIV easily. It's hard to pin-point why: the game isn't very innovative, most of its mechanics have been used in multiple western and/or eastern MMORPGs before it. But it blends them well, and everything feels very polished and sleeky. And the Final Fantasy style gameworld, full of fan-service for fans of the series, lends itself well for a relaxing experience with gorgeous scenary. To help with that, the community seems to be more pleasing and much less toxic than most other MMOs, too.			"

												FFXIV:ARR is a great game in my opinion. Graphics look great, fighting is fast and exciting, most of the community is helpful, crafting and gathering is fresh and has many perks. Que times can take a while but if you join a decent FC people are usually willing to help, especially since you get bonus Gil/Exp/Currency for helping someone run a dungeon for the first time. I love that you only need 1 Character to level all the classes.14 Free day trial or up to level 20 is a pretty generous trial for a game of this magnitude My only complaint is the amount of kitty people.

												If you love Final Fantasy games and are unsure about picking it up because its a MMO and it'll take away from the experience. Then allow me to reassure you, Even though its an MMO, FFXIV has done it amazingly well with their Story. Taking part with the MMO basics of Dungeons, Raids and Guilds, as well as putting their own twist on it with Aeons/Primals, If you don't get hooked on the fights, The music will get you to come back to them, Each having an amazing soundtrack as it fires you up to fight onward, Coming from someone who enjoys Final Fantasy games in a whole and has put hours upon hours into them, Going to A Realm Reborn was a great refreshing feeling.So far my best experience is the Trial fights with all the different Primals they have in store for you, Not only in A Realm Reborn, but in the Heavensward Expansion as well. Each having a great impact and leaving you wanting to go at them again and again.One other thing to mention is that Final Fantasy 14 allows you to change classes at will, so theres no need to make another character to play a different class, You may begin a new class at anytime by talking to their respected Guilds and taking on their Quests.Long story short, The games great, Ive had countless hours of fun, Trials kept me wanting to come back and VS tough opponents, Dungeons had great mechanics and a great level curve, The music is amazing to listen to, Although it is Pay to Play, You can start a free trial to see if you would like it or not, But Would recommend.

												A beautiful, easy to play, time-consuming to master, approachable MMORPG. There are tons of things to do, seasonal events, plenty of PvE, and even some PvP for those interested. The models are very well done, and the whole thing can be played in 1st or 3rd person. As usual, it's the kind of experience one can get lost in, with a strong social aspect. Indeed I've found it can be terribly boring to play alone once you've had and lost a close group of friends. There are many good times to be had here.			"

												This game is possibly one of the best MMOs i've ever played. dont be fooled by my 1.5 hours on record. i personally bought the disc edition of this game so my main account is outside of the steam client. i can guarantee you i have well over 1500 hours into this game.Although some of the updates of late have been controversial, there is no shortage of fantastic content in this game and it is easy to see that square enix spared no expense. from start to end game, there is rarely a dull moment since every single zone, dungeon, and raid, is completely unique and jammed full of amazing character and design.the music in this game is second to none. honestly, it is the type of music that CREATES nostalgia within you. while the main themes of the game are completely new and inovative, the game incorporates many of the prior games' iconic music tracks such as final fantasy 7 golden saucer, ff7 costa del sol, and many remixes of battle themes from throughout the series. you will find yourself humming along to the theme of a boss fight you have never been in and then realize ""Hey! this is from ff4!"". but truthfuly, there is nothing like coming back to your starting city and being welcomed by the grand theme of Ul' Dah, or the Liberating bagpipes of Limsa Lominsa. even the perky, yet calm harp and flute of Gridania. i would buy the game just for the music.The graphics in this game are some of the best graphics you will find in an mmo. there are others that boast amazing graphics that surpass this, but the style is quite amazing.the crafting system is the best i have ever experienced and is extremely rewarding. the economy is also, alive and thriving. i can guarantee that you will get many many hours of entertainment out of this game.

												I strongly recommend this as an immersive, beautiful, extensively narrative-driven experience, to the point even the crafters and gatherers get their own storylines! While the combat is simplified, it's neither too simple nor too frustrating, and the native controller support is an absolute joy. More depth and complexity can be found in the crafting and gathering systems, although the game is still quite easy to understand.The world, while only consisting of a few maps, is gorgeous, memorable, and full of detail, both in characters and environment.The music is also fantastic, expressing a broad array of emotions, from the tender to the grand. The boss music as well is varied and intense and uses a variety of styles and instrumentation.Achievement hunters might find the game a bit of a grind, as some of the achievements are literally just grindwalls, especially the ones relating to the game's minigame hub, but the fact that most game systems have achievements attached to them, and the sheer array of activities that can be done, mean achievement-hunting is fairly involved and interesting from an intellectual point of view.

												I have never liked mmorpg's in general though i have tried a few like WoW, Guild Wars 2, and some F2P titles. I thought the pacing and grinding was awful, i could never get past lvl 30 because by then I was too bored. This game however is something else. I'm a lvl 54 paladin by now. Here's why: there's a very captivating storyline, the gameplay mechanics are awesome (although the global cooldown might be a bit slow for some), the pacing is brilliant; you level quickly due to the main scenario quests and a thing called dungeon roulette (the game throws you in a random dungeon for an exp reward).Perhaps the most important thing (for me at least) since I never got to the endgame of an MMO before: the community is extremely helpful for new players, be it the guild you're in or the randomly selected partymembers with which you have to clear a dungeon. People were always ready to help out. There's also a lot of nostalgia-bombing for fans of Final Fantasy, but you absolutely don't have to have played the games beforehand.Overall I recommend this game for newer MMORPG players as well as older players.

												Absolutely love, love, love this game!  I am a former WoW player and after playing FFXIV, there is no way I will ever play WoW again.  If you like a good, story driven MMO with intricate crafting, multiclass single characters (you can be every class in this game on just one character!) and a very wide range of activities, events and achievements, Final Fantasy XIV:  A Realm Reborn and Heavensward are what you want to sink your teeth into.

												This game... is addictive.I have not played much endgame, I'm sure it's fantastic, this is a run-of-the-mill MMORPG however. You played Tera, Aion, Rift, WoW, Guld Wars 2, etc, you'll see the familiar elements, the grinds, the farming, etc. So I'll list some pros/cons below:Pros:So much to do (explained below)Graphics""Engaging"" cinematics, for real, this game has the most cinematics for a MMORPG I've seen yet (and I played SW:KoTOR)Cons:Semi-clunky (combat, movement, etc)Same old grind, if you want an MMORPG without some type of farm/grind, keep looking and good luck.So much to do:FIrst, the class system is fantastic. Anyone can be any class, crafting, and gathering profession. You wanna be a cook? Go for it, wanna be a warrior and a mage? You can (just not at the same time obviously).This, for me, was one of the things I was most warry about, but ended up loving. Finally, I can play an MMORPG game where I can do whatever I want with no consequences. All it takes is a switch of gear (your main-hand weapon determines you current class/profession). Of course it has a well-done gear swap system as well (can save gear sets, etc), and furthermore there's a ""reccomended gear button to auto-equip you for your current class/profession, fantastic.The sheer multitude of classes, professions, and 3 gathering professions is amazing... you will NEVER search for something to do. Along with little quests, dungeons, scenarios, a ""game room"" type area you will not want.Now... if your goal is to reach endgame and do that content.... you may find the above frustrating and in your way. If you want to immerse yourself in the lore, enjoy the world and characters and various things to do, then you will be satisfied as I was. I've been playing for 71 hours, still haven't reached max level (even for the base game), but I've been levelling 3 classes, 5 professions, all 3 of the gathering professions).On that note, the gathering system and crafting system is the best I have seen, very in-depth. Fishing not only helps other professions, for example, but you also have a fishing log, showing you various areas you've fished at, fish found there, etc. If you like filling out logs and collecting ♥♥♥♥, this game has you covered.The crafting system also has abilities (like combat), to improve and craft you items. You don't simply hit a button and wait for a timer to craft! However, if that's what you want then yes, there is a ""quick-craft"" button that does that :)About the CLUNKY aspect. The overall feel is clunky not in a bad way, but compared to other games (WoW, Wild Star, etc) it falls more in line with GW2 for movement and combat, but slightly less fluid. There is a weight to movement and actions, the weight is not bad, but it's like the difference between playing Gears of War and Halo or Team Fortress 2 and CoD. Every button in FF14 has a purpose, every movement a reason, and you can feel it.Overall, this is one the most addictive MMORPG's I've played in a while... and I've played a good amount. This is the FIRST one besides WoW that I actually cared about the lore, and the first game where I've actually said ""Wow... this crafting system is actually nice."" Hell, I even enjoying fishing, fishing! If you've ever played WoW and levelled fishing to 700+ you'll understand what a feat it is for me to actually say I enjoy fishing in a game (that isn't specifically designed solely for fishing).Anyway, review too long and bulky, my work here is done.

												A very solid MMORPG. Sticks to many of the traditional aspects that made the genre popular while putting its own spin on things, as well as keeping the Final Fantasy vibe alive and well.  Final Fantasy fans who are not very familiar with MMORPGs will find this to be a good entry point into the genre. MMO fans should get enjoyment out of it even if they are not big into the Final Fantasy series, although they may not appreciate it as much as somebody who is very familiar with the Final Fantasy series.  Even if you aren't a fan of playing MMOs, you can still get a good experience just by playing through the main storyline.  Since the first month of game time comes free, that gives you more than enough time to play through the story if that's all you desire to do. It's definitely worth picking up and trying. It's a fun game and my MMO of choice.			"

												If there's an MMO out there today that is worth playing - this is it. Fun dungeons, great group play, hard at times (big plus), you only need 1 character (1 character can be any class you want him to be) and its huge. 10 bucks? It's a steal. You got nothing to lose if you at least try it. Don't worry about the expansion, you won't get to do everything by the time the first 30 days of free game time last. Thumbs up!			"

												At this point, writing a review is a bit like asking Gordon Ramsay if he likes to cook. I have nearly 300 hours in this game as of writing, and I've enjoyed every single one of them. Also I manage perfectly well to balance my study with this game. If anything it actually IMPROVED my performance, it drives me to work harder during the day so I have more free time during the evenings to play.The good:+ Summarized: This game takes everything from other MMOs that works, strips out what doesn't work, and innovates on features in its own way.+ The dev team is very much aware that the original FFXIV had a horrible start, and their mantra is ""earn and deserve the players' trust"". They deliberately chose to keep the game subscription-based because it offers them and the players more stability.+ The cross-server Duty Finder lets you queue up for every form of cooperative content from wherever you are in the world.+ Big bonuses for people who repeat old content in the Duty Finder (sadly only once per day), to encourage keeping storyline content populated so you won't get stuck just because you can't find anyone to play with.+ Classes are varied and the handful I've tried are fun to play. At level 30, every class evolves into one or two Jobs that are even more specialized.+ You can train every class on a single character. In fact most Jobs have a secondary class requirement that also needs to be trained.+ There are two levels of subscription, Entry and Standard. Entry is cheaper than Standard, but doesn't allow recurring payments and restricts you to 1 character per server, 8 in total. But since you can just train every class on a single character anyway, this won't actually lock you out of anything.+ The world is beautiful and feels alive.+ The lore and story are of true Final Fantasy levels, and better than I've seen in any other MMO.+ The game tries to do that ""chosen one in a world of chosen ones"" that story-heavy MMOs are all guilty of, but actually executes it very well. In-storyline, your character becomes something of a living legend after a while, and everyone acknowledges that you faced off with terrible monsters and lived to tell the tale. When someone does question your skills in the storyline, it's usually because they actually are a fool.+ Boss battles are extremely memorable, and all have interesting mechanics.+ The music. Oh God, the music. The regular zone music is already plenty good and immersive, but the composer went completely wild with the dungeon and boss themes. Expect epic choires, punk rock and heavy metal. One boss in particular has 5 different phases, and every phase has its own song.'The middle:~ Truly understanding the mechanics of your class/job and the role you fulfill in party dynamic takes quite some time and willingness to learn. If someone gives you good advice, listen to it. I learned the most by making mistakes, and getting tips on what I should have done differently from people who were there with me. This process still continues today, and I only get better by it.The bad:- Levelling alternate classes gets quite grindy. You get massive XP boosts when you level classes that are below the level of your highest class, but even with that you'll need to invest a lot of time past level 30. Your primary class should be fine doing only Main Story Quests most of the time, at least until you reach Heavensward.- You start with a lot of inventory space and even an armoury chest to store your equipment in, but you will inevitably run into the limits of this with how many crafting materials there are in the game, and how many different sets of equipment you need if you play multiple classes. Rather than a bank the game features retainer NPCs which can do something to alleviate the burden, but I think the game would really benefit of a Guild Wars (2) type of crafting material specific storage.- There is a shortage of Tanks and Healers in the Duty Finder queues. But this isn't really the game's fault, and multi-classing makes it easy to just ask a friend to jump in for a role if you really can't find anyone.- Not all parts of the story are equally good, and some characters are very annoying.

This game`s main quest drags u into a story and inmersion making you feel special as u go. go try it and experience it yourself :) can be alot of things to learn before the game really opens up for you but you get there a tiny step at a time ^^			"

												I have put a few hours into this game you could say. I recommend FFXIV as an MMO as I believe it is truly amazing and is a step above other ones out there. FFXIV is completely open for jobs, which is very refreshing instead of making 10 different characters you can have one who has 10 different jobs. Constant work on the development of end game content. Has a wonderful storyline throughout the entire game and has many hints to other Final Fantasy games from characters names (Which is common for the series) to enemies within dungeons and raids.			"

												I LOVE this game so far! Quitting WoW after 10 years and was looking for an MMO with depth. I've dabbled in Aion and Rift periodically, but thought I'd try FF 14. The negatives coming from World of Warcraft are the numerous loading screens and the steep learning curve. BUT!!! Honestly, the game is good enough that I don't mind much. The GCD is rather long initially, but combat speeds up as you receive more abilities. The ability to change classes on the fly is fantastic. This can be a drawback as it is easy to get sidetracked if you try to level everything at the same time. The graphics and attention to detail are stunning (especially if you like anime/Japanese-style art). FFXIV is heavily story-driven. Sadly, the cut-scenes aren't always voice acted, but many of them are interesting or entertaining for someone new to the franchise. I popped onto WoW to help my husband last night and it felt shallow and uninspired compared to FFXIV.If you are coming from Warcraft, bring your map/navigating skills. It took me a bit to get used to the maps/navigating compared to other MMOs. Also, do not skip the help topics...it will save you a LOT of trouble.			"

												Having played (and still am playing) World of Warcraft I've been over the MMO market to find one as fun as WoW. Warhammer Online didnt work for me, The Old Republic had nothing in the way of content (also its Star Wars, don't heavily like the series), Maple Story was ok in small doses, and Tera, while pretty, has one ♥♥♥♥ community.So while I knew of the original FFXI I never played it and got the basics from hearsay, and the original launch of FFXIV left me glad I had no interest, cut to the present and SE decided to pull it, rework the game, and with Naoki Yoshida's wonderful direction remade and released a truly fantastic MMO that reminded me of the first time I played WoW.Eorzea literally grabbed me like Azeroth first did and I was everywhere, I had my first timer bungles yes, but the game is fair in its guidance and shows you where to go. Dungeons are only 4 people instead of a traditional 5 but that also seems to help on content as with 5 you could have one person carry everything with 4 everyone must pull their own weight. Dungeons offer a fine line of challenge, reward, and ease, you do a hard mode dungeon, wipe on a boss several times but push it more and eventually kill it and get loot and no one is mad but glad? Always wonderful. While young, the games raiding is solid if needs just a bit more tweaking, not I have not done Coil so I cant speak on those as I know they are quite challenging but it all works well and wonderful.Overall I got my monthly payment of enjoyment, and with the developers constantly working on new content for everyone to do it doesnt get stale, also PLAYER HOUSING!

												I thought it was about time to write a review for this, since I've put quite some time into it.Final Fantasy 14 is really freaking amazing. There is always so much content for you to be doing.FF14 was my second paid MMO, first being a... RUNE game... Yeah you know the one. Anyway, this game just seems so much more superior than the other MMOs I have played. Both free and paid.When I first started playing this, I was clueless on so much. The game throws a lot at you in the beginning but it's also not difficult to catch on. I started in Ul'Dah, and for those who have played the game might know how easy it is for a newbie to get lost there in the beginning!The game has multiple classes you can play as. You can start as a Gladiator, Lancer, Arcanist... Anything available, really! And to make it better, once you reach level 10 (I think...), you are told that you can now change class whenever you wish. That's right, you read that correctly. So if you started as a Gladiator and then was having second thoughts, you can go ahead and change your class to whatever you want. Anything!There are also multiple crafting classes and gathering classes. Again, you can become these whenever you please. Crafters will make things like armours, weapons, foods and potions. And believe me, your gatherers and crafters are fantastic money makers.Now onto the content. Final Fantasy 14 is FLOOOOOODED with content. You really won't get bored. (Seriously, look at my time played ._.). The story is amazing, and I won't talk much about it to avoid spoilers. But IT'S GOOD. There is plenty of side quests for you to enjoy too. Some of them are quite funny, like the Hildibrand sidequest. Ontop of the quests, there are loads of dungeons, raids, primal fights and even PVP.You definately will not get bored playing this game. You'll always find yourself being able to do something. You might wanna go kill things to level up, run a dungeon, go and explore the world or sit down by a lake and do some fishing.The choice is yours, Adventurer ;)			"

I will update this review probably once I reach 1000+ hours. My hours are 160 at the time of this review.So you probably want a review from someone who doesn't play MMOs, or at least, didn't. I played Runescape back in 2007 with some friends. That was the only MMO I've ever played. FFXIV was still easy to learn, and I just didn't feel a stranger at all. It's impossible to not enjoy this game unless you just hate MMO's, or are impatient.I bought this like a month ago and I just reached level 50 dragoon. It's all so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. The story is incredible, the music is stunning, the art is amazing, graphics are ridiculously beautiful. The classes (fighting classes, crafting classes, and gathering classes) are all uniquely rewarding. With that said, you can literally play as ANY class in the entire game with a single character. Wanna be a gladiator? Equip a sword. Miner? Equip a pickaxe. Wanna just ♥♥♥♥in cook? Equip a skillet. The community is wonderful. I'm no veteran hence my hours played, but I'm in a great Free Company (like a clan in other games) with great players that make me feel at home.However, this is definitely not a game for everyone. It could be quite intimidating to the average casual gamer who doesn't understand the basic principles of most MMO games. This game requires quite a bit of your time and patience. So, I would absolutely recommend looking up gameplay videos to understand the combat system if you're really questioning this purchase.I guess the only downside is I wasted my entire summer on a single video game. In the real life that sucks, but in Eorzea, it has been so wonderful.			"

												IMPORTANT: If you buy the steam version of ARR every new expansion must be bought from steam, because steam and windows keys are different, BUT, if you buy the steam version on the Mogstation website (where you can manage your ff14 account) you get the option to buy time using your steam wallet (it takes you to the steamwebsite and it shows how much is going to cost using your currency)Review:Well...i never thought i was gonna be hooked with an MMO because of the story.....seriously, best godmman plot in an MMO, even some side stories unlock at the end of the basic story have incredible character development.Also, if i ever got bored playing a class, all i had to do is change my weapon and im done, which in my opinion is the best idea ever, since the worst thing an mmo can have is repetition, so being able to change classes whenever i want is the best, hell they even have a unique story for every basic class and its respective Job upgrade.

												This is a game that I was unsure whether or not I would be able to get into it at first.  However, once I starting playing and created my character, I was in for a treat.  Many people and news outlets have said how terrible 1.0 was and that a completely new team at Square Enix was formed to create this game.  This game was even created from the ground up since there was no way to fix the original due to outdated code and other factors.  This game was very worthy of my time and still is.  The combat is very fluid, the different zones that you visit are all unique and have some factors that make it stand out  the various dungeons and trials that you do with other players are all very fun, this game is cross platform between PC, PS3, and PS4 players meaning that regardless of platfrom, you are all playing with each other, the endgame gives you something to do with more harder dungeons, trials, and raids,  and the story in this game is probably one of the most interesting stories that is part of a Final Fantasy game.If you are still unsure whether or not you should invest some time in this game, there is a 15 day free trial that you can try out.

												IMPORTANT: If you buy the steam version of ARR every new expansion must be bought from steam, because steam and windows keys are different, BUT, if you buy the steam version on the Mogstation website (where you can manage your ff14 account) you get the option to buy time using your steam wallet (it takes you to the steamwebsite and it shows how much is going to cost using your currency)Review:Well...i never thought i was gonna be hooked with an MMO because of the story.....seriously, best godmman plot in an MMO, even some side stories unlock at the end of the basic story have incredible character development.Also, if i ever got bored playing a class, all i had to do is change my weapon and im done, which in my opinion is the best idea ever, since the worst thing an mmo can have is repetition, so being able to change classes whenever i want is the best, hell they even have a unique story for every basic class and its respective Job upgrade.

Love the fate system, and the ability to switch between any class and to multiclass.  Also like how the game is a lot more soloable than Final Fantasy 11.  Fun game, glad I bought it.			"

												A pretty solid MMO experience, though depending on what you are looking for your opinion may vary. If you are or were a WoW player who was mostly into PVE, you will probably like this. It's at least worth looking at via the free demo on the official site before deciding on buying and subbing.I would suggest probably not buying this through Steam, though.  "

												looks fun, but i wish my game wooked for once. First the game couldn't find the survers. Then for some reason my password to get in was wrong. After geting that fixed I tried to get in again and it lost conection to the servers. I thought I should put a One-Time Password on my acount so the password dosn't get changed by someone again, and now my One-Time Password is somehow behind everything so I can't log on to my Square Enix acount anymore. To top it off I didn't know the only way to remove the One-Time Password was to type in a randomized code that I was didn't get to wright down before the thing didn't want to work anymore. So ya now I can't refund the game because I left it open when I thought it was downloading a update so I've got 17 hours on my acount looking at the log in screan and I can't buy another copy on steam because it thinks I alredy have it. Anyway the game is fun so I would recommend the game, but don't put a One-Time Password on your acount unless you write down the random password to remove it directly after puting it on.			"

												This game is literally the best MMO I ever played. I bought it while on sale during christmas days and not a day has passed since where I haven't played. The character creation has not as many options as others,but still enough to customize a decent character. The monthly fee for playing (13€) us worth paying. There's a lot to do and discover: One character can have all classes and jobs,there's no need for an endless character list. Also the character is perfectly integrated in cutscenes and the english translation of the story is well-made aswell as the translation for other stuff (e. g. open world events [FATEs]). Also the game has a beautiful world graphic wise,it just feels good to walk/mount through.Every area has it's own style.Gameplaywise it's the basic MMO thing: you use your skills and your chara does autoattacks,but every class is made interesting with it's own features. For example Conjurer (cleric): They have a skill wich switches their healingstat with their magdmg stat and increases magdmg by 10%/reduces healing by 20%,wich makes them great to play solo,unlike in other MMOs. Also the NPC-Mentors of all classes are vbery memorable and characteristic,the dialogues all are worth reading.Conclusion:This game is worth it. Once you start playing it,you will be able to feel how much love and detail was put into the game (except that long hair still glitches through some clothing),in music,dialogues,the landscapes and also the story.And you will learn how to love and hate characters and bosses at the same time.

I am a 8 year vet of WoW and I can say this is a bit funner then Warlords. It just got old to fast for me I guess.

I'm way on my way to level 60, learning all kinds of new tactics and ways to hit things much harder than I ever thought possible and learning to trade in an actual working economy in game. Loved it so much I bought the expansion and I just can't get enough. Give it a try people! Please note though, there seem to be compatibility issues with Steam bought and physical game copies which stops you from buying a physical copy of the expansion...not sure if that's yet fixed but keep it in mind. Seriously fun, better with friends, highly recommended.(P.S. Please send help, have been levelling my carpenter and haven't eaten for 2 days)			"

												Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is, without a doubt, the best MMO I have had the joy of playing. Of course, I grew up on Free to Plays that bombarded you with microtransactions everywhere you turned, and perhaps it's simply the feel of a clean  'I know exactly what I'm paying for' MMO that makes me love it so much.The dungeon runs are smooth, and every single party I've been in has worked extremely well together. The only quip here I might have is how long some queues take, but if you're in a Free Company, chances are you'll have at least one person there to wait with you- which speeds things up considerably, might I add. Even when I was in a dungeon queue for over an hour, all I had to do was switch gear sets and work on my Blacksmithing. So really, I view the wait times as forcing me to get off my lazy ♥♥♥ and work on some more 'mundane' classes.The idea of being able to play literally every class with /one/ character was, I'll admit, a little overwhelming at first. I didn't understand it all that well, but one of my companymates helped me out and showed me the ropes of juggling more than one class at a time. It's not that difficult once you're used to it.I can't say much for the soundtrack, as I listen to music of my own while playing, but I can say something about the graphics. They're absolutely stunning. Some of the best I've seen for an MMO, honestly. Even little things, down to how clothes and hair blow when the wind picks up, and how your clothes will actually change texture if it's raining to actually make them look wet.The community is actually surprisingly low-key, friendly, and helpful. I've only been playing for a few days and I've already made over 20 friends who've helped me understand quite a bit about the game. The only downside is I get a lot of whispers from spammers. They're easy enough to blacklist, which is another very well-implemented system, so it's not a big problem either.Overall, I just really enjoy XIV. Maybe I haven't been playing long enough to say my piece, but it's a stellar MMO and if you're a fan of either FF or MMOs you should definitely check it out. Make sure you have enough for the monthly fees, because it'll have you wasting all your money.			"

												For some reason Steam doesn't show me playing when I launch the game, but I do have many hours into the game. Wanted to add that before my review.It's just really good. I don't really know what to say. Whether this be your first MMO or not, it's a completely solid experience. I was out of the MMO scene for a while, pretty much stopped playing them towards the end of WoW's Wrath of the Lich King expansion. Played plenty of others, was originally really hyped for Guild Wars 2 but felt it was entirely disappointing and the genre fell out of favor with me for a while. Never was the biggest Final Fantasy fan either, of those that I've played IX is my favorite, but I had some friends get into XIV when A Realm Reborn launched and decided to try it out. I absolutely adore this game. The content is good, the progression is well done, and all the jobs feel interesting and fun and what's better is that you can do every job on one character. It has the right amount of difficulty and accesibility. You don't have to do long attunement chores to get content unlocked. Instead, you unlock content through short quests, whether it be part of the main story or side quests, and it gives you a reason to be there by giving you lore behind the dungeons.There's also plenty of end game content, and the story continues even after you hit max level. You have hard modes of dungeons you've done previously, but it's not just new mechanics as they feel like whole new dungeons. Halatali Hard has you going a different route with whole new bosses as an example. You have two 24 man raids, Crystal Tower and Syrcus Tower, and the hardest content in the game is 8 man (Coil of Bahamut). You have the post-50 primals such as Ramuh or Shiva and hard modes of the pre-50 primals like Titan HM or Titan EX. It's a game with plenty of fun and interesting encounters, and with a new expansion coming out sometime in the spring you'll have even more to look forward to including new jobs, a new race, and more story. Not to mention other post-50 content like Hildibrand which is an awesome quest-line.If you're wanting to try it out but not sure, there is a trial and I recommend sticking with it until you get to Ifrit at around level 20. The story that leads you to Ifrit and as well as the fight itself is what made me really want to see more of the game. That isn't to say there's not some low points in the story, especially pre-50, but there's some great moments and it only gets better once you hit max level on your first job.XIV provides plenty for both the hardcore raider with hitting the Coil of Bahamut, or the more causual minded MMO player who just wants to chill with friends. Was game of the year last year for me, and will probably be again this year. At least a 9/10 in the MMO genre, and currently the best subscription based MMO on the market.			"

												I played WoW for 6ish years on and off, and when I was gifted a subscription by my sister, who gave high praise of it, I I thought it couldn't play that differently. WoW set a very rigid image of how an MMO was set up to milk time whenever possible from the user to give the illusion of accomplishment. However, I began to notice very quickly that where WoW wasted your time, FFXIV ditched those gameplay mechanics and replaced it with something more sensable.First, I'll give you a brief look at classes, money, and travel. Travel first because its simple. Remember all those long flight times, and even with flying mounts it didn't compensate for having to traverse the continuous, no-loading-screen continents. In FFXIV you teleport to the zone and that's it, no fuss, maybe a little walking if your destination is in the back of zone.This ties directly into money, so that's next. In FFXIV quests actually give you some substantial amounts of money for getting everything you need from gear to materials for professions. However, repair costs ramp rather quickly, as do teleportation expenses, so part of managing your character becomes maintaining enough income to sustain everything you need. Daily quests and dungeon queues are actually important if you don't maintain any crafting/gathering skills, unlike WoW where they're a chore simply to improve a reputation with a side faction.Classes are completely different as well. Unlike WoW where you get locked into focusing on a class unless you want to start up a whole new character, and restricted to 2 professions, FFXIV puts no barriers in your way. One character can level to 50 on every tank, dps, healer, crafting and gathering profession, and there are economic and gameplay insentives for expanding your knowledge of the game with this. Every class/profession has 2-3 cross-class skills that can enchance the abilities of another, not just combat but also in professions. The more professions you level, the easier it becomes to be independant of their version of the Auction House, as well as make boatloads of money.Last, I guess I can put some facts down about differences in guilds and endgame. In WoW, you had to find a dedicated guild and organize parties yourself to complete 10 or 25 raids, which essentially the home to all the best-in-slot gear. They eventually added in a token system where hard 5 mans and the 10 mans would grant accumulative currency for buying equivalent or near-BiS items. However, you'd find yourself tediously working through a raid clear all week, and very rarely a boss would drop something useful to you (and you actually win the roll), making it akin to the lottery everytime you actually got something you needed. In FFXIV, they bipassed this by making the token gear the BiS in most or all cases. If your gear dropped in 4man dungeons you were always the only class that would be able to need on it, and even in the 8 or 24mans there would rarely be another class-mate (HEH).  Also, there's nothing particularly unique a dps brings to the table than another, same with tanks and healers. Some do things better than others, but the developers saw class balance as an important thing to accomplish, UNLIKE WOW. Holy ♥♥♥♥, just remembering how useless they would make certain classes from patch to patch is infuriating as I'm writing this. That doesn't happen in FFXIV, in fact, you can randomly queue for the endgame raids everyday, multiple times a day if you want. Farming those tokens is easy, and queues are generally short. The only weekly restriction is on the current endgame dungeon's loot, which is 1 drop a week.TL;DR: FFXIV doesn't waste your time, and seems more interested in enjoyable gameplay than epenis upgrades to flaunt over your fellow players that are more busy IRL.

												Pros: - Intersting story that isn't hard to follow and has decently played out cutscenes.- Collision/Impact style based tab target, Not the usual tab target where you can clip through people/npc/enemies, It actually makes you dodge attacks and not just stand there bored pressing 1 , 2 , 3 repeatedly untill the mob dies like generic tab target games.- Brings back the old type of class systems where you can do everything on the one character, An aspect I personally love because it means you dont have to play through the same story over... and over... and over... to play the different types of classes available or master different professions - you only need the one character.- Game lets me be a Ninja Catgirl.Cons: - Pay to play.- Its still tab target.- No open world pvp/Very little pvp content.- Servers are pretty limited, Europe/Japan/NA.All in all its a good game, Probably not worth the full price unless you plan to dedicate your life to it, On special i'd definitely reccomend it, The amount of content you can do on your one character is staggering and i'd imagine it would take multiple months to get to that level so you wont be bored quickly.Take a week off work, Ignore your friends and social obligations and dive into the world of Eorzea, At the very least you'll leave with a miqo'te fetish.

												Don't let my small game time dissuade you taking my review seriously, I have been playing since 1.0 and most of my logged hours are with the beta client which was patched to the retail client.Anyway not really a review, but this is hands-down the best subscription MMORPG currently on the market. It may feel strange to those who aren't familiar with the Final Fantasy franchise, but to those who are (or are familiar with the original version of FFXIV) this game is now a huge success, and it's not hard to see why.By adopting common traits found in modern MMORPGs, yet dousing it in Final Fantasy flavour, A Realm Reborn feels like an MMORPG while still feeling like a Final Fantasy game. Square Enix are committed to continually updating the game as well, with loaded content patches being released every three months since launch. I hope they continue this trend.Just be wary, you may not enjoy or appreciate the first 30 or so levels, but when you upgrade your class to a fully fledged job and can change jobs whenever you want (providing you are out of combat) and more importantly, when you experience the incredible amount of content that the endgame provides, you will realise that FFXIV is finally reaching the potential we all had hoped for.I can't wait for the first expansion this Spring.Goodbye real life.

												Ignoring my playtime (I actually rebought the game on Steam, I'm sure I'd have upwards of a few hundred hours otherwise) this is one of the only MMOs I've been able to get into. It reminds me of the WoW glory days but it seems to have learnt from WoW's mistakes. HOWEVER, keep in mind it's practically a WoW clone in some regards. This is a very 'traditional' mmo. An excellent one, but it still isn't exactly gamebreaking innovative anywhere. You still have the old school action hotbar combat with tab targetting, you still work off an ability rotation, the holy trinity class system is here, etc.If you don't LIKE those systems, then this game probably isn't for you. If you're looking for an alternative to the giant that is WoW then this is an excellent choice. Personally as someone who LOVED Guild Wars 2 but was immensely bored by the lack of end game (And ♥♥♥♥ Anet's expansion and how they handled pricing) FFXIV was an extremely welcome sight. This game has some of my favorite raids and a seriously massive amount of end game content with lots more being added every few months. Even if you aren't a super hardcore MMO player I find the game excellent to revisit every few months just to check out the new content.			"

												WARNING PLEASE READ:Save your soul if you tend to play this game and also make sure to put your girlfrind aside, your dog aside, your kids aside, your job aside and also the life you don't have aside as well.There are so many things about this game I love and I'm not even max level yet. This game is by far one of the best mmorpg games I've played for a PvE experence. The grind is a fun grind where you can sit back and have fun. Also this game is so well optimized where I could run it on my old GT 630 (I have a 970 now) on lowest settings and it would look like it was on high, plus there was hardly any lag (Besides the main square at limsa lominsa everything goes to hell) But the only downside is the amount you have to pay. It costs 155.88 US$ for 1 year of a subscription and that is a lot to pay for one game, not only that but the addons such as hevensword and to buy the game itself and if you want a good ceremony of eternal bonding deal and also more retainers the money just keeps adding up.Overall its a 7.5/10]=-=[Pros]=-=[Smoothe, stunning gameplaycinematic cutscenes are long and gratifyingwonderful community (Depending on the server you are on I am in Brynhildr)enticing end game gear that is worth working up tosemiregular updates with a good amount of content in each realeaseA fun grind instead of boring.Amazing charatcer creation (Usually takes me an hour making my charater)you can be a neko.]=-=[Cons]=-=[Payment is a ♥♥♥♥♥Pray to your one and only RNGodThe Market Board is VERY franticSomewhat limited invortory space.~Player of the game~And finally a duengeon rant:If you are a DPS queueing for a duengeon you better watch a movie and go pick corn out of your local corn feild, peal the corn, dry the cernals out and after a while then cook the corn cernals into popcorn then you want to make your own caramel dressing to put over that popcorn to cure your salty soul and soon after when you finally sit down to enjoy your movie you can finally relax of the hard working labor you just did to make your popcorn and eat it. Once you get back to your computer or playstation you will finally be ready to enter your duengeon. (This has been an over dramatic decription of how long it takes and how I feel when I have to solo duengeons as a DPS)			"

												I'm not an MMO player, but I love FInal Fantasy. And that's what drew me to play this game after hearing that the story and music were the best in the FF series in a decade. Having beaten the story up to the end of Heavensward, I can confirm that is true. Although the gameplay is classic MMO, the atmosphere, music and story all bring back memories of the Final Fantasy series. The story will have multiple twists and turns and will keep you wanting to know what happens next. The Heavensward expansion is especially good with this imo. To note though, because it is an MMO, there ARE portions of the main story questline that are filled with filler quests and fetch quests. They definitely felt dull, and feel like Square just put them in to increase the amount of ""content"" in the main story when they didn't need to. Again, the Heavensward expansion did not have that. The main culprit is the post-ARR, patch 2.1-2.4 content.The game has some of best FF music in awhile, enough to make me seriously want the soundtrack. There are a lot of memorable area/city music and battle/boss themes. The world and areas are another strength. There are many varied locations in the world, and some beautiful scenes. The lore is extensive, and I can't wait till they open up even more of the world. There is so much left unexplored in the world and story (that will most likely be explored in future content).In terms of end game content, the constant updates gives you enough things to do throughout even if it is possible to ""binge"" through all of it fairly quickly. Raids are fun and challenging.In terms of an MMO game, there isn't too much innovation, but FFXIV:ARR executes everything really well and hence its status as the foremost MMO rival to WoW.			"

												This game is an overall amazing and stunning MMO to play and my favorite yet. It is very rare to find an MMO that just completely nails so many amazing features at once. This game has a very nice social aspect to it with a wide variety of emotes, housing, mini games, guilds and more that just allow the very large player base to interact like few other MMOs. This game creates a wonderful atmosphere with it's visually stunning graphic style and quality. It also features one of the hardest sets of raid content I have ever experienced. The game has a large variety of raids and dungeons at varying difficulties that allow for both casual and hard core raiders to enjoy themselves. The easier raids are just slightly more mechanically driven than WoW's Raid Finder while the highest tier of raids take more skill than almost any MMO I have played. This game almost has it all for an amazing target based MMO with amazing developers that literally took a dying game and turned it into my favorite MMO to date. I highly recommend this game to any MMO fan.			"

												I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet, but my play time should speak for itself. Do not confuse this game with the atrocity that was XIV 1.0. Square Enix literally dropped a Bahamut meteor on that game to crash the servers and reimagine it as the beautiful experience it is today. Graphics are top-notch, at least if you have a decent enough rig to play it on high quality. The community overall is incredible, though your experience will vary by server, play times, and free company allegiance (FFXIV's version of guilds). Inter-played cooperation is mandatory for endgame content, and the game sets you up very nicely to learn your chosen role well by level 50. And then if you decide you don't like that role... all you have to do is switch weapons to a different class and try again.Hallelujah, no more multiple characters to play multiple classes; I'm looking at you, WoW. Final Fantasy's job system makes it totally feasible to level every class to cap without having to jam up a server with 10 different characters, and you might be surprised by the number of people that do exactly that. Even the crafting system is much more interactive than others I've tried, and it's the crafters and gatherers that drive the game's economy. The sense of community is all-inclusive with plenty of experienced players willing to lend a hand to upstarts, though of course don't expect everyone to be this way. Like any game, this one has its elitists but the funny part is that some of those still haven't beaten the last raid.The best pieces of advice I can give you are these:1) If you buy the game, give it until around level 30 to start getting truly fun. That's where you unlock your job (as opposed to your class), earning you extra abilities, and it's where the dungeons start to get really fun.2) Once you hit level 50, there is a HUGE learning curve jump when you get to extreme mode primals and the Coils of Bahamut. That's not to say these things are impassable, but you will have to buckle down and learn the mechanics rather than expecting a clear on your first try.3) If you get lost, use the /sh shout function in chat. Talk to someone! I can almost guarantee there will be someone around to lend a helping hand.4) Listen when people give you advice. 90% of the time, they say it because they want to help improve their server's experience, not because they think you're a n00b that sux.5) If you're new to the game and chose the Brynhildr server, hit up Taliel Sicilian. ;)			"

												This game is an overall amazing and stunning MMO to play and my favorite yet. It is very rare to find an MMO that just completely nails so many amazing features at once. This game has a very nice social aspect to it with a wide variety of emotes, housing, mini games, guilds and more that just allow the very large player base to interact like few other MMOs. This game creates a wonderful atmosphere with it's visually stunning graphic style and quality. It also features one of the hardest sets of raid content I have ever experienced. The game has a large variety of raids and dungeons at varying difficulties that allow for both casual and hard core raiders to enjoy themselves. The easier raids are just slightly more mechanically driven than WoW's Raid Finder while the highest tier of raids take more skill than almost any MMO I have played. This game almost has it all for an amazing target based MMO with amazing developers that literally took a dying game and turned it into my favorite MMO to date. I highly recommend this game to any MMO fan.			"

												Pros: - Intersting story that isn't hard to follow and has decently played out cutscenes.- Collision/Impact style based tab target, Not the usual tab target where you can clip through people/npc/enemies, It actually makes you dodge attacks and not just stand there bored pressing 1 , 2 , 3 repeatedly untill the mob dies like generic tab target games.- Brings back the old type of class systems where you can do everything on the one character, An aspect I personally love because it means you dont have to play through the same story over... and over... and over... to play the different types of classes available or master different professions - you only need the one character.- Game lets me be a Ninja Catgirl.Cons: - Pay to play.- Its still tab target.- No open world pvp/Very little pvp content.- Servers are pretty limited, Europe/Japan/NA.All in all its a good game, Probably not worth the full price unless you plan to dedicate your life to it, On special i'd definitely reccomend it, The amount of content you can do on your one character is staggering and i'd imagine it would take multiple months to get to that level so you wont be bored quickly.Take a week off work, Ignore your friends and social obligations and dive into the world of Eorzea, At the very least you'll leave with a miqo'te fetish.

												Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is, without a doubt, the best MMO I have had the joy of playing. Of course, I grew up on Free to Plays that bombarded you with microtransactions everywhere you turned, and perhaps it's simply the feel of a clean  'I know exactly what I'm paying for' MMO that makes me love it so much.The dungeon runs are smooth, and every single party I've been in has worked extremely well together. The only quip here I might have is how long some queues take, but if you're in a Free Company, chances are you'll have at least one person there to wait with you- which speeds things up considerably, might I add. Even when I was in a dungeon queue for over an hour, all I had to do was switch gear sets and work on my Blacksmithing. So really, I view the wait times as forcing me to get off my lazy ♥♥♥ and work on some more 'mundane' classes.The idea of being able to play literally every class with /one/ character was, I'll admit, a little overwhelming at first. I didn't understand it all that well, but one of my companymates helped me out and showed me the ropes of juggling more than one class at a time. It's not that difficult once you're used to it.I can't say much for the soundtrack, as I listen to music of my own while playing, but I can say something about the graphics. They're absolutely stunning. Some of the best I've seen for an MMO, honestly. Even little things, down to how clothes and hair blow when the wind picks up, and how your clothes will actually change texture if it's raining to actually make them look wet.The community is actually surprisingly low-key, friendly, and helpful. I've only been playing for a few days and I've already made over 20 friends who've helped me understand quite a bit about the game. The only downside is I get a lot of whispers from spammers. They're easy enough to blacklist, which is another very well-implemented system, so it's not a big problem either.Overall, I just really enjoy XIV. Maybe I haven't been playing long enough to say my piece, but it's a stellar MMO and if you're a fan of either FF or MMOs you should definitely check it out. Make sure you have enough for the monthly fees, because it'll have you wasting all your money.			"

												For some reason Steam doesn't show me playing when I launch the game, but I do have many hours into the game. Wanted to add that before my review.It's just really good. I don't really know what to say. Whether this be your first MMO or not, it's a completely solid experience. I was out of the MMO scene for a while, pretty much stopped playing them towards the end of WoW's Wrath of the Lich King expansion. Played plenty of others, was originally really hyped for Guild Wars 2 but felt it was entirely disappointing and the genre fell out of favor with me for a while. Never was the biggest Final Fantasy fan either, of those that I've played IX is my favorite, but I had some friends get into XIV when A Realm Reborn launched and decided to try it out. I absolutely adore this game. The content is good, the progression is well done, and all the jobs feel interesting and fun and what's better is that you can do every job on one character. It has the right amount of difficulty and accesibility. You don't have to do long attunement chores to get content unlocked. Instead, you unlock content through short quests, whether it be part of the main story or side quests, and it gives you a reason to be there by giving you lore behind the dungeons.There's also plenty of end game content, and the story continues even after you hit max level. You have hard modes of dungeons you've done previously, but it's not just new mechanics as they feel like whole new dungeons. Halatali Hard has you going a different route with whole new bosses as an example. You have two 24 man raids, Crystal Tower and Syrcus Tower, and the hardest content in the game is 8 man (Coil of Bahamut). You have the post-50 primals such as Ramuh or Shiva and hard modes of the pre-50 primals like Titan HM or Titan EX. It's a game with plenty of fun and interesting encounters, and with a new expansion coming out sometime in the spring you'll have even more to look forward to including new jobs, a new race, and more story. Not to mention other post-50 content like Hildibrand which is an awesome quest-line.If you're wanting to try it out but not sure, there is a trial and I recommend sticking with it until you get to Ifrit at around level 20. The story that leads you to Ifrit and as well as the fight itself is what made me really want to see more of the game. That isn't to say there's not some low points in the story, especially pre-50, but there's some great moments and it only gets better once you hit max level on your first job.XIV provides plenty for both the hardcore raider with hitting the Coil of Bahamut, or the more causual minded MMO player who just wants to chill with friends. Was game of the year last year for me, and will probably be again this year. At least a 9/10 in the MMO genre, and currently the best subscription based MMO on the market.			"

												I played WoW for 6ish years on and off, and when I was gifted a subscription by my sister, who gave high praise of it, I I thought it couldn't play that differently. WoW set a very rigid image of how an MMO was set up to milk time whenever possible from the user to give the illusion of accomplishment. However, I began to notice very quickly that where WoW wasted your time, FFXIV ditched those gameplay mechanics and replaced it with something more sensable.First, I'll give you a brief look at classes, money, and travel. Travel first because its simple. Remember all those long flight times, and even with flying mounts it didn't compensate for having to traverse the continuous, no-loading-screen continents. In FFXIV you teleport to the zone and that's it, no fuss, maybe a little walking if your destination is in the back of zone.This ties directly into money, so that's next. In FFXIV quests actually give you some substantial amounts of money for getting everything you need from gear to materials for professions. However, repair costs ramp rather quickly, as do teleportation expenses, so part of managing your character becomes maintaining enough income to sustain everything you need. Daily quests and dungeon queues are actually important if you don't maintain any crafting/gathering skills, unlike WoW where they're a chore simply to improve a reputation with a side faction.Classes are completely different as well. Unlike WoW where you get locked into focusing on a class unless you want to start up a whole new character, and restricted to 2 professions, FFXIV puts no barriers in your way. One character can level to 50 on every tank, dps, healer, crafting and gathering profession, and there are economic and gameplay insentives for expanding your knowledge of the game with this. Every class/profession has 2-3 cross-class skills that can enchance the abilities of another, not just combat but also in professions. The more professions you level, the easier it becomes to be independant of their version of the Auction House, as well as make boatloads of money.Last, I guess I can put some facts down about differences in guilds and endgame. In WoW, you had to find a dedicated guild and organize parties yourself to complete 10 or 25 raids, which essentially the home to all the best-in-slot gear. They eventually added in a token system where hard 5 mans and the 10 mans would grant accumulative currency for buying equivalent or near-BiS items. However, you'd find yourself tediously working through a raid clear all week, and very rarely a boss would drop something useful to you (and you actually win the roll), making it akin to the lottery everytime you actually got something you needed. In FFXIV, they bipassed this by making the token gear the BiS in most or all cases. If your gear dropped in 4man dungeons you were always the only class that would be able to need on it, and even in the 8 or 24mans there would rarely be another class-mate (HEH).  Also, there's nothing particularly unique a dps brings to the table than another, same with tanks and healers. Some do things better than others, but the developers saw class balance as an important thing to accomplish, UNLIKE WOW. Holy ♥♥♥♥, just remembering how useless they would make certain classes from patch to patch is infuriating as I'm writing this. That doesn't happen in FFXIV, in fact, you can randomly queue for the endgame raids everyday, multiple times a day if you want. Farming those tokens is easy, and queues are generally short. The only weekly restriction is on the current endgame dungeon's loot, which is 1 drop a week.TL;DR: FFXIV doesn't waste your time, and seems more interested in enjoyable gameplay than epenis upgrades to flaunt over your fellow players that are more busy IRL.

												It's funny that almost everyone I've met has been eager to help and once in two dungeons there has always been 1-3 people that wanted to chat with me during the whole runs. I currently have over 140 hours in to the game and there has been only 1 person acting bad towards me and that was in potd when I was playing with a friend in matched party and I wanted to clear this one room and one of the randoms started to curse and act negative towards me. Few minutes later he left us alone there, which made us need to restart that run again because there was no way to take the enemies down with the classes we had. I'm currently around the end of Astral questline, have bought heavensward which I actually bought after 1 week in to the game. I like the game alot, the easy class swap method is great and interesting. There are it's own faults in it though. The Waking Sands area's story quests were a bit irritating to complete and many other places, because they had so many repetive ""go talk to thess guys in these cities and come back here 50 times"" quests. The duty finder sometimes takes around 9-13 minutes to find enough people even though the game informs you that it should usually take 5minutes at max to find all people. There are also few un-important instances in the game, for example Waking Sands's and Raising Stone's office where Minfina is is pretty useless. Haven't touched pvp yet so can't say anything about it yet. It was a shame that the base game didn't have a to handed swordsman class which is the main reason I bought heavensward actually. But overall it's a pretty good game and I'll gladly get the stormblood expansion when It comes out.			"

												People complaining about how this game has a subscription service.People call this game pay to win, its pay to play. There's a difference.Pay to win is the ability to pay for items or in-game currency to gain an advantage over players.Pay to play is a subscription service to keep the game running and keep updates rolling out. If the company didn't make any profit off of this, they would most likely abandon it. As you can see, hundreds of thousands of people don't play this, but it still has an active community.If you complain about this game not being free, complain about World of Warcraft as well, one of the most popular, if not THE most popular mmo out there.I would recommend the game to people who do like WoW, but dislike the 2002 graphics.Play with friends, or find a free company. Community is great.Gameplay : The game has a similar if not identical gameplay system to World of Warcraft. There is a high variety in classes you can choose from, that fits your playstyle.The game has good tutorials that you can use that can be accessed at anytime for reference.If you can't find out how to do something, join a guild, or ask a friend and ask.Or google it.Google exists.Grinding mobs isn't really a thing. Just do leveling roulette and do a dungeon for your level.Classes: Make a character, pick a class, switch whenever.You can change from a gladiator to a conjurer to a pugilist at anytime. Of course you can't do it in combat or in a dungeon, but you can still try out everything.Gear : Main quest should supply you with the gear you need. If not, buy it off the market. If you're poor, run dungeons and get gear from there.Staff and Support : You can enter a support ticket for any bugs or questions that are not found in the FAQ. The FAQ also acts as a tutorial when you can't find out something. Otherwise google it.Google exists.They usually respond within a couple hours or a day, from my experience.Story : So much story. So much. This game is not enjoyable if you don't pay attention to the story. You will end up not knowing what you are even doing. Basically saying, don't rush the game.Bad ♥♥♥♥ : Boring without friends.Story can get boring.Everything can get boring.The game thrives on community and pretty features.You can expect to find me in the Primal data center in Malboro under the name Naomi Sato.Oh you get a 30 day trial which you can basically level up to the max level in a good amount of time.

												This is a beautiful, immersive and meticulously detailed game, the amazing gameplay of which will reel in franchise fans and newcomers alike. While Final Fantasy XIV is unlike its single player predecessors, the lore recognizeable by the long time FF fans creates a story with depth and character interactions generally forgotton by MMO creators. As such, the attention to detail regarding idiosyncracies of certain characters is conveyed through their speech, and this attention to detail extends to the environment as well. Small things that one would barely notice can be found in the game, such as the pattern of shadow created by light shining through a grate, as well as that shadow adjusting alongside the in game time of day; the stitching on armors and clothing, right down to the shadows created by them on the player; and many more details that add to the game's wonderful environment.Within this environment is gameplay that is executed uniquely, and superbly. Skills operate in a style familiar to MMO players, with a relatively short global cooldown, and individual skill cooldowns which vary depending on the strength and usefulness of the skill. Combat utilizes a TP, similar to a stamina system, while magic utilizes the classic MP. Some magic skills of which rely on a casting time, which occurs at the same time as the global cooldown, making casting fluent yet balanced. Skills can be clicked, hotkeyed, setup through user macros, and so forth. The combat truly appeals to every style of play, as well as every player through its broad range of classic Final Fantasy jobs that players can quest as.The questing is reminiscent of other MMOs, and yet the game approaches these concepts in ways that makes them less of a grind than they could be. Rather than the traditional, ""Kill 50 of this monster,"" or ,""Gather 30 of this material,"" the quests bring these numbers down to 5s and 3s, which allows the player to take the time to actually understand WHY they are doing what they are doing.Furthermore, many players will actually be ABLE to do what they want to be doing, for the game has been optimized wonderfully. Areas are divided by loading zones, but the transition between these is so fluent and quick that it took me this long to even remember they were there. With easy to use presets such as ""High end PC"" or ""Low end laptop,"" adjusting settings is user friendly. If you would like to adjust things yourself, there is of course an option for custom settings.Yet what truly sold me on the game, what I believe to be the greatest of its qualities, is the job change system. Many MMOs have you make one character, choose one class or destiny for them, and that's that. You're either forced to pay for some sort of reset, make a new character, completely start over or combinations of the above. NOT in Final Fantasy XIV. By simply equipping a new weapon, your stats, gear, abilities, everything switches to the role that weapon relates to, and you can head back to lower level areas to train yourself anew. This is done WITHOUT losing any of your previous progress. In fact certain jobs can use abilities learned from other classes, and often need to in order to reach their full potential. The best part is that no mistakes can be made with this system. There is no ""woops, you didn't train your warrior class so your strength is too low,"" there is some minor ability point allocation, but this is done easily and can easily be reversed. A single character can serve you for every adventure, and as such, the character creation allows you to bring that perfect character to life.One truly could spend a few hours just in the character creator, detailing everything from the muscularity of your character, to their eye color, to the color of the tips of their hair vs the rest of their hair, etcetera, etcetera. There are four basic races each with two deviations in appeance to begin with, and the next perk that comes along is that you don't have to worry about ""which race has the best looking armor."" Armor is purely based on class, scales based on size, and doesn't vary from race to race, only between genders. There exists a range of emotions to emulate via these characters in game, if roleplay at all interests you, and the community has considerably less...""game challenged"" players than other MMOs.Worth every cent of the subscription fee, Final Fantasy XIV is a game whose developers LISTEN to their community (see the 2.1 Patch) and who truly care about their game.

												It's funny that almost everyone I've met has been eager to help and once in two dungeons there has always been 1-3 people that wanted to chat with me during the whole runs. I currently have over 140 hours in to the game and there has been only 1 person acting bad towards me and that was in potd when I was playing with a friend in matched party and I wanted to clear this one room and one of the randoms started to curse and act negative towards me. Few minutes later he left us alone there, which made us need to restart that run again because there was no way to take the enemies down with the classes we had. I'm currently around the end of Astral questline, have bought heavensward which I actually bought after 1 week in to the game. I like the game alot, the easy class swap method is great and interesting. There are it's own faults in it though. The Waking Sands area's story quests were a bit irritating to complete and many other places, because they had so many repetive ""go talk to thess guys in these cities and come back here 50 times"" quests. The duty finder sometimes takes around 9-13 minutes to find enough people even though the game informs you that it should usually take 5minutes at max to find all people. There are also few un-important instances in the game, for example Waking Sands's and Raising Stone's office where Minfina is is pretty useless. Haven't touched pvp yet so can't say anything about it yet. It was a shame that the base game didn't have a to handed swordsman class which is the main reason I bought heavensward actually. But overall it's a pretty good game and I'll gladly get the stormblood expansion when It comes out.			"

												People complaining about how this game has a subscription service.People call this game pay to win, its pay to play. There's a difference.Pay to win is the ability to pay for items or in-game currency to gain an advantage over players.Pay to play is a subscription service to keep the game running and keep updates rolling out. If the company didn't make any profit off of this, they would most likely abandon it. As you can see, hundreds of thousands of people don't play this, but it still has an active community.If you complain about this game not being free, complain about World of Warcraft as well, one of the most popular, if not THE most popular mmo out there.I would recommend the game to people who do like WoW, but dislike the 2002 graphics.Play with friends, or find a free company. Community is great.Gameplay : The game has a similar if not identical gameplay system to World of Warcraft. There is a high variety in classes you can choose from, that fits your playstyle.The game has good tutorials that you can use that can be accessed at anytime for reference.If you can't find out how to do something, join a guild, or ask a friend and ask.Or google it.Google exists.Grinding mobs isn't really a thing. Just do leveling roulette and do a dungeon for your level.Classes: Make a character, pick a class, switch whenever.You can change from a gladiator to a conjurer to a pugilist at anytime. Of course you can't do it in combat or in a dungeon, but you can still try out everything.Gear : Main quest should supply you with the gear you need. If not, buy it off the market. If you're poor, run dungeons and get gear from there.Staff and Support : You can enter a support ticket for any bugs or questions that are not found in the FAQ. The FAQ also acts as a tutorial when you can't find out something. Otherwise google it.Google exists.They usually respond within a couple hours or a day, from my experience.Story : So much story. So much. This game is not enjoyable if you don't pay attention to the story. You will end up not knowing what you are even doing. Basically saying, don't rush the game.Bad ♥♥♥♥ : Boring without friends.Story can get boring.Everything can get boring.The game thrives on community and pretty features.You can expect to find me in the Primal data center in Malboro under the name Naomi Sato.Oh you get a 30 day trial which you can basically level up to the max level in a good amount of time.

												They really improved this game- and I love that I can choose to play the same character on PC or PS4 depending on which I'd rather be on at the moment (unrelated to the PC version, but the controls work very well on PS4).It has a bit of a slow pace, and of course it's an MMO so there's grinding involved- but the game looks good, is easy to use and unlike FFXI you can solo your way through anything even if you're not a great player, while also making it easy and rewarding to group up both for dungeons and world events.It has pretty much every feature you'd expect for a modern MMO, an involving story, variety to do, and it has likely the best online community of the AAA group.You won't feel any adrenaline playing this game, but if you're looking for something relaxing it's perfect. Need a break from enemies? There's entire classes devoted to gathering and crafting you can switch to on the fly (one character can have every single class, almost like specs in another game with no respec cost). There's many mini games, even an entire zone dedicated solely to mini games (the Gold Saucer behaves much like the one in FFVII).Gathering professions are considerably more involving than other games; and even fishing's enjoyable (though, a bit limited- take in small doses).The game looks and sounds nice, but some of the voice acting is... questionable. Also, there's still a sub fee.That said- for a mainstream MMO it's one of the best, and I'm hard pressed to think of one that has the same general appeal for the f2p. Sides, a month of gameplay for an hour's work at minimum wage, or two starbucks coffees, has never seemed unreasonable to me.			"

												I've been playing Videogames for over 25 years now  and MMORPG for like 10 my first one was FFXI->Everquest->Aion->TERA and now FFXIVI didn't want to play it before ARR it was until FFXI took over I gave it a chance:Good:Graphics Look Amazing some voice acting through CS is always welcome.Story isn't the best ever but quite good.Jobs with different utilities and such.Hours/Days/Months of content and enjoyment even better with friends.Bad:It gets dull overtime you overcome the content (Like Story/Extremes/Raids).You will end doing dailies if you ran out of things to do with your endgame char or lvl up jobs you don't even like to use later on (mostly through FATES) just to make your sub worthy.Endgame community is quite toxic/elitist and forget that this is a game people are suppose to have fun with.This game is great,I recommend you to switch between other games or unsub for a few months until new content comes and so on don't feel forced to pay every month if you barely play it.I recommend this game to anyone who is looking to play an awesome mmorpg but not for a lifetime, it is up to you anyways :D			"

												TL;DR - I am confident this is the best MMO out there, especially for a Final Fantasy fan.By far my favourite MMO of all the many ones I've played in the past. What put me off in MMOs has been worked on in this game, such as an engaging, worthwhile story, a decent sense of progression, and the greatest thing of all, being able to be all classes on one character. It has content for both casual and hardcore players, plenty of mini games and collectables, such as mounts and pets (minions, which have their own RTS mini-game now). Crafting/gathering classes are actually extremely fun for the first time in an MMO for me, so give those a shot for sure. The game can be grindy at times, but it isn't ball-achingly dull like most games. I've been subsribed for almost a year, I've taken a year break, but now I am back into it and I plan on staying for years to come. For the first time in any MMO, I've truly felt the urge to keep coming back.If you plan on playing this game, I highly suggest trying to get yourself on Gilgamesh (at certain times in the day, off-peak hours when the server isn't full and people delete characters), under the Aether data center (NA). From what I've heard, it's the place to be, and the server to get stuff done later on in the game. I moved here from an EU server and have had no lag issues whatsoever, only ones to blame on my internet.PS: Expect super over the top boss fights that the FF series is known for. A lot of them are visually stunning, it's almost distracting how amazing some of the visuals are in this game.			"

												So, i have recently been playing final fantasy xiv for almost 2 months now and i can say that this has been one of the most enjoyable mmos i have ever played. I do not give a second thought to getting world of warcraft again after playing this. community is very accepting and overall just a good group of people. Also this game is beautiful! I find myself going on doing quest and i will stop every now and then and just take in all of the work this team has done to it. On a side note i did play final fantasy 11 the previous final fantasy mmo, while i do miss some features from the old one like certain classes like puppet, blue mage, red mage, I am not playing xiv like its just filling the gap, The story keeps me wanting to play the dungeons are fun to run and the challenges i come across are always making me better in any class i have tried out, (atm white mage is my primary) In the end if you are curious about this game give it a try! you wont be disappointed!

												This game is really good. Any char can become every class and every job, there are about 20 each, respectively. Some skill/abilities are considered ""Cross-Class"" skills which means you can use them on alternate classes that wouldnt normally learn that skill on their own.You can train your mount to fight for you, and it can take on any combination of 3 roles, dps, tank, heal. Lots of unique content, Lots of familiar content.If you like FF games and enjoy MMO's I recommend getting this. PS Collectors edition is worth it.			"

												I've played my fair share of MMOs, and I have to say, this one tops them all quite easily.The graphics are pretty damn good, and it runs really well on almost any system.I'm used to grinding in MMOs, and so far I've yet to really do anything 'grindy'.For an MMO, it has a story that is actually good. And believe me, they did it well. Each story mission immediately leads into the next, with no need to grind levels between.The class or 'job' system is a really neat structure that works very well. you can change class when you want, and level everything on one character. No need to make alts to try other classes.Only complaint I have is that you can't go swimming (invisble walls stop you from going into deep water).And remember there is a 14 day trial if you want to try it out! Highly reccomended.			"

												First review is written during my first 50 hours in this game. I have not played any of the Heavensward patch.This game is by far the best mmorpg I have ever played. It has great graphics, great playstyle and awesome storyline. It is one of the most engaging mmos I've ever played. (I did grow up with final fantasy, so maybe thats why). Im gunna list some pros and cons for my first 50 hours in this game, and add on it as i gain more hours.50 Hours -Pros -Nearly everything. Its great.Cons-Subscription. the subscription sucks but it makes the players more loyal than most of your girl/boyfriends.(Some may differ but) Tab target combat. I would call it Action tab targeting, but still I'd love this game so much more if it had action combat like TERA does. ♥♥♥♥ tera though, tera doesnt even compare to this game.(Coming from a Tera play with 500 hours dedicated into the game.)Thats about it so far. I will come back to update my pro-con list as i gain hours. (Next probably at 100 hours, then 200, 500, etc.)			"

Delightful?The game is exceptionally good for MMORPGs, and as well as having good story and mechanics it has a mature and generally friendly community who partake in serious role-play that some servers are dedicated to. Offers a huge amount of things players can do (Such as crafting, fishing and similar tasks) and encourages players to engage in Jolly co-operation with dungeons and things of the sort. Worth the money, but it requires about £8.99 / 12.99 € in subscription fees every month so while you will only get players willing to pay a decent amount of cash to play this, a lot of players are unable to play because of this. The game works very well in cohesion with steam, despite most in-game purchases and subscription payment going on at their own website they still accept steam wallet as payment. It looks beautiful and is a somewhat relaxing game to play imo, I would highly suggest giving it a try since they do offer a Free Trial[www.ffxiv-freetrial.com]. Allows you to download the demo on steam.			"

												I remember playing FFXI for hours on end, day after day until SE announced FFXIV. Then, after waiting for the new game to come out, I couldn't wait to delve into the game. Boy, was I disappointed. So were a lot of people. Thankfully, SE listened and completely redesigned FFXIV into FFXIV: ARR. This is what I was hoping for the first time around. It plays enough like FFXI to give you warm fuzzies remembering bygone days, while being different enough to stand on its own in the FF series. I don't write recommendations for games often unless I really enjoy playing them. This is one game I can see myself playing for 200+ hours with ease without  growing tired of the game.			"

												As an avid MMO player, I came into Final Fantasy XIV with mixed expectations.  I had friends who had played before ARR and I had friends who had played after the release.   While one set said the game had been terrible and they were never touching it again, those who played after ARR's release said that the game was well worth the monthly sub.   Deciding to see for myself; I, my significant other, and our friends decided to buy the game and check it out.   It suffices to say, I was not disappointed.FFXIV: ARR takes points from all current MMO's, polishes them, and then puts them on a pedestal for all their players to view and enjoy.   I've played GW2, WoW, RIFT, Terra, and SW:TOR, but nothing comes close to the pure satisfaction of embracing a truly well made Final Fantasy MMORPG.   FFXIV: ARR has recovered from all of it's mistakes in the past, to bring out a wonderful game that sticks true to it's Final Fantasy roots and will leave you begging for more.From the game soundtrack to the storyline, FFXIV: ARR has shown itself as a competitor to take place among the ""legends"" of the MMO industry.  The Dungeons are paced wonderfully, and show challenge when you need it, the quests are fulfilling and give you a sense of purpose within the game and objectives like FATE's and Guildhests give players exactly what they need; smooth enjoyable fun.From furthering yourself in crafting items and gear, to fighting monsters and bosses, each task takes an enjoyable amount of time.  Having only put in about 75 hours, I've found myself enthralled by  the depth of each action, and the amount of polish that has gone into the game to make it the work of art that it is now. + Great Storyline.+ Battle system is enjoyable.+ Wonderful music.+ Enjoyable community.+ Smooth gameplay.10/10.

												Final Fantasy XIV: A realm reborn is a really fun MMO. Being a WoW player from late vanilla and jumped to GW2 but got bored from it after a couple of weeks later when it was released and then jumped to Final Fantasy XIV: A realm reborn when it came to steam.I can say that i have more fun playing this MMO then when i playing GW2 and what WoW is becoming today.To be honest i never played a Final Fantasy from the main series before but did played some DS spinoff games and came to this game and the main series as a stranger but i always wanted to try out a FF game from the main series. From have completed the main story in this MMo i think i can make a review of this game.The first thing you should know is that if you were expecting a different MMO then World of Warcraft you gonna be disapointed but if you liked WoW from what it is you can feel a bit comfort here. You got your Kill X creatures and Collect Y things and also some talk to NPC quests but the game does not take the amount you need kill or collect as crazy as most MMo's. At later levels you mostly need to kill like 6-10 while at early levels not even more then 3. Also this game has just like WoW the Holy trinity (Tank,DPS and Healer) where also you can also play dungeons with people from other servers. But unlike WoW the normal instances are 4 man and the bigger instances 8 man but you also got a 24 man raid.One of the key differences from WoW is that you can change to every class in the game on 1 character meaning that you dont have to make alts. I personally like this a lot and you can also be every gathering and crafting class aswell. if you level more classes you can even share some of the skills they have with other classes but not all of them, Kinda replaces the game from having no talent tree or talent skills.The game does have a story and you progress through it by completing story quests. The game kinda forces you to follow the story quests because most of the game features are only unlocked by doing these quest making the first levels from 1 - 30 on your first class a long tutorial but after that games opens more up and the game does not really feel that slow. The game does feel a bit slow on every class first levels but as you go on the class becomes a lot more intresting.The game also have guilds but here they are called Free Company's in this game but as you go through the story you also need to choose a Nations Grand Company wich you discover more from as you go on with the game.Lastly if you are more of a PVP person you gonna also gonna be a bit disapointed because right now the only PVP is a 4vs4 Arena battle like in WoW and there is no way to duel people in the world and Open pvp is also not in the game.So that kinda concludes my review on this game. if i tell about everything then this review goes out of hand. Overall i really like this MMO and wishes it to even improve more in the future. And i cant wait to do all the end game content now that i completed the main story but to be honest the story does go even further after you completed the real main story of the game. If you are unsure if you can run this game you can download a benchmark from the official site of the game where you can also Create a character beforehand so you dont have to that when you buyed the game and the benchmark is free.

												Great game. Was my first MMO. The game is super fun and exciting; world is also very big. If you are wondering what kind of gameplay this game has it is very standard MMO. The combat is much like World of Warcraft's, but the jobs and FATES make this game fresh and exciting. The only downside I have seen so far in this game isn't anything the game does wrong, but the community can be quite a bit harsh to newcomers. If you are new DO NOT do what I did and start in the tank role. You will get enough backlash to probably stop you from wanting to play the game anymore. If there was one thing I could go back and change, it would be a different starting class for my own character.			"

												Awesome game when it comes to the pve experience. Falls a little short on story telling when compared to guild wars 2 cutscenese. and the pvp is almost non existent. The crafting and gathering professions are extermely well done!  You can level every job, every class with just one character, and never before have i played an mmorpg that had that much freedom.  Personnally been a fan of final games since the original nes release and this one promised to be a final fantasy theme based mmo and it deleivers. There is one other annoyance with the game engine however, the music tends to get repetive, the game updates can be slow to download at times .63 mbs per second when you have a 6 mb connection. The music part one can simply turn on pandora or pop in a cd so no big deal.			"

												The graphics are beautiful, the combat is tight and the pve content is all in all extremely enjoyable. If you're new to the Final Fantasy world or an old fan boy like myself, you would truly enjoy everything this game has to offer. The only drawback I have with this game is the pvp. It needs fine tuning and the battles are completely unbalanced. You have to go in with a cookie cutter group. Pugs are usually cannon fodder in pvp.My favorite aspect of this game is the job system. You have several base classes in which you will later combine to create an advanced class. Some classes can cross abilities. For example: My Black Mage can use some of my Archers abilities or buffs. The cross platform is fantastic as well since I can play with friends who prefer to play on their PS3's. This game has plenty to offer for every type of gamer.			"

												The PVP needs some work, and theres next to no voice-acting (atleast until level 20). Questing is great, luckily its not just grinding quests. The lore and stories that come with the quests are very indepth which is what I would expect from a final fantasy game. It took about 4 hours to reach level 10, I expect about 8 to hit 20 from there.The cross-platform feature is great, the population is huge. Even on the newer servers!They offer a cheaper subscription offer to those that only want 1 character per server, which is GREAT!This and WoW are the only MMO's I believe that will continue to thrive with a subscription model. The others will be F2P by the end of the year (Im talking to you, ESO).			"

												This game is not just a fantastic MMO. It is a fantastic Final Fantasy game. It captures the essence of the franchise very well. The music is superb and the graphics are top notch. And the game is BEYOND addicting. At the time of writing this review I have 35 hours in on it and have barely even scratched the surface of the game, and that is being generous. I can't imagine how long it would take to do everything. Thousands of hours. It streamlines the whole finding a party or group thing which was usually my least favorite thing about an MMO. Because I don't like the hassle of trying to get a group together. But FF14 automates this and it becomes as simple as popping into a Call of Duty match. It makes dungeon crawling feel like pick-up matches that require very little set-up. And that is THE quality about the game that makes it near perfect for me. I highly encouage anybody who is a fan of similar games to pick this up. By far the best MMO I've ever played. Which for reference the otheres I've played are Everquest, Everquest 2, and Guild Wars 2.			"

												Owned it for just over 2 weeks, and got up to level 20 with my main character.The style really does make it feel like a Final Fantasy game. From the music the moment the game loads, to the style of clothing, to classic creatures such as chocobos and moogles.What also helps make the game different compared to some other MMORPGs is that your class changes simply from switching out your main weapon. This is for combat and non-combat classes. All gear has a level limit which is determined by the class, but some may also be stricted to specific classes, preventing your level 1 Marauder running around in level 50 Lancer gear, or even the other way around.I still need to decide if I will be continuing this after my initial subscription expires, but currently it is optimistic :)			"

												This game, like other MMOs, is deeply addictive. While I don't like games that involve too much grinding, Final Fantasy XIV has some fun mobs and dungeon-like events called FATEs that make leveling up your character fun rather than a chore.The graphics are beautiful, and exploring the game is a joy, especially once you play long enough to get a chocobo!With emotes, it's possible to role-play within the game if you want, but it's not necessary. There's a little less player interaction in chat that I'd like, but FFXIV forces you to play with other people via it's four- and eight-person story-based dungeons. It's a crapshoot as to whether you'll get paired up with good folks, but it definitely keeps you on your toes.All and all, I dig it. I'm about halfway through the story right now, and I like it an awful lot.			"

												Final Fantasy XIV: A realm reborn is a really fun MMO. Being a WoW player from late vanilla and jumped to GW2 but got bored from it after a couple of weeks later when it was released and then jumped to Final Fantasy XIV: A realm reborn when it came to steam.I can say that i have more fun playing this MMO then when i playing GW2 and what WoW is becoming today.To be honest i never played a Final Fantasy from the main series before but did played some DS spinoff games and came to this game and the main series as a stranger but i always wanted to try out a FF game from the main series. From have completed the main story in this MMo i think i can make a review of this game.The first thing you should know is that if you were expecting a different MMO then World of Warcraft you gonna be disapointed but if you liked WoW from what it is you can feel a bit comfort here. You got your Kill X creatures and Collect Y things and also some talk to NPC quests but the game does not take the amount you need kill or collect as crazy as most MMo's. At later levels you mostly need to kill like 6-10 while at early levels not even more then 3. Also this game has just like WoW the Holy trinity (Tank,DPS and Healer) where also you can also play dungeons with people from other servers. But unlike WoW the normal instances are 4 man and the bigger instances 8 man but you also got a 24 man raid.One of the key differences from WoW is that you can change to every class in the game on 1 character meaning that you dont have to make alts. I personally like this a lot and you can also be every gathering and crafting class aswell. if you level more classes you can even share some of the skills they have with other classes but not all of them, Kinda replaces the game from having no talent tree or talent skills.The game does have a story and you progress through it by completing story quests. The game kinda forces you to follow the story quests because most of the game features are only unlocked by doing these quest making the first levels from 1 - 30 on your first class a long tutorial but after that games opens more up and the game does not really feel that slow. The game does feel a bit slow on every class first levels but as you go on the class becomes a lot more intresting.The game also have guilds but here they are called Free Company's in this game but as you go through the story you also need to choose a Nations Grand Company wich you discover more from as you go on with the game.Lastly if you are more of a PVP person you gonna also gonna be a bit disapointed because right now the only PVP is a 4vs4 Arena battle like in WoW and there is no way to duel people in the world and Open pvp is also not in the game.So that kinda concludes my review on this game. if i tell about everything then this review goes out of hand. Overall i really like this MMO and wishes it to even improve more in the future. And i cant wait to do all the end game content now that i completed the main story but to be honest the story does go even further after you completed the real main story of the game. If you are unsure if you can run this game you can download a benchmark from the official site of the game where you can also Create a character beforehand so you dont have to that when you buyed the game and the benchmark is free.

												I remember playing FFXI for hours on end, day after day until SE announced FFXIV. Then, after waiting for the new game to come out, I couldn't wait to delve into the game. Boy, was I disappointed. So were a lot of people. Thankfully, SE listened and completely redesigned FFXIV into FFXIV: ARR. This is what I was hoping for the first time around. It plays enough like FFXI to give you warm fuzzies remembering bygone days, while being different enough to stand on its own in the FF series. I don't write recommendations for games often unless I really enjoy playing them. This is one game I can see myself playing for 200+ hours with ease without  growing tired of the game.			"

												Great game. Was my first MMO. The game is super fun and exciting; world is also very big. If you are wondering what kind of gameplay this game has it is very standard MMO. The combat is much like World of Warcraft's, but the jobs and FATES make this game fresh and exciting. The only downside I have seen so far in this game isn't anything the game does wrong, but the community can be quite a bit harsh to newcomers. If you are new DO NOT do what I did and start in the tank role. You will get enough backlash to probably stop you from wanting to play the game anymore. If there was one thing I could go back and change, it would be a different starting class for my own character.			"

												Awesome game when it comes to the pve experience. Falls a little short on story telling when compared to guild wars 2 cutscenese. and the pvp is almost non existent. The crafting and gathering professions are extermely well done!  You can level every job, every class with just one character, and never before have i played an mmorpg that had that much freedom.  Personnally been a fan of final games since the original nes release and this one promised to be a final fantasy theme based mmo and it deleivers. There is one other annoyance with the game engine however, the music tends to get repetive, the game updates can be slow to download at times .63 mbs per second when you have a 6 mb connection. The music part one can simply turn on pandora or pop in a cd so no big deal.			"

												The graphics are beautiful, the combat is tight and the pve content is all in all extremely enjoyable. If you're new to the Final Fantasy world or an old fan boy like myself, you would truly enjoy everything this game has to offer. The only drawback I have with this game is the pvp. It needs fine tuning and the battles are completely unbalanced. You have to go in with a cookie cutter group. Pugs are usually cannon fodder in pvp.My favorite aspect of this game is the job system. You have several base classes in which you will later combine to create an advanced class. Some classes can cross abilities. For example: My Black Mage can use some of my Archers abilities or buffs. The cross platform is fantastic as well since I can play with friends who prefer to play on their PS3's. This game has plenty to offer for every type of gamer.			"

												Final Fantasy XIV is a beautiful game. The world design is wonderful, bringing life to new areas with each update. Dungeons are fun, interesting, and easy to get into. While there is a primary storyline, which you need to follow to unlock different aspects of the game, a lot of the side quest are unique and very filling. When I say filling, I simply mean that there is a lot of ""stuff"" to do. From slaughtering cacturns, to exploring new areas; each quest comes along with an interesting narrative.When I first started to play, I joined up with two pals from beta. They were significantly higher level than me, but were able to help me by lowering level to match my own. It really made the game more fun, and we got a few good laughs out of the dungeons. They had me join up in their Free Company, and now I've got lots of people to just hang out with and dungeon run with.Sure the cost isn't exactly cheap, but it is easily worth the monthly fee. Besides that, the only real issue is that even on the lowest graphics, it can still slow down a computer to a crawl.			"

												Don't purchase this game from Steam as they will give you a ""key"" that will not allow you to login to the game or register the game successfully. Even after logging into the account management section for Square Enix, I still could not use the key that STEAM provided. I attempted to use it at the login screen that prompts use of the key, as well as the actual account management site AND Mogstation. So just when you sit down and have some free time to play, you actually have to contact Square Enix, sending and email, since their chat support is offline on Weekends, only to find that you have to wait for a response for more than a day or two. So at this point, when you do get a reply, its likely that you go back to work, bummed that you did not get a chance to play the game that you purchased, because STEAM and SQUARE ENIX can't get their crap together and communicate effectively and the ♥♥♥♥♥ gets passed along, down the hill to the customer, even after they are both multi-million dollar companies. That is laziness and stupidity in its finest. Rant over. P.S. Yes I have played FFIX on both PC and PS4, but took a break and decided to come back. What a waste of time, lol. Now for the review. It's a fun MMORPG, polished and continually improving. The map system still sucks, hopefully that will one day improve. Auto-Travel to quests would be nice, who knows, maybe they have that now. I don't know, I have not gotten back in the game yet. It still has cat-girls, so it is not all that bad, lol. The raids can be confusing, because of the crazy stuff going on in your team hot bars, so you just hope the DPS does not pull to much Aggro from the Tanks and the Healers do their part and everyone avoids dying horribly, you know the usual. That being said, don't expect more from this game than any other MMORPG, they are all clones, with different character models, animations and so on. There are some neat aspects that I believe they are learning from MMORPGS where you have to dodge, like Wildstar and Tera, but with a better story and player base. Get it. It's another pretty way to waste your time and meet others who are also wasting their time. Enjoy. "

												There is a sharp divide in the player base. And it's the same divide you see over most of the internet and its associated communities: Half the players are awful bigots, white nationalists, and just generally gross people who sexually harass you, scream awful things in the shoutbox, or otherwise hound and harass you - these ones tend to be ex-WoW players, who joined once the game received high review praise.The rest, however, are lovely, kind people, who are pleasant to be around and always helpful.You will be pestered fairly frequently by goldfarmers trying to sell you in-game currency.The game is really good. The crafting system is a great. Battle system is solid. Party mechanics work well.You can literally try any class out with your character, just by equipping the necessary stuff.What stands out to me are little things, though - a rather robust character creation system, and the ability to dye most of the armour/equipment as you see fit.I just love things like that.Superfluous outfits are available too. And at lv.50, you obtain the ability to ""glamour"" your gear, to wear whatever you like without sacrificing stats.They have a system of marriage, with no restrictions on gender.Is this the first game with marriage equality? Because I can't think of any others.And that is just an awesome touch.So much love, Square-Enix.<3			"

												After what i feel is a decent amount of hours played i feel i can write a review for this game..Lets start with its good points right? so here goes:-FF XIV is a top shelf MMORPG, yes your have to purchase the base game and yes it has a subscription fee 'sigh'... but after much deliberation and playing pretty much every other MMORPG.  My friend and I came to the conclusion that in F2P games the most important content and utilities where microtransaction BS! and you just cannot progress.. not to mention the most vile and hatred filled gamers your ever likely to come across.. So we gave this one a bash and in all honesty for what your paying its a bargain ! and no im not a fan boy.. im speaking the truth.... theres no locked content, everything is available as long as your able to progress that far and level up high enough to reach the locations.The graphics in this game are indeed Direct X9.0, but not by any means outdated ! i play many new games such as S.O.M / Farcry 4 etc... and this game is just as graphically pleasing if not a little easier on the eye as it all blends and texturises realy well. I run a Nvidia Geforce GT 740 2GB ddr5 card and get 40-50 fps all day long on the highest settings.The music is well composed and fits in well with the FF Franchise to those who are familiar, however just sometimes it can grate on you when your not expecting it or suddenly gets louder...Voice acting is some what scarce and when is around poorly dubbed but again something anyone familiar with FF will just over look this easily !As for content the game is full of it ! Theres never a dull moment, with 18 Classes to not only choose from but swap to at any given moment you can never get bored... ive litterally gone from fighting to keep my A** alive to suddenly sat on a stool fishing for sardines !! all in space of a few seconds. get bored of fishing easy ?? no problem grab a pickaxe and follow me ! we can go smash some crountry side open and mine for ore and composites !! whats that you say ?? cant find your pickaxe ?? not to worry my friend, lets go train to become a carpenter. We'll have you equipped in no time :D and how about after that we head to the Culinary Guild and cook us up a nice dinner of rabbit pie with white pearl chocolates for afterwards. Like a bit of slash and gash voilence ? become a Gladiator and Tank your way through whiles the Arcanist's and the Thurmatages watch your back with ranged magic and summons ...And of course need not to be mentioned really (ITS AN MMO ITS IN THE DESCRIPTION) you can do this with your friends 95% of the way through... of course i say 95% because during some Guild missions and Campaigns missions im afraid your going to have to go it alone !!! But the people of Eorzea are a nice Folk and are willing to help out anyone who just speaks up !! Help is out there people.. your never alone here :D FF XIV is Cross-Platform compatible with the PC/PS3/PS4 platforms and you play along side them..Bad Points to this game:- Again i say ""Subscriptions fees"" but there not all that bad .. theres no locked content once you've paid and everything is at some point readily available..Fast Travel can cost a fortune so be wary of how you travel !Can seem Tedious at times, but once you discover everything there is to do youll never fit it all into a day :DOverall i Can definetly recommend this game to anyone looking for an MMORPG but feel there all missing something ?? WELL WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FOR FREE HUH ??? pay a little and gain alot more !9.3/10 theres always room for improvement right ?? Come join us today and find out for yourself just how addictive and fun this game really is ..... because you just cant take someones else word for it :D			"

												I'm going to try and keep this brief. I feel this game is solid enough to be a top contender in the MMO genre and worth the monthly fee it charges. If your NA and can get on a full NA server like Gilgamesh or Cactuar you will find there are always people running around and you will never really find yourself alone.

I have put a ton of time into Wildstar, ESO, GW, GW2, BDO, WoW and many others. I usually find myself going back to WoW after a few months of playing a new MMO and reaching whatever i consider to be the end game for me. I am seriously considering making this my main MMO.			"

												*played 50-100 hours on the ps3 version plus an additional 100 hours on the ps4 version*incredibly fun mmorpg that starts out a bit slow but soon enough kicks off into a well-written story based final fantasy game that we all know and love.  character creation is pretty in depth, you get to make a character that looks truly unique.  you get to play as either a human, elf, giant, super midget, or furry.  music is wonderful, as it should be expected in a final fantasy title.  just be sure to have a good graphics card in order to run this at over 30 fps on 1920x1080 resolution, since the game's pretty demanding8/10			"

												This game is beyong anything I could have ever imagined.Gameplay wise, the game is smooth, easy going, and rather slow paced. The start of the game may seem a bit grindy, but the more you progress, the more features you unlock. Every quest you complete seems rewarding.The environment one of the most beautiful I have seen in any MMO, being easily comparable to games like Tera Rising. The graphics are absolutely phenominal and the attention to detail makes the game really immersive.The community as far as what I have experienced contains some of the nicest people I have ever met in an online game. People are inclusive and ready to help new players out.The only issues I have had with this game are a global cooldown of 2.5 seconds, although you  get used to it quite fast, and the lack of voiceacting in cutscenes. Voiceacting could have deserved a little more focus, especially seeing as when you actually get to experience it, it is absolutely great, funny and immersive. That's literally the only issues I have had though, and if you are able to ignore these minor things, you are going to have a one-of-a-kind experience.I will update my experience with this game the more I progress through it.

												The game is great and fills the MMO role quite nicely. However--I find the gameplay to be somewhat slower paced than most MMOs I've played (Recently got into WoW, big difference) which isn't a deal breaker by a long shot. I actually like it.. however I live in Japan and all the people I would like to play with are in America, so due to time zones I find little interest in the game. It's not a solo game, or a solo friendly game. You need to play with friends to enjoy it.If you have friends.. 10/10 would recommend. Especially if you've played FF games since you were a kid, like me.			"

												Pro's: The game is beautiful. Even on medium settings the game looks great and runs smoothly. The story is actually enthralling and is keeping me interested and I don't find myself speeding through text and skipping cinematics. Atleast, not for the main stories lol. The monsters are really well done and there are a wide variety from cute and cuddly (i.e the Cactus monster thing...) to the scary *** demons. The dungeons are fun and it seems that most of them tie in with the main story so you in a sense have to unlock them. Same goes with getting your first chocoboCons: There are some things that really do bug me in this game which may be just superficial on my part. The first is how the map is. When zoomed out to look at a regional view all you see are name blocks with lines directing which zones are connected. It's not like a google map view that you find in most mmo's. Along with that is trying to find where to go with quests. Some mmos if you have quest lets say 3 zones over, will usually point you to the nearest exit from the current zone into the next. This game doesnt seem to do that. If you have a quest in one zone over, sure it will show you. But if it is 2 zones over then you need to go and track it down. The zones themselvs I wish were not instanced. Even parts of the main cities are instanced. I personally like complete open world games. Or at the very least, the main cities should not be broken into instances. Getting a mount is kind of a pain. You need to progress to roughly lvl 20 before you get the quest to get a mount. Then you need to go farm some tokens in order to get a certificate. That part isnt necessarily hard just annoying. Even if you have the collectors edition and have the two mounts already, you need to get the normal chocobo first before you can use them. My biggest gripe however, is the use/lack there of of voice over for the games. Some main story cinematics will have voice overs, some dont. Some times you will have voices then all of a sudden you dont. It's not my sound card, or computer, or whatever, it's the developers that didnt put in voice acting for the whole game. I hope they do add in more sometime down the line. Overall though this is a very well done game and I am impressed. Even with the nuances I am enjoying the game immensly and definitely recommend playing it even if it's just the trial.			"

												As one of the MMO players, This game is not bad at all, and I will not compare it to any other game whether it's a bad or good thing. all I have to say is that this game didn't lower my expectations. I can tell you that this game seems more directed towards its story however. Even with a week of experience of playing this game, a friend of mine and I haven't even went passed lvl 10 on our second try. either because of story delay, or just how slow we are. so it isn't really favoring the ""just lvl up and do battlegrounds and raids"" but other than that this game kept me really busy. even knowing that i would hit the lvl cap, I would probably make another character.   This is a great opportunity to take a monthly break from WoW and other FTP or PTP MMO games. what also got me interested playing this game is the change on its audio, subtitles, ETC. Regarding that it's developed by SE. I really can't stand english voice acting. Upon knowing this as soon I started listening to Japanese voice actors, I felt comfortable playing the game. I don't know about you guys, but After playing a few games that originated in Japan, the difference between voice acting is sychronizing with the mood. That's how I see it. When it comes to english voice acting, I always expect few if not most, messed up on certain occasions, and I'm always afraid it's always on the best parts.That's all I can offer on my review on this. I'm sure there are more helpful ones than mine.			"

												Actually, just having gotten through level 10 I can say this is a really zen-like playing experience. Good music, decent plotline and all of those great, familiar FF throwbacks. It is like playing deja vu: a really warm, melty nostalgic experience for an older gamer like me. I cut my teeth on FF back in its 16-bit days and this MMO is like a warm security blanket. Be sure to switch the cutscene language to Japanese and enable subtitles! It makes it a pretty fun cinematic experience. Overall, fun stuff.			"

												Ok. First of all I am not an MMORPG fan. I Have played 2 before and not for very long. I swore I would NEVER pay for a subscription fee. Now I have paid for one and do not regret it at all. This game is awesome. The amount of stuff you can do in game is impressive as are the graphics and framerate if your PC can handle it.  I have so far played as 2 different classes and to me they feel different. I play them different, which is a good thing. People are generally pretty helpful to noobs and not total d1ckfaces, Although you do get some of those too to be fair.The community seems to be pretty tightly knit and friendly. Within a few minutes on each of 2 servers I have played on, I have been invited to join Free Companys. Or Guilds if you prefer.There does seem to be a fairly steep learning curve with menus and such, and the game doesn't really explain them very well if at all. Stick with it, ask questions and experiment and after a while you will get the hang of it. The map can be daunting at times. I find I'm getting better at it all of the time, but initially it can really mess you up. Especially when there can be different height levels in some areas such as towns. The map does not shift up or down to accomodate your vantage point. When playing with a party, it seems you will share/split experience. That can be pretty cool. Audio is good and has some classic FF music, which is nice.Graphics are incredibly vibrant and colorful, like you'd expect from a FF game.Character interactions are a little tedious. You read alsmot EVERYTHING. Even most cutscenes are not voiced. Although there are a few. Account creation is a  little weird. Especially when you have to use the game client+the website+subscribe and link your account. This could have been a little less confusing. When a friend wants to join you and they just got  the game it is entirely possible that they may not be able to join you. The  world you are on might be full. They can't wait for someone just to logoff. That doesn't seem to work. They have to hope that someone deletes a character at some point I have a lvl 12 character in one world and my friend cannot join me. I had to create a new character on a new world to play with them. One last thing: I believe, (and I might be wrong about this), that you get 8 character slots per world. To give you an idea, there are roughly 8 worlds per server area and about 7 server areas. That is pretty impressive. Would I recommend this game to people? Sure if you are a Final Fantasy fan or an MMO fan. Not for everybody...but I'm loving it so far.			"

This game has a hotbar cobat system which im not a fan of because they confuse me and end up clogging the screen, but thankfully this game has controller support which really helps me and i just have to press two buttons and dont even have to look at the keyboard to make sure im doing the right thing.But all together this game is great for any MMO fan!

												my recommendation is a 51/49 yesthe game is fun up until you get to end-game (at least from when this review is written, we'll see future updates)but they are abusing player's timeif you wanna do end-game things, you better not have a IRL job and no friends to play with, because you're never going to get maxed jobs/classes (jobs as in gathering + crafting) with all fully equippedthere's not enough time to do all that, mainly because of how limited you are, /450 gathering/crafting points a week for example...also for the anima weapon (the very end-game weapon you can get) there are, at the moment, 3 steps to level it... one is doing some fates... that... ok... takes maybe 2-3 hours for each things in that step (like on 5-6 maps)then it's doing dungeons, also easythen you need to farm different things, but if you wanna play more casually, like me and my friend, you need to farm EVERY DAY NON STOP FOR 3 MONTHS!! no joking, it's about 87 days... the tribe quests (not the last, vanu one, which would be even worst) but the 4 other tribesthose tribe quests takes like 30 mins to do a day... IF you're lucky and not get into fate quests because some of them can take 30 mins or even 1h to 1h30 to pop (that one in sylph tribe...)ok i'll be nice and inform about the reason of it being so slow : i sometimes do them at night and there's no one playing, so no one doing the fates and so it takes longer to pop those ones you needso farm it for 3 months is the best casual-wayand in that same step afterwards you need to craft 4 times each 4 different items (each one of a different crafting job) in high quality...so you already need to get your crafting and gathering jobs up to that point... and you can only have 3 job crystals at a time, with that 450 point limit a week it will take forever even with the best items equipped -_-so basically end game = work-at-farm festand this is in ""game"" categoryworking isn't playing			"

												It's funny how I read forums from 3 years ago about how people will be surprised if this game becomes big and successful... And then I go play this game. 20+ year gaming vets agree this game does more right than its beaten-to-death-then-beat-some-more-horse of a cousin. Also, CHOCOBOS AND MOOGLES!Rode a chocobo to a chocobo farm to talk to a chocobo trainer to get a quest to summon my chocobo to assist me in battles and quests to get different chocobo gear and hope to one day fly my chocobo in the skies of Ishgard amongst other chocobos.Chocobo/10.In all honesty though, it's very polished. Also, certain features really appeal to me that don't appear in many other games. The job system for example. I always end up making a bunch of characters and never getting as far as I'd like on any of them in MMO's because I want to try every class. In this game, I can do every class on one character! Perfect! With the recent switch to Direct X 11, the game is better lit and more reflective than ever! Janitors of of Eorzea all are standing proud at the gleam of their polished floors! Well done and a helmet tip to those fine gentlemen and gentlelalas on your travels mustn't be overlooked!AND I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO THE FLYING MOUNTS YET!			"

												WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!Since I was 12 years old MMORPGS have been a part of my life, it has been an on going battle not to neglect my life and focus soley on my virtual characters. You see in reality i do not have much going on, I use these games as a escape sinking 100s of hours of my time, while my in game character progresses i am stuck at home in a unhealthy routine. MMORPGS are a unhealthy habit i have had to break.They almost had me wrapped in their grasp again, i put 60 hours into this game before i realised i had done this all before and that i can not continue living life this way. IF YOU PLAY THIS YOU WILL GET ADDICTED!The game itself is quite good for a MMORPG but i can not recommend a platform that is literally killing people. These companies are using our money to keep their game running, such a evil corporation. OPEN YOUR EYES AND SEE THE TRUTHHumans were not ment to play MMORPGs i urge you to give this game a miss and maybe focus on a hobby of yours, try and get creative or spend time with the family, learn a skill. Reality is yours to shape and mould!!!! "

												Such a beautifully done MMORPG. This game has made me really think twice about going back to WoW Warlords of Dreanor ever again and even giving Legion a chance. Played it since 2005/2006. The 10-15 hours I only have while writing this review aren't my total hours as I've played since PS3 and had it on PS4 with the free upgrade. This game is everything I ever wanted in an MMO. Nice raids, decent community (depending on your server, I Guess. Everyone I've ran into were quite nice) and the quests lines are well. And not having to make an alt is really nice and you keep everything on one character. I can see this being my go to MMORPG from now on.			"

												PLEASE PLEASE COME PLAY THIS GAME! Like many of you, I thought FF online will always suck because 11 and fourteen 1.0. This one? You miss out something valuable as a gamer if you skip this game. I BEG OF YOU AS A FELLOW GAMER, THIS GAME DESERVES RECOGNITION.I came too damn late because I thought GW2 is gonna be great (heart of thorn is terrible especially with the story, so I quit). I've been a gamer since 1995 (5 years old) playing red alert, tiberium, starcraft and diablo so on. I play good games only! The first MMO I played was Rangarok, it was a frigging cocain at that time. Realm Reborn is a ♥♥♥♥in Opium. If you are willing to experience and accept the quality in the game for the first 2 hourse outside of character creation, you will understand why the subscription is actually reasonable.What MMO put Final Fantasy quality cinematic ingame?

			Witness the end of an era as the Eorzean Alliance clashes with the Garlean Empire in a bid to deliver the realm from certain destruction. The saga will continue in FINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn.		

Answer: none. Pro:-lvling system: Bravely Default-Boss battling system: semi-tales mmo style-Story: Final Fantasy-Cinematic: Final Fantasy-Regular MMO battle: Guild Wars-Living world, stories, quests, end game content and item update almost every patch. -Miqo'teNeutral:-Looting: rolling base (Need - almost garaunteed get it if no one else pick need vs Greed - not a gear for your role want it anyway Vs Pass). Con:- Subscriptions.....so ♥♥♥♥in what? If you don't pay, you just can't play. They don't delete your account btw...unlikes *cough cough* ESO.- Grindfest starting at lvl40+...I just want to go through stories QQ. - The que time in early lvl quests (aka dungeons) usually take forever. Too many people got sucked into end game content. - This is not the actual world we live in.*EDIT1*CON- Just finish realm reborn final mission. HUGE MISTAKE: Too many people required and reward elite players to come back and play with you. Meaning they will force you to skip either all the cutscenes or all the fight. They even have an audacity to tell you to go watch cutscenes in the inn as if they ever do that first time in the dungeon. Few would even try to kick you out.I heard they fix for story content after this, but we'll see what I find out. Major dissapointing ending mission. Great ending content, ♥♥♥♥ system..... What's with these games these days that ♥♥♥♥ing up ending one way or the other?*Side note*Just put down your stupid Destiny, ESO or whatever lame game that got hyped out into the outer space and play this damn good game already.*Edit after Heavensward*- So they actually fix the ending missions issues where elites force you to skip all battles or all cutscenes.1) They reduce the players required to normal of 4 players.2) the cutscenes are off higher quality, more efficient and less time consuming. All the more intense cutscenes are put in your private main quest while.3) Dungeon quest cutscenes are not only shorten, but elites that come for delicious delicious tomestone will have to wait for you otherwise, they will have to fight the boss with less people (which is impossible).I haven't done raid yet...♥♥♥♥, 261hrs and I've only done all main quests up to date.....OH patch 3,2 is coming. LOL.... QQ			"

												A top contender for one of the best-worst MMO's ever.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -FFXIV had a bit of a rough start when it first launched which prompted Square to create an end-of-the-world Event that ended Version 1.0 ( 1.23 or higher ). This event is always shown as the intro to the game in form of a fantastic CGI video with a rather sad sounding song. However, if you ask me, I dare to say that they planned it from the start as it would give them a great amount of publicity.Here are some of my top complaints of the game.* There is no freedom. It's another Hallway-game.* The storyline is absolutely atrocious, but it does have a few gems.* It feels like work, without pay. You work, and you gain nothing.What I mean when I say there's no freedom, is that just like FFXI it isn't an open world game. You walk from zone to zone. This was fine when it was in FFXI because of it's role as one of the first MMO's. This is NOT okay in an MMO of 2010+. For example, every single town is split up into two separate zones, usually as one top and one lower section. In Limsa Lominsa, this can become utter ridiculous where the lower Limsa crystal can have 20 people standing around, yet because of it's divide you'll never see any people if you are on the upper half because the lower part when watching from upper is a separate instance.This was done I recon in order to make things run smoothly or whatever, but it's just stupid in all honesty.This leads us into the other part. Jumping is a lie. You don't actually jump in the game - You just display a Jump animation. Let me explain: There's no true Z-axis in FFXIV that measures if you are moving vertical. If you can walk it, you can jump it. But if you can't walk it, you can never jump it. Combine this with the fact that everything is divided into zones and we find out the true nightmare of a player of the explorer type - A gilded Cage.Which leads us into the expansion, Heavensward where they introduced flying mounts. They work differently in that they do count the Z-axis, but your jumping still don't. And the most damning fact of it all that everyone I know hate - Aether Currents. A completely, arbitrary thing that Square Enix pulled out of their asses just to spite players. If you want to fly, you better hunt each and everyone down in ONE ZONE in order to fly in just THAT zone. And the hilarious part of this is that usually when you've found all Currents, you're done with that zone so why would you ever go back to it? This makes it so that the only zone worth spending time finding them in is the Churning Mists because at least there, you can fate grind from like 52 to 60Make no mistakes. FFXIV is work. It's not a journey to gain strength, it's just good ol' labor for everything except by the end of the day, you'll have gained nothing of true worth. You're not stronger, you're not more skillful - You're just screwed over.Finally, and here's the golden anaconda of it all.The storyline, is rancid. You really need to try hard to make a story that sucks this much. Just about every single NPC has a special kind of stupidity to them that's out of this world. I have heard D&D players who made joke characters still be better than these numbnuts! And just like how Square usually makes games these days,You are not the Hero.People have joked around about MMO's always telling how everyone is special and they are the chosen ones and all that. FFXIV does this the opposite way. It makes you do all the work, but you are never the hero of this tale. Even after you complete a full storyline and have your fame reach the far wides of Eorzea, you're still going to be everyone's errand boy and if some special NPC shows up, they'll push you aside and go "" No! This is something I must do! I who haven't lifted a single finger since you saw me must deal with this enemy!  "" or "" No -Name-! This enemy is too strunk for us! We must flee! "" even though you just eliminated an entire army just to get to that point.It's like Square looked at Mystic Quest and went "" Oh man! This is amazing! Let's take ideas from this game! ""= = =In conclusion, I cannot recommend FFXIV to anyone.I have spent over 800 hours with the game.I've had some good moments, and I have screamed from the top of my lungs about the story.I have met friends, I got a random guy and his girlfriend to get into the game and they love it, but my hate only grew.If you think you can stand all these things, then I implore you to try the trial out.But otherwise, I cannot recommend this game to anyone with two braincells.PS. I am slightly wrong about Jumping, but in grand gist of it I am right. Jumping in FFXIV is largely a pointless ordeal.			"
