												For claification sake, I've played this game since Beta and I love the overall animation and playstyle imaged as a 2D platformer. I guess this really hit a nostalgia nerve for me and my yearning for the old Mario Brothers mechanics. And while I hate to bash something I fell in love with, this is no longer the game that I use to know.Back in the early days of MapleStory, you had your 4 standard classes: Mage, Warrior, Archer, Thief. Mage and Warrior had 3 subsets each; Archer and Thief had 2 subsets. Finding equipment and hanging out with friends was easy because there was just a few servers and not that many maps. The level cap was set as a crazy 200, but the mindless grinding wasn't so bad, cause you could easily be with your friends and if you found an equip you couldn't use, one of them could and vice versa.But Maplestory grew. On the surface, you would think this is a good thing; more people = more friends = more equips. True, but Nexon saw this as an excellent opportunity to milk its players through microtransactions. As the game grew, Nexon built more servers and maps, creating virtual spacial rifts between players. It became more and more difficult to get to the same map as a friend without using a teleport rock (a microtransaction item) or wasting a bunch of time. Nexon created pets, vanity items, world transfers, shops; all for real money. When that wasn't enough, they created more character types, those who couldn't share the cash shop items with the original characters, essentially urging players to rebuy cash items. The new characters also lead to the nerfing of some of the original characters under the guise of ""improved"" for rebalancing issues. Nexon raised the level cap to 250, milking players for even longer. They created a lottery system called gachapon for in-game items using real money, not to mention special event ""lotteries"".Don't play Maplestory. It's not what it use to be. The fun is sucked out of it. Don't waste tons of time and money on it like I did.			"

												MapleStory was one of the first MMORPG titles I've had the chance of playing, besides Runescape Classic (which was a looong time ago).After a revisit of this game (after many years of on and off playing), as well as THOUSANDS of dollars spent, I cannot say I am willing to recommend this game.FIrstly, MapleStory is one of the few 2D side-scrolling MMORPGs that try to mix 'cute' and 'breathtaking' together, and at times, they do it very well. Some landscapes are huge, the original lore and locations were very well done, and one can be trapped in the game's beauty for long periods of time. Heck, even getting lost in that game was fun. However, with the changes as of the last two to three years, a lot of the beauty has been lost. In order to cater to the broader generation of players who demand instant gratification, they have changed out most of the old expansive locations and replaced them with compacted versions - so that players can traverse the world much more quickly. However, by doing so, they've stuffed all the game's content into the newer maps, which makes most of the world appear small and claustrophobic.The music score for this game is wonderful. Whether you're inside the forests of Ellinia, or exploring the depths of Ludibrium,  the background music really amplifies the mystery and beauty the game world is trying to become.The original MapleStory had a handful of classes, and each of them were unique, but overall balanced. Now, each large 'class update' seems to focus on newer 'Hero' characters, most who severely outclass the older counterparts in terms of damage and flashiness. In fact, there are so many different 'Heroes' nowadays, it saddens me to say that you'll rarely run into the older classes anymore, except in the case of Legacy worlds. The Cash Shop isn't all too great either. In addition to the standard cosmetic items and EXP boosts that one would commonly find in Free-2-Play MMOs, there are also items which give you in game currency, some which would offer you lowered failure chances when upgrading items. The latter gives players who spend a huge lead over players who don't, and this is made obvious by the overly high prices those items fetch on the marketplace.Combine that with a marketplace that doesn't let players open one without forking cash (and depending on how much cash you're willing to spend, it also determines whether you'll have to stay logged in to sell items)(players are only able to trade, so they'll have to solicit people in the market entrances) and a bad support team, I truly cannot recommend this game to anyone. MapleStory's golden days are long gone, and what's left is a carcass of what was once a masterpiece.			"

												This game is like that really easy girl in middle school. You played with her for a while and got bored with her, but you hear her call your name and for whatever reason you go back to see if anything has changed, and every time you go back, nothing has ever changed. Now, almost 8 years since you've met her, and you two still meet up every once and awhile to diddle. This game, man.			"

												I've played this game since I was 10 years old when it came out in america.The best way to describe maplestory is a deep, deep hole out in the woods.When you are bored and looking for something to do you fall into this hole.At first you are scared, you panic and try to get out of the hole.But slowly, you begin you like it in the hole. You spend thousands of dollars on making this hole cooler, nicer, and do more dps. You meet friends, lovers, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥s inside of this hole, it begins to feel like a community.Then high school girl drama will go down, and you will sell all your gear and quit.You will struggle to climb out of this hole. And finally....you're out.You go back to the way your life was before, and you become happy again.After a couple of months...you feel this craving...this...hunger...You miss the hole. Sure, the hole has its ups and downs...but you...you were safe in the hole...you were...home...So you go back, and thus begins the never ending downward spiral of your life.10/10 would quit and play again.

												I played Maple Story the very first day it was released to North America and since then the game has changed a ton.The grind in the game was hard but when you got them levels you earned them and it was amazing hearing the stories of guys like Tiger making top Teir and Wizet really loved it's community. Normally in the old maple story you would see admins walking around talking to members as they passed by and it was exciting to see the community with their passion for the game making content like Dray86's Maple Kombat. Then came Nexon who montized the hell out of the game, took the world that everyone loved and threw it all over the place then they made these hero classes that made the orignal classes completely useless of which had the most insanely high damage you've ever seen. Many of the cool dungeons in maple story became empty which is really sad because they was excellent. Sadly maple story degressed into this sub par kind of game. I want Wizet back, I want my maple story. Do I recommend it to you? No, Nexon is a greedy company but you won't really noticed how screwed up the game is unless you was there from the start. You won't notice all the cool stuff taken out because they'll try to blind you with high numbers and stupid classes to ego stroke your♥♥♥♥♥♥  "

Review as follows: Simple version up top, detailed on ""read more"". Note: I have played this game for well over 2,000+ hours over the years, and long before it was released on steam; how I ever racked up that many hours I will never know, but the game is not worth even 1 hour of your playtime.The good:  A classic 2D action platformer  Many character classes  Many areas to explore  The Bad  Character classes are horribly balanced  Classes do not particularly stand out from each other  (their niche's all blur together now) There is a huge problem with botters and hackers (people using cheats)  Traveling is a serious pain, and they draw it out ALOT to make you want to spend $$ money to make it easier.  Items purchased with $$ have a time limit (usually 90 days) The Worst   The game is so horribly coded it takes approx 2+ minutes to start even on high end computers  it will often take several attempts to start the game in order to start up properly (you will be getting lots of errors) The game crashes FREQUENTLY you could be playing for 5 minutes and it will crash so hard you must force shut down your computer  The game servers frequently need extended maintanence (often emergency maintenece; occurs several times a week)They force you to pay $$ real cash to have or upgrade abilities your character should have to begin with (such as the ability to hit criticals with magic attacks; which is INVALUABLE)  They make quests and grinding require so much travel you are essentially forced to purchase teleport rocks or other timesavers  Dying is exceptionally easy at higher levels, even the best gear can get you killed in as little as 5 hits (which you can get hit about every second), if you want to avoid the 10% exp loss you have to buy consumable ""charms"" to negate the 10% exp loss (which is many hours of work at higher levels).  Looting is atrocious (essentially requires spending $$ to get pets and items to have them loot for you.  They create artifical demandOn to the detailed and truely abominable things that make this game horrendous, almost beyond words. Fundamentally flawedThe simple act of looting is to push the ""loot"" button which is both ""Z"" and the numpad 0. As you progress through the game the method for fighting ""mobs"" is at the bucket loads, you will be killing 4~12 monsters within every 5 seconds. Each monster drops 2~4 items which are money, a misc monster drop, a potion, and a ""ticket fragment"" of sorts to do a special instance run that is always dead (no one does them.). So for every item you want to pickup, you must push ""Z"" and you will find that you will quickly be pushing that key hundreds if not THOUSANDS of times every few minutes. And if you dont loot those items you make essentially no money. The entire economy is seriously inflated to begin with too. If you want looting to be convenient be prepared to shell out about $30~$40 every 90 days for a pet and its ""gear"" to make it run around to loot things for you.You are forced to struggle with inventory space. At first you may think that you have plenty of space, but you quickly find out that the ""Use"" items and ""misc"" tabs will quickly be overlowing from NECESSARY items (the several hundred or THOUSAND potions you will be carrying, and have to replace every few hours or so). while the ETC slot will be filled with quest items, materials for crafting, and of course the hoards of monster drops you will be picking up (which usually only stack up to 200).Items you buy with $$ are NOT account-wide. They use a nonsense ""cash inventory"" system which is only shared with other characters of the same class (except in some rare caes like the ""adventurer"" series of classes or the ""cygnus knights."" However after the addition of the resistance they have their own shared cash inventory as well. You may think that is good enough but it IS NOT! because there are 2x of all that combined in classes that have a cash inventory shared only with other characters of the same class (which is POINTLESS because then you would be leveling up the exact same thing all over again; as each class only has 1 build, a special exception is made few 2 or 3 classes which can be either 1 element or another). Please note I am not talking about how a magician splits off into ice/lightning or fire/poison, I am referring to how a single class with a single skillset can have skills you wont want to invest in because they have no real part in the only effective way to create your character; which can be ever so important as there are skills in future advancements that require some certain skills to be Maxed.).They purposefully make things that should be everyday and easy access functions, exceedingly hard. For example, if you want to sell ANYTHING to ANY players, you want to go to the ""free market"" with about 50 other people, all spamming trying to sell things. If you want to sell ANYTHING as easily as it should be, you have to spend about ~$5 to buy a shop that your character has to man (lasts 90 days) just to sell things, which is horrendous in itself because you cant play the game, and it has a tendency to CRASH FREQUENTLY, and so hard you will have to FORCE SHUTDOWN YOUR PC!. So if you want to sell things as effectively as it should be, you have to spend $10 USD+ just to setup a store that will sell things for you (you set prices), and those can last 1 day to 7 days (getting more expensive for longer, up to $30 USD.) Character balancing is pitiful They come out with new character classes OFTEN! I swear, whenever you start getting your character to a high enough level to be happy with it, they release something that will outclass you in EVERY WAY! and you will essentially be forced to play that newest class since the monsters only get stronger to keep competing with the newest classes. And dont expect your old class to get revamped any time soon! it took them well over 3 years just to update the adventurers ONCE. and over a year for most anything else. In some cases the skillsets even change so completely you wont even recognize what to put your skill points into! but it gets WORSE! because if you make a mistake you will have to spend the $5+ USD to reset your points and hope you get it right the next time. It used to be that you had to spend about that much to reset a SINGLE POINT! and most skills require 20 or 30, im sure you can see how atrocious that is (the complete reset is only a new addition too, if you wanted reset you had to wait until they revamp your class again, because customer service WILL NOT HELP YOU!Customer service from Nexon is essentially non-existant, in fact, 99% of any and all messages you will get from them are automated. And no matter how large or small your problem is, nothing will be done. Your account getting hacked, or a broken quest (some havent been fixed for 2+ years), maybe even missing items/progress from a rollback, you will not get any help.There is no acceptable passive regen's (% or fixed numbers) for being in or out of combat, the only class that had one (the Jett) was removed with their revamp. So of course you must rely on potions ENTIRELY for you healing (unless you are a healer of sorts). The only passive regen you do have is 10hp for standing still for 10 seconds, and at higher levels (something you quickly reach) you have 7,000+ HP easy. while mana regen's at 3, which your mana is easily over 2,000 regardless of class (mages can go up to 30,000).There are countless more horrible things I can tell you about, but i feel I have made my point, and I beleive this is enough reasons why this game is among the things you should never play. Comments and likes are greatly appreciated! lets get the word out on why this is an awful game!			"

												I have no idea if Steam will say at all if I've played Maplestory but I promise you all I have put a lot of time into this game and absolutely loved every minute. Unfortunately Maplestory just became completely uninteresting since I've tried to relive it. And it makes me really sad. Maplestory originally had the classes we all see in every MMO (no matter how hard other MMO's try to make it different) and of course also like every MMO it started off simple. One big difference of course was the fact that it was a 2D sidescrolling MMOPRG and it's done so beautifully. You can make different faces at people depending on how you feel which was really fun before the cliche ""lol"" and ""lmao"" texts we all now universally know. Getting weapons was also a little more unique since most MMO's just milk weapons. Now a lot of MMORPG's have bows with unlimited arrows and guns with unlimited bullets. Maplestory made you buy arrows and throwing stars/shuriken if you wanted to be a ranged class. And Mesos (Maplestory currency) was hard to come by at low levels making it even more challenging since you had to actually ask for money from time to time.When I originally loved this amazing piece of gaming art you had to use a taxi to get to different cities (which you still do at least) and use flying boats to get to different continents. This was a huge deal because it allowed you to just settle down for a short time and actually talk to people; and listen to music along the way. Now this is not the case. There were no overpowered and annoyingly voice acted 'Hero' classes that literally kill everything in their paths with ease. You really had to work to get more powerful back then and you also needed to manually know what your stats needed to be for your class. Maplestory added more powerful classes over time but they were never 'Hero' status. Yes they got more powerful due to their unique skills compared to the default classes; however you still needed to start off as a default class and work your way into the more unique class you selected and leveling was still just as hard for you as the rest. The music is still the same Maplestory anime music I know and love. I just wish it could be heard with the game I knew and loved. For all you new players out there reading this review it'll mean close to nothing probably. To shorten what I just said: Maplestory used to be a surprisingly vast game filled with lots of social opportunity and hours upon hours of questing and leveling. It's a shell of its former self now. This does not mean I say it's a bad game. It's still good and worth the try. But unfortunately you have missed the golden age that was Maplestory. It's all milked down and I can't recommend it in its state now. What used to take a couple weeks to a month takes less than a day now. Bosses that originally required a full team can easily be defeated solo and the monsters that were originally intimidating and powerful are powerless. The challenge is gone. I will miss you Maplestory.			"

												MapleStory is that one game you're probably never going to find another of its calibre. It has that feel of nostalgia, even if you're new to the game. Attractive art styles look cartoony and cute while retaining 2d and pixelation draw people in this game with its surprising uniqueness. Maplestory has been breathing since 2005, but is it stable breathing?-Leveling-Maplestory was in its prime long back when generation Y was around 6 years old (2005 debut). If you compare the leveling from old Maplestory to post-big bang Maplestory, youll notice a huge difference. Its easier to hit level 100 nowadays, but back then whoever was over level 100 was considered a god. Old Maplestory had challenging leveling, so challenging that it took months to hit just 50. If you see the game now, it's a joke to hit 50, a 5 year old could do it in an hour.Of course Maplestory's leveling system will never be as good as it was back then; it evolves for newer audience because Nexon know the older audience will eventually quit. This is an instant gradification era, people want to level up quickly, not like a snail, to a point where it bores them to level up only 10 times a week. So, Nexon implemented an easier leveling system. One could argue that Nexon actually saved the game from dying off earlier.I won't argue anymore about Nexon saving the game with the leveling system, I used to think it was a saving throw, but I realized it's pretty much easy if you have enough change in your pockets. You can buy your levels. That's right. Nexon milked the leveling system for money. (by buy I mean buying 2x coupons and smashing keys to hit 200 easy peasy granted you have the money)-You ultimately don't have to spend money, but it makes you look/feel like trash-Nexon milked this game so much that its clear instead of a thick white. You ultimately don't have to spend money, since you CAN get anything you need without money. Let me elobrate, of course its convenient to buy cubes instead of pressing your mouse to farm for minerals and craft one, so the obvious logic is to do illegal activites and buy nexon points with mesos, the ingame currency, from a shady dealer with -239 downvotes. This game isn't really Pay 2 Win, it's more of Pay 4 Convenience. P4C makes you look like japanese eyecandy to people who get turned on to pixels, and makes your equipment hit like train, if that train holds 5 billion damage per hit.But if you don't P4C, you look like absolute crap until you muster enough mesos to buy one permanent nx item that looks decent. Gaining mesos from scratch is a timewaster too, because to merch (the term for buying low, selling high) without staring at your screen and hitting up and down to cycle messages, you have to pay real money to get a stand that does it for you, for about a month. Then you gotta buy it again if you want to merch, or get Carpal Tunnel. Oh, also, unless you spend alot of time and logical thinking on cubing and boosting stats on CRA, might as well fight with a stick because you are doing absolutely nothing to bosses that matter.-The Community-It sucks. Everyone will screw you over. I've seen too many stories when people grow up and try something like CSGO and leave for a month and the guild they had a blood pact with kicks them out, no matter how much they've contributed real life money for. People rarely work together anymore with strangers, guilds are just IRL friend camaradies, or a bunch of snobs who have superiority issues. Nexon realized this, but made it worse because they've made the entire game soloable (of course with money.) The community is just like anti-social teenagers at that one lunch table, if those teenagers tell you to CC if you step into their precious room.-Conclusion-This game, stripped of everything but gameplay, is so great. I love Maplestory's gameplay. I love it. But Nexon made a semi-working money making machine off of it, and completely ruined it for the veterans. I still play it on and off like that one chick in middle school, but Nexon makes so many schemes for cash and I can't believe people are blindlessly falling for it. Don't be tempted to buy that 90 day hair. Either voice your opinion of change to Nexon, or leave the game. It's not worth your time.			"

												I remember waking up as a kid, excited and eager to start up my dad's computer, hopping into the world of Maplestory, ready to take on whatever the game was going to throw at me that day. Needless to say, I was hooked. The cartoony yet oddly satisfying visuals, the huge world that was set before me, the deceptively simple class system, all things that I adored about it. For a while, I couldn't get enough of this game. It was my first MMO ever, and, to this day, probably still my favorite. Nothing comes close to the fun I had while killing mushrooms in the starting zone, slaying Balrogs on airships, destroying robots in Ludi, and finally, conquering Zakum. I made many friends, joined a slew of guilds, and mostly, just had fun. That's what videogames were about back when I played Maplestory, and in a sense, it seems like they've kind of lost that recently, although that's a different topic entirely. Maplestory now seems to be much more oversaturated in terms of classes and things to do, actually making it an overwhemingly experience rather than an extremely enjoyable one, one that I had when I played. Needless to say however, I still had a HUGE amount of fun with this game, and is hands-down one of the best experiences, if not THE best, I've had in gaming. I cannot speak to the community now, but when I was playing, it was a bunch of generous and fun loving people, one's that were willing to help others when they needed it. I miss Maplestory, specifically old Maplestory, even more specifically v.066, when things were simpler and I had a bunch of NX to spend on a different hairstyle. I miss you Maplestory. Thanks for giving me the game of a lifetime.			"

My mom had to close the internet at night so I wouldn't play. Probably played more than 1500 hours since I was 13... I am now 21.Don't play this game if you want a social life.

												Oh man has this game died so much. When I first began playing which was in 2009, the Maplestory community was the best gaming community I had EVER experienced. The social aspect of the game was absolutely amazing. Back then, Factions weren't dead and every day I would find interesting people to play with and party up with. Now, maps are relatively quiet and empty, and you never get the party invites and friendliness that there used to be. People just farm to themselves and the amount of people playing has dropped  so much  that I feel like I'm playing on empty servers all of the time. People don't even bother talk to you and in the major cities all you find is afk players just sitting there waiting for you to rank up their fame. Gameplay has also changed for the worse too. Back then there were relatively few and DISTINCTIVE classes that were unique and gave the game a balanced and helpful feel. Nowadays there is just a bunch of classes that are very similar and their niches are intertwined so much that you feel like class choice doesn't really give you a new and fun experience anymore. They've also emphasized microtransactions too much that it just takes away from the game. Overall, you feel like you're playing in a largely empty singleplayer game that's not even fun because the social aspect has completely rotted to nonexistence and the large amounts of ""events"" that fail at trying to make the game more interesting. The game has died and I must admit that even if you pay lots of money to level up and look cool, it doesn't matter a single ounce in the end because you've wasted your hard earned captical on a game with a meaningless and dead world and community.

												First serious review, go easy on me.tl;dr version, everything died but the devs.review updates at bottomNow, I have been a loyal player of this game since around 2008, despite my hours on Steam. Originally, I played the game off of Nexon's actual download site so I'll take that into account. I've invested over a thousand hours into this game, and boy was it great! The community was very fun to just socialize with and everyone was nice. The party quests differentiated from each other so it wasn't too repetitive. Everybody also worked together to help each other level up, and villages were filled with friends; until about a year or two ago.. Those were the good days.I'm not necessarily saying the game itself is really bad now, but the community just went kablam. It's like napalm upon the nice people of the game. Henceforth, many players disappeared and the developers just turned the game into more of a pay-to-win aspect. ""Whatever happened to the people?"" I ask myself a lot. I always come back to this question as this was my all-time favorite game and community. I don't know. I miss the party invites from random people, and the occurence of running into strangers who become your best friend. Sometimes I think I'm all alone when I'm online since each instance is filled with afk people and others just walking around aimlessly, then logging off just like me, only to check if the game is restored to its former glory. There are also no players left that actually do party quests, an essential thing to leveling up efficiently. ""The tears that come out of one eye are from nostalgia, the tears that come from the other eye are from how bad the game is."", quoted from another reviewer, is similar to what I feel about the present Maplestory.Now onto the pros and cons.Pros:+Great concept of characters+Good storyline that provides a foundation for each character+OMAIGOD THE MUSIC+Many, many places and locations to explore, with hidden quests+Content (apparently still) being added every few months or soThat's all the pros I can come up with from memory for now.Cons:-Pay to win-Screwed over community-Dead servers-Unbalanced charactersWell, that's pretty much it. If I had reviewed this game much earlier, rather than 2015, I would've given this game a recommendation. Is this game worth playing at this point? Not really, unless you're just wanting to explore the game itself. That then concludes my review.If you actually read to this point, thanks for doing so!Update: Apparently, its much easier to level up now. So easy that the game essentially hands you the exp, whereas in the past you actually had to work for it using teamwork. If you're looking for that nostalgia, it's not there anymore. Also, remember the ship you took took to Orbis and the people you met on that ship? Well, nobody uses it anymore. There's no more aspect of exploration since you can just use a dimensional portal or something, or a click and go item.Update Update: holy♥♥♥♥♥♥what the ♥♥♥♥, people still use basilmarket to communicate. thats a plus i guess			"

												A once-great game with a rather unique style, ruined by balance changes homogenizing all the classes, pay-to-win power creep, and no customer support.Aside from the graphics of skills being different and some classes requiring ammunition to use theirs, it's all a matter of using the fastest skill that hits multiple times so you can hit the damage cap twelve times in a single attack. With the occasional buff to prevent the bosses from instagibbing you with one of their attacks.The only challenge most bosses in this game have come from one of two factors: 1, Attacks that reduce your health and mana to 1, dispel your buffs, or take control away from your character.2. Having HP totals somewhere in the billions, and a short time limit to bring that to zero. Not a problem for people who hit the damage cap with every attack (50,000,000), but for people too self-aware to spend loads of dosh on cash items to upgrade in-game equipment they're impossible.Getting away from the game mechanics, the servers are infested with hackers and botters. How infested? There are more botters in the game than actual players. There's a ""Report to GM"" function, but if a GM actually responds to it, you should probably either buy a lottery ticket, or more likely slap yourself in the face because you are in a dream world where the impossible is possible. GMs only show up to host godawful events and spam emoticons while spouting lies.On that note, the game has an autoban function built into it, which 90% of the time bans nonhackers doing something mundane for no reason. On the off chance a hacker/botter actually is banned, they'll eventually be unbanned because Nexon likes giving people ""second chances"" and unbanning everyone who was ever banned up to that point. Why? Because hackers spend money too ya know! Gotta keep profits up!I said there is no customer support, but I was lying. There is a customer support ticket system, but it would probably better if it didn't exist at all. Tickets can go without a response for literally years. Nexon also has this opinion that having your account hacked into is the player's fault and refuses to compensate. One of the Global exclusive areas even has a quest line that mocks this, giving the middle finger to everyone who had their account broken into and laughing at them.Long story short, Unique art-style Platformer-MMORPG that crashed and burned and then was grinded into the dirt. Cause of death? Power creep, pay-to-win, and apathy and malice from the company that runs it. Avoid it like the plague if the plague were also on fire and making rude gestures at you.			"

												    After I have experienced SO much about Maplestory, from playing it since 9 years ago plus on various private servers, I think it is time to hit delete key and post a caveat for curious 12-year-old like you to see. This game does not hurt if you play with some friends. Honestly, being playing with friends is the only good way to play this game since they serve as a reminder that you still have a real life. Without such link to the reality, it is too easy to be sucked into the scheme of Maplestory that is deliberately, fundamentally created to exhaust both your mind and wallet    Because remember: the philosophy of any MMORPG is to encourage competition between players strictly on the level of vanity and facile values, being how beautiful you look, how much money you have, how high damage can you hit...... Especially when you are lonely in the game, this emotion is easily ellicited because the game encourages so in any aspect. But the trick is, we all understand there is no ending to beautiful cash shop items and the amount of currency you possess, why can't we/I keep from not coming back to torture ourselves in the grinding and trading that ultimately lead to no real satisfaction?    Because those game developers(e.g. Nexon) understand how pleasure works in us. What human desires is not a specific, final object, but a differential value through a growing experience. That is to say, pleasure is only gained through change; and after you arrive at a threshold, being it posed by the game or your brain, you are only left with emptiness. And this is when you want to start the loop again, again, and again. This is precisely why we only want to make MORE money, why we want to spend MORE cash items, and get MORE levels/damage without it ending at a specific number. This is why Nexon created so many new types of characters and jobs: they want to give you the pseudo-novel feeling each time you restart the experience, while in fact, nothing has changed about how your pleasure works. It's an everlasting loop.    So instead of clicking the ""Play Game"" button. Why not think about something more valuable in your life? Whether or not you are willing to participate in this collective subconscious hell of pleasure looping is your own choice. If you really want to play, play it with friends. I am lonely, I don't have friends. Since I understand all these, I decide to quit.			"

												ATTENTION EUROPEAN PLAYERS: Avoid playing on European servers at all costs, it's trash. Just play on the NA one, the european server lags like crazy. Especially if you've got strong internet, in that case you won't feel any lag in NA, while there'll always be lag on the european server, as it's the server's problem.I don't want to beg for ""likes"", but please upvote this review so people can be aware of this.Thank you in advance :)			"

												In my opinion, this game used to be really good. It's still good, but not as good as it was.Maplestory has lost something that many older players found extremely valuable, community. While community still exists in the form of guilds, free market, and henehoes, the lack of rewarding party quests and party-training zones encourage most players to walk the path of a solo player; simply put, the game rewards you much more for playing by yourself. The game is still enjoyable. It allows you to spend your time to work towards achieving a certain goal, whether it be a higher level or new items. If you love grinding, you'll really enjoy this game.			"

												Disclamer: This is long, but my review of the game is towards the bottomAbout me: A friend recommended this game to me back in 2006 when it was still in its first few years. I downloaded it and was hooked immediately. Except for Runescape, this was my first MMORPG. My friend moved away but we kept in contact for awhile through this game, and I also ""met"" a lot of people in-game that i became as close as you can be in a fake world. I felt cool pretending to be 16 and people actually believing me.Starting out back in the day this game was hard. Hard in the sense that it takes a long time, effort, and collaboration even to reach the second job advancement at lvl 30. I still have my very first character at about lvl 26. This game hooks you in and keeps you grinding and doing quests all because of wanting to be like those who were lvl 70+ and had the cool job advancements. Over the years things started to get a little easier. With a new account and job classes like the cygnus knights coming out things were still looking good for this game. I was playing it more for time-wasting instead of sheer need/addiction (yes, looking back i was wildly addicted to this game). It was still something to play with my friends, but i still recognized i needed a life. Getting my first character to lvl 70 (an assasin) was a very big step for me, and when it took me forever just to get it to lvl 72 thats when i started to realize i needed to stop. FAST FORWARD 2-3 years and its summer and i think, huh i kind of want to waste some time. That summer i fell back in love with Maplestory, but for a different reason, it was so easy to level. I was able to get several characters to higher levels (60s-70s) rather quickly and it was fun to experiment with the wide set of classes that were new. But this is where Maplestory for me started to lose its touch. I would every few months or so log on and just think ""Oh i wonder whats changed this time"" and its always something. It isnt what I fell in love with anymore.Now in college i found myself playing this once in a blue moon if i had some down time and wanted to just relax. This game has a therapeutic sense to it that i just go around doing quests/grinding till 2AM. Nowadays it is so eay to level up i started a character and in about an hour it was at level 50. along with my 70 assasin, i have a 12X dual blade and my main character is a 135 Aran, one of my all time favorite classes (i havent really been interested in the new classes). So if you're still reading this, im almost done. Why do i still play this game? Nostalgia. Plain and simple. when you spend as much time as i have on something like this it is hard to give it up. I have wonderful MEMORIES of this game and i play now to waste time. ---------------------------------------------------ABOUT THE GAME: Pay to Win: A lot of people say its a 'pay to win' game but i have spent about $5 of NX just for looks purposes, i made my couple million mesos on sheer grit and luck with some equipment and scroll drops. Its possible without it, but it takes work. Art: This game is beautiful. Not much else to say really.Community: All about gone. As a ""veteran"" i can tell that it is all solo now, even the PQs can be solo. Also the free market is empty except for the stores, that should tell you something.Gameplay: If you like doing quests and grinding and doing storylines, its for you. If you're expecting something more, look elsewhere. As i have said before: this game was addicting to me, some may play for only a little but there are only extremes for this game. Either 10 hours or 1000. BE WARNED. Nexon: They dont really give a crap about their players so dont expect very good customer service (which is why i would steer clear of NX, you dont need it)Hacking: Theres in-game hackers and then there are people who hack accounts. Luckily after being off the grid for about 2-3 years i was able to come back on and have everything right where i left it. I guess i was lucky. Because of the time i put into it and how much of this game i have seen, from the beginning to the end, i can only recommend this with a word of caution. Dont invest yourself into the game but still have fun with it because it is a wild ride. I believe this game can only get a 1/10 or a 10/10 and i have to give it 10/10 for what it has been for me. You've been warned.I apoligize for the novel but this is what Maplestory has caused, it is a beautiful game and it is something that has been that nagging baby sister for the past ~10 years and it is something that i will always look back and laugh about and think of how much ******* time i put into that game.

												This is a game that SHOULD be fun. It really SHOULD be. It has everything it needs:Awesome music, amazing graphics (You get used to the character sprites.) and lots of things to do, tons of classes that function very differently the farther you go along, but eases you into them at first.So why am I not suggesting this game?Nexon isn't the 'best' company when it comes down to it. They have a Cash Shop. You want a pet? Cash shop. You want nice looking armor to RENT to display over your current armor? Cash shop. Teleport wherever you want? Cash shop. EXP boost? Cash shop.Literally anything and everything is a Cash Shop. Yes it's not the only MMO to have it, but it clearly abuses it so much and was (Likely) one of the first MMOs to truly abuse the heck out of the system. Don't worry if you forget about it, you'll get reminded with drops, quests, and so on that there is a way to buy your way out of everything.The community itself? If you've played an MMO, you know what to expect. Generally this consists of people who speak nothing to you most of the time- except in a market, in which case you get spammed with lots of things you won't know what they mean.The best way to compare the free market on channel one is like watching ants swarm a meal. It's fascinating and disgusting at the same time...and by the way, you're the meal.You can use the forums to get in guilds which aren't bad, but even then most of the lingo is confusing- half because MS has a text limit shorter than a Twitter message, half because they have a filter that is so picky that I could never state my friend 'is' something because it gets filtered out, even if I wanted to say 'is great'Another dislike about the game is the AI. 90% of the enemies you encounter outside of dungeons  (At least up to lvl 120) use the same pattern of ""I'm gonna run into you and damage you that way!"" which, yeah there's hundreds of enemies, but it's all just nothing short of a pallete swap if they all get the same functionality.In the end, Maplestory has a lot of ingredients to be a great game, but too many spices put into the soup end up making a good soup turn rotten (But still look pretty). And that's the best way to describe it.			"

												I've been playing MapleStory off and on since the year it came out, I think I was about 10. Oh lord so much of my childhood was spent pouring endless hours into this game. Something about it is addictive and enticing enough to make you come back about once a year for a week long binge. That being said, it's gone through a lot of phases as far as games go. It started out gaining a huge amount of popularity by having one of the best communities I've seen in an MMO, cute graphics, unique skills in each class, but it was largely grind based. Grind based MMO's are more tolerable if you have friends around you that also play the game, but Nexon started making it more pay to win and so eventually it thinned out a lot. Nexon respond by throwing class after class, new world after new world, new maps, and tons of other extraneous stuff to entice players to stay/come back but without addressing the pay to win problem so the game died almost beyond recovery. It was still grind based, with only three basic forms of quests - killing monsters/gathering items, jumping on platforms with obstacles, or traveling across an ever expanding map that would just suck up idle time. Since then, it seems Nexon finally started tackling some of the main problems players have been complaining about. There are faster ways to get across the map, cross-world features to elliminate the thinned out player base, it's not necessarily as grind based, there are more unique monsters popping up, and far more quests and features. It doesn't seem as pay to win, and Nexon is improving on what they have rather than just throwing more stuff at players. It's more fun than I remember it, and I never thought I'd ever describe MapleStory as fun again. The community is still thin but there is more to do in the game and it's more balanced than ever. Overall it's worth a shot, but if you want your character to look remotely decent you're still going to have to spend money.			"

 Nostalgia and the big numbers blind me If you've never heard of Maplestory just skip it. To be completely honest with you the only reason I got this game on Steam was for the nostalgia. I've been playing this game on and off for so many years. (Since 2006) This game was fantastic, but it was ruined by it's absurdly high damage numbers, (which get so damn high that Nexon has to raise the cap on damage) The insane high prices of the free market, and the sheer amount of classes. (There's 32 classes! THIRTY TWO! I was so happy when Pirate first came out.) Oh and the community. Do you like 12 year olds? Well that's basically a majority of the community. Here's my recent adventures. Recently I played this game AGAIN for the 90th time. I chose Adventurer my bread and butter, I picked Magician and picked the Cleric tree.  As soon as you hit level 20 you get bombarded by all these alerts. ""JOIN THE NEW CHAT SYSTEM."" ""EVENT!!!!!"" ""GACHAPON GACHAPON!"" I got very annoyed very quickly. After a very quick leveling grind to level 100, I got my fourth job Bishop. I was very happy that I made it to level 100 because back in my day I've gotten a level 100 Dark Knight.  Soon after my 4th job I realised.♥♥♥♥♥♥there's 150 more levels. I gave up after that. The community annoyed me the grind was boring (Just spammed HS for bonus Xp) and I didn't want to spend any real life money to cube any items or scroll anything.  Final Verdict:  It WAS a good game. The game is no longer enjoyable. But my inner 12 year old makes me want to love it.  Nostalgia is the only reason I would see someone play this. The game on it's own is a grind all the way to level 250. The big numbers are blinding and are hard to track, the classes have no ""uniqueness"" It's all about DAMAGE DAMAGE DAMAGE.  5/10 Nice nostalgia trip, game isn't fun anymore Edit:Went from being most recommended negative review to not existing at all.If you can't take backlash for your dying game consider fixing it instead of hiding negative reviews. Thank you for hiding my review though!Proof: http://imgur.com/nVIs5tXMy review doesn't even show up. If you can't take negative reviews please just delete all of them. If you say that this is an outdated review, please look at most recommended reviews. There's reviews older or just about the same age as mine. Please delete their reviews too then.			"

												I really do wish I could recommend this game. I have spend many, many, hours on it. I was drawn in by the excellent storyline and seemingly endless levels.But then it hits you. The level curve is absurd. The content is either sparse or not worth your time (good luck leveling between 120 - 150) and the top play is just far too repetative. There is always a best build, and they are painfully obvious. All these status effects, elemental damage, forget them. Only element that matters is holy, and most enemies die before you can do whatever horrible status effect to them.Maplestory, gameplay wise, seems to be hanging you between faster leveling crowd attacks or better boss-killing single target attacks. Usually you end up a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mix of all of them, and it seems like that's the track most classes are now moving.Really, the only difference between most of these classes is their DPS and weapon of choice. While this one has to balance light/dark, this one rides on a panther, and this one is so adorably ridiculously pink, it doesn't make a bit of difference. You're either a bishop or a killer. Class synergy? Nope. Tanks and Strikers? Nope. I guess the best example of this are the boss battles, which just involve going down your attacks, drinking crap tons of potions, and watching a screen literally covered with colorful multi digit numbers. You do this for an hour, and if you can't do it under a hour, you lose. Fun.There is so much to like about Maplestory, but even more to hate. Honestly, I play it for the community. I'm not saying the game is awful, I'm just saying it is intensely flawed.			"

												I started playing this game when pirates came out. I used to love this game I really did. What I loved the most out of this game was the sense of being part of a community. The community is still active with an estimated 50,000-70,000 players but will continue to dwindle since less people join the game than there are leaving. I left because I didn't like the direction the game was taking.I can't say if the game is still worth playing.. All but one server, the Reboot server, are pay to win. If you have the time to do mindless grinding then the Reboot server is for you (keep in mind that you cannot trade anything in this server). Find yourself a guild and hopefully you find some nice people to chat with. I don't recommend joining the non-reboot servers anymore as the majority of the old veterans are one of the most etilist and toxic players out there, and that's coming from the veteran player I am. Pretty much the normal servers are kept alive by the whales who spend tons of money in the game still. Anyone willing to pay can to be on top but I decided to not spend the money myself, it seems pointless and unfun instead of working towards progressing your character yourself. One of the things I really disliked about this game was the introduction of the potential system. Potential widened the gap between rich and poor players. It divided the community even further. There are a ton of potential related items in the cash shop that give an unfair advantage to players with lots of money to drop in non-Reboot servers. Reboot is just a band-aid for the problem potentials created in this game. Reboot is a server Nexon created that solved many pay to win aspects, however this comes with many drawbacks, including the inability to trade with one another within the server. Another problem I saw was that Nexon was nerfing party related quests and raids, it was encouraging people to go solo instead of partying with other people which is what I loved from this game (as of today you'll rarely see anyone doing party quests, most people are grinding now instead of doing PQs/Boss Runs/Raids to level up). Now that the damage cap has been removed there is little reason to party with others to do stuff if you're decently funded. One other minor problem I saw is that Nexon created tons of servers, there was no reason to create more, the population wasn't even increasing and it further divided the playerbase. They finally merged many of the barren servers into single servers but are still even less populated than the top 3 populated non Reboot servers.The game gets minor updates monthly with the occasional major update every now and then, so the game is still alive in that aspect. Thanks to Nexon Korea's ongoing support for the game, there's many more things to do than you could do in old MapleStory which is one of the few things this MMO has going. If you are looking for a good MMO to play I recommend you look elsewhere, but if you really want to try it out, go join the Reboot server, it is the most populated server and hopefully you find some nice people to chat with.TL:DR The game is extremely pay to win if you're not playing the Reboot server (keep in mind that you cannot trade in this server). I recommend joining the reboot server only if youre willing to try the game out. The game has an average of 50000-70000 players at the moment.			"

												Used to play the game years ago, when Maplestory wasn't in steam, but Reboot and nostalgia pulled me back into the game. This game is for you if you love grinding, but thats pretty much all there is with this game. Socialization has deteriorated in this game because of faster levelling, faster transportation, and the evaporation of casual players. Unless you have friends to play with this game, you are mostly by yourself. I've never been into MMORPGs due to the grinding aspect, but this game has made want to re-evaluate what I am doing with my life. The only accomplishment I feel from this game is seeing large numbers in the damage I deal to mobs and bosses.			"

												I started playing this game before ludi and orbis came out.When seeing someone at the 3rd job was an excitement.When you had to wait for a ship to orbis about 10 minutes and get scared to die from the flying balrog on the ship.When a warrior that dealt 1k damage at lvl 30 to a giant slime at kerning PQ was a - ""WOW!""When illbi was worth 35m and you tried to get it from the vicious mushmom to get rich.When getting your first million was a great achievement.This is the maplestory i love Nexon made the game too easy which kinda ruined the game for me and a lot of peopleI still recommend this game because for new players it should be a very fun game and a time burner.

												To give some context, I've been playing on/off since Beta. So I have a nostalgia for this game I cannot shake. Therefore, at the time of writing this review, I have 912 hours of this game on my Steam account. But don't get me wrong. Most of this was just me AFKing overnight to sell things, because if you want to have a shop that you can leave open without playing the game, you have to pay a crazy amount of money. I think it's like, I dunno, $3 for a 24 hour shop. Yeah. Meanwhile, it's only $1.80 for a 3 month permit to do the same thing, but you have to be online. Seems fair, right? Yeah. Anyways, here's the review lmao+ Surprisingly fun combat+ Consistently updated+ Several different classes+ Levelling is straightforward and easy+ Reboot server takes the pay to win out of the game (but also removes other features as a result, encouraging people to keep playing on the P2W servers as well)+ Very cute style, have had a lot of fun customizing my character with gear.~ Simple Crafting system (Both good and bad, because those who don't like crafting in MMOs typically won't have trouble using it, but it also makes it boring for those who love in-depth crafting systems in MMOs.)- Pay to win out the♥♥♥♥♥ People sell their godly weapons and armor on Paypal. Anyone with a few hundred dollars can become number one in a day.- Outdated, constantly lags and crashes, built on old framework and needs updating. The sequel, Maplestory 2, looks fun but will probably never come out globally.- Once you reach a certain level, your daily routine typically involves fighting the standard bosses for about an hour or two then keeping your shop open overnight to sell more and buy more gear/cosmetics. It's a massive grind til the very end.- Pay 2 Fashion. You have a very small, if even any, selection of hairs/faces at the beginning. The only way to change them is with NX. No joke, you have to pay real money to change your hair and face. Of course, you can just pay people to gift you a coupon with in-game money, but if you want to have enough in-game cash to pay someone to do that, you either have to beg or pay real money to get gear to grind for these things. In short, unless you're insanely patient or have wealthy friends, you're going to be coerced into buying NX with real cash. Because looking ugly in an MMO sucks. Oh, and not to mention, the best hairs are in Royal Coupons and the likes, which have a RANDOM SELECTION of 6-8 hairs, of which at least half usually look terrible. This game wants your money. That's why it's still alive. And it works.Overall: Giant cash grab. Still fun if you have the money. If you don't like looking decent and don't care about bossing, then sure, I can see how you can enjoy this game, but honestly, who's going to go to this outdated MMO and do that? There are better MMOs out there. Don't waste your time here.			"

												First of all I don't have 9 hours on this game. I have a few thousand on this game. I just played the client version most of the time. Honestly, when this game came out way back when in '05, I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. It was hella fun but it was also really hard. I mean if you were level 50 you had great respect. Now getting to level 50 can be done in 2 hours as apposed to 2 months of training 4 hours a day. I mean like if you got to lv200 back then people would waste money to acknowledge you for what you have done. Now if you get to level 200 its just a race to 250 or to get super high damage and solo bosses to make real money on paypal or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Then later on they made Big Bang which made it super easy. Big Bang continues on and now its hard again. They raise the level cap from 200-250. Still takes like 3-5 days to get to Lv250 is unknown how long it will take because no one has reached there yet. In my opinion, this game has become completely pay to win. Nexon has declined in their service from where they started. Before buying NX was for like for clothes that didn't do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ But then nexon was all like, ""Lets make every piece of equipment♥♥♥♥♥♥ and put a bunch of NX items to scroll them, reset their potenial, protect them from being destroyed and a bunch of other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."" That really made me mad and now I ended up spending more then $7000 on this game. I ended up making Close to $10,000 in paypal credit over time but that was only because I played way too much. I farmed bosses and scrolled and sold items all day and all night. I got sucked in and do me a favor, never get sucked in. I was lucky to make that much money back. To be honest, that was over the course of 4 years. Its not worth giving up even a minimum wage job for that kind of pay. Go get a job and make something out of your life. Back when there was only 4 jobs and it was super hard, those were the good days. Like the actually unbanned hackers recently just to get more attention back in the game. Wait i'm sorry, let me say that again. THEY UNBANNED HACKERS SO THEY COULD GET MORE PEOPLE TO PLAY THEIR ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME. I hate to say shiity but thats what it has become. Probably 70% of the userbase how is Hackers/Botters. Freaking Angel Prossecer is free and theres also BT that just allow people to level up fast and♥♥♥♥♥♥ For christ sake the 3rd best highest level is a hacker. ZeroByDivide better known as Divide By Zero on Gamersoul (maplestory hacking website). He has some of the rares duped items and IGN's and so much more♥♥♥♥♥♥ He has CLB's that hes always using to find exploits and hes also leveling super fast. This game is just not worth it any more. Stop wasting your time on this stuff. If your a billionare, then this game is for you. Don't waste your time.			"

												i played this game in its original day. the orginal four classes were fun and challenging. leveling actually was a challenge. it took a while to even get to your 2nd job change. now you can get to 2nd and even 3rd job in less than a day. now that they added all these new classes, the game isnt the same anymore. the new classes can solo bosses that used to take a whole team. the map is nothing like it was. and after a while it is just boring, you end up doing the same thing over and over and over again that its not fun anymore.

												Alright so this game is a mix with meBack then, I was a beta tester in 2002, a year before the game released. The game used to be randomized at the character selection including you as the player having to roll the dice for your stats as your beginning class. Now it just feels like the characters have no variety, with Phantoms, Xenon, Kinesis and other classes.It used to be just the explorers, warrior, archer etc and back then the commmunity was amazing.Now gamers in general are pretty anti-social, I could even say that communitys in games like Minecraft or any other indie games have better communities now.If only Nexon saw the worth in the nostalgia of the old maple. I know they made the reboot server, but that isn't really much to provide everything about the old Maple.MapleSTORY, this game at this point has no story. The story that we all took back then ended, the player was supposed to go through their own personal story and the game's story at the same time, but now it's just... nothing, no friends, nothing. Hackers are invading a lot and ruining the game's experience, and the big players aren't even around anymore. Areas like Henesys, kerning city just feels DEAD. Afk players are there but not really playing anything. I remember being a kid and talking about Anime and such around Henesys and having fun little arguments, and those were the times when people didn't take everything so seriously. Maplestory used to be pretty innocent, but now kids are cursing in the game and such and it ruins the experience. Nexon ruined the games by removing Gapachon and adding cubes and other buy to play stuff and it turned a game where socializing and playing with your best pals into a buy to play anti social place. Gameplay is the same but the characters feel WAY TOO OP, and leveling is way too fast. The HUD is different too, I prefer the new one though so thats fine. Character creation is somewhat better, more variety in hairstyles and some of them, you had to pay back then. Seasonal Events still are pretty dead and overall, this game is dead. I think old maplers such as myself placed down the maple leaf for the new generation already. BUT, if you have a group of friends and you guys want a game to play, PLAY MAPLESTORY! It's pretty fun with friends, even though you grind extremely fast and level up fast. I rate this game 7/10 but back then it would've been a 10/10 for me.			"

												Here is the thing, It isn't exactly the game itself, as much as it is the community. When the game first came out, the community for it was amazing! Everywhere you looked, you could see a player in every map. It was a game where you had to work together to make any progress. You knew the big name players; FangBlade, Tigger, CurryIsHot, etc. The community was there. It was loving, it was caring, it was a game that you wanted to play with friends instead of alone. It wasn't so much how long it took to get somewhere, as opposed to how you got there. Now the game is just too quick and easy to do anything. There are far too many classes, and instead of using skills from each class; (for example, one of the most famous party quests, the Ludibrium Tower PQ, you NEEDED to have at least a magician and a thief in your party otherwise you could not complete the party quest) is now replaced with 'HEY I CAN BEAT EVERY BOSS IN THE GAME IN 2 DAYS BY MYSELF BECAUSE I BOUGHT NX'. It just doesn't have the same player base, and I believe that is the reason so many people are quitting.As someone who has played since 2006, these 10 years have really brought a change to my eyes on the game I once loved.Here are some key points:1) The game is too rushed now. I know leveling slow sounds boring, but back in the day the excitement of getting to level 21 after hours of work so you can start Kerning PQing with your friends. Getting your 2nd job took work and then going to Ludi PQ was another fun adventure when you had friends to do it with. Getting tracks and looking for the best 'clicker' to get you into the PQs and what not. It was fun. Someone being level 70 back then was amazing. You'd look up to them. Now you can get it within 5 hours of playing hard. When Zakum first came out, for a long time there was a select few who could even dream about getting a zakum helmet, now everyone has one.2) Pay to win. They added all this new stuff to upgrade your items like cubes and I don't even know what else. Back in the day the only thing that NX bought you was cool hair, clothes and pets. Now, if you wana be the best at this game, you have to pay a lot of money for it with cubes, and other NX items.3) Simplicity. This is what is turning me off at the moment. Back when I played, there was only Mage, Bowmen, Theifs and Warriors (and the rare 'beginner' main), and it was awsome. Each class had strengths and weaknesses at different points in the game, and the world wasn't too gaint to explore. The old saying 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' I think. People enjoyed making one of each of the 4 classes (even more if you wanted Spearman, fighter, F/P mage, clerics, bandits etc). Now, when I opened maplestory, I see like 20 different classes at least, and each probably have their own sub-classes, it's just too much imo. Back then it was easy to balance (in fact they almost never had to balance any classes cause they were so equal) but, I imagine with this many classes now, sometimes they get out of balance and certain ones outshine heavily.

												I've been a loyal player of this game for the past eight years (I started back in the Summer of 2006), and despite Nexon's blatant destruction of the game with limited customer support and not giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their playerbase...I can somehow still enjoy this game. As of recent, I mainly stick around because, yes, the game is QUITE fun if you find your little clique of friends, and because somehow, I enjoy the story of Maple's heroes fighting against the Black Mage. A few of the Hero classes have one hell of a backstory to them, and despite clunky, unfair gameplay mechanics, I like it. Yes, I'm aware Nexon couldn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about how their players feel, and yes, they break the game continuously while providing ""patch updates"" to cover up their intentional ♥♥♥♥-ups.Long story short? Nah, can't really recommend it to anybody. Am I going to keep playing it? Probably; waiting to watch it burn is more like it. I can equate my experiences to sitting with a group of friends, enjoying their marshmallows around a campfire, when suddenly, a wild sasquatch arrives behind you and tosses someone into the flames. The question is: who will be next?			"

												Was and no longer is great.Maplestory retains that look and feel from years ago, but still falls short on the essential elements that keep people in-game enjoying content and off hotstreaks of haituses. The community was the reason to log back in everyday. Your friends from school weren't embarrassed to say they played, and if they were it didn't show when they were in game. Today, I feel I need to explain myself everytime I download the nearly 10 gigabytes of content again, and appear online abound with greyed out names of the past on my buddy list.It's depressing how a game that used to bring me joy is now devoid of any passion. Free to Play became a lie with the introduction of pets and store permits; things that should have been available for ingame currency or as rewards from quests. It's good business, because it's still tricking people, but poor practice. Veterans of Maplestory saw the decline years before the younger crowd that the game is now geared towards. It was reap what you sow and is now pay hard to hit hard.Maybe I'm stuck in the past, but the experiences I've had in the recent versions of Maplestory have cost me more than my wallet and is not worth even a half an hour of gameplay.

												Despite it having some pay to win features that help increase your damage, etc etc, the designers have been listening to the community recently so things are becoming more free to play again.  The game itself has been expanding to become less repetition and more game play.  It even rewards people for just sitting around doing jack squat, so you can be super casual about this game like me.  Over all it's something fun that can be done with casual and hard core players together.			"

												I know everyone is dissapointed because the game has changed and it's extremely easy to level up now. I have played since 2006 and me and my older brother got to level 90 with an archer. I don't think it's that bad. Honestly, I keep enjoying this game just as much as I used to. So what if I don't actually work hard to gain levels. I still enjoy the unique art style and all the skills and class variety. I enjoy this game so damn much and I have one level 131 Dawn Warrior and one level 120 mercedes. And in case you ask, I am free to play. I didn't spend a penny on that game. Actually once I bought a pet for my shadower cause I thought it's cool but it was before I discoverd the steam version, don't let those idiots who say this game is bad, they are just dissapointed cause it's not EXACTLY how it used to be, so they just talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about this game. It's really fun, just sit back, explore, try new classes and if you don't know anything just check out on the internet. Enjoy this game. It's fun.			"

												Played the game back in 2009 and it was amazing. It was a lot like old school runescape but with a better community. The game took like months just to get level 30 of the 200 levels, so everyone leveled together to become legends amoung men and get level 120 or higher. This sounds ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for some people im sure but it was so cool to be that badass that was god tier. The game was a grind but you had to do party quest to level and get some of the best gear so everyone always worked together. Party quest being a huge part of leveling ment that what is normmaly a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grind became make freinds and get rewarded for it. builds were not easy either, were as now the game holds your hand on were to put points, I remember seeing a dude who dumbed all stats into HP and nothing else and the dude was like level 60 tanking for our group of level 100's. It was cool to be like ""that guy"" who had a cool build. now after all that praise on what the game was what is the game now? dont talk to anyone and kill like 10 hours of time to get to level 90+. its world of warcraft now where its so easy, and so much better to do everything solo that everyone does. If you try to talk to anyone they will walk right past you. What point is an MMO that its no longer played as a multiplayer game? Party quest still exist but it group you up with a random person who just leaves as soon as the quest starts to solo the boss by themselfs because its more of a reward to just do the party quest and grinds by yourself. They ruined the community by making the game far to easy, and there is no way to go back. Not work the five hours of game time to have a charicter that plays and works jsut like everyone else your class, and then play by yourself at max level.			"

 This game... Thousands of hours into this game, and I  highly  do  not  recommend it. Only very few hours were recorded because I always played through the launcher and not Steam. Anyways;...Either one of two things will happen:1) You won't like this game, and quit playing after like 10 hours tops. 2) You'll really enjoy this game for the first 5,000 hours, then realize you wasted a couple years playing one of the worst MMO's out there. I enjoyed this game when I was a kid, quit playing it for a year, came back to it, quit playing, and so on. This game is one of those ""Pay-to-win"" games, where everything is based off how much money you feel like dumping into this game. And that right there, is what makes it so successful. It's a nice game, yeah, but not worth the time and money you'll put into it. After a couple hundred bucks put into cosmetics, ""damage"", any stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥there is, you then ask yourself what you're doing. ""Well, it's not a waste if you enjoy playing the game!"" I suppose so. That's what I said at first, but hey. It's your money, your feel to the game. I would recommend this game if it wasn't such an addictive pay-to-win game. The Pro's:+Enjoyable classes to play as+Countless different styles of gameplay+Endless outfits, equips, weapons, etc.+Kind(ish) community (Average MMO)+It's a good time-waster+Free world, do whatever you want+Cute graphics, nice way to express yourselfThe Con's:+Hundreds if not thousands of hours will be put into it+Pay-to-win game+Starts to get boring after a couple months+Too many restrictions (Treated as 10 year olds)+Terrible storylines, only thing that matters is levels+Grinding levels takes hours upon hours spamming the same buttons+Lots of hackers, scammers, spammers, botters, etc.+Above all,  waste of time. I recommend not even trying it out, and just leaving it there. You'll end up  hating  it one way or another. My opinion, is that yes, it was a great game growing up, but wasted many hours of my childhood while growing up. And money.  And money.

												I first played maplestory maybe 7 or 8 years ago and at first it was fun. (Note: my main interest is quests.)I remembered it was a game that, if you are a casual player, got harder and harder to progress as you went on. Eventually I stopped playing because it would take far too long to level up and make any sort of meaningful progress. Plus items like scrolls to increase certain traits of a weapon were pricey and overall the game was just slow.Fast forward to 2016 and I am back! It's a lot of fun now. Nexon have made certain parts of the game painless and have introduced new niche areas. Not interested in monsters or mapleworld? How about becoming a star/celebrity over at Star Planet? Want something different to the world of monsters and magic? Check out Friends Story, one of the alternative dimensions that's set in the modern world where you play a student!If you just want to do quests and wander about - the game now has a very good guide that will recommend the quests that are right for your level. I followed this guide and levelled up quickly, giving me more options to explore other parts of the game and even take on a big boss or two.Improving your weapons and equipment is now simple to do and doesn't take long at all.My main criticism of the game is that it seems like a neverending mess. Little to no structure and if you were looking for a main storyline to follow there isn't really one. Instead there are lots of short story arcs, or series of quests (one leading on to the next), which is great while it lasts but leaves you thinking - now what?Playing alone is fine, and I mainly solo, however playing with friends is a lot more fun.

												Pretty much a failed product after a long run. Old maplestory was much more of a challenge and everyone actually interacted. Now it's just a bunch of Cliques and groups that people stay in together and keep away the noobs. Expect to see smartphones and dumb cliche stories about high school life and pre-teen focused content. MapleStory was a fantasy world full of dragons and magical items with a feel of that little Warrior, Thief, Mage, Archer. It's just thrown out that feeling that makes you feel like a true adventurer and puts you in these cliche IM THE MAIN CHARACTER AND I MUST DO THIS IN ORDER TO BE STRONGER stories. It's honestly stupid. MapleStory has become a game where everyone is pretty much anti-social unless you join them in their talks about being ""azn"" and saying ""chuu~"" and ""imah pandah"" thus making them more comfortable enough to invite you to their little clique. The old days were full of nice people, people willing to talk with you and go on quests with you. ""Hey dude are you doing this quest to get this item"" ""Yeah wanna party up?"" was a very common thing to hear. Nowadays it's folk rushing to level 30 and farming spots saying ""cc pls"". It's disgusting. You don't have to agree with me it's just how I feel as to what this once magnificient game has become. By the way, almost everyone looks the same due to the popular looks taking over most of the population. Expect to see people with no pants, eyes almost closed, and hair that looks like it was straight out of Yu-Gi-Oh.RIP MapleStory. Big Bang damaged it. RED put into critical condition, Friendstory finished it off and cut life support.			"

												This was my favorite game ever back then. Even if I couldn't get past level 40 (due to the sheer stupidity of a child's mind), I still played it daily and never got tired.Going back to this game a few months ago, for the sake of nostalgia or what not, it took me just barely a week to get bored of it.-The game, at its core, is now a complete grindfest for clearing maps of monsters every 10 seconds.-The community that was upon a time is now long gone.-You can speed through levels like nothing, what was once two week's work to get to lv 30 (a month's work prior Big Bang patch!), is now less than a day's work. There is barely any feeling for accomplishment left.- A LOT of party quests are now easily soloable. There is no point for looking for party members to do them (not that there is much of a community left to do so).In a nutshell, that's what I found of the game I once loved. I still do love it for what it gave me then, but not as it is and what it offers now.If you want a quick nostalgia trip, go for it. Install the game, give it a few days to a week or two, then leave it.If you're looking for a game to invest gameplay time in, take yourself somewhere else.			"

												2003 maple story came out as the worlds first 2d side scroll mmorpg 2006 I started playing the game. maps were HUGE and not needed, item grabbing was so crazy just to get a rare drop, internet was Dailup and aol at the time, updates took forever and it got me excited, listened to experimental techno while staring at the backgrounds or waiting 5-10 minutes on an airship or toytrain/genie. Maple weapons were HUGE collectibles and it was just before they made the hero classes. Fast forward 10 years later to the same game and to call it the same is far from true... 10/10 would revisit old memories again if I wasnt 26 married college and have 3 bunnies to take care of.			"

												Repeat after me; ""I am not bored enough to start playing MapleStory again."" However, if you ever are bored enough to play MapleStory again it has most likely changed so much since the last time you played it that you experience it brand new again.If you are looking to try MapleStory for the first time I would go into it with the mindset of ""This game is meant for children, but that doesn't mean I can't have fun playing it."" Because the graphics, dialog, and even the animations are very childish but it is a fun game that will eat all your spare time for roughly two weeks, and then it will sit in your library for a few months. Then you'll delete it, then re-install it roughly one year later and repeat the process. "

												Played since beta in 2003.. even got all my screenshots from back then.. 10 years ago it was a great game! 10 years later the game is just horrible:Pay 2 Win: If your very high leveled and dont have a single piece of cash shop items or hairstyles, you will get mistakenly banned for being a botter, or treated like♥♥♥♥♥♥by the community.. oh and for the people who do spend money on the game you would be spending $15,000 USD or more to get the results you want.. (cubes and all) while spending $50 on the game wouldnt get you anything except a pet and all its lame accessoriesHackers Everywhere: Now i don't care how secure your account info is, or how many antivirus scanners you got, or even if you use that anti-keyloggable steelseries keyboard, YOU WOULD GET HACKED.. skilled people know how to manipulate nexon's database, exploit the pando downloader, or even right through the cash shop and gain access to your character and pin.. NOBODY in that game is safe.. best way to be safe in that game is not to brag about your gears or show off in youtube videosLame Economy: The in game Meso currency cap used to be 2.1billion but with so many complainers they finally increased it to 10billion.. though 10billion couldnt even buy you a decent weapon in that game.. since very great or even godly equipments cost about 60bill~120bill a piece..1. purchasing equips that cost more than the meso cap (which is pretty much everything in the game except pots) will require you to have a voucher.. you are 200.1% likely to get SCAMMED2. large trades through the trade window violates nexons TOS, your likely to get mass perma banned for having fradulent meso or even trading with illegal website farmers3. by the time you buy all the equips you want, you WILL GET HACKED.. nexon wont compensate you at allBotters Everywhere: The reason why everyone bots in the game is because the economy is so jacked up and expensive, no legit person can even afford a decent equips set.. alot of people resort to botting to accumulate alot of mesosCocky Players: Alot of the players in that game are self centered losers with 2million damage range or higher, if your damage is lower than theres they would either kick you out of partys and raids, or killsteal the map your training on.. oh this happens very often during 2x exp events unless you play on one of those underpopulated brand new servers but they even started to do that over there tooWrongful Bans: This happens ALOT and a good 85% of the people never do get their accounts back.. they have to start all over, some never play again.. you might be strolling through the free market, or henesys townsteet and walk into a map with a vac hacker, well your gonna get banned for hacking too not just that person, and nexon doesnt investigate nothing they just hellban everybody as they see fit, and when it does happen to you, their customer support takes great pleasure in refusing tickets and appealsI would recommend La Tale instead of Maplestory.. to anybody who plays it.. you've been warned			"

												I'm not as much of a reviewer that is going to dislike the game just because I have nostalgia goggles on, I'm going to give you a view of the game while including my own experiences to show you how the game is.This game as it is, in 2015, is an extremely pay-to-win driven game. Over the past 6 years (for me) they've consistently been dumbing down the game to where it practically plays itself with things like 100 level tomes which just make your character level 100 no questions asked, no effort produced. The sidequests are generally repetitive and unrewarding (and unrewarding isn't necessarily a bad thing if the quest was fun). They have special global quests (which when were created happened once a month or couple of months) every single day which reward you with gear for your level and experience automatically, you do not have to go out and kill mobs/bosses to get rare drops or complete a questline anymore.When I began playing Maplestory in 2009 it was a simple game that allowed you to do practically whatever you wanted, you had no guidance (or very little) and were encouraged to explore the entire world which made the game very fun, it was absolutely great at making you feel accomplished and as if you discovered something new. Now you have something called a Hyper Teleport Rock at almost all times (from the global quests mentioned prior) that can take you literally anywhere in the game, no long trekking, boss battles, or sense of adventure. You can avoid all of that. The game was more challenging which made it more enjoyable when you leveled up. Back then (pre Big Bang), to put how easy they've made the game into perspective, to get to level 30 generally took around a month and level 70 took maybe 4-6 months. Now, with no exaggeration, you can get to level 30 in an hour and level 70 in about 4 hours. You can hit level 200 (which pre Big Bang would have taken a year or more) in a week, maybe less.This game also never had a story, just quests. There was no ""ultimate evil"" or dedicated storyline, but they made that with the Cygnus Knights. I joined the game again just to play the Black Heaven storyline which was extremely boring. The character dialogue just droned on and on with no meaningful interactions, it was almost entirely just characters making cheesy jokes to eachother and other useless non sequiturs which completely dilutes the idea of an overbearing being, so I found myself just holding down my spacebar to fly through the dialogue a lot and I never felt like I missed any information. Then there were things you had to do, and you could tell it was just all filler content. You had to kill 30 of these robots, then go through the portal and kill 40 of them, then go through the portal and kill 60 of them and I wish I was kidding, you ACTUALLY do that up to 100 robots. And you do that a couple more times. You also do the same thing with collecting things from monsters you kill. They're forcing a story that has no weight and is so clearly thrown together that it hurts.This game is great if you're looking for just a straight casual MMORPG to just♥♥♥♥♥♥around in and waste time, if you want an experience and a challenge I would go find another game.

												With the direction this game is currently going in - No, I would not recommend playing MapleStory. I have been playing MapleStory for years, as such I've chosen to stick by it through good times and bad; but I have to say that I am not happy with Global MapleStory's choices, as of late. It seems that Global MapleStory wants to make itself the superior version of MapleStory, but it has a very half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥way of trying to achieve this. So far, pretty much every attempt at being different from the mother version of the game, KMS(Korean MapleStory), has been an annoying step-down from what could have been awesome. For the last few years, GMS has made unneccesary changes to content coming from KMS to make it seem like their version of MapleStory is somehow ""different"". The problem is, these changes have always been sloppy, and they've continued to hold the game back from being much better. In my opinion, what GMS should be focusing on is creating completely NEW content that could easily go side-by-side with anything we receive from KMS, rather than making nitpicky changes and removing pieces of content that players have been looking forward to for months. The main problem with the game is how Pay-To-Win it feels, and it is sad to see that unlike KMS, which has been slowely making attempts to make the game fair for non-paying players, GMS has continued to hold the game back in its Pay-To-Win state. For example, in the Korean MapleStory as part of the ""RED"" update they added things like an Auction House, allowing players to buy and sell items from other users without needing to purchase a permit with real-money. GMS has opted not to add this to the game, claiming that it had some ""problems that needed fixing"" but months have passed and we've seen no news on it actually coming for us. Another example of ways that KMS had attempted to walk away from Pay-To-Win (and another example of how GMS simply ignored those changes to continue on their Pay-To-Win path) is the ""Maple Mileage"" system which allowed you to optain mileage through playing the game, and having the option to pay for Cash Shop (real money) items using Mileage instead! This meant that anybody who played long enough could have the option to EARN Cash Shop items through playing if they chose to do so. Of course, in a decision that surprised no-one, GMS simply did not make any attempts to add this feature to our version of the game. There are many other features that helped even the playing field with paying players and non-paying players, and I could go on-and-on about what else GMS has decided to skip, but I'll stop there. (If you'd like, you could look up things like Additional Options which added all sorts of randomized stats to your items to help players who weren't quite powerful enough to fight Bosses for their loot. You could also look into how KMS added the ability to buy 'Maple Points' with in-game currency. Maple Points being an alternative to NX, which is what you use to buy things from the real-money 'Cash Shop'.)I continue playing this game in hopes that one day these things and more will be added to make the game friendlier to non-paying players, but only time will tell if any of these will happen. For now I would stay away from MapleStory, as it continues to give the Free-To-Play genre a bad name.			"

												I originally had a bad review of this game but now I am more or less neutral. This is a fairly old game and has since been slowly dying each passing year. I went on after 5 years and had no idea what was happening. But it is still a fun game, coming off of a game that you pay for and has optional in game transactions I forgot how hard f2p games make you want to buy stuff in them. But now that nexon has actually gotten a support center after all these years and they helped me get my hijacked account back, un-banned, and un-bound from a steam account I can say that the game is now about 50/50. It's not as good as it used to be because games are now mainly in 3d and they stuffed to much stuff in and made it confusing, but it is still fun and nostalgic. Though the game has died alot since the good years back in 2008.			"

This has taken me over half an hour to 'attempt' getting to the log in screen, this is ridiculous and I hope things might change in the next month because I for one won't be trying again in the next 30 days.

												I have played this game back in 2006 and I had a blast, everything was new to me, the settings, the people running around and killing snails on maple island then slimes and mushrooms in henesys hunting ground. Took many years of breaks in between, back and forth, but when they revamped the game and released big bang is when they started to lose the vast majority of players (slowly).I know that change is needed for games to progress, but so many changes killed the game.Pros:- if you're a fan of mario style games or platformers and like to see big numbers when you hit monster, then try out this game- it's not a grindy game anymore, *sadly* (at least not from lvl 1-200)- amazing map BGM's- a lot of friendly people still and so onCons:- p2w- bugs, bugs and yes, more bugs! ""yay!""- gets a bit grindy past 200 and gets a lot grindy past 200 if you didn't pay a lot of real money into it- the company NEXON America, doesn't care about their customers/playersI could go on forever with the cons and some more pros, but I'll stop here. If you're a new player, I suggest you try this game, but it won't feel ""magical"" anymore.Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game in the state it is right now. "

Ha ha ha ha!     xHermit1337: mesos plz     Nexon: Your NX transaction is complete. Thank you. I grew up playing this game as soon as it was out in North America, all the way back in 2005. I was just a kid then, not even a middle schooler. I spent most of my free time on the computer playing the game with my brother and his friends. Back then, leveling was SLOW; it would take a week just to get to Lv.30. The only way to level at all in your 2nd job was to PQ the same quests over and over half a dozen times just to level up once, and even once you did, you didn't find much content at the next level. Because of this, most of the original game was extremely social. The goal to getting anywhere was cooperating with other players, as interaction was key to success. Because of the snail-leveling, you would spend most of your time in one of the 6 towns, listening to gossip and learning important information, getting into Parties and Guilds, and making friends. This game was key to my survival, as I live in a hellish redneck ghetto town. My online friends helped me see the light through dark times, and I owe them everything; even a decade later. I stopped being very active after 2008, but did check on the game after BB. My original draft of this review was negative, but the modern maple is loaded with new content and 5x as many classes as the original game. Leveling is fast now; I could get 10 characters to level 30 in a day. Even then, there's still a lot of grinding. The EXP you need is a fraction of what it used to be originally. Money is still an issue, and the economy makes no sense to me. The cash shop is still a waste of money, and you are forced to spend real $ on skillbooks, or else your characters will be stunted in their later growth. The modern community is very antisocial because of the soloing aspects. It's not the same game I remember as a child, but this could still provide you hundreds of hours of content, and it's been free for a decade! If you're bored and want a free mmo to try, this would be one of your destinations for many years, and for good reason.			"

												TL;DR:PROS: levelling with quests and not just grinds, a lot of classes, findable good equips, great for new players (and old ones if they can get over the fact that the game isn't the same as it was 16 years ago)CONS: quiet community in-game, some party quests are completely deadI see a lot of reviews talking about how much the game has changed and how there's no nostalgia left for us older players. As an older player myself (I've been playing Maple off and on since 2006), I disagree. What brought me back to Maple after the last four year haitus I had was the nostalgia, but what kept me playing was the complete rehaul of the game.When I was a kid with dial-up internet, getting to the first job advancement was difficult. Fast forward to today: I have played almost every class through into the fourth advancement. Yes, it's been made a lot easier, but it's also reasonable now; any player can get a good diversity  of content regardless of experience or skill. The endless 10-20 level grind on the same map is gone, now theme dungeons and quests offer the best leveling chance, which is loads more fun. In fact, quests used to be altogether useless, so this change is super awesome.There's so many classes now! I was super happy when I came back to all the new classes. I actually can't wait for more to come out so I have more skills to try out. (I'm hoping there's an all-new class soon with new clothing equips and not just weapons.)The addition of spell traces and the equip enhancement system actually reduces the pay-to-win aspect that has ALWAYS (as in FOREVER, as in THIS IS NOTHING NEW) been a part of Maple. It offers people the chance to have good equips but without the ridiculous cost and rarity of scrolls. Equipment drops have been completely rehauled and now have hidden potentials, allowing players to find their equips without having to spend mesos or real money and to make a decent bit of mesos that help in the later game with pots and the like. (Side note: I remember the days of the scrolled out sauna robe, can't nobody tell me the new equip drop system is bad.)Us older players are not the major target of this game anymore and that's OKAY. It's for those kids coming in at the same age when we started back in the day. It's not entirely Maple and Nexon's fault that the previous audience left, a good deal of people left because they got older and found other games, particularly MOBAs. (Admittedly, the game community has gotten quieter and some party quests are dead, but, again, see previous point.)All-in-all, it's not right to make a crappy review on the game because it's changed over the course of over a decade and a half. The game is different, even easier, and that's totally cool. I think it's a great choice for new, young gamers with its cute graphics and background music. And if older players approach it as a different game than the one they remember, it can be really great for them too.			"

												Aight, it's about time i worte a legit review about this game. Take this from the perspective of someone who has played the game for roughly 12 years now. This game conisits of (At the time of writing) 41 classes, and for each one i have played. and the economy is different for each server. In which i mean items PRICED are different....and yes even i'll admit to every server BUT reboot is pay to do good damage.Now lets knock some cons out of the wayCONS(excluding reboot)Botters: yes, this is a major ****ing problem with a server like Scania, where items are currently triple a players MAX meso capacityEconomy: completely ♥♥♥♥ed up to oblivion (scanis, lookin at you)Cash Shop: it's more towards the line of pay to do good damage at a chance(miracle cubes) or pay for convience(aka auto looting with pets)Pet issue isnt really a problem if you can manage the time to farm killa with a spider pet, 2x drop n stuff, managed to get a pet from it. Also there are events where they do offer PERMANENT PETS! like getting a blaster to level 150 gave you a robo gorilla pet(event is over now tho ;c Also, you CAN get perma cash shop get without spending money, like the current event (12th anniversery) is an entire PERMANENT  cash item set that goes over your current gear. so go look classy as ****!Balancing: Yes this is an issue for every game, really a no brainer there..Grinding: typical for an mmo, however even though i put this as a con, i love grinding <3---NOW! the benefit of playing on the current reboot server:Cash shop: you can buy teleportation rocks... with mesoes :O miracle cubes? MESOES! PETS?!... with cash unless you're like me and just go kill hilla... OR PARTICIPATE IN EVENTSBotters: I have yet to ever stumble upon a botter within the reboot server, as there is no need to bot since trading is disabled. You want to do good damage? you earn it. Want that good boss gear? you earn it. everything MUST be earned.. or have a lumi WHICHEVER WORKS :Dbosses are hardermobs are harderI also laugh harder because of that one indian guy trying to sell mesoes on a reboot server (lul)they also give double(?) the experience and better drop chance?Also, since i feel the need to mention this: what about party play?Bring a couple friends with you, or join an ACTIVE guild, otherwise be like me and just grind for days and be a lonerto those downvoters ♥♥♥♥♥ing about P2W, jjust move to reboot and quit your ♥♥♥♥♥ing, downvoting a FREE game because you dont wanna pay for pets is a bs excuse, and i've yet to sink an actual dime into the game o/ and i've played roughly 12 years, aka this is part of my childhood <3			"

												**Edit** : If you look below my original bit, I went into a little more depth about how this game is pay to win, if you're not convinced. I don't cover all the reasons, but I do cover one of the main ones. Please, take my word for it, you don't want to play this game past the early game.EXTREMELY pay to win. The end game is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥for this reason along with various other problems ranging from lack of content to game breaking bugs that take forever to fix to extremely unbalanced classes.Nexon just doesn't care. Don't play this game, it's not worth your time. Find a private server, their service and gameplay is generally better.**Edit**I'm going to add this in due to some comments I've been getting about the game not being pay to win. Sorry if it's a bit disorganized, since this was meant to be a comment, however it went over the 1000 character limit :The potential system, to those who have not played this game yet, is basically an extra 2-3 stats tagged onto almost any peice of equipment. These stats account for the majority of a player's strength/damage, much more so than the stats you regularly get through upgrading items by in game means. These stats start out very poorly, and are rolled randomly by using what is called a cube. Occassionally, the tier of the potential will go up when you roll (This is quite rare, maybe 1 in 30 rolls give or take. Some people need around 100 if they're unlucky), giving access to better potentials. Note that these potentials are RNG, so as a warrior, you may very well get DEX, INT, LUK, M.ATK or any other useless stat 95% of rolls.To get a single cube through in game means takes up to a week, more or less. Crafting them is ludicrously expensive and trying to obtain them from killing bosses is pointless due to the ludicrously low drop rate ( To get one cube, you'd have to do a twice daily boss each day for on average a month, give or take. I say this from personal experience ).Of course, you could always BUY cubes. They're $1-$2 each (The $2 one is necessary for upgrading the final tier ), or they come in $10 and $20 bundles. Note that it's ONE DOLLAR TO BUY A SINGLE CUBE. Making a single end game tier item can take HUNDREDS OF CUBES, and that will get you almost NOWHERE progress wise. You need a FULL SET of these types of items to have a CHANCE at one of the end game bosses. This, coupled with the fact that group play is extremely discouraged in boss fights makes these end game bosses impossible (The HP on these bosses is in the hundred billions. Consider that I, a long time player who doesn't spend money can't shave even a fraction of their HP bars in 10 minutes. Now consider that most bosses have a 20 - 30 minute time limit).It is also impossible to make money in the game from 'end game' activities, because unless you have an extremely high damage range, all the bosses you will be able to fight have useless drops.I didn't even mention the fact that a lot of boss drops are trade locked unless you pay $2-$3 to untrade lock it for one trade.

												I used to play this game a lot back from 2007-2009. Game has changed a lot and I have mixed feelings about it. Some new classes are cool and I guess they implemented a storyline as well. Disappointed on how easy it is just to even reach 1-30. Feels like they dumbed the game down and made it look pretty. Overall, the nostalgia factor is still kind of there, gameplay is smooth and simple and it seems like there's still a community here. Get it if you love MapleStory like I did way back when, but personally I probably won't keep this installed for long.			"

												The techno reboot of the theme music is so cringe worthy it needs to be banned.Not as big a fan now as I was with beta through the first five years. Too many one off classes. MAJOR MISTAKE in grouping servers, the Nova and Bellocan pair is the biggest mistake in all of gaming that I have ever seen - years later the two servers are still fighting to be what they were & bello's sh-tty market tanked the pair.On all servers: too many hackers, too many spammers, too many trash ""holiday"" events. I would've reccomended this 7 years ago.Bring back the MS that players came for, you've lost your OG & Beta players trying to make the game better when in reality the player count has never been lower and the customer service has never been worse.

												Played Maplestory since 2008, when i was 7~ish. Constantly kept coming back to the game even though i told myself that i wouldnt. The game itself is very enjoyable, but the problem is that most of the playerbase is gone. I've played all the classes and gotten some characters to level 200+. Probably one of the best mmorpgs i've ever played. Most of the people you will meet are very friendly and will try to help you learn how to play. The game also has many events, most notably the anniversary events and seasonal events.10/10 would recommend. The reboot update on 12/2 will make the game less pay2win and will probably bring back some players/bring new players into the game.			"

												*Long wall of text sorry but this was on my mind for a long time*I use to play Maplestory a lot in the past, it was one of my most enjoyed games, like many I played since the early days, it was great, there was a whole lot you can do, even if there was limited classes at the time, heck not even 3rd job was in game but it was still awesome.Long ago tho I had lost interest within Mapelstory, not due to the game being boring, lack of things to do, well kind of, after a certain change it made the game become horrible in my eyes, due to making everything to simple, to easy and just lacking what Maplestory was long ago, causing it to lose what made MS fun and enjoyable.I know you might be asking ""what was the change that caused you to say such things, lashing out at this game, it is still quite fun and I like it."" the thing that broke the game was the addition of  the ""Big Bang"" update, what broke it wasn't the new classes or game play, the new areas you can explore and or the ability now to craft items and gear, no what to me broke Maplestory was that Nexon messed with the EXP tabels making it so you can hit max level without even trying.Sure it might not sound bad to you, tho here is  a list and examples ofwhat problems this caused for me and probably others.1. This update made PQs useless and really any type of party related things useless [PQ = Party quest] you would in the past need to make a group of 5 + people to go into dungeons, the dungeons would depending on where you had been in game need a certain group in order to play/beat it, like in Ludi PQ, you needed 1-2 mages, 1 theif, 1-2 warriors or so or a archer class in order to do areas within the quest, the theif would use their darkness skill [or what ever it is called] in order to sneek into a room full of mobs that 1 hit KO you, the mages would use their teleport skill to warp to spots others can't hit and the archer would use their bow and arrows for distance kills, the warrior was for dmg and tanking of the bossesI know this is a long text wall and I am sorry, the memories I use to have of making friends while in line waiting to do a PQ was awesome, having to do dungeon raids with them was great, the reason I also mention it makes doing parties useless is now that the exp tables have changed someone can solo lvl faster then when in a party, sure a nice exp buff from a Bishop is nice tho it isn't needed.2. The game is super easy to level up in now, in the past it use to take people atleast 1-2 years to hit level 200 sure I know that is a long time, tho now you can within 1-7 days hit that, since all you need to do is find out where high exp monsters spawn and grind kill them, now this is another factor as well, this will cause you to KS people [KS = Kill steal]  who happen to be doing the same thing as you and or would be doing the same thing as you.3. Changing of the classes, some for the good, the rest for the worst, I made a Dragon Knight, wanting to use it how it was in the past, you know with dragon roar, anyone remember that attack? I sure hope so, it was quite a scary and powerful attack that would hit 16 or so mobs within the AOE range for massive dmg and this was a warrior based class, that also you didn't have to be job class 4 to use it, only needed to be lvl 70, well now the Dragon Knight has been changed to be more of a spear based class, so dragon roar is gone, the most useful skill in my eyes for lvling up, I forgot the rest of the changes to it, tho it seems they gut a lot of classes for the worst.I will end this review here, I do like Maplestory, tho since the Big Bang update, it broke the game in my eyes, no longer do you need a party, you can just KS grind up to lvl 200 + by your self, they made the game to easy, if they could only add alt servers in that played like before the exp tabel changes but keep all of the new classes and what not, I think it would be more fun, since you would have to party up with people in order to get any where, it made me angry to see they would change their full game on their hard core fans like this and bring the game down the to such a level.

												I've played this game for years before it became available on Steam. Loved it. Logged many hours on it. Met some amazing people on it. The artwork was engaging, and the gameplay was reminesent of the 2D scrollers I played in the 80s. To this very day, I still love it. But do I recommend it ? In its latest form, can I recommend it to the new players?Sadly, no.Call me an""old school Mapler"", but I can't recommend this game anymore. Why? For a number of reasons. Here is a few:-The core Explorer classes have been overshadowed by the numerous and, to a degree, overpowered new classes. Granted, this was all part of the overall storyline, but I still love the original classes more.-What hooked me most was the social aspect of the early days (year 3 onward...). Waiting to hop onto the big airship or waiting for the subway to come encouraged me to interact with the others as we waited. Since the big airship was all but replaced with the option to rent a private plane, the socializing is now almost non-existant.-Free Market now is a joke. Unless you can grind for hours in order to farm for ""mesos"", or can buy ""meso bags"" with real cash, nearly everything on sale in Free Market is grossly overpriced.While the features that were added over over time are helpful, I can't recommend this game to the new player. While it is still fun to play, MapleStory has moved to close to the ""pay-to-win"" mechanic that too many FTP games have become.			"

												I started playing this game way back in 2005 when it was still technically in beta. I played for a long time.  It took six months just to get to level TWENTY!! Now... it takes literally 10 minutes.  There was something great and fresh about the game. At the time, it had four classes.  Now, over thirty.  To be perfectly honest.  Once the breaking (an event in game that reshaped the map and landscape) happened a couple years back the game went from being awesome to being unimportant.  No longer did I feel connected to my character or the world around me with its great stories and characters.  It became all about how much damage a character could put out and how fast you can max your levels (and with multiple classes).Maple Story is a game I love, a game I cherish in my memories and had some really great fun playing with many of my friends.  I would love to recommend but can no longer do that.  The game I love is no more.  I really just doesn't exist anymore. All that being said, I have read and heard others saying that they always come back to it.  I will admit, I usually check it out for a few days every 6 - 12 months.  Nothing has changed though... the lack of charm is still gone.  Sad.  Really sad.Miss my Maple			"

A Childhood Memory That Should Remain ThereI wasted a lot of my childhood on this game that I'll never get back. There has always been a pay-to-win wall that makes grinding less mind numbing but the fact that the gameplay is repetitive and slow is enough to warrant a negative review. The artstyle and sound direction is terrific but I cannot in good conscience recommend this game unless you've got disposable income and want to support shady business practices. I've heard all kinds of Nexon horror stories, like banning accounts without saying why and the fact that their Karma Koins expire (Cash Shop currency from store-bought cards). Never again.If you're looking for an alternative MMO experience with more transparent developers and better customer service support, Guild Wars 2 (free to play; buy the expansion once[buy.guildwars2.com] and it comes with the full base game, no subscription; frequent sales) and Final Fantasy XIV (monthly subscription) are terrific to dive into.1/10			"

												Whut.Why is this game still alive?---Half a decade ago, MapleStory could be considered a pretty decent game. Four classes, places to go, and you can conduct social activities/experiments? Welp, sign me up!Except that was 5 years ago. Now, I felt that the game is just swamped with 'features' (being that they are a little more than gimmicks). PvP arena has, in my experience, died out after a few months of activity 3-4 years ago. I'm now swamped with event quests that I'm not even interested in doing. Hell, even the community as gone worst over the last five years. I still remember the times where, at the boat from Ellina to Orbis, the players, as passagers, would do some kind of crazy shenanigans to pass the time (hell, there are dedicated Balrog killers just in case one showed up). Now? you buy a plane mount, head to the station, go into transit, and then stare into the screen in boredom as you count down the timer. Now, if you are the adventuring type, prepare to lone-wolf the game 90% of the time; most of the 'social' groups camp in Henesys nowadays.And the grinding. Yeah, prepare to mindlessly grind your way through. At least a few years ago you would have parties that would happily join you. Now? *sigh*Five years ago, I would of recommended this game. Now? Nah. Look for something else, or do stuff in real life. Now, any task is more useful than this failure of a time-waster. "

												I have played this game since 2007-2008 and I can tell you the game has not only declined, it's plummeted. Hackers and botters were always an issue so I won't touch on that, as well as the P2W nature. We all know P2W is bad and I've sunk easily far too much money into this while I was still on my parents' alllowance. Still, many MMOs follow that route and I've become inured to it.No, what gets me is how far the game likes to think it's come when in reality it hasn't moved at all. On the one hand, I like the multiple character classes, as even though they feel just like all the others of their niche(Tank, glass cannon, rogue, etc.) there's little perks that make the classes interesting for a time(My favorite so far being Mechanic, though since I haven't played in ages they've likely been nerfed). That leads me to one of my main gripes: The lack of balancing for the numerous new classes. Not only that, but the game itself doesn't change to suit each new class and their newfound overpowered strengths or crippling weaknesses. This leads to many classes being pointless or obsolete(Who even plays as the classic four/five character classes anymore?) which clutters up the game.The game itself is very cluttered, as well. I get that traveling is a big part of any MMO or any game with a large world for that matter, but if your game is a 2D, linear style, the back and forth of traveling is a lot more tedious than choosing the shortest route in a 3D game. Not only that, many parts of the maps are just lines with no connecting rooms or hubs, leading to a lot of needless backtracking. However, this is another feature of the game that I got used to(Though pre big bang the map was a circle, which was very nice).Those are my two biggest qualms right now, though for the most part I don't feel comfortable completely bashing this game since I've had so much fun with it since when my brother introduced me to it as a young teen. I wouldn't recommend it in the state it's in, though. I'm going to try Mabinogi and other Nexon MMOs, though, because I've heard they're better now than Maplestory has been in a long time.			"

												To me I had fun in this game, it felt like a genuine adventure, a place to explore with unique landscapes and monsters. None of this ""save the world"", ""your the choosen one"", class backgrounds filled with melodramatic tragedy of a chosen underdog. Just a simple adventure game, like the original classes are called. Though I am sure that people who only know of this itteration of maplestory can't quite understand what it was like, but the best way I can put it is.... it could be frustrating and cruel but it was fun and forced people into situations where they could connect and converse. There was a time in which certain maps acted as chat rooms/lounges. People would show off their equipment and levels, share stories, tips, guide new players, tell jokes, help other players through leeching parties, trade valuable items. Sometimes people (myself included) would drop exccess gold or rare loot that we either couldn't use or were not interested in. This was before gold had value beyond pots, so items were goods that were traded for other goods, occasionally gold (for pots). It was a far less... toxic feeling place. Far less bugs too.Wrote a rant about how they simplified everything and stripped away the uniqueness and challenge of certain classes in pursuit of molding every class into the same thing with different visual animations. And with this story stuff it just feels condescending to it's target audience. They could write a better story..... I'll stop here.			"

I have put countless hours into this game and it will forever and always hold a speical place in my heart.That being said...The GoodThis game is MASSIVE! By virtue of it being such a long standing MMO, it has more conntent then I could ever hope to see.Grinding (And ooohhhh yeah there's A LOT of that...) has some suprising little challenges that make it more tolorable.It has a unique artstyle and gameplay as compared to most MMO's.It has a lot of charm if you're willing to sit through the other stuff.The BadUm... There's a whole lot.The comunity seems to have fallen appart. I've heard of MMO's with toxic comunities. Maplestory's is non existant. There's a group of max level players that seem to... enjoy? them? Selves? (They sit in cities waiting for people to ""fame"" them.) I Actively attempted to have social interactions with other individuals, and failed. Miserably. They're just... not there. Or they simply seem to not care. At all. It's so borring to do anything after a while. I've been playing since I was ten, and it probably took me 25+ hours just getting one character to level 100 (Which is less than half-way to max level) and... it wasn't fun after the inital 20 or so. I did it just because it was like my childhood dream to have a character at the final job advancement.Also, balance is non-existant. Certain classes are just WAY more fun and WAY stronger than other classes. That's just part of the game. (I guess that's not nessisarily bad. It's just something to be aware of)The UglyIt's... it's an old game. It shows. It feels like they keep trying to put more and more paint on it, and now it feels like it's just that... Paint. A facsimile of it's former self. Almost like someone has taken a dead relative and taxadermised they're corpse and prettends like they're still alive. (A bit of an extreme example, but acurate nonetheless.)The end.I am done with this game, it's not fun for me anymore. If you decide to play it, maybe you'll find something I didn't and have more fun then I did. I sinceerly hope you do. But I honestly suggest you play a different game. or wait for Maplestory 2 to come out. I know I'll be giving it a shot, haha. (Seriously, it's a thing give it a look.)			"

												Maplestory is like a salad.It feels fun for a little bit but then you taste too much of the ranch dressing.Slowly it becomes disgusting and you don't want to eat it anymore.But you do because it's ""healthy"" but slowly you realize your not eating salad.Your eating a bowl full of flaming money and steam funds and thinking to yourself.Dear Lord, Why did i buy so much salad. Then you look at the salad pack and realize its going to expire in a month.After spending 30 dollars on your dressup ite- I MEAN SALAD you realize its going to expire.So you buy more salad to the point where even vegans think you have a problem.10/10 would spend all my money again			"

												MapleStory is a free to play side scrolling mmorpg.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok. Artwork is chibi style characters. This game was released in 2005.CONS:- Bug at the Please Wait MapleStory being launched has There is no Disk in drive error. = cancel 6 times to continue.- Changing resolution to what it recommended crashed the game. - The soft keyboard for putting in your PIC is a stupid idea the way it is made.- Has some annoying features.Try it, if you like side scrolling mmorpgs.  I don't suggest you invest real money on this game.For more info:

												This is a review based around the Reboot server. Reboot was one of the major goods the Nexon did to this game, and it was an update big enough to bring the community back to life in its last dying breaths. Nexon America, notorious for focusing only on pushing out content and collecting as much profit as possible, rose above and listened to the community for the first time in a while. They finally addressed the fact that their game was heavily pay-to-win based. I do agree that it was rather scummy to save this as a last resort instead of doing it earlier, but the fact remains that they did it, even at the risk of losing money.Reboot is a GMS server different from all the others, in that the only items you can buy using real money are purely cosmetic, aside from pets. Pets are definitely needed for fast grinding of mesos in the late-game, but even they can be earned by killing Hilla, a mid-game boss.MapleStory will always hold a place in my heart, even long after I leave. Through the layers of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Nexon coated the game in, there's a genuinely good game with an expansive world and a great community. I was long gone and done with the regular servers but Reboot brought me and tens of thousands of other players back, allowing everyone an equal oppurtunity.We can even see now that Nexon is slowly beginning to address bugs and balance issues. In recent patches, Nexon was also able to add new content that was meaningful and well made, while also balancing characters and fixing bugs. They also give out items if ever they make mistakes that mislead players or affect gameplay, fixing it right away as well.I have many other things to say about the game, but I think everything beyond what I've said so far is purely subjective and will be up to the player whether or not they like it.

 First a little background I have played maplestory since early 2006 and I've kept playing since then. I have 6 level 200+ characters amd will continue to make more. I am an MMORPG fanatic and I really enjoy the 2D side-scolling games. I recently got Maplestory on steam to avoid using the horrendus Nexon client. Review This game has a lot of grinding. A lot of grinding. Much like WoW, in Maplestory you constantly grind and are trying to level up your character to get better gear, a new job advancment, etc. That is one of the aspects I love the most about this game. In a game such as WoW you get new abilities every 4-5 levels depending on what level you are, in Maplestory you get things called job advancments. Basically, you have a certain moveset with certain abilities, you can upgrade these abilites until you reach a certain level, and then you get a new set of abilities. This is one of my favorite aspects of Maplestory and it really makes it unique. The player base in Maplestory is also awesome, everyone on here is extremely nice and it can be really fun to just talk to other players rather than grind. There are many other things for you to do besides grind of course; You can do ""dungeons"" where you are sent to a certain area for 10-15 levels and do quests for the NPCs there and have a lot of fun learning the lore, you can also fight massive bosses with other players (this is much like a raid in WoW). There are so many fun things to do in Maplestory which is why I have played the game for so long and will continue to do so.			"

												i have played this game since i was little despite what steam says, i have only had steam for less than a year. i have put countless hours into this game and absolutely say this game is pay to win. ignore everyone else who says this game is now pay to win, this game is very much pay to win. without paying you wont make it far at all in the game. without money you wont be able to make meso (the ingame currency) to support yourself with equips and weapons. not only do you need money to get the equips but these equips BARELY allow you to deal with enemies that are your lvl and still leave you lacking. early on in the game you will find that just to fight certain bosses you will need to be funded or rely on other who ARE funded. not only this but the entire free market is run by people who are funded and are selling items that drop from bosses you can only defeat with tons of funding. one certain area, root abyss, to defeat one boss you need a party of highly funded players just to defeat it despite the lvl req is 180 you will need to do atleast 4m damage per line if you wish to attempt it with a party or 15m if you want to attempt soloing. not only do you need to fund yourself but its a gamble in itself. the main way to use your money to adavance in the game besides buying the equips needed it improving your equips. without improving your equips, your equips STILL wont get you far into the game. the way to improve your equips is by buying an item from the cash shop called ""cubes"". in current maplestory, as of 7/22/14, there are red cubes and black cubes (black cubes cost more yet yeild an apparent greater chance of improvement). basically items have a potential which means the items have a chance to provide bonus stats. there are 4 tiers of potential: rare, epic, unique, and legendary. as the tier progresses, the bonuses become more usefull but only if the stats if provides are actually meant for your class. not only does this in itself make it a gamble but the chance of getting your own stat is pretty low. aside from that the rate to upgrade a teir is EXTREMELY LOW meaning you will have to pay more to get that low chance of an increased teir. this same ""money whoring"" cube system is also used for ""bonus potentials"" which is the same thing but just more rare to find an item that yeilds bonus potential (more money for nexon if you want to improve bonus potential too). aside from cubing you can also try scrolling items but as you would expect, the only decent scrolls only have a chance of working meaning if it fails, itll take up one slot of however many your equips has meaning the items max stat potential is decreased. not only do these scrolls have a chance of failure but some of these scrolls even have a chance to destory your item if it happens to fail, and the only way to protect your item if you wish to risk one of these scrolls (which are typically the best) is to buy a ""guardian scroll"" which is again, in the cash shop for a moderately high price.without any of this above, making it through the game will be extremely difficult, or even impossible. at certain points early in the game, bosses even become impossible to defeat without funding. this doesnt stop at bosses though, about halfway through the game it becomes too difficult to even defeat the enemies needed to train and level up.whether you take my word for it or not, if you want to try the game feel free to, it is a  free to download game afterall.

												I cannot fully explain how frustrating it is how Nexon destroyed this game. I used to play this game as a kid for hours. This game used to be perfect with a very large community, awesome party quests, easy and comfortable controls, awesome class balance, people spending hundreds of dollars on NX, and a community of Maple videos. The awesome video makers from dray86 to greencream to goldentot. I used to even make some of these maple videos. You can check them out at youtube/NaBeHobby.It was paradise if you loved mmo rpgs where you can easily make friends and have tons of fun for hours. People were having in game relationship and marriages for the love of God. This game was, in my opinion, by far a better game than WoW until... They completely ruined it after the Big Bang Patch. Everything is simplified, new classes overpower the older classes, people leaving the community, and devs only care about your money.This game used to be a 10/10 game for me. I used to spend hours and hours everyday throughout my middleschool and halfway highschool. Now it's 2/10. It's very frustrating when my most favorite game turns out crappy because the devs were corrupted with greed. I can only hope Star Citizen will be able to replace this for me.I will miss you, Maplestory. You were that hot girl that I had a crush on, were going out, but then cheated on me. You broke my heart. How could you. I will always remember the times we spent together.			"

I made another character until he reached level 50, the next day  he was wiped and ive spent actual money out of my pocket on that account.

But even then, i still say dont play it. its fun, but only if you like hings handed to you, the enemies die no matter what, there's no challange, so dont play it. i will continue to do so, hoping for the day when the game returns to its former state, and it requires effort. and i can see the days when maple story was great.... everything seems to be going to crap these days.

												I put a lot of hours into this game, it is very unique in that it's a 2D sidescroller MMO. In this review, it appears that I have less than an hour clocked in; this is due to the fact that you are locked into creating a Steam account and cannot log into an existing one. What a drawback. I really enjoyed the wide selection of classes that were available, but at one point, Maplestory only started adding classes for account-buffs or to attract returning players. The entire market is basical broken on a regular basis, and hackers commonly plauge popular maps. Hell, even I hacked to see how easy it was. Despite the boost that insta-teleporting, auto-macros, and godmode gave, the entire game was still just a slow grind to the next level. After that it's all about the equipment. For what though? Don't get me wrong, I loved this game for the longest time and I wish I could find that pleasure in it again, but Nexon has turned this game into a cash-cow, claiming 'free-to-play' in their advertisements. Trust me when I say it's free-to-start, pay-to-compete, hack-to-play, quit-to-win.			"

												MapleStory is more of an Old-School MMORPG, and a good one at that which I'll give, but I just don't like how trying to level, hell, even get a job class is, it's more of a chore than ""fun"".  I mean yeah if it wasn't a grindfest or when trying to do something isn't a chore, I'll give it another go, but the game blew it's chance with me.  It's more of a Pay-2-Win than a Play-4-Free, I don't mind if a game has stuff you want that you can buy with real money, but when trying to do my job quest, I was so lost(As everyone would in any MMORPG) but until I found out what to do, were they challenging and fun to do?  Well, yes and no.  Why?  Yes, they are challenging and I like that, but, no, they have such annoyance and can be TOO hard to where it's not even fun, but a nuisance.Honestly, I just hope Maple Story 2 isn't as annoyance as this, and much less of a grind fest, or Pay-2-WinFor a side scroller, if you're annoyed by the nuisance it has, you're better off playing a 3D sidescroller called Elsword, which is basically the opposite of the bad I posted about this gameThis is basically an edit of my original review of this game, when first reviewing it I was a bit rash and having it come out to not turn out as a review.

												This was one of the very first games I played to experience extreme power creep. Every few months, a new class is released, or an old one is comletely reworked to be stronger. 90% of the time this new/reworked class is the most powerful thing in the entire game and you see ~50% of the community playing it. This cycle repeats itself as every class is made stronger and stronger until the monsters of the game need to be buffed to compensate. There's also the horrendously pay-to-win microtransactions that make the power-curve between ""funded"" characters and ""unfunded"" completely incomparable. Maplestory is long dead. Move along.			"

												One of the worst MMOs back when I played- and trust me, I played A LOT. Hours don't show up because I was a ""dedicated"" (hah) fan and played well before it hit steam. At least 1k hours as a very generous estimate. I would say ~2k as a real estimate. It continues to get worse and worse. They implement shoddy new classes that obviously have become a moneygrab, in leui of new content for existing characters.Worst MMO I have ever played. Easily.			"

												Sorry Just can't recommend a game that takes 20min. just to get through a tutorial and that's just skipping through the dictionary of dialoge the have during the process. There was literally so much dialoge that after 5min. of reading everything and not even getting to any kind of action I just started skipping everything and still it took another 5min. just for me to kill some little rabbit things? I don't even know if i'm fully done with the tutorial I refuse to go back and check because of how boring it was just sitting there trying to skip everything and play the game. The game could also do better with a more readable GUI. Everything is extremely small and also crazy confusing. I had to change my controls also because it just felt too weird attacking with ctrl and jumping with alt. How hard could it have been to just implament a jump and climb mechanism into 1 keybinding as a default setting? Anyways clearly I have no write to fully go over this game as I'm still in the tutorial I think and don't even know how good it is due to the lack of enjoyment I had trying to just get the the part where I PLAY the game and not read 5 more chapters of bs they put in the beggining. So if you think the game is fun that's cool and all, but until they make a better tutorial I'm going to just uninstall this game as it bored me within the first 10 min. of hoping I could kill something or get to the action. Overall: 3/10Gameplay: ?/10 (wish I got to experience this) "

												Don't let my 12 hours fool you. I have played for a VERY long time. This game used to be fun. I remember spending HOURS grinding (which was FUN! Fun grinding. I KNOW!) and leveling my character. I remember how hard it was to chhose between the classes. They were each fun and awesome. Then everything changed when Aran was introduced. HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ Some of my fondest memories of all the games I've ever played come from the experience of swinging a giant pole-axe around and wrecking face. But it was hard as ♥♥♥♥ to level. And I loved every minute. But I slowly got older. I stopped logging in as often. Why? New classes. The freaking new classes. The little♥♥♥♥♥♥of a dragon wizard was the last straw. I couldn't take it. What had they done to my beautiful game?Then, to blow my fondness and love for this game into tinier shards, BOOM! BIG BANG! (Man, ♥♥♥♥ big bang.)Changing the entie world? What idiot that that would be a good idea? Whatever. It can't be that bad! So, I decided to start playing again, and I realised something horrible in the first couple hours! HOURS! My lovely, cute, AMAZING game had been corrupted. With power creep. SO. MUCH. POWER CREEP. (If you don't know what that is, search it up.) Like come on! I got to level 80 (80!!!) with SO much ease. It sickened me. What had happened? What made it this way? Oh right. Money makes the world go 'round eh?I love this game. But it is a bittersweet love. I hate what it has become. I love it for the friends, memories, and good times it's given me. But I hate it for not telling me it was going to change, so I could play just a little more, cherish it a little harder. It's hard to find good MMOs nowadays. This is... WAS a shining example of a good MMO. Now, it is a glammed up, shiny, flashy carcass. A shell of a once amazing game. No. Not a game, but a masterpiece, because everytime I look at this game, I remember a happy time. And everytime I look at this game, a sadness for what once was creeps into my heart.♥♥♥♥ you, Maplestory. You beautiful son of a ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												Maplestory has to many starting bugs and crashes in it that it doesn't function well at all. It crashed 5 times in the matter of 5 minutes with my 1,700$ computer and sometimes the log in screen crashes. This is not for people that don't have patience, good internet, or a good computer.The gameplay is fairly addicting for an RPG game. It's satisfying seeing your character level up and unlock new skills with gametime. You can choose between many classes that all have unique skills, so you won't get bored. But like all RPG games you must grind until you die. Grinding is a major part in this game and most RPG games, so if you don't have the patience to grind, I reccomend you not to play maplestory.			"

												tl;dr- no.Maplestory has changed a lot over its ten year career, but at its core it is still a complete and utter grindfest. Though the time it takes to get to an acceptable level to really explore the content that the game offers has been shortened, it still feels extremely long and drawn out. And even if you end up actually making it to this level you reach a point where getting gear overtakes leveling in priority, the cost of acquring entry level gear for fighting some mid difficulty bosses becomes pretty high. At this point is where the game really blossoms. There is a rather decentvariety of bosses and encounters, and are often rewarding and create a cool sense of progression and challenge. But, after this point is where the fatal flaw of the game lies. You reach a point where the only way to  progress is invest a major amount of money into gear, larger than many other f2p games. Aside from that, still a fun game, but lacks the same charm and community it had when it came out.+ Gives a great sense of character progression+ Many varied classes to choose from + Nostalgic+ Mushrooms+ Still addictive - Pay2win- Devs and customer support don't really care about their players just that sweet $- Huge amount of time needed to reach an endgame level (even for an MMO)- Lacks the same sense level of community it had in its earlier age- Gigantic gap between funded and unfunded players- Some Classes just don't have an even remotely competitive level of DPS- Even an equipment slot that holds stats is gated by a pay barrier- An Incredible amount of botters- After quitting there is a 100% chance of asking ""Why did i do this to myself""			"

												I used to play Maplestory around 2005 while in highschool, and to me it was extremely difficult to get to level 120 as a Bowmaster. Every couple months since 2006 I wanted to play the game as a game I could sink some hours into just to get the grind out of my system, but due to compatability issues, I could never ever return to the game unless I went through these ridiculous changes to my OS and when I did, the game was so different and I felt I missed so much and the learning curve was so drastic at the point of where I was that I simply was dettered from rejoining the game, so my Maplestory experience so far ended there.Fast forward to 2015, I find out that Maplestory is now accessible through Steam. So I decided to do a little research and see if I could pull up my old account and start up my Bowmaster and just be higher average in the game. I get my archer back, but man EVERYTHING is different, but in a good way.Game was much easier to get into, the learning curve and leveling process was MUCH easier, there were a lot of classes to choose from, all with their own style of gameplay and storyline, and each as good as the last.Pros:- Easy learning curve- Every class is good and visually pleasing- Big numbers are oddly satisfying which there's plenty of- Grind Heavy, but time will fly easilyCons:- Grind Heavy- There are certain parts of the game where you can get experience bottlenecked for certain classes- The social aspect of the game is near none, so it's very hard to get a group or make ANY friends at all- Some microtransactions are neccessary to get min/max unless you play for a LONG time********TL;DR********Easy learning curve, a lot of classes to choose from and each one is as good as the last. Big numbers everywhere, but very grind intensive. Be prepared to play this game alone, as there's no socialness here.			"

												MapleStory is basically my childhood; I played it alot in Middle School, alot in High School and even some in college.  I spent two years getting to level 70 on a Page, which was one of the harder, boring classes to play back then.  It felt awesome getting to White Knight status (being probably the only one running around) after two whole years of grinding and socializing in-game.  Then, almost over-night, it all became for nothing.  The White Knight became seriously overpowered, the levelling system went from taking two years to two weeks to two days to get higher levels, and everything I knew and thought I had worked for became almost worthless.  The point is, this game changes really quickly (as MMOs should to survive).  The tactics I had painstakingly learned became obsolete, as had my dedication to being unique in the game.  The reason I can't recommend this game is simply because it's very polarizing in structure: either you're dedicated to playing full-time, or you're not.			"

Unlike most MMOs, you have to REPEATIVLEY kill enemies friendly or not, until you just get bored and give up on the quests. All the quests are is to kill monsters till you drop or talk to a certain person thats a few worlds away. This is also a P2W. Sometimes, the game just begs you to buy stuff (Mostly clothing). The storylines are just like the story authors just copy pasted a whole fanfiction onto the script. Another thing is, it gets bored after a while. Oh yeah, and before the game, good luck remembering a whole  bunch of passwords for the game.			"

												Where it says I havent played this game at all/a couple of hours. That's totally wrong. Ever since the 2005 beta started ( yes, i was 8 years old), I played the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game. Its fair to say I have put tens of thousands of hours into this game. It was REALLY good when it first started. It really brings back good memories playing this game when i was younger. It allowed me to escape my depressing child hood life. That being said, this game has really declined from being an awesome f2p into practically a p2p. The reason it is a pay to play is that you either have to spend thousands of dollars in order to become strong. Or spend hundreds of hours hoping the farming will pay off just to get one item with 3 lines of maybe decent bonus potential.I dont regret playing this game. But, If i was asked if someone should play this game at where it is now. I would never in a million years agree recommend it. EVEREdit: I still don't recommend this game if you dont have the time to put into it. I played between october 2014 to january 2015 and clocked over 500+ hours (steam launch wasnt working from when i played some of the time.). I got to lvl 205 and 6+ other character to 120+.. That being said, I put over $200+ into just because I wanted better equips to go bossing. It's also pretty hard to get into training parties without hitting 500k+ a line. Was it worth it? at the time yes. But do i regret it? ♥♥♥♥ yeah i do...All in all, if you have the time to put into it, then sure, do it. If not, then dont waste your time.TIP FOR STARTING PLAYERS: You go into the game and they recommend you a very low populated server; dont do it and thank me later. Join either Windia, or Bera. Maybe Scania if you feel like being edgy.			"

												Pay no attention to time played on this game! Had another account years ago.Anyways, this was a fun game back when I use to play it, and it came up on as a mobile game not too long ago. So I picked up and remembered how much better the PC version is, due to one reason, you have to have some freinds to play with! So get a few buddies and try it out.			"

												I've played Maplestory for 10+ years. I've recently decided to use Steam for it.To break it down, Maplestory is a fun game, provided you have a good reason to start and to continue playing. It helps with the fact that the game has constant events and promotions. But even more important than that is to have friends to play with. Like every other game, without friends, Maplestory becomes a bit dull.I originally fell in love with the game because I absolutely loved the fact that there were so many places to explore, so many hidden areas, and so many things to do, accomplish, and to figure out. I played pre-Big Bang update (Shoutout to players who played around that time xD), where leveling up used to be an accomplishment. Now, levels (at least early on) are given practically for free. With 2XP events going on all the time, and various different things that boost that even further like Cash Shop items, Maplestory ceased to become the thing I first fell in love with. But eventually, they added the new level range 201-250, and then I took that and started playing the game again. It had the same frustratingly difficult level system like before, but it was nostalgic.Maplestory is a nostalgic RPG game, still having most of its former charm, and it continues to draw in many players. Though many Steam players do not play the game because people on Steam are mostly there for the large online community of FPS games and the like, it's still an amazing game. I recommend it 100%, provided that you have the continuous motivation of playing the game.This game is a rather special game. The first of its genre (a Korean MMORPG), Maplestory was and still is amazing. I believe that Maplestory is a rather impressive game that has the potential to do much more amazing if they just made the game more multiplayer themed. As of now, all you can do is farming and party quests together. Though they did have the occasional PVP thing going on, the way Maplestory is set up makes that rather difficult. If they can find a successful way to integrate that or make more ways to play together, then this game would be the successful game in North America it is in South Korea.Oh, as courtesy, here's the summarizationTL; DR: Farming Simulator for over a decade, enjoyable with friends			"

I got so immeresed in this game that I found myself locked in my mum's basement for a whole 3 years!  I also get to spend heaps on money on Nexon Points because I save so much money on condoms.  I strongly recommend this game as you never need to meet people in real life as the people in Maple World are so much friendlier and cuter :3			"

												2 years ago MapleStory was fun and easy to play, where you can easily reach to 170+ or the level cap (200), but at 2014 all of that changed, resulting many maplers to quit even with new updates, all training maps has been significantly nerf making it hard to reach the level you want, however this game offers many different classes to play and try. In MapleStory there are many servers (over 10 servers to choose from), but a majority of the servers contains unfriendly community and tends to lag a lot. I would recommend this game to those who are willing to play more than a year, but overall if you play for a few weeks you will quit. Not only that MapleStory contains a lot of hackers and the the company, Nexon tends to get DDoS attacks (at least once per month), this will affect a lot of games including Combat Arms and Mabinogi, which will cause massive lag and disconnection. Play at your on risk and avoid flamming and raging.			"

												Thanks, but no thanks. Had enough of this from before. Put too much time into this in the past. Just not on Steam. Now it comes back to haunt me. Nightmares of meso sellers, @@@@@@ spammers, 'cc plox/gtfo KS'er, I report you', and many other similar horrors. *NOT* recommended to anyone, especially if you value free time and your very soul. Whether you take my word for it or let it pull you under the suffocating tar, is your decision alone.*Note* It may seem like a innocently fun game with a reasonable amount of grinding, don't let it fool you. The insidious nature of this time suck only serves to cement you into a mediocre experience that's really not worth your time. As much as I loved it for quite a little while, I can't even bring myself to care about it any more than to leave a warning *un*recommendation to ward off anyone sane from considering it.Now, if you like the game, fine..But just because ""You can and it's free"", doesn't mean you should.1.5 out of 5 score.

												Increadibly addiciting, but sadly due to a recent update I no longer reccomend this game. My reasons are this:Way back when, when the game was still new my sister showed me this game. I installed it and started to play. got to level 20 and had a bunch off goodies. Then something happened to where the game was unplayable. So I stopped playing.Now then, the second time around I saw it on steam, Thinking back to the fun I did have with it, I decided to give it a shot. Got all the way to level 30 and have good enough gear and items, knocking out quests left and right. Till a recent update to where the game does not launch through steam anymore. It goes to a black screen then remains running in the background but does not play. Unacceptable in my book considering this game was made long ago. The bugs should have been ironed by now. Once I am able to get back in game and be able to play without fail, I will take this down. But for now I do not recommend MapleStory for Steam Users.			"

												Before it came out on Steam, I remember playing Maplestory with only 4 classes. Warrior, Mage, Bowman, and Thief. Over the years Maplestory has evolved into something almost completely different. Some old players have given it up because the game has grown at a rate that rivals other popular MMORPG's like World of Warcraft. The main draw of this game is cooperation. Without friends by your side, the climb to become the most powerful mapler in the land and the challenge of defeating the Black Mage, who has inflicted chaos on the Maple World is a very long one. Luckily the game doesn't require much to run and it's even easier to make friends on your first day of playing. I've met 5 people myself who I owe my well being to. They made me who I am today. Now what's different about this game? What makes it stand out? The art style. Today, 2-D MMO's have either died out, become obscure with about 500 players playing a day, and/or become a 2-D 3-D hybrid. Maplestory is one of a kind where you can compare it to those days of playing Megaman on your NES. 100% Sidescrolling, Shoot em' up, Beat em' up, RPG, Multi-Event, Party Questing, Adventure that anyone can get into. So what are the cons? Every MMO has 1 or 2. What's wrong with this game? Well, you remember how I said this game relies heavily on community? Unfortunately, the community has become more secluded/hostile than it used to be. Pre-BigBang you could jump on a ship that goes to Orbis and meet up with some of the most powerful players in the game or the weakest and have friendly conversations with them for about 20 mins until you arrive at your destination. Today, Maplestory has become elitist. So unless you come in with friends or decide to take a weak player under your wing it's a bit more challenging to make strong relations here. Speaking of relations beware of Gender Bender players. Quite a few players choose excessively appealing avatars to swindle money and items from people of the opposite sex through marriage. Yes, this game has marriage. Always a juicy source of gossip in the maple world, marrying someone who divorced a top player is practically the same as being a top player.Overall, Maplestory is an amazing game that not only has an entertaining storyline, but also has some of the most addicting RPG gameplay to date. Despite what many people say, unless they put in their first 8 hours the review typically isn't worth it. Give it a try! Play for 2 hours and watch your time fly away!			"

												TL;DR version:Pros+Okay graphics+Okay gameplayCons-Difficulty is minimal and the game is laughably easy-Long and drawn-out tutorials that are poorly integrated with plot.-Combat is essentially Slow-Time-Events-Dull and uninteresting plot.4/10I was really kind of sad coming back to this. As a mapler from a long time ago who was stuck at my second job, nothing feels like a challenge anymore. The skills are inconsistently changing and annoying, and overall my character feels either too powerful or too weak. There isn't a ""just-right"" tier for me, it seems, and I'm only at level 60. I really used to enjoy Maplestory, but now it's changed to the point of ""Who are half of these classes?"" In fact I remember when the Cygnus Knights came out; that was an interesting character class, compared to the other classes that are essentially all plot-driven for reasons that I could truly care less about.An example of this is the new and seemingly more interesting classes. I can't remember the specific names because, as stated, I could really care less, but one of the plots was that this fellow seemed to have a bond with the Empress and it involved teddy bears as well as some sort of accusation and revelation of evil chums...? Something bad happens and aforementioned fellow is injured for some reason. I enjoy the inclusion of plot in tutorials, but I also enjoy brevity. Most plot cutscenes were completely irrelevant to the tutorial which is exactly WHY I didn't care; because it wasn't teaching me anything impotrant that was integrated into my current objective or learning how to play as my character.Another problem is the fact that this game has done what I believe quite a few other video games have done; stooped too low to helping out new players. The game feels pathetically easy and there's no real motivation for me to continue playing the game... All in all, it's a bit like an old friend that you see after five years and it turns out they're almost like a stranger to you. Goodbye Maplestory.			"

												To get to anywhere in Maple. 1. be in a town that has a quick move and allows you to go to dimension portal go to the town known as momijigaoka. from there ( if you are over lvl 50) go to the dimension portal again and go to the Party Quest area. Leave that map. when you come back out you should be in Mushroom Shrine. Find the Green Rock and it will allow you to go to Henesys. From there quick move to the Ship icon. Go down the ladder. Go up the rope until you find the interdimensional Portal in Pantheon. Click that and from there you can go to any town in Maple World.PS if you are under lvl 50, first purchase a nearest town scroll in the shop once that is done go to the right in  Momijigaoka until you find the map with cherry blossom trees. then use the nearest town scroll. this will take you to the mushroom shrine. PSS. After you leave the Party Quest area, you will be in ch 1.			"

												For the lazy people.Pros:- Vast world with thousand of quests, mobs, bosses, events and more to come.- Weekly update with new events, items and more.- Great diversity of classes.- Millions of character customization.- Insanely big community.- Unique graphic and music and it's own sense of humour.- Large of daily events and bosses that will keep you engaged with the game.Cons:- Large amount of grinding.- Pay to grind less.- Pay to get extra cosmetics. Neutral:- Contains ranking system.- Max level of 250.- 17 worlds with 3 world alliances and 3 stand-alone worlds.For people that want a more in-depth review.Maplestory has always and will always be a treasured baby of Nexon. The developers have implimented a lot of interesting events, bosses and mobs into the game. As of recent updates, Maplestory have come in contact with 2 huge anime series, Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan. These have been 2 of the biggest events in Maplestory. It's large community astonishes many people on just how great the game can be. And the large amount of diversity in the game just adds icing onto an already beautiful cake.Though this cake might not be like be everyone, as grinding is one of the core elements of the game. The game consists of hours of grinding mobs for exp, mesos (currency in-game) and rare drops. But these grinding will be reduced greatly as you level gets higher as you'll be going into the stage of bossing to gain more mesos, and leveling once you've hit the 200 mark will just not be as engaging.This game is not pay-to-win, this will be a statement that I am willing to make. This game if more pay-to-grind-less-or-just-have-hours-of-grinding-if-you-don't-want-to-pay kind of game.The majority of your cash is mainly to get cosmetic items that will make your character look very fancy. The minority of your cash will go to items that will enhance your gear, which you can get by grinding of buying it off others.Alas, this game at its core has achieved what the developers have wanted to achieve and it is not likely to change too much from the state that it is right now.

Unless you start on the reboot server where it's in game money to get strong ( play reboot it's so fun! ) and the whole game is pay to look good. 😂 overall a great game but it doesn't have its flaws...

												After logging quite a few hours into this game over the years I figured it was about time I wrote a review. The game is fun but there's a LOT of grinding. Not like world of warcraft grinding where the quests are all different. Maplestory is go to this place, kill X amount of these, and repeat for every quest in the game. Once you get to a high enough level boss fights are pretty fun but that's after grinding up to that level. Party quests are fun to do though. It makes the incessant grinding a lot more bearable.The loot system is pretty basic where all the enemy's stuff gets thrown to the floor and you run over it button mashing to pick it all up. That gets kinda old after a while but luckily there's pets that pick up the loot for you! That you have to pay for... Gotta make money somehow I guess?One of the charms Maplestory has is the platforming. There's a few quests where you parkour around to get to the next one. Those were always enjoyable (if infuriating at times) and a nice breather from the grinding.Overall Maplestory is a pretty basic game. Kill this, get experience, level up to get new skills so you can keep grinding. It's more of a game you play if you have a summer with nothing really else to do. It's not the best game but it's not the worst either. The events were always really fun though and one of the reasons I keep revisiting this game. So yes, recommended if you have a lot of time to kill.			"

												This game till this day is the best 2D side scroller RPG. That being said...When this game came out it was incredible, I was quickly addicted and like most RPG players I played on and off mostly during the summer. I loved the character sprites, the anime/chibi theme. The 2D  aspect was done really well, navigation was easy, combat was entertaining, and the frustrating platforming jump quests were proof that even moving could be mastered. Back in Maplestory's hayday Bosses took hours to do and were seldom done. People cared about guild leader boards, the game broke up grinding with enjoyable party quests, basically minigames but with a nice EXP reward. Maplestory also had a great social environment, not typically your hardcore game types but people of all kinds had an easy time finding a guild and friends.The elephant in the room....This game has many flaws, but i'm just addressing the two that KILLED the game.What killed this game is the horrific cash shop and formally MTS, even more than rampant hackers. For a long time now the cash shop has been sucking players dry with ridiculously priced non permanent stuff. You will pay up to $10 for a single piece of rental clothing. It gets worse, with the addition of cubes, Meso sacks and some necessary conveniences(pets, scissors of karma etc) Its a pay-to-win mess. Its impossible to play this without spending money at some point, or else you'd be wasting your time now that is so grindy. This is the WORSE implementations of micro transactions in a game i've ever seen. Its completely unacceptable. Nexon does not care about its customers. Maple is showing its age and what made it great is rapidly dying. Hackers are a big issue too. But At this point I can hardly blame them since its so hard to progress without real world money.If you want to play Maplestory, Go on a private server. Its still a good game, Nexon is not a good company. Worse than EA.			"

												The biggest problem with this game is that it can be remarkably addictive but it always feels totally unfulfilling. I've probably played 100 hours of this game and my brother probably spent at least 1000 hours and 300 dollars in content. Now, both of us wish we could have that time and money back. If you play it, I'm not saying you won't like it. What I am saying is that one day, you could really regret it because Maplestory is essentially a really simple♥♥♥♥♥game that hooks you because Nexon cleverly knows how to design it in a way that will keep you engaged. In other words, the game is designed to be addictive but it isn't really designed to be fun. You will play it, you will spend lots of time, you will spend lots of money, and then you will really regret it.			"

												I remember playing this game for hours and hours on end when I was younger and I did have fun for that time. Although, I hate everything Nexon and everything Maplestory pretty much I still get dragged back into it. I always give it another try and then I realize again that all you really do in this game is press spacebar and spam one attack for some amount of hours at one monster, then go to another map with a little higher level monsters and do the same. This is ridiculously boring after a little bit and get really stale fast. Even though there's a huge amount of jobs to choose from (way too much), there's honestly not much variety in what they do, because usually most of their attacks, buffs, and passives are all the same or just reskins. Also, after a while this game gets to be pretty much pay to win. There's also the problem with there being too much god damn hackers.So unless you're okay with endless, boring grinding, hackers, sometimes getting banned just because you are in the same map as a hacker, and a really annoying community that mostly consists of 6 year olds, then this game is perfect for you. If not, then ignore this game and never come back to it again.			"

												has a huge pay to win comunity its almost imposible to some classes to completion without either saving up money since you created the character or buying them in the shops in freemarket/ their store although it was fun for a while i played till i was about 120 but when was a blade dancer it wouldn't allow me to rank up without buying skills because i had spare skill point -_- so i payed for the skills and guess what i asked some people if i could do raids they said not unless you got this skill that either you payed 5 bucks for or kill a boss and pray it drops i killed the boss several times never got it -_- so i was mad and ended up quiting the game because of the fact that i payed for this char and it was about 20 bucks maybe more to rank up and your telling me my character isn't even strong enough to do some places BECAUSE the fact that i dont have this ultra rare skill that drops about less then 10% of the time you kill the boss ... also this boss requires you to get a rare item to even fight it so yeah i would give this game a lot higher of a score if it weren't ptw 2/10 becasue fun in the begining HORRID towards endgame.

												I've played maplestory for many years (I don't usually launch the game on steam.) I have experianced everything this game has to offer and here is my opinion on the game. The game definitely has a lot of potential, however like most mmorpgs there is a lot of mob grinding involved in order to go to a high level. In maplestory, you must grind for hours in order to reach your desired level. Unless you pay real money! Maplestory as you see is a Pay-To-Win game. You need to spend money to get good equips, more xp while grinding, pendant slots, more backpack space... I really wish I could give this game a good review, however the game is crap because it's all Pay-To-Win.			"

												Don't be fooled by my play time, I've played Maple long before it came to steam.Maple is one of those games you can play for a bit, and then you take one of two paths, you either leave of boredom after a few weeks, or you lose a lot of money and spend months on this game, and then realize this game sucks and quit until you come back wanting more.Maplestory is a 2D mmorpg with classes that represent characters that you will explore the world as. An idea of what classes are offered range from explorers that can advance into a warrior, mage, bowman, or thief to the master of dragons, or the elf queen of elluel, to more extreme things like magical girls or an animal girl with the power to fight with beasts.To put it straight, you can make a new character, explore the world, level up, go through job advances and have more flashy skills, but eventually that magic dies.You realize how much time you wasted on this game, how boring and tedious it was to sit down in one spot for ten levels, holding one button down, level up, and move on to the next spot. Then you repeat the process all over again on a different character.This game sucks with ease of access. You want the best equips? You gotta work for it in the free market. A full set of the best and optimized equips has the potential to cost billions of mesos depending on how popular the class subset is. You can barely get ten million by normal play. So to make more mesos you have to learn the ins and outs of maple's economy, this has the potential to take weeks. Then you need to scavenge whats good and in high demand to sell in the market, and then, merchanting, buy low sell high. Even when you get to the point of learning the market, results are not immiediate. You can't begin with 5m and end the day with 5b.The game is pay to win, but you can get nx buy gambling with other players and paying your hard earned mesos at a certain rate per 1k nx. The cash shop has many things you may want. All the items purchased in the cash shop can not be earned in normal play, you need real money for certain things like changing your character's appearance, pets, stat changing and stat enhancing items.But don't get me started about hackers. This game is poorly managed by nexon. The market time and time again has been dominated by hackers. Tales of people losing everything they worked for due to hackers, with no compensation. There is no escape, and no salvation for the hacker situation in Maple. This game is tedious, money siphoning, poorly managed, boring and not worth your time,but go ahead, play for a week or two, but don't take it too far. I lost thousands of dollars on this game, and I don't think you would want to do the same.			"

												Don't go back.In many ways, the game has improved, but no matter how much you garnish & polish the turd of uninteresting combat and endless grinding, you will still be left with a core of unrewarding gameplay.The visual design of Maplestory is still pretty garish. On one hand, enemy pixel-art is quite impressive, on the other, player characters are still samey giant heads & hats. Combat effects from player characters and enemies alike can be so oversized and garish that the entire screen is blotted out continuously while you're left staring incredulously at the developer's excuse for a UI.Audio design will make you mute the game. This is not a joke or an exaggeration.Don't go back. It's not as bad as you remember it, but it's still not good.			"

												I have been a mapler since about the time this game launched. The graphics are pretty good, there's excellent custimization, and as of late, there's a LOT more choices for classes. This makes the game a lot more fun and interesting to have multiple takes of the same general class. (EG - Mechanic Vs Pirate Vs Angelic Buster) The game has also become less party quest based (although PQ's are still fun and helpful), which is nice considering the game used to be almost based on this. There's new engaging story quests, and MapleStory as a whole has grown a lot since the original launch date. I hope Nexon keeps up with the awesome content for Maple, as this will always be my go-to game when I'm bored of everything else.Also, nexon, PLEASE fix the one-time account link. It should not be a one-time deal. I don't like that I have to keep a standalone launcher instead of just being able to launch through steam.			"

												I will say this, in my opinion, this is one of the best free-to-play MMORPG's you'll ever find it is so in depth and specific and so many different quests, monster, bosses, and events you will never be bored. But I will say this this a game where you need to work for your levels, in this case characters go up to lv 250, this may seem like a lot but actually u don't really need to go past 120, and in general if you find the right areas it wont be hard. This is a great game to play with friends in fact its almost recommended, but in my case since none of my friends play this game I just put a Youtube Let's Play on the side and its great. Background Information: Been playing this game for 3 years, am 16 now was 13 when I started and still love it.Defiinitely recommend it, so many classes to choose from,You'll definitely enjoy it its a great experience!

												This game till this day is the best 2D side scroller RPG. That being said...When this game came out it was incredible, I was quickly addicted and like most RPG players I played on and off mostly during the summer. I loved the character sprites, the anime/chibi theme. The 2D  aspect was done really well, navigation was easy, combat was entertaining, and the frustrating platforming jump quests were proof that even moving could be mastered. Back in Maplestory's hayday Bosses took hours to do and were seldom done. People cared about guild leader boards, the game broke up grinding with enjoyable party quests, basically minigames but with a nice EXP reward. Maplestory also had a great social environment, not typically your hardcore game types but people of all kinds had an easy time finding a guild and friends.The elephant in the room....This game has many flaws, but i'm just addressing the two that KILLED the game.What killed this game is the horrific cash shop and formally MTS, even more than rampant hackers. For a long time now the cash shop has been sucking players dry with ridiculously priced non permanent stuff. You will pay up to $10 for a single piece of rental clothing. It gets worse, with the addition of cubes, Meso sacks and some necessary conveniences(pets, scissors of karma etc) Its a pay-to-win mess. Its impossible to play this without spending money at some point, or else you'd be wasting your time now that is so grindy. This is the WORSE implementations of micro transactions in a game i've ever seen. Its completely unacceptable. Nexon does not care about its customers. Maple is showing its age and what made it great is rapidly dying. Hackers are a big issue too. But At this point I can hardly blame them since its so hard to progress without real world money.If you want to play Maplestory, Go on a private server. Its still a good game, Nexon is not a good company. Worse than EA.			"

												I played this game from 2006-2013.  I have thousands and thousands of hours on this game.  The 200-ish hours that are logged with Steam is the winter break of 2012-13 I spent with nothing better to do.Here's the sum of it.Do you enjoy spending hours and hours killing the same enemies at the same place just to gain a level?Do you enjoy doing quests whose effort to reward ratio is even worse than the method mentioned above?Do you enjoy playing games where the majority of the (dwindling) community is under the age of 18?Do you enjoy games where the only thing that matters is DPS?Do you enjoy paying to win?If you answered ""Yes!"" to one or more of these questions, then you have every right to download and play this game.For everyone else, you're better off trying something else.Now you might be saying to yourself, ""I'm sure there is more to this game than that.""Nexon tries their best to add new content (which is either a mechanic that will be exploited to death or a new class that breaks the game) and apply balances (removing said mechanics and nerfing said classes).However, what hasn't change through the 8 years that I've spent on this game are the questions I asked you above.Are you familiar with the classic board game, Monopoly?Maybe you and some friends are hanging out one day with nothing to do, and one friend mentions a cool new version that has come out recently.  Being it that you're on an extended vacation with time to kill, you think to yourself, ""We've been down this road before.  We're probably gonna start up the game, sit down, roll the first pair of die, and instantly regret doing this.  But I'm feeling optimistic.  Maybe this time will be different.""  You turn to your friends and say, ""I'm down if you're down.""  So you and your friends start up the game and you're starting to get really into it, but a few turns later your friends are already sick of it and you immediately regret being so optimistic about this whole idea.Maplestory is exactly like that.

												Simple: Play with friends, Yes! Play alone, No!Having both good and bad memories of this game in the past I'm surprised to see it now on steam.I can't say it's the worst game or the best but I do still enjoy the designs and artwork, having it's little comedy into the action and the sound is what I feel is the core source that many other MMORPG's has taken influence from. Still what made it bad would be the  toxic community of very sensually active preteens seeking love relationships and harsh judgement from everyone for simple mistakes. It's like high school all over again!Would I recommend it? I have to say 50-50 on that because it sure is nice for being an old free MMORPG that still updates and make new changes but it's been years and I feel like no matter how much it tries to change it will be dull compared to other MMORPGs. There are better ones out there... But if you choose to play with friends then nothing could really go wrong!( From a personal experience to reason my hate for NEXON though is because I used to play back in 2007-2008 when it was still GLOBAL but later forced me into EUROPE region servers and seperated me from my friends as well as making me lose my hardworking character. I was still so young and that really depressed me. :/  )			"

Nexon is money hungry and needs to atleast make a server dedicated to pre big bang maplestory (kinda like what runescapes doing) but I doubt they'll even try that. I would honestly say download a private server that is pre big bang for more fun out of the game.  It actually took time to get around the Maple World, but now they have pay 2 win rocks where it can teleport you anywhere. k im done with this mixed crap, don't play.			"

												I've been playing for seven years so this might be a bit biased, but I personally enjoy the game. The animations are nice to look at, I enjoy the music, there is still a decent player base(at least on the server I play on), and it's kind of fun just creating your own training routes and seeing how fast you can level up.The events they give can also be fun, even if Korea gets them 6 months ahead of us.Though there are some cons as well, Kind of ""childish"" graphicsSome may like it while others will be turned off.PlatformingOne of the worst thigns in the game is the amount of platforming, I honestly refuse to play any part with platformign since it pisses me off.DeadspotsSome level sections have a deadspot where there are few training options and you'll usually level up slowly. Though through all that I find the game to be very above average, so I'd give it a 7/10. Which is higher then I give most games. Well over 2000 hours on the game in total, and I'm on and off every couple weeks. "

NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAYThe sun shines brightly on the classic facade of the main library at FifthAvenue and 42nd Street.  In the adjacent park area, pretty hustlers anddrug peddlers go about their business.FRONT STEPSA few people lounge on the steps flanked by the familiar stone lions.INT. MAIN READING ROOM -- DAYPeople are dotted throughout the room sitting at the long oak tablespolished by decades of use.  Reading lamps with green glass shades cast agolden glow on the tables.  The patina of age is everywhere.  It is veryquiet.LIBRARIANA slightly stout, studious looking girl in her late twenties circulatesquietly among the tables picking up books and putting them on her cart.Everything seems completely normal and peaceful.POVA single eerie musical note signals the presence of something strangelooking down on the Librarian from a vantage point high above the room.It follows the Librarian as she pushes her cart around the corner.INT. WORK AREAThe Librarian is alone in a back room sorting books for reshelving.Behind her is the card catalogue.  One of the books attracts her interestand she starts leafing through it.THE CARD CATALOGUEAnother eerie note is heard as one of the drawers silently slides openbehind the Librarian and hundreds of index cards start popping out.

												Maplestory is a 2D MMORPG(massive multiplayer online role playing game). While the graphics are dated they are still appealing. The pros: -Pracitcally a single player game     -Free to play     -Multiple classes, +15 The cons:     -+15 classes: there are so many classes that many of the classes fit the same style of character.      -Monotonous: this game is the epitome of a grind fest. You grind for levels by hunting montsers from levels 10-250.        The quests given are typical MMO quests. The game is such a grind fest that when grinding a map if someone other than        you joins the map, people throw tantrums and get upset.     -No socialization: ever since the big bang update socialization was drastically hit. The bigbang update brought forth a          massive increase in the exp rate, only further supporting the grind fest.     -Nexons idea of balance: when the release new classes their idea of marketing the new class is to make the class stronger       the class before them. They repeat that cycle until the older classes get to far behind, so they have to bring the older        classes back to up par. Rinse and repeat that cylce.Another thing to bring the relation between Nexon and the community was terrible for a large period of time, no commmunication tickets going unanswered for weeks/months. The last several monthes something changed and Nexon is currently attempting to repair the damage they caused.			"

												This game has taken many leaps foreward and backward up until this point, and ultimately in the end I would say that the game is throughly enjoyable. However, if you want to hit the damage cap and really be the best, the game is 100% pay to win. Without paying you cannot even see the top. Another factor about this game that i would critisize is that nexon has dropped the idea of roles for bosses. You dont need a healer to defeat a boss, which means that parties don't use any teamwork. With that said, i do enjoy checking back into the game every once in a while, and theres SOO many classes! all in all fun game but pay 2 win :3			"

												I don't know about my opinion policy, but there is something with me with liking actual mixed/controversal games.Its play this game for a long time, take a break.Try it again after 3 months and then play it for a long time again... Repeat.Being a person who has not spent a single penny on this game, I still probably found fun in this game. Possibly just because I like wasting my time because I have barely any games to play, and still at least have some satisfaction included.I'll go with some pros with the game.First is the graphic design... It has a unique appeal to it while giving itself a charm. Even the most evilest looking of all enemies look clean.From the attacks, there is a lot of ""WHOA HOLY CRAP THIS LOOKS SO AWESOME!!!"" ones cosmetically, while at times practically.Most of the notable characters in the present main story are pretty original. Cygnus, Neinhart, Orchid, and so on.and As part of the story, the clans within it are quite official feeling, the Black Wings, the Cygnus Knights... The black wings especially due to the amount of backstory with their characters.And now... the cons.As most of the people know, yes, this is a freemium game by all means. Making the game's experience the more fun using actual funds. As for the same time, there were a lot of freemium items I found that only had a 90 day trial.It is like valve making a system where you pay $30 to have a certain unusual for a temporary amount of time, Except less attention instead.The playerbase is 95% of people at the age of >13, the first time I encountered someone who chat with me and requested to play together, I denied the request in the most polite way I could think of saying... All he said was ""*********"" after that, and that is the only time I actually talked to someone out of the hours I played with this game.Also the amount of times I've seen someone who wants to get married using the shout system.Quests in a nutshell:FIND ME 150 OF THIS AND THAT EACH AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME EXP!!!!Find me something that is almost impossible to do until you level up 50 more times.'I need you to hunt the monsters till they drop something, the programmers made it very lucky to find.and Classes are unbalanced that it felt like it was measured using kilometre rulers, and thought a 1Km difference didn't mind much. After playing the Evan class for a while, he started to lack power, tried out the revamped mechanic class and it was much more powerful.Overall, I give this game a rating sentence of...Very mixed, but finding fun without pay to win stuff is a likely chance with the right mindset.

												I really don't get why everyone is complaining about the leveling from now and to before. I understand that many memories were made back in the day and it felt like a great achievment to get that level. But, get over it. No matter how much you complain to Nexon about it, it isn't coming back. Anyways the game is fun Ive been playing ever since i was 6. Great amount of story, nice effects, in game currenct can be easily made, and a good community. Most end game equips can be easily bought if you grind the Mesos for it.			"

												In my opinion this is by far the best 2D Side-Scrolling MMORPG. I have been playing this game ever since I was 8. I did take few breaks here and there but I always came back to it.The game offers a lot of classes for you to choose from and a lot of things to do. People are saying that this game is a total grind fest. These people could not be anymore wrong than what they already are. This game is NOT a grind fest, unless you turn it into one. There are tons of quests to do, which players that grind decide to skip cause they prefer the ""fastes"" way to level up, and then they moan about having to do pre-quests for certaim bosses... well their fault.Give this game a try and just take things slowly. Pick who you want to play as and who you find most fun to play, don't look at damage and don't listen to the whole Pay2Win Bull****. Every player is given the same chances to do things, of course if you pay then you will speed things up, but you don't have to at all because the things that you can get from paying that will make you stronger, i.e Miracle Cubes, can be crafted and looted from Bosses, it just takes time and not real money.Yes the game can get repetitive, but all MMOs eventually get repetitive. Plus once again, it is only repetitive if you make it repetitive.All in all, play it, you won't regret it!			"

												Played since Beta... I occasionally go back to it for whatever reason if not just to check stuff out.You may hear the words ""pay 2 win"" a lot and it feels that way but in all acuality you dont need to spend a dime to get to end game. You can easily do bosses if you are skilled enough or made friends. It is however ""pay to proceed"" and by that I mean you will have to at one point spend some cash. Wether it be a pet, exp gains, or even a shop. You'll need to buy one of those 2 things to proceed to get to that ""level"" where all the kids with mommy's credit card are at. (Even if you have your own job you fall in this category by spending those insane amounts on this... game that will one day shut down) I'd still check it out if you enjoy Action 2D side scrollers, it can still be fun without paying anything.. Just frustrating.			"

It works EVENTUALLY and then queueing up to joing an ""empty"" server also takes a century to connect, as with the annoying music you get greeted with.Was a good game, pisses me off sometimes, grinding is a bit much not as bad as adventure quest,you should restabilize. as you already lowered the exp curve in the reboot update			"

												This game was really good, and I loved it more than sleep for a very long time. Eventually, I started hating all the changes but kept coming back. Once I finished high school I quit because my college blocked the game. I came back to play for a while one summer when i found it on steam, but found myself bored since all my friends had quit playing. I have no doubt that I was addicted to this game in high school. The changes were okay at first, but then they became frequent and way too crazy. I was okay with a few simple changes, even when they added a new class. Then they started adding a new character every 5 minutes and it became hard to keep up with the game or the economy in it. Go on vacation with your family for a week and some of your most valuable items are worthless because a new update had a new boss which gave it out like candy.It's your typical mmorpg grindfest, and there's very little appreciation for a newcomer in older worlds... although they will complain that the server is too empty 2 minutes after making fun of someone for not knowing where the next quest is or whatever ""noob"" question they asked. I joined the game because of a friend, but then I kept playing because of the community, now I would I avoid it because of the community. I enjoyed playing for probably the first half of my time. Most of the second half I tried convining myself it was going to be fun again, and tried finding new people to play with. I thought it would be better once it came to steam but it didn't really help. Eventually I just stopped, and started playing other games.			"

												Ok so ive played this game before it came on steam so dont look at my hours played on steam. Ive been playng Maple Story for about 3-4years now and i have to say i regret it this is because Maple has a lv cap that was 200 back then Now the Lv cap is 250. I started as a Aran and ive got him to lv 187 and i just gave up from there. Even if you go and make new characters you just gona keep Grinding over and over again its really no fun cause most of the time your just sitting there and pressing 1 button to kill all these mobs do that till you reach a certain level then go to the next place again and repeat Its just SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORING. Most of the times too making money in the game is a pain.There are just way better games out there then Maple Story4.5/10			"

												Some background at the bottom, clear cut facts here:  Pros:    - Unique.    - Free.    - Highly social.    - Virtually endless amount of story line to follow, I've been playing 10 years and I have not even completed half of it.    - Not a game you need to play every day, you can drop it for a few months and pick it back up no problem.    - Everything you can pay for, can be obtained through (sometimes tireless) ingame efforts. I did not pay for nx for the first five years.    - Consistantly updated, always being worked on.    - Great bug support, I have contacted them about obscure bugs before and (when they were at fault for it) they had a fix for it within the day, I call that response time. Like, for a MMO: fixing a obscure bug (flight with my classes mount) within the DAY has got to be the fastest MMORPG response time I have ever seen.    - Although it has a light overtone, it is actually quite a dark and graphic game. If you actually read the story line, the things that go on are quite morbid and macabre. It is not nessesarily a childs game.     - I see A LOT of older players on, the fact of the matter is that the younger demographic does not tend to interact with the community. The usual demographic for the social towns are around 16-30. Although there are many young players, they don't tend to be as prominant.    - The community, I mean.. Come on guys, It's maplestory! I have NEVER played a more social MMORPG, EVER. This game not only has a massive community, but I would say you are unlikely to run into some nasty people. It is largely populated by nice people! I mean, yeah. You will run into some nasty people, but that's the same for everything. I am a massive collector of chairs, and when I sell them, I spend about twenty minutes with a mercher on each chair to tell them about how I got it and what it meant to me. One of them said that they were literally crying and that I made him really nostalgic about the game.     - The story, It is beautiful. Not only is there a pratically endless suply of it, it is quality content. Their newest update black heaven literally made me cry. It was SO intense, I can not listen to the ending credits song without a tear rolling down my cheek. I can't tell you how amazing it is. My absolute favourite character to play is the Evan, it ties SO nicely with the other story lines. It ties seamlessly with Silent Crusade, Black Heaven, Glowing Sylph, and so much more. It is really deep and meaningful to me.    - I could go on, and on, and on. Just download it for Goddess of time's sake.   Cons:    - It is a grinding game, I would put this on my pro's list but a lot of people don't like this. It is a korean based MMO, it is the standard. Just walk in knowing this.    - The game can crash for a variety of reasons, although it is not near as bad as it used to be.. it is still a problem.    - PC Master race! I am a big hater for apple, however I can't run this on my linux machines - which is a major bummer.. Like, Through a windows wrapper you CAN, but it will be laggy.    - There are some botter problems, it is not often that you will run into one anymore.. but when you do it's annoying.     - Names. this game has been around for over a DECADE, there are A LOT of taken names.. But there is hope! this october (2015) they are releasing 15 MILLION names! That is a lot of new names to use! Be there to claim the good ones!!!    - Pretty big hog for resources if you have a dated computer.    - At this point I am struggling to come up with more cons, just download it.---------OLD REVIEW-------------I have played this game just short of ten years, I have never had a dull moment in it. When you're not off killing hords of unimaginable beasts, you're in town talking to friends from around the world. The game is brilliant, many people don't like the game due to the graphics, but it's the graphics that make the game. The story line is phenominal, in the Black Heaven update I cried - literally. It was a perfect addition to the story line. There are events on much of the time, so it's always tonnes of fun. This is not a pay to win game, I love it for that. I recommend you try this game fully before dismissing it :)			"

												A painful login procedure followed by ads demanding your money. I remembered this game back in my high school days, when it flourished with popularity. The art even screams like it is made for children, sort of like how Gaia forums exploded while the adults would play World of Warcraft. The game lacks direction on who their target audience is and just wants to demand money off you now. A game like this cannot expect many adults to pay for, when there are some better alternatives out there. Kids would probably be more annoyed by the login procedures and would prefer something like Rift, Ragnarok or even Elsword.			"

												Fun, lightweight, and easy to get in to as a side-scrolls hack'n'slash. The quests are somewhat generic, the action (at least for the first 150 levels) is somewhat reptitious, but is an overall good game.Wish it wasn't quite so 'cutesy', but that's a Korean MMO thing, so I cannot be overly upset.

												I need to give this game a little love...I’ve personally been playing this game since 2006, which means I have some nostalgia for the game. The natural first reaction to this game would be that it’s too complicated, it’s hard to level up, its pay to win/ pay to do anything fun, Exa. That’s understandable and was actually my initial reaction when I first started playing. Note that this was in 06, and the game has changed very much since then. I also noticed after hours on hours of playing, I was only level 24 and had gotten nowhere. I then decided to quit the game, to come back to it at a later date near 2008. Many things had changed, and even some new classes were added as well. I tried to level up some more managing to get to level 60 (third job) and noticing I was having tons of fun. After that I kept playing, getting higher in level, making new characters, and even making some new friends. It was weird how a game I hated with a passion became one of my favorite games of all time. Maple story is a game that you need to invest time into to get its full potential. As more time goes in to the game, the more fun it gets (depending on how you look at it). When you reach level 120, the game really get fun and entertaining, discovering new things, getting flashier attacks, beating bosses, and more. The only warning I give is that the game is very confusing, and for a long time you won’t know what things do, such as menu icons, items, and even some npc’s. it will try to tell you, but its lacking explanation leaving you clueless on what it even was. (The free market is also something to stay away from with new players)8/10   "

												I started playing Maplestory way back since Patch 1.83. Or 2007....The game has certainly changed much over the years...and will always keep changing, don't ever expect it to be the same for more than 3 months.  My main character has been level 200 for many years now and I have a 200 NPC In Kradia. So take my word for it, the game is now, just as playable as it ever was.  Many of the things we know and love are gone, like the challenges, or Temple of time being the most difficult location in the game (most players walk over pink bean now like he's a snail)..The direction of the game has changed, and is much more story driven now. Before you just made a character and made it your own story. But you can choose from several. AND I MEAN SEVERAL...different classes with a pre-determined story. And advance them to lv 250 (new level cap)  by grinding on monsters or doing party Quests.The game seems overwhelming at first, but once you get the world map down, you'll be navigating like a pro in no time. The 2D anime style chibi art makes the game much more social than any 3D MMO so feel free to take a break and grab a chair..(literally a chair) that you can buy or collect from events...and sit down and make some cyber friends! Or go gear up and be the God of Damage and solo every boss in the game and wow your friends. My major complaint about the game (and it's been this way forever) is that many ways to grow are all based on luck....nothing makes a person more angry than to spend Hard earned cash on a scroll, that ends up failing. It's always better to let other people do it....but on the other hand...you can sell sucessful gear at a higher price.This game used to be VERY ADDICTING...fortunately I was able to break off of it and do other things with my life after I hit 200, but the new update and all still hasn't pulled me back in. If you plan on getting into this game....you will certainly have a blast...all the confusion at the beginning is worth it and it has something for everyone!			"

												So I've played this game for a while now.  It says I have 0 hours logged because I've haven't been playing it on steam, but I've probably wasted well over a thousand hours on this thing.  There's this thing called the cash shop.  You can buy a crap ton of stuff from the cash shop, but there's a catch, it's all temporary.  You buy a thing and then it disappears after, say, 90 days.  I feel like this rips you off so damn much.  But if you play for long enough, you come by more than enough events,  So you don't have to spend any money.  But the thing is, if you actually want to get cool stuff like chairs and good looking clothes with amazing stats on them, you HAVE TO spend a crap ton of time in game grinding on mobs.  So if you want to get good at this game without spending any money on it, it's possible, but you have to have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of time on your hands on your hands.  Also, to be tolerant of this game, you have to be tolerant of anime.  If you want to be good at this game without spending money OR time, give up, it's impossible.  Unless you have someone else play for you... I guess...? But what's the point of that?  Overall I do recommend this game because of the nostalgia it causes to me and how fun and obsessing I first found it like 6 years ago.			"

												Alright, I don't review games, but my friend tried to get me to play this. So I downloaded it through steam. Hit the play button got all the way to character creation and it crashed. Asked my friend why the hell an 7 year old game isn't running properly and he said don't blame the game you need to run it outside of steam. So I go and hit ""GameLauncher.exe"" and it directs me to Nexons website essentially saying that they don't let people start the game that way anymore. Nexon wants you to use their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ steam knock-off. If they wanted people to use the Nexon Launcher then why can you installl it directly from steam...TLDR: Game doesn't even run past character creation, and tries to shove their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ launcher down your throat by deceiving you by having the game on steam.

												This game blows. Let me say this, I played the game once a long time ago. I didn't like it but it wasn't a terrible game at all. I downloaded it and tried to start up again. After finally getting able to log in, I was greeted with a wonderful 10 minute loading screen. Then I had to create a character and the character selection screen was set up so terribly that I couldn't figure anything out. I finally chose a character and was asked to create a PIC. The Soft Keyboard they gave me was so horrendous and confusing. I entered a PIC and kept being told that it needs to be 6 characters long (and I tried many different codes, each was 6 charcters long). Then I FINALLY got it to accept my PIC and was asked to re-enter it. I did so with my PIC and was told that my PIC was incorrect, even though it definately wasn't. This rocked on for about 30 minutes before I said ""♥♥♥♥ IT."" Everyone I've talked to about the game says that it is heavily bugged (being unable to actually PLAY the game, I don't know how true that is). One of my good friends, who WAS an avid player of the game, told me that he doesn't even remember them ever updating the game with bug fixes.

												I LOVE this game, I've played it for so many years I can't even count (uhhhh, Nexon, can you send me that?) and its gotten old sometimes, it's so much fun and very interesting. Some updates and revamps aren't the best, but the suttle to easy-to-spot game references like Bowser in the Mushroom Kingdom TD make my day. My favorite class is a tie between Evan, Kaiser, and Demon Slayer/Avenger. Definitly a game that requires thought, planning, and quick reflexes. The community is awesome, sure, you have the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but most are nice and have a good sense of humor. I love this game, and always will. And this game has REALLY helped me deal with my Tourette Syndrome, AD/HD, OCD, ADD, ODD, and all the other stressfull stuff in life. Have fun playing guys!			"

												(Ignore the hours. The account attached to this was lost.)With how the game has been getting, I have to say there is more reason to give it a positive remark. I do have negative views about the company and how they've make it into a cash cow with their games, but I won't digress too much into this review about that and suggest reading my Mabinogi review about that.= - = - = - = - = Positives about the game = - = - = - = - =Balancing of Classes:For a long while, there were many classes that were just too overpowered and needed adjustments. Luckily, they fixed that in December of 2015 by giving necessary nerfs and buffs to classes. Many people would play a specific job (like Kaiser or Dual Blader), while neglecting other classes (like Evan or Aran) because they rather play overpowered over underpowered. I do see some jobs needing rework, but there is likely revamps going to happen.No Pay-2-Win Server (Reboot):This was necessary for the longest time because of how people can just drop $10 worth of Nexon Cash and end up with like 200+ million mesos for their character. It put a huge difference between the players who work for their money (by bossing or gathering) and people who can just drop money into the game.Easier for Beginners:I'm a veteran of this game for nearly 10 years and I remember the hardship of being sustained in the game, especially if you were a magician that relies heavily off of potions. Now, this game hands out money and potions like candy and I do support it, especially in the methods of how Nexon has done it.= - = - = - = - = Negatives about the game = - = - = - = - =Finding People to Work With:Unless you have friends that play this game personally and willing to keep you there, the game gets boring and some content does require you to be in parties. Even for me, I can't do some content without the help of a friend and I'm fortunate that I was employed at Maple-Radio for a point to obtain some active, nice friends during my tenure. The game in the previous years were quite easy to get into a guild and work together, but these days--it's harder to do so and can be a challenge. You may want to spend some time trying to get into some groups.The Company Itself:I can go from one end of the earth to the other about this, but they have milked this game (and others) dry with the Pay-2-Win complex. Alongside, there has been times the company would say one thing, but then take it back and proclaim they ""never said that"" or you're ""twisting their words."" If you have a negative view or complaint about the company, don't even dare try to say that on the Nexon Forums or you'll end up with the Hime fans pouncing all over you or potentially banned. (I've witnessed and was a victim of this myself.)Dead Servers:The higher you go up the server list chain (exception of Reboot), you'll notice that the game doesn't have a thriving community in some servers. If you want to stay in a small server, fine; however, you will pay the price of how expensive some things might be and how some content might be limited to you because of the population and economy.

												Lore and StoryThis is something I found myself really getting into as I continued to play the game. The story has really taken off since Big Bang (a really controversial patch that was released in 2010). We actually started to get more information on who the Black Mage really was by this point, and beyond. We find out that he used to be a mage known as the ""White Mage"" as discussed in the Grand Athenaeum. He restlessly researched the light to see what was beyond it. He eventually realized that the ""Ultimate light can only be found in the ultimate darkness.""His research started to have more and more negative effects on the world, creating dark beings known as ""Omens."" Eventually he became corrupt by the power he obtained from the darkness. Not only was corrupted, but he allowed it to corrupt him. He eventually became what we know as the ""Black Mage.""These days, there are so many more lore quests to go through. Especially with Black Heaven out right now, it's gotten a whole lot darker, and a whole lot more interesting. I'd suggest checking these quests out if you plan on playing the game.Based on what I have experienced in the game's story: this is no mere ""childish game."" Unless you think characters dying on screen, and the occasional curse word (crap, damn, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the words that would qualify a game for a Teen rating) are childish.Just to add a bit more, you actually grow attached to some of the characters. You gotta play to find out why. I can't explain it all.GameplayVery basic way of playing a PC game, and it fits this style. Abilities are able to be hot-keyed to YOUR liking ANYWHERE on the keyboard. Especially your basic functions such as jumping, walking, attacking, etc. You can customize your hot-keys to fit YOUR play-style (and yes I will continue to emphasize that). It's not hard to get the hang of this at all. Some classes do require you spam the attack button in order to refill specific substitutes for their MP bar. Examples are Demon Slayer with his Demon Force, Zero with his Time Force, and I think there maybe one more in there. Can't think of it right now.Grinding is something that you do when you're bored IMO. It gives you something to do, and if you want to gain some levels then yay! You want to level up! Though, grinding is the one glaring issue with this game. The only problem I have are the stupid and repetitive fetch quests. ""Get me this from this monster"" or ""I need this many of this item from that monster."" That is actually one of two complaints about this game, and I don't have any other issues with it other than the ""Star Force"" system. -_-""HOWEVER! The grinding in the game used to be fun to a degree. You would often find yourself partying with strangers or friends to go level up somewhere. While you did that, you would sit for a few moments to chat. Most of the time you would make a friend. Hell I got invited to several guilds up to 100+ people, and with 300+ member alliances. I think it's still fun if you know how to take a break for about an hour or two, or just stop all together because it will actually suck your life away. It's that addicting.			"

												NGS Initilization Error.I played this in 2005 and played for a few years and then a few more years of randomly reinstalling it. I got that nostalgia itch again and reinstalled. I tried their launcher from their site first. I had a lot of issues with the old one and was kind of excited to see a new one. Installed 8 gigs and went to open, error. I looked all over online and only saw unanswered cries for help. I deleted all files and reinstalled. Same error. I tried opening it directly from the launcher file, no luck. I deleted it all again and installed it through Stream. The same. exact. error. I have no idea what changed, possibly OS issues?, but I can't play any version of this. Also they marked my account as ""suspicious"" for no reason years ago. I still cannot make any NX transactions. Literal years later and despite having done nothing questionable on my account, ever.

												I remember back in the day when Maplestory only had four classes: the Magician,Warrior,Thief,and Archer. The game was very social and leveling was very hard. It was considered an achievement to reach your 3rd job. I kept playing until the Big Bang patch, which made leveling so much easier. Reaching the 3rd job and 4th job was easy and not an achievenent since everyone could do it. I kept playing after the Big Bang for maybe a month or two after i reached 4th job and quit.After returning to the game, it has lost it's social aspect and there are so many classes it gets confusing. There are jobs for your characters, crafting, and overall un-needed features that just confuse the player. These days, the game is just a grind and level game. Although the game before may also be considered a grind and level game there were social aspects that made the game actually fun to play. Not just playing to level and get better gear, but a game where you played to have fun with friends and leveling and gear was a bonus.IN THE END:  The game is just about grinding to level whereas before the game was played to have fun with friends and leveling and gear was a bonus.I really wish i could recommend this game, but the game is just not what it used to be.

												DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU DO NOT LIKE DOING REPTITIVE THINGS, LAG, UNSTABLE SERVERS, CRASHING OF THE GAME 30% OF THE TIME, MISJUDGEMENT OF GAME MASTERS.The reason I have only 0.1 hours is because I use the game launcher.The game has lost so much ever since I came back to it. I remember back in the days when party questing was live, I was always looking forward to party questing with other people but now they took the fun out of it. In party quest areas, you may find like 1 or 2 peeps, that is not enough to get you into one, and they may be 80% be afk They may try to attract you to the game by putting up events but it really is not worth it. Try another game. Plus Game Masters look investigater and suspend/ban legit players who report real hackers and let the hackers roam while they put the legit players on the ground for a month. It is just absurd, they are taking the very incentive that makes us report hackers, to get them banned. The community is pretty much dead as well. If you are looking to play, don't, you will just be wasting your time as have I.-I got banned for no reason. I was not using any illegal programs nor was I violating any policy. I have been playing all day and suiciding on purpose to not over level so I could play with someone while I look for some equipments. I am greatly disatisfied with this suspension as there are real hackers that I see on the server and I am always reporting them when I see them, but instead, I am the one that gets falsely accused by the program. This is unfair not just to me but the whole community as well. People who do not use illegal programs, such as myself, getting banned while the real ones stay botting or w.e., this is to be not treaded lightly.     Their customer service is not implemented well, when asked to provide information on why I was banned, all I got was ""I understand that this is very upsetting, but any evidence obtained by Nexon is proprietary and we will not be able to release that information."" and they would change the subject towards abiding the Terms of Services before playing the game. These gamemasters would keep saying that they had checked their evidence and would pass judgement on me by banning me but when they are asked to provide the evidence, they would avoid it (I believe they randomly ban people, that is why they do not hand out proof on why people get banned). Every response mentioned insisted that I should have read the Terms of Services and that I should commit to the agreement before I play. As to my knowledge, I have never broken any of those rules, I have gone through the list that they gave me multiple times and still unable to acknowledge the ban because I have never broke any of thoe terms and conducts they have provided. In addition, my time and effort put into leveling up my characters as fast as possible is labeled as leveling exploit (I was leveling so fast because I was strong and using the 1.5x/2x they gave us and the buffs that came with the event). I basically got banned for leveling up too fast, and when I tried to appeal, they ignored my requests and gave me no proof; I bet they did not want to admit that they banned the wrong person. In conclusion, I realized that they do not give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥about what we have to say. If these Gamemasters were judges, I am pretty sure they would pass the wrong judgements upon people such as letting the bad ones stay in society; meanwhile, caging the good ones in jail.If you are looking into this game, keep in mind that you have no voice in what-so-ever.

												Now i'm gonna keep these real brief. If you are into cute graphics/sprites with feel attracted to this game. I know i was when i was like 11, still am though. Mainly because i like the ""ANNNNNNNNNNNIME"" feel that it's got going for it, and alright, cute looking things beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of other cute things, why not? Beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of things is really satisfing to me.I've grown up with beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of things. Final fight, Streets of rage, King of dragons, hell even Sonic blast man II. So yeah, i really enjoyed this game and was a ""MIGHTY WARRIOR OF ANIME""I got around my 2nd job advancment and then, my eleven year old mind noticed something. ""HOLY FRICK I SPENT TWO WEEKS TRYING TO GET THIS"" and then i stopped playing for four years and got back into it with a new account because the eleven year old me was like ""FRICKING LONG PASSWORDS MWHAHAHAHAHA""Anyway the now fifteen year old me blasted to level 45 in one day and he was like ""Excuse me? b...but why? Last time i played this i CRIED BLOOD to get my 2nd job advancment. Now i can get to this high within one day? Jesus this game is so.....FUN"" And then i lost about a months worth of my life playing nothing of maplestory and then mysterously quitting it again.now we come to the present. ""WHOA, NEW MAPS?! NEW CLASSES?! EXLUSIVE SINGLE CLASSES?! WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?!""I mean no disrespect to the new classes at all, i was just tooken aback when i first saw them. It was like the eleven year old me just took control a flipped the hell out.Even though i keep coming back to this game....I....I can't recommend it to others, no matter how hard i try too. Yeah the games charming but beyond that the game is riddled with problems.

												I can't give any bad feedback about gameplay BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME! And I'm not the only one! My friend had downloaded MapleStory recently too (as in we both downloaded it less than half a month ago) and she gets the same error message as I do when we try to log in.""It appears that this version of MapleStory is outdated and cannot be patched to the current version. Your game client needs to be updated to login to the game. Please vist maplestory.nexon.net and download the latest game client.""Then when I click next, it links me to http://maplestory.nexon.net/WZ.ASPX?PART=/Downloads/GamePatches and it mearly says ""The web page you are looking for cannot be found. If you feel you have reached this page in error, please contact technical support."" I really shouldn't have to contact support just to download the right version of the game and it's obviously not the system I'm using that's causing errors because I just recieved my Dell Inspiron M531R-5535 for christmas and my friend's laptop is at least 2 or 3 years old!

												Don't play this game, seriously. I've only played 9 hours on steam, but I've been playing this epic piece of crap for 10 years now. This game will suck all your time, money, hopes and dreams away and leave you empty. The company doesn't care about this game anymore, they haven't for some years and all its content is money grabbing, trying to extract every last cent off people as they can before the game goes under. Every single thing that once made this game amazing is now gone.I'm warning you, this game is the lowest of the low, it's is the cesspit of mmos.The community is full of hackers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.This game was a precious gem and now it's like a dirty, slimy, freshly pooped turd.

You're pretty much required to spend at least $100 to be successful at the endgame level, and you'll spend hundreds more if you want to get there without carpal tunnel syndrome or an anyeursm. Steam only has 17 hours recorded for me but I've thrown at least 1,000 hours into this mess over the past 7 years, ever since GMS first came out. Play it if you want to test the waters, but unless you're the sort with a lot of disposable income, you will not enjoy this one bit.			"

												First of all, many people who played in this game's early years are unhappy with the game because of the exp curve after the Big Bang patch. Nexon America made reaching the higher lvls a bit easier rather than grinding for weeks to only reach level 30 (Level cap is now 250.) As a person who played in the early years and currently, I honestly understand that they're upset about it, but those people need to get over it. They give the game negative reviews because they don't like change. With that being said, here is my review.A lot of reviews claim the game is Pay to win which is true to an extent however there only thing that makes the game Pay to Win is the cubing feature from the Cash Shop. For those who dont know what cubing is, it's a way to reset the stats on your equip's potential (Bonus stats) which cost 1.2k nx or $1.20 each for red cubes. However, There are cubes that don't cost any money, but drop from boss monsters or can even be crafted in game.Other people complain thats the game is pay to win because aesthetics (NX equip covers) have to be bought with real money. Most games sell aesthetics for real money (League of Legends Skins, H1Z1 clothes, CS:GO gun/knife skins) which people pay for so that isn't even an issue.While yes, Maplestory is a game that can be made easier for you by spending money, if you put in the time and effort to fund your character in game by bossing, farming, and utilizing the Free Market in game, you can easily enjoy the game without spending money. The only reason people complain is because they're impatient, and is that really the game's fault?With over 30 characters to try and many different bosses to fight, Maplestory is much more promising than these reviews lead you to believe. If you don't plan to spend a lot of money on the game to fund your character, I would suggest trying characters like Demon Avenger, Aran, or Zero (Must have a level 100 character to create, but worth it.) These classes have high base damage on skills and don't require nearly as much funding to do high damage on monsters/bosses compared to other classes. They're great for first starting out in the game! You could also play support classes like Kanna, (3rd job has a skill to increase spawn rate) Bishop, (3rd Job has +Exp Buff)  or Beast Tamer (Exp Buff in Cat Mode.) These classes are always wanted in training parties, especially high level training because of the support skills that they  provide. For help with training, bossing, or even game knowledge, make friends and join a guild! There are hundreds of guilds in each server, you just have to find the right one for you! Also check out the Maplestory reddit and Twitch.tv streams for even more help!			"

												For the love of God, download this from the website. From myself and multiple threads on the discussion, 9 times out of 10 the game WILL NOT play from Steam due to a colorful assortment of problems. For me, each time I tried to start the game it worked up until I tried to connect to a channel. Then it repeatedly asked me if I had trouble logging in, preventing me from playing. It will always let me play from the website, and the game is easily on my top ten, so I would definitely reccomend it for people who don't mind having to go to the website each time you want to play.

												Maple story is a gamew here you play non stop pretty much. ( I did 2 all nighters on this game and trained the heck out of my angelic buster ). It has the concept to train 24/7 to get that max level. Most character you might have to fund but overral it's fun. I played during when there was only 2 classes beginner and cygnus knights at the make a character screen and it was amazing. My older brother played it so I thought of playing it and it get me amazed, I didn't really know what to do because I was kinda young at that time lol, but I stopped played over 5 years and cameb ack to 2012 or 2013? I became a Phantom and didn't even know what was happening, everything was different. For people who are new, I recommend you picking a mage. That's the end of the review.

												I remember back in the day when Maplestory only had four classes: the Magician,Warrior,Thief,and Archer. The game was very social and leveling was very hard. It was considered an achievement to reach your 3rd job. I kept playing until the Big Bang patch, which made leveling so much easier. Reaching the 3rd job and 4th job was easy and not an achievenent since everyone could do it. I kept playing after the Big Bang for maybe a month or two after i reached 4th job and quit.After returning to the game, it has lost it's social aspect and there are so many classes it gets confusing. There are jobs for your characters, crafting, and overall un-needed features that just confuse the player. These days, the game is just a grind and level game. Although the game before may also be considered a grind and level game there were social aspects that made the game actually fun to play. Not just playing to level and get better gear, but a game where you played to have fun with friends and leveling and gear was a bonus.IN THE END:  The game is just about grinding to level whereas before the game was played to have fun with friends and leveling and gear was a bonus.I really wish i could recommend this game, but the game is just not what it used to be.

												I have played Maplestory for so long when I was younger and recently i played it again. I like the game because of the teamwork that is needed but recently it seems that you can solo a lot of the things in this game. Although it is still majorly fun to level characters it just isnt the same anymore for any of you old time players who are looking to coming back to the game. Another thing about the game is that although it is free buying NX is a major part in regards to why so many people can solo bosses and dominate in the economy when they re-sell an item.			"

												Loved this game before they screwed it up with whatever FarmVille Clone they decided to add to it. I really think they should have made better decisions. and more testing. The Customer Support is one of the Worst Customer Support Services ever, No joke. and in all these years ive been playing this i'm still level 30-50.Great Game but It lost its fun, Just like gaiaonline, lost its fun...

												I have played Maplestory for so long when I was younger and recently i played it again. I like the game because of the teamwork that is needed but recently it seems that you can solo a lot of the things in this game. Although it is still majorly fun to level characters it just isnt the same anymore for any of you old time players who are looking to coming back to the game. Another thing about the game is that although it is free buying NX is a major part in regards to why so many people can solo bosses and dominate in the economy when they re-sell an item.			"

												It is a great game, considering that it has lots of stuff to happen, and lots of things to do. The   First video on the store page pretty much explains it all. For the first 70 levels its boring, but as you keep leveling up and becoming more powerful, there are more possiblities and more bosses to fight. I can relate to TF2 in a way that this game has customization, but people mostly care about chairs. The chair design and ideas are great, and also the game it self is great. Worlds to explore, Monsters and Bosses to fight, Endless possiblities. Maybe you can challenge your self into using this crappy weapon against a powerful boss. I would recommand this to anyone who likes adventure games, customization, and of course, killing monsters. Have Fun ;)			"

												I remember back in the day when Maplestory only had four classes: the Magician,Warrior,Thief,and Archer. The game was very social and leveling was very hard. It was considered an achievement to reach your 3rd job. I kept playing until the Big Bang patch, which made leveling so much easier. Reaching the 3rd job and 4th job was easy and not an achievenent since everyone could do it. I kept playing after the Big Bang for maybe a month or two after i reached 4th job and quit.After returning to the game, it has lost it's social aspect and there are so many classes it gets confusing. There are jobs for your characters, crafting, and overall un-needed features that just confuse the player. These days, the game is just a grind and level game. Although the game before may also be considered a grind and level game there were social aspects that made the game actually fun to play. Not just playing to level and get better gear, but a game where you played to have fun with friends and leveling and gear was a bonus.IN THE END:  The game is just about grinding to level whereas before the game was played to have fun with friends and leveling and gear was a bonus.I really wish i could recommend this game, but the game is just not what it used to be.

												Maple story is a gamew here you play non stop pretty much. ( I did 2 all nighters on this game and trained the heck out of my angelic buster ). It has the concept to train 24/7 to get that max level. Most character you might have to fund but overral it's fun. I played during when there was only 2 classes beginner and cygnus knights at the make a character screen and it was amazing. My older brother played it so I thought of playing it and it get me amazed, I didn't really know what to do because I was kinda young at that time lol, but I stopped played over 5 years and cameb ack to 2012 or 2013? I became a Phantom and didn't even know what was happening, everything was different. For people who are new, I recommend you picking a mage. That's the end of the review. Also you mighth ave troubles with the cilent so. Yeah.			"

												First of all, many people who played in this game's early years are unhappy with the game because of the exp curve after the Big Bang patch. Nexon America made reaching the higher lvls a bit easier rather than grinding for weeks to only reach level 30 (Level cap is now 250.) As a person who played in the early years and currently, I honestly understand that they're upset about it, but those people need to get over it. They give the game negative reviews because they don't like change. With that being said, here is my review.A lot of reviews claim the game is Pay to win which is true to an extent however there only thing that makes the game Pay to Win is the cubing feature from the Cash Shop. For those who dont know what cubing is, it's a way to reset the stats on your equip's potential (Bonus stats) which cost 1.2k nx or $1.20 each for red cubes. However, There are cubes that don't cost any money, but drop from boss monsters or can even be crafted in game.Other people complain thats the game is pay to win because aesthetics (NX equip covers) have to be bought with real money. Most games sell aesthetics for real money (League of Legends Skins, H1Z1 clothes, CS:GO gun/knife skins) which people pay for so that isn't even an issue.While yes, Maplestory is a game that can be made easier for you by spending money, if you put in the time and effort to fund your character in game by bossing, farming, and utilizing the Free Market in game, you can easily enjoy the game without spending money. The only reason people complain is because they're impatient, and is that really the game's fault?With over 30 characters to try and many different bosses to fight, Maplestory is much more promising than these reviews lead you to believe. If you don't plan to spend a lot of money on the game to fund your character, I would suggest trying characters like Demon Avenger, Aran, or Zero (Must have a level 100 character to create, but worth it.) These classes have high base damage on skills and don't require nearly as much funding to do high damage on monsters/bosses compared to other classes. They're great for first starting out in the game! You could also play support classes like Kanna, (3rd job has a skill to increase spawn rate) Bishop, (3rd Job has +Exp Buff)  or Beast Tamer (Exp Buff in Cat Mode.) These classes are always wanted in training parties, especially high level training because of the support skills that they  provide. For help with training, bossing, or even game knowledge, make friends and join a guild! There are hundreds of guilds in each server, you just have to find the right one for you! Also check out the Maplestory reddit and Twitch.tv streams for even more help!			"

												Maplestory is a 12 year old 2D MMORPG that holds a dear place in my heart. To put it in simple terms it plays like a platformer with all the classic RPG archetypes like Warrior, Priest and Rouge and some unique classes such as the melee Battle Mage and the spell-stealing Phantom.PROS------------ Tons of classes, plenty of variety- Never a shortage of quests and events- Still upated frequently after 12 years!- Unique artstyle and gameplay that no other game hasCONS------------ The Cash Shop. It's okay to offer cosmetics for a price but they also sell things that enhance your equipment that could only be bought with real money. As the late game becomes more about your gear, this presents problems. - Quests doesn't reward enough XP or gear compared to party quests and plain grinding. Leaves a lot of content untouched.- Some classes are rarely played (looking at you Jett and Marksman)All in all its a decent game that should be given a try. I played it with my friend for years and we keep coming back for some reason. Please send help.			"

												Been playing for 7 years, and to be honest I enjoyed it up to a few days ago. For an entire week the game has been completly broken to the point where 1/3-1/2 of the playerbase can't even load. No actual fix has been released, and no anouncement by developers. Tech support and customer support don't help either. They've just ignored us and ran away with our money. To add salt to the wound they also had a double xp event when no one could log in. I've given up on this game and you shouldn't waste your time on it.Edit:Well It's been about 5 months, and maplestory is up an running. They updated some of the UI, as well as changing a lot of the mechanics. The game is a lot easier to get into now, but harder after about lv 200. I enjoy the game, however i'd recommend downloading the nexon version instead of steam. Due to a few bugs it's had since launch.			"

												This game went downhill since big bang update.- Too many new jobs which aren't unique.- Leveling has become a joke. Too fast for low levels and most level 250 players have botted.- Most bosses aren't rewarding, and ones that are, you need to 'pay2win'.- Speaking of pay2win, player's damage is strongly dependent on money spent for this game. Could be over a thousand bucks to ""win"" which is ridiculous.- People are more independent with bosses, no longer requires teamwork.- Most limited-time events are dull, only asking you to kill/collect.- Their customer support is slow and unhelpful.I know I did not list positives for this game but they are points for my decision which I DON'T recommend Maplestory. Even it's not recommended for old-time players because the game's nostalgia is completely gone. If anyone still wanted to try out this game, play at your own risk. Think of long-term commitment and see why this game is terrible.			"

												Maplestory...I've been playing this game for years with my friend...on and off.We will play and totally be loving it and devote our lives to it by getting no sleep and permantley damaging our brain cells.And it's worth it.But then we get bored with it and move on to another game.Then decide we miss it and go back to doing the same thing.It's been a cycle for years.But overall I do very much enjoy this game, shure it can be much better, like the more ability to customize your character without having to pay money. But that's how games work.If you love chibi looking things and mmorpgs, this is the game for you.			"

												I've now played Reboot for a good 2 months and I can asy it's alot better. Pets are still of course basically necessary however the amount you'd have to spend as in absolutely have to is pretty low. Hackers are kinda rapmant right now and there is some issue with nexon nerfing a class skill and coming out with the same exact thing as a p2w option costing on average $150 (not avialable at ALL on reboot), this severely hurts people joining when I did. I can't get even half the mesos per minute that people at my DPS could get pre-kish nerf, that said they are supposedly 'buffing it' now.The newer classes are quite fun, 5th job is coming by end of year or so and also seems 'okay', it's mainly just Hyper skills 2.0 though it feels.ORIGINAL REVIEW PRE-REBOOT PLAYING : This was arguably the best MMO I played when it came out in 2003~ and stayed that way until it got super P2W. That said reboot seems like it should fix that issue and I intend to try it out to see if it's everything I've missed.			"

												this game is actually pretty much grindfest and it's pretty relaxing. Play reboot servers, gamble for free with cubes and feel your damage(numbers) growing fast. Almost infinite end-game so you don't need to worry about ""fulfilling"" the game, because as soon as you start to think you are getting to its end, nexon just provide you a new game update.really good and relaxing OST in almost every map made by NEXON KOREA(such as arcane river maps, ereve, classical maps), so bad almost every map from japanese maplestory really sucks in OST.Okay, as a REBOOT world player, here are the pros and cons:PROS:- REAL FREE-TO-WIN ASPECT: You don't need spent a cent, and indeed you CAN'T spend a single dollar in order to get better or increase your damage in the game(reboot server)- Cute characters:you can really turn into a very cute chibi anime girl in this game even tho you may look like a normal man irl, rofl.- Great community:way easier to make friends in maple than in IRL, and most people there always help themselves with bosses and stuff. All guilds are active!- A really lot of events:You might not get bored while grinding, because almost 100% of time maplestory will bring you some collecting items event or so.- big amount of classes:the game is so bing rn you have so many options to decide your ""path"" in the game, really worth it to look into every single class and make your own opinion on it.- Never-ending end-game:as soon as you get close to finishing the game, nexon will bring something new. and IF you ever get 42093840923904290340923904 damage and lv250, you will always have something new to do, in fact.- Grinding is RELAXING:Please don't take it as a bad thing, really. go to your guild's discord or with your friends, and chill out.CONS:- Staff seems to really suck:PLEASE, don't ever need to rely on them. Most likely they won't solve your problem quickly, except if it's NX related or to unlink your steam account or so.- JMS maps has really bad OST:just like masteria ones, gollux, and every other non-KMS map(most of them).- Not a good game for non-grindy peopleYeah dude, you will grind a lot here, but I personally think it's funny when doing with friends.- Outside REBOOT server it's UNPLAYABLE.No wonder reboot is the most crowded server, scania and all others are just paytowin♥♥♥♥♥♥~~End of review <3			"

												I played this game when it first came out and have seen it go downhill. The more this game gets updated the worse it gets. Many of the highest ranked players have hacked or are continously hacking to reach the top leaderboards. To be able to fight the powerful bosses to get the best items you must pay REAL MONEY and spend it on cubes that give a small percent chance to change your crappy item into something amazing... something like .01%. This game is PAY FOR FUN when you reach higher levels. You will end up paying real money on 3'rd party websites where an employee or owner will log in and give you the ingame money that they have hacked for. Reaching high levels and getting decent items for bossing will require a MASSIVE amount of time, or a MASSIVE amount of real life money, or you just pay a 3'rd party website that hacks for the items to come into the game and give you what you paid for. This game is going downhill each year and loses players each year. The few that are left are die hard fans who spend thousands of dollars weekly to legitametly get good items. Overall this game is a 2/10 since at higher levels you are almost forced to use 3'rd party illegal websites. As they end up being cheaper than spending your real life money in the actual game!!!			"

												This game contains a lot of memory of my childhood, I've played it since the very start, when the game has only 4 classes and the installation size was only 300mb...I followed thru a lot of expansions and witness the changes done to maple world, and it's kinda like witness how the game start to get disappointing bits by bits. Especially after big bang expansion I would say...   -class balance, I don't think this word exists in maplestory dev's dictionary...   -party quests, especially the low level ones, it was a lot of fun to do them with others, but now those process can be all skipped as leveling up is so easy, say, who still remember the meaning of 133221333123111 o.O   -npc quests, there are a lot of side quests, but they can be all ignored because you can easily level up by killing monsters to 100+, no more excitement finishing quest and receive reward at all during my leveling process   -transportation, all those fun while travelling with others in between Victoria Island-Orbis-Ludibrium are gone, they're still there, but forgotten, now where ever I wanna go to I will always take the portal to bypass those transportation   -profession skills& new equipment upgrade method, I really think this is just trying annoy players who really wants to enjoy the gameplay, and making those who want to be good in this game spend more time and money, where most of us just simply wanna play to relax, but we end up getting annoyed a lot...   -game takes forever to load and crashes quiet frequently, idk, the game is out for so long, and every update is making the loading time extend, and crashing chance to increase...I'm gonna stop there because I'm afraid that if I keep stating more then I will see the sunrise very soon...After all I would not recommend people to come in and play maplestory, It was an amazing game with enjoyable gameplay, but unfortunately, not anymore.

												Well, I wanted to play it. But whenever I open it, I cannot select a world. It eventually just closes and says I've been disconnected, and to try again later. The game would be great to play, since I use to play it for years (2004-2009). But recently I cannot even get into the game world. I do not know if its my PC (which is built for gaming), or the fact that I am running Windows 8.1.I would only reccomend this game to those who can run it. It use to be an amazing game. I cannot give a good review on whether or not it is still a good game, because I cannot even play it. I have tried ten times, and only once got into the world (only for it to disconnect me after ten minutes). I believe this is due to my Windows version. So don't get your hopes up if you have Windows 8.1, but if you can run it, enjoy it.			"

												I've been playing Maplestory on and off since late 2005. Don't let the negative reviews dissuade you from playing it, this game is a one-of-a-kind gem, and is worth your time to play. While the games' direction changed from a social grindfest into an more of a side-scrolling-action platformer, it still gets the same love and dedication from the devs that it did back in 2005. If the constant stream of huge updates doesn't convince you, then I don't know what will.Nothing, and I mean *nothing* plays like Maplestory. You won't ever see another MMO which plays like it, and that's too bad; I'd totally love if more of this showed up in the MMO category			"

												Ive been playing this game since the first two years it came out. It has improved by leaps and bounds since then, and I kepe coming back after brief hiatuses. Without a doubt, if you're into Asian RPGs, this game can be a powerful addiction for you...Pros:-Visually appealing for an Asian RPG-Decent community, and sizable population even after years of existing-F2PCons:-Very grindy. Lots of farming, though its amount is constantly being lowered.-can be very much P2W in the endgameEven though I have a hate/love relationship with this game, I would still recommend it in the end. At the very least, try it out and play through the base content, without commiting yourself to all the sidequests, endgames, etc. just to feel out the overall game.Speaking from a perspective that has been here for more about a decade (at the time of writing this, starting from 2006 until today Nov 25 2016), this game never ceases to surprise me with all the improvements it gives the players... although I say that because MapleStory had needed many changes to get where it is today.

												I don't like the game anymore because it gives me no sense of accomplishment.

Taking time to get to high levels drove my sense of accomplishment, it also drove the sense of community I loved so much.The community is one of the worst parts.

												MapleStory is one of those games that has become a dominant force in the realm of MMORPGs. Its simple gameplay, endearing graphics, and huge game area draw people into the game. It however, has gotten a rather negative reputation; one, for the playerbase which can range from friendly and helpful to mean-spirited and childish, but truth be told that is the problem with most MMOs today. The other reason for its bad rep is Nexon, the publishers of the game, who turned the game into a cashgrab, with bonuses given to players who pay for items in the game.First, some background. I played MapleStory starting around 2006 (when the game was published by Wizet - the developers - themselves) and stopped some time in 2007 (around when the Mu Lung area was introduced). To say there was a large change in between then and now is an understatement. Back then, the grind was unbearable - normal playing would see me level in the 30s one level per week. Nowadays, the levelling is made much easier, and reaching level 60 in 2 weeks is not unheard of. On top of that, money and item drops are much more abundant, making character maintenance much easier. Victoria Island was also changed, though honestly for worse; instead of the ring system of cities with Sleepywood in the center, every city branches from the Six Path Crossway in the center of Victoria. For some this is more logical, but I miss the old system. Oh well. Anyway, onwards to the game of today.The graphics; they are simple and yet quite charming. The game is a sidescrolling platformer, though it doesn't look like your stereotypical indie sidescroller coming out today. One can tell Wizet put a lot of effort into the creation of the areas, and the detail that is in the game is impressive. I can't think of any other sidescroller that comes close in terms of its detail; Elsword comes close, but that is a 3D game and while I do think the graphics are good in that game I do think MapleStory does get the edge here, probably because it was the first game of the two (to my knowledge), and on top of that Maple seems more diverse. The graphics - ranging from the backdrops to the maps to the monsters themselves definitely give a sense of whimsy not found in other games. It is retro done right, and here the game is not even trying to be retro. Production quality of this game is incredibly high. The music is just excellent, and certainly aids to the atmosphere of the areas that each song plays in. The music is quite listenable on its own as well, and it is quite diverse, ranging from earworms such as the Henesys town music and the Aquarium town music to more ""epic"" (I hate that word) soundtracks such as the music for New Leaf City. Wizet certainly put a lot of thought into the music, and into the sounds in general. They aren't harsh, and the monsters sound like what they would sound like. The user interface is quite friendly and intuitive. It is clean and unobtrusive, and for me sets a standard for what a UI should look like. Easy to read, easy to follow, easy to use. Onto gameplay. First, the controls; they are simple. One does not have to aim if his/her character is a bowman, one does not have to worry about blocking or defending, one does not have to think about other facets of playing in this game because they are not there. After all, one has a normal attack and skills, and with the arrival of the Aran class did combos start becoming somewhat important (truth be told, I have no experience with Aran, so I cannot comment on the combo system much). However, where it works is in execution. The controls are fluid and the character is responsive to the player's input. There's not much clunkiness with the game, and where there is some it can easily be overcome by learning the character one has chosen. The second part of gameplay would be, well, the overall game. I will say this; the game does get dull after a while since it is very repetitive. Part of this is the fault of some quests, which have the player killing a large amount of monsters, or picking up a certain amount of a particular item from a monster (which might not drop said item right away) to both. It wears on you, and many times I wish the amount of monsters killed was lower. There's nothing difficult about killing them anyway when you're at or around the monster's level. It's tedious and arbitrary, and detracts from what makes the game good in the first place; the simple intuitive controls and no nonsense quests. I do wish there were more puzzle quests or quests that involve the storyline (that don't amount to kill X of Y monster) rather than the fetch quests Maple has now. Sure, there are jump quests, but those are incredibly obnoxious and are more infuriating than rewarding. There are some bright spots though; the game surprisingly has a decent storyline (it didn't have a storyline back in 2006) and the fetch quests that have lower mob requirements are a breeze. I understand that it might be hard to write quests for the game, since it is a sidescroller, but it could be done. And in the end, it is still a fun game, even with the boring fetch quests; exploring new and uncharted areas is exciting, beating up monsters and boss monsters that are way higher level than you can be rewarding, and the game as a whole has a re-playability factor that I haven't seen in many other games.Now to the more negative things about this game. I discussed the staleness of the gameplay already, but what is more pressing is the cash shop. Every free MMO has a cash shop; it is how the developers and publishers make money off the game. MapleStory though is infamous for its ""pay2win"" aspect. Items that give boosts in EXP rate, drop rate, and more are easily found. Of course, MS isn't the only game to have these, but they are there. There's also the cash shop clothes and pets, which can range from decent to downright obnoxious. That said, this game is Nexon's cash cow, and while I don't plan to put anything into the game, others do.Would I recommend this game? Probably yes; it's now a classic MMO and while it isn't the first or oldest MMO it certainly deserves a mention. And as far as the game itself goes, yes, it is a good game. It though is marred by arbitrary gameplay decisions and repetitive gameplay, but once one looks past that and the cash shop, it's a fun game.			"

Everything in the game is built around getting you to pay to get stronger, pay to trade items and equipment ect. But even paying partially you still might not get that upgrade for your item and will be forced to pay even more to fix the failed upgrade and then try again. At least the friends I have made from this sad game made it worth just that little bit more.			"

												Why you should play maplestory:-If you play MMOs for the story, maplestory has several storylines you can follow, all of which are kinda alright (Like that anime which you kinda wanna watch cus it looks cool but it still looks bad but you do it anyway and its as expected but was a good time.)-Maplestory 2 is coming. Maplestory 2 is technically a prequeal but do you really want to come back to play this game afterwards? Get the old one out of the way.-It was kind of a revolutionary step in time. Being one of the first platforming MMOs it deffinatly has a decent ammount of appeal.-Killing things is some how satisfying despite the combat system.-The minigames are a ton of fun and if you can make friends in game or get your friends to play then its even better.-It defined a point in history that encouraged internet safety as many angsty kids stole from their parents to buy ingame items. THIS IS NOT NEXONS FAULT!!! The parents should have kept a better eye on their cards, the kids shouldnt have stollen, and to be fair they could have used it on anything else online.Why you shouldn't play maplestory:-The community does kinda suck.-Its hard to train on anything but bosses unless you are in a party.-The combat leaves something to be desired.-The cash shop will burn a whole in your wallet. (If you use it.)-Its kinda a waste of time-Good luck getting your friends to play it.Personally I'm just here to get ready for maplestory 2			"

												Maplestory, a game that in it's early days promoted hard earned levels, items, and achievements. This premise of challenging gameplay where you had to grind away many days to earn the most simple goals is what originally attracted me to the game. The feeling of being able to achieve what most wouldn't dare to do, kept me coming back for more. I literally feel like I could write a book on my many years of experience in this game. So I want to keep this review short, and write that book later. From playing beta to now (2015)This game is always changing, and no matter how much hard effort you put into it, a year or so later it will be irrelevant.If you do decide to play this game, please do not spend so much on NX. It's a very hard temptation to ignore, but you will be less depressed in the end. I have spent way more in this game over the years, I literally could have bought a second vehicle, brand new. Not only just in money, but time. So my advice, play this with some friends, have a good time, and don't worry about having the most 'elite' items, because that only makes you fall into a money trap that you will regret in life later.

												Maple Story can be an amazing game if you have extremely large sums of money you do not mind lighting on fire. Everything in the game is built around getting you to pay to get stronger, pay to trade items and equipment ect. But even paying partially you still might not get that upgrade for your item and will be forced to pay even more to fix the failed upgrade and then try again. At least the friends I have made from this sad game made it worth just that little bit more.			"

												Why you should play maplestory:-If you play MMOs for the story, maplestory has several storylines you can follow, all of which are kinda alright (Like that anime which you kinda wanna watch cus it looks cool but it still looks bad but you do it anyway and its as expected but was a good time.)-Maplestory 2 is coming. Maplestory 2 is technically a prequeal but do you really want to come back to play this game afterwards? Get the old one out of the way.-It was kind of a revolutionary step in time. Being one of the first platforming MMOs it deffinatly has a decent ammount of appeal.-Killing things is some how satisfying despite the combat system.-The minigames are a ton of fun and if you can make friends in game or get your friends to play then its even better.-It defined a point in history that encouraged internet safety as many angsty kids stole from their parents to buy ingame items. THIS IS NOT NEXONS FAULT!!! The parents should have kept a better eye on their cards, the kids shouldnt have stollen, and to be fair they could have used it on anything else online.Why you shouldn't play maplestory:-The community does kinda suck.-Its hard to train on anything but bosses unless you are in a party.-The combat leaves something to be desired.-The cash shop will burn a whole in your wallet. (If you use it.)-Its kinda a waste of time-Good luck getting your friends to play it.Personally I'm just here to get ready for maplestory 2			"

												MapleStory has always been a fun social game, with the added bonus that it was incredibly fun to grind on.I originally stopped playing due to the rampant botting, hacking, and pay-to-win allowed by Nexon.I recently began to play again because Nexon launched a new server, Reboot. Here, there is no pay-to-win but there's still many botters. The botters never bothered me since I always did my own thing -- that's the point of Reboot, you do you.I recommend anybody to play, even if just a bit.			"

The game's improved over the years... But it's still the same Maplestory Grind past level 120. Still heavily cashed shop influenced and the only PERMANENT Cosmetics are those once a week deals, and then you'll never see them again for another year or so.2/10.

												Before I would've recommended this game. But now Maple is 50% pay to play. Plus, everything is made so easy that it's not very fun or replayable anymore... The storylines are similar and getting bland while trying to be dramatic. The classes are all overpowered and are pumped out too fast. The leveling is too easy, the combat is repetitive, the grinding is annoying, the hacking is pointless. I played this game since way before the pirates came out, back when there were only 4 classes (if I had been playing on Steam the whole time, I'd have around 500+ hours). I enjoyed it when I was younger, but now it's not worth much of my gaming time. If you're a really casual gamer and you like simple games with super easy controls and no gaming skill required and a childish community, go for it. I mean the one positive thing it has done over the years is it's gotten cuter so you might enjoy the relaxing, light graphics. But in all other respects, the game has gone downhill in my opinion. Enjoy if you go for it... but you probably won't be enjoying it for too long.			"

												I come back to this game for a month once every year or two and the game looks completely different every single time. Items that were worth something are now worth nothing for the most part. I feel like the community has gotten harsher as time passed but there are still friendly players around. The game is always changing and adding the most random♥♥♥♥♥♥possible so it is hard to keep up. The total players are split among different servers so some are completely dead even after server merges. Last time I played this game, the game was so bloated and not optimized that well but I am not sure if thats still the case. I just back from time to time and return to a dead guild and dead friends list, so if you make good friends make sure to stay in touch or you will lose them possibly forever. I wouldn't recommend this game to most people due to the fact that if you don't spend money on the game you will probably never be as good as someone who does. People drop mad money in this game to make their characters look pretty and others drop mad money to reach the highest dps obtainable. They will talk♥♥♥♥♥♥and look down on you if you even drop by their group of friends and say hi. It's like high-school with the cliques. You have the athletes who train non stop and you have the cool crowd.It can be a fun game, though but it gets tempting to drop $5 from time to time			"

												This game has been absolutely terrible, i've been playing this game since the year 2000.  Throughout the years this game has been such a pay to win game. I've been banned on occasions for their terrible auto-kick system. The game progression has stopped in the later stages and forces you to spend money just to reach the ""DPS"" count. I remember specificly when i went to the support and asked about the bug issues, such as Gollux dissappearing platforms for no reason. And that is only one of the MANY MANY glitches/bugs they didn't fix throughout the years. I asked about why Kanna doesnt have a profession and they responded with ""We are working on it"" for all my questions. That is seriously dissapointing.			"

												NOTE: This is a very big ""IF"" recommendation.This game is made by a greedy company that only cares about getting money. Wether the developpers of the game care or not, they are probably forced into decisions that realllly encourage paying.That is, if you actually plan on playing the game efficiently.This game is simple, unless you're going into high level end game raids with people, that is the only time I can think where this game gets complexe and requires actual planning.Until then, most of the game is litteraly just pressing a single OP power button and watching a screen full of enemies dying with massive numbers showing up on screen?So WHY would I recommend this game?Because somehow, MapleStory makes that sensless room clearing one shotting grinding for days entertaining to watch.Its not complex, its not complicated, pick the weapon with the highest stats, apply all your buff/debuffs, then just spam away with that one attack that fills the whole screen with pretty explosions and lights and make you feel somehow like you're REALLY powerful, way over the top, and just sit back and enjoy the fireworks.That's really all you do, and when you reach the job advancements, you suddenly get even cooler looking and prettier powers to enjoy.And now they have a 5th job advancements with even BIGGER and PRETTIER attacks to use.Their are so many choices, all the classes, all the different job advancements, just choose what looks the coolest to you, find the nearest NPC that tells you where to go to kill 100 enemies or collect 100 items of one type, go there, and just watch and have fun seeing massive numbers pop up.But if none of that sounds fun, if you're looking for a well polished, super complex RPG, you wont like this game for the first 100 levels or more.I've heard that the end game raids can be tough and require a planned out raid party, no idea if its true, I never got that far. But the time it takes to reach that level isn't as bad as it looks since this game loves its level up events where you get like 3 levels per level up, slicing the time it takes to 1/3 of the ammount. Either way, it still takes a bit though.And in the end, the game still isn't as complex as some other MMORPG, I'm not an expert but I've heard better from other MMORPG games, so look elsewhere for super in depth and interesting MMORPG games. But if you're looking for some time to kill, to just sit back and watch things die as you watch some stream or youtube video or you're just waiting for something to be done, this game does a surprisingly good job, for free. All the in game purchases are usually for people who want to level faster or who want to get end game stuff quicker or reaaaallly max out their characters but, if you're just trying to kill time, this game does an amazing job at entertaining you for a few hours before you move on with your life.I'll never take this game seriously, but if I'm ever bored and got nothing to do, this game is always one of my go to picks for killing time and simply having a casual fun time with the game.Once again, no idea exactly how complex this game gets at the higher levels, I'm sure it does get ""better"" later on as any hardcore maplestory player might say. But until you get to that point, it all depends on how much you enjoy watching hundred of enemies fall to that massive screen filling energy blast you just used.			"

												Fun and cute game hindered by a big pay wall.  For instance, not many items are permanent which means if I take a break from the game, the cute items I bought are gone when I come back.  =c  I would recommend if you have the cash to spend otherwise it will be a very slow process to reach end game.  May be faster with events but I do not have time to log on at the right time.  Suffice to say, if you make it a priority in your life, it is doable.  Have fun and enjoy at whatever pace you play at.			"

												Where do I start here.. Man, this game is pretty.. lame honestly. The game itself is fine, but how it runs is atrocious. It has issues with certain headsets, keyboards, etc. Still hasn't been fixed.. and I've seen stuff about it since 2010.Overall, the game just would freeze every 4-5 seconds for about half a second for me, even without the set headset plugged in, and I couldn't figure out why. I've tried playing without any usb's plugged in, still nothing. I've tried messing with about everything on the game and still freezes every 5-ish seconds. For whatever reason the devs still have not fixed the issues with the game when you use those headsets/keyboards/mice after several years so I cannot suggest this game. Like, 6 years and you still don't solve an issue like that? lmao... My issue with the game doesn't seem to be with the headsets/etc. It just freezes constantly, and honestly its stupid. Well, if I want to play a game I guess I can go to every other game and it would work perfectly fine however this one doesn't. I can't recommend this when there are better 2d/fighter/brawler games out there. Especially when this one has had issues for 6 years not being resolved, then it just not working for me. For whatever reason anyway.			"

												I've played a little over 15 hours of the game. It's a great game under two circumstances: 1) You have a friend/friends to play with. 2) You actually understand how to play the game. Without these two things it gets really boring very fast, too much repetitive grinding for quests with drop rates being odd and sometimes making things last far longer than they should. It's a great game and I'm sure it was lots of fun when the community was bigger but there are just too few people online now and there just isn't enough information told in game. I hardly understood anything about what I was doing even while I was reading guides for it. After 15 hours I got to level 53 out of a max of 250, and the game just isn't entertaining enough for me to get those other 197 levels.			"

They might as well just start you at the maximum level at this point.Honestly, I can't touch this game anymore, and I reccomend looking elsewhere for entertainment.			"

												This game has a long history. For many it was their first MMO ever played. While this game is still somewhat fun it has become considerably a pay-to-win game. With the introduction of item stat %'s Nexon introduced a Cash Shop item you can purchase with real money called a Miracle Cube. Cubes allow for the reset of item potentials and to even raise the potential to a much higher percentage at a random chance. If you want to deal a massive amount of damage and be an unstoppable boss slaying machine. Chances are you'll have to buy mesos, the in-game currency, or cubes to boost your weapons and armor.			"

												This game, Maple Story, is truely a magnificent diamond. I first played Maple Story when the era ""Big Bang"" was on, at the time the game was at it's prime state. I don't know how long ago that was, maybe 6+ years ago.The game is not as good as it was before. I'm not going to butter this, the game right now is really terrible compared to what it was before. I detest it, and so do most other players that also played during ""Big Bang."" Nevertheless, I and many other people play the game because of nostalgia and big digits. I remember I met my first love and lost my virginity in Maple Story, which is why I love the game.  If I had the option to go back in time and tell my past self something related to Maple Story, it would be ""Kid, this game is going to destroy your life, but you will also reach enlightment and become happy."" Overall, I still crawl back to play this horrible game, reminds me of the good days. I personally enjoy it.			"

												I have been playing this game for over six years on and off, way before it was on Steam. I have really seen the game grown over the years, for better and for worse however it seems it has been for the worse. As Nexon releases updates, they have added many new classes that outclass and overpower the originals. These new classes are usually much more flashier and stronger than the orignals, making them more popular. The new classes can often solo bosses, something that use to be impossible and defeating the purpose of teamwork.Through several updates, the game has also become much too easy to level up, unlike how it use to be. Also, Nexon has made the game very pay-to-win like. Often people who have the money to spend on NX have the better equipment in game from the equipment enhancment system. As the game advanced, Nexon has made many changes which altered the game drastically. One of these changes made in game world feel much more smaller than it use to be. Many and almost all of the maps have been compressed into compact versions, making traveling very different than it use to be. The game world use to be much larger and you could get lost in it and still have fun.Finally, Maplestory has been a host to many bugs/hacks/down time. The game has been hacked many times, often causing damage to the econonmy and forcing server rollbacks. Hackers seem to also be quite common, seeing as a hacker(s) posted the login ID's of over 50 thousand players, including myself. The also game has more than a few bugs that can affect gameplay or quests, forcing unexpected maintenances.			"

												This game... I swear. It has so many problems. Crashes and irresponsiveness are common, and everything is hard to find or confusing. Default controls are unfriendly, and remapping them are even more so. Character creation is the worst. The classes seem to have little difference, and often your character will disappear from the selection screen for no reason. Furthermore, names of characters that have disappeared will claim to be taken, as if name creation isn't difficult enough. The passcode required to create, play, and delete characters is very time-consuming, as the keys are randomized, as if the username and password aren't enough.With all these problems combined, I couldn't even get past the tutorial to see the actual game. Do not let its pretty graphics fool you. My rating is 2/10.			"

												As a person who played Maplestory back in...man, back when Ragnarök Online was still alive and kicking, I can say that Maplestory's early levels consists of agonizing grind...at least it used to. Now leveling to 70 is easy; however, anything beyond level 70 is a massive and agonizing grindfest consisting of burning so much money on XP boosting scrolls you'll find that at least 300 USD is needed to actually reach 120+, effort not included. To truly hit endgame requires level 210, and basically everyone at that level has so many cash shop items it's not funny; this is the norm for Maplestory. If you want to consider yourself as 'hitting the cap' in Maplestory, you'll have to spend over 500 USD, probably. Thankfully they got rid of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Jump Quest for whatshisface, the angry golem ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that spaminates your screen with more energy beams than a US player in C&C Generals. Don't even get me started on HP Washing and other cashshop item related tactics to forcibly boost your stats to absurd levels. It's that kind of game.-Update-With the levelbuying option and significant exp gain increases, reaching 120 is pretty much a cakewalk. This is extremely depressing for me, because I had to spend the better part of 2 months to get 3 or so chars to 120, with EXP boosts included. For those of you who did not have to go through this grind, I hate your guts because you all get to take the easy path now. Seriously, bugger off.			"

Lower populated servers have all really nice people. If you want a game where you can just make friends and spend money, well this is it. Has to be my favorite game of all time playing it since i was in first grade and im in tenth now. Sure the game is ""bad"" if you look at it in the way of just you alone playing by yourself, but when you have friends irl that play it, or you met people within the game, it gets a lot more fun, with not just bossing and party quests but also just being social with others. I rate this a yes since i've never not liked it in these 9 years. Its a gr8 b8 for ur money tho. Welp gg to the money i've spent, but all the fun i've had in this game has been priceless and i wouldnt want to take the money i spent back.			"

												NOT WORTH PLAYING ANYMORE.GMS is pretty much dying. Nexon never fixes their bugs and crashes, let alone the server instability. Event rewards are nerfed from time to time. The game content is getting boring as well. Just new bosses with inflating HP (like trillions). Everyone in reboot bascially follows the same route (farming mesos, node stones...). I would say 11 years is far longer than the lifespan of MMORPG. It's time to stop nostalgia and move on to some new and creative games.			"

												If you do get this game, be prepared for: an elitist and toxic community who won't help players, use gazillions of dollars to buy cubes (items that change your equipment potential to great stats) to be actually noticed by someone, to farm the same spot over and over again in gaps of levels and to read megaphones with stupid people showing off their stuff bought out from their parents money.Don't get me wrong. the game itself its great and it has great potential, I had a blast playing it years ago and coming back from time to time but its players who are looking down on everyone just because they got lucky with a cube, because they're on a certain guild, or because they're friends with someone who is ""famous"" really bothers the hell out of you.The thing I like the most about this game are bosses, but they are ruined because you can either solo them if you're overpowered, or not do them at all because no one will like to carry/help you.This is a game for fun. Not a game to get serious.Unless you do have gazillions of dollars and want to throw them all away at buying cubes or selling in-game currency to buy overpowered weapons.			"

												This game... I swear. It has so many problems. Crashes and irresponsiveness are common, and everything is hard to find or confusing. Default controls are unfriendly, and remapping them are even more so. Character creation is the worst. The classes seem to have little difference, and often your character will disappear from the selection screen for no reason. Furthermore, names of characters that have disappeared will claim to be taken, as if name creation isn't difficult enough. The passcode required to create, play, and delete characters is very time-consuming, as the keys are randomized, as if the username and password aren't enough.With all these problems combined, I couldn't even get past the tutorial to see the actual game. Do not let its pretty graphics fool you. My rating is 2/10.			"

												As a person who played Maplestory back in...man, back when Ragnarök Online was still alive and kicking, I can say that Maplestory's early levels consists of agonizing grind...at least it used to. Now leveling to 70 is easy; however, anything beyond level 70 is a massive and agonizing grindfest consisting of burning so much money on XP boosting scrolls you'll find that at least 300 USD is needed to actually reach 120+, effort not included. To truly hit endgame requires level 210, and basically everyone at that level has so many cash shop items it's not funny; this is the norm for Maplestory. If you want to consider yourself as 'hitting the cap' in Maplestory, you'll have to spend over 500 USD, probably. Thankfully they got rid of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Jump Quest for whatshisface, the angry golem ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that spaminates your screen with more energy beams than a US player in C&C Generals. Don't even get me started on HP Washing and other cashshop item related tactics to forcibly boost your stats to absurd levels. It's that kind of game.-Update-With the levelbuying option and significant exp gain increases, reaching 120 is pretty much a cakewalk. This is extremely depressing for me, because I had to spend the better part of 2 months to get 3 or so chars to 120, with EXP boosts included. For those of you who did not have to go through this grind, I hate your guts because you all get to take the easy path now. Seriously, bugger off.			"

												This game is a big number generator. This game is good from levels 1-130 afterwards any improvement to your character is based off rng cubes and equipments that drop from bosses that are too hard to kill and equips that have an extremely low drop rate.  The only server worth playing is reboot but progress is slow and grinding takes forever to increase power levels. The community for this game is useless as anything important can be soloed and nothing requires a party as soloing gives much more exp than any quest or party quest. The 5th job is just a glorified hyper skill system that requires hours of grinding to collect arcade nodes and symbols. This game is not worth playing as it is basically legalized gambling to kids and should be illegal as the gambling practices are addicting and subliminal.			"

												When I first made this review, I put no, because I thought the game had no purpose, but now i realise that a game doesnt need a purpose to be fun.Many people know maplestory as that game that was popular a long time ago but then Nexon bought it out and made the game totally pay to winWell that people, is wrong.Maplestory is no longer a pay to win game, I would say it is pay to progress, or pay to get higher level faster. Once you farm yourself to a higher level it gets easy to from millions, as there have been many features added to the game making it easier to get high tier items.Some Examples -- Daily boss runs can net you good experience and you can sell the potions you get which stack up in money over a while.-Commerci runs - if you farm this enough you can end up with items like sweetwater glasses and tattoos, which sell for over 200 mil each.- Easy gollux - this is harder to do, as there are a bunch of annoying prequests, but you can use the coins you get from farming gollux to get pretty good gear that you can sell.-Elite Boss Farmiing- This is something all levels can do but its totally based off luck if you get anything good, if you want to know what this is go check out a guide as it is pretty lengthy to explain.- Taking advantage of events going on - there are always events that are going on that can rack in some major dough, and can boost your damage pretty significantly.Some reasons I personally play maplestory are -- I enjoy the grindiness of the game, Its something I do when I am bored of the other games I am playing and if i play a bit every day it can add up in the long run.- Using twitch.tv, you can find a multitude of streamers to play with which add a totally different aspect of the game. These streamers are very generous with their items and will do a lot of give aways!- I like the look of the game and I love the classes that are available for creation, my personal favorite is night lord!These are just some of the reasons I play the game, and there are lots of people who agree with me. I know there will always be people who disagree but I am okay with that and I dont expect them to play it with me.			"

												If you want to waste your life from 4th grade till the 12th grade, buy this free game. It might seem free on the outside, but once it sucks your soul in you become an NX ♥♥♥♥♥. I don't mean ♥♥♥♥♥, like scantily clad, I mean it like a true ""♥♥♥♥♥."" You'll find yourself covered in skull caps and rockstar t-shirts after stealing your mom's credit card. I have wasted over 9,000 hours of my life on this game. That's roughly 3 weeks for those of you who failed 2nd grade english class. My advice to you is if you're planning on downloading this game, atleast make sure your mom's credit card is securely fastened underneath your hotdog fingers while you cry yourself to sleep upon realizing that you have made the biggest mistake of your life.

												This game randomly crashes every 1-2 hours of play time. Also good luck creating a character, I thought the game was broken at first but it only took 2 minutes for the game to connect to its own servers so i could create a character played for an hour got kicked off.  Gameplay wise its not bad if you enjoy games like the Diablo series, it's an endless grindfest. And for a final note the ""world map"" is the worst thing i've ever seen you can't tell where you are or where you need to go at a first glance and takes minutes of staring at it to find and useful information.

												This game gave me childhood memories and since it is on Steam I can play it whenever I want. MapleStory is a great game for anyone to play, though the controls can be confusing at times (especially if you have not played the game in a long time), I would recommend it. One thing I would kinda like in MapleStory is controller support, other than that, I have no complaints against the game.			"

												The 5 minutes i have on record in this game is a lie, i could first add it to Steam today cause of region block, i have MANY hours of gameplay (i would say around 75000 hours, no lie), closing in on 11 years nowI cannot even start to describe this game... it's been a lifetime i've spend on it! And it just keeps dragging you back to the game as it has no end to it and constantly comes with new content (around each 1-3 months on avarage)Pros:- The community in the game, Europe version was epic!- A game for people who like damage and flashy skills- MMO 2D Supermario, what more do you want?- It's free!Cons:- It's Pay2Win!- The Bugs that never seems to go away that affects gameplay in a bad way (Seems 30 gets fixed, 32 new bugs comes each patch)- Bad communication between Players and Nexon which result in not so great supportIf you want to get far with Endgame, find some friends and team up with them as there is TONS of grinding for Endgame and TONS of farming for coins and items from bosses/events. Solo can get you far, but the hardest bosses like Lotus and Damien... those you won't beat in a VERY long time (even with a VERY strong team unless everyone hit cap damage of 50mill)			"

												When I first made this review, I put no, because I thought the game had no purpose, but now i realise that a game doesnt need a purpose to be fun.Many people know maplestory as that game that was popular a long time ago but then Nexon bought it out and made the game totally pay to winWell that people, is wrong.Maplestory is no longer a pay to win game, I would say it is pay to progress, or pay to get higher level faster. Once you farm yourself to a higher level it gets easy to from millions, as there have been many features added to the game making it easier to get high tier items.Some Examples -- Daily boss runs can net you good experience and you can sell the potions you get which stack up in money over a while.-Commerci runs - if you farm this enough you can end up with items like sweetwater glasses and tattoos, which sell for over 200 mil each.- Easy gollux - this is harder to do, as there are a bunch of annoying prequests, but you can use the coins you get from farming gollux to get pretty good gear that you can sell.-Elite Boss Farmiing- This is something all levels can do but its totally based off luck if you get anything good, if you want to know what this is go check out a guide as it is pretty lengthy to explain.- Taking advantage of events going on - there are always events that are going on that can rack in some major dough, and can boost your damage pretty significantly.Some reasons I personally play maplestory are -- I enjoy the grindiness of the game, Its something I do when I am bored of the other games I am playing and if i play a bit every day it can add up in the long run.- Using twitch.tv, you can find a multitude of streamers to play with which add a totally different aspect of the game. These streamers are very generous with their items and will do a lot of give aways!- I like the look of the game and I love the classes that are available for creation, my personal favorite is night lord!These are just some of the reasons I play the game, and there are lots of people who agree with me. I know there will always be people who disagree but I am okay with that and I dont expect them to play it with me.			"

												This game gave me childhood memories and since it is on Steam I can play it whenever I want. MapleStory is a great game for anyone to play, though the controls can be confusing at times (especially if you have not played the game in a long time), I would recommend it. One thing I would kinda like in MapleStory is controller support, other than that, I have no complaints against the game.			"

												If you want to waste your life from 4th grade till the 12th grade, buy this free game. It might seem free on the outside, but once it sucks your soul in you become an NX ♥♥♥♥♥. I don't mean ♥♥♥♥♥, like scantily clad, I mean it like a true ""♥♥♥♥♥."" You'll find yourself covered in skull caps and rockstar t-shirts after stealing your mom's credit card. I have wasted over 9,000 hours of my life on this game. That's roughly 3 weeks for those of you who failed 2nd grade english class. My advice to you is if you're planning on downloading this game, atleast make sure your mom's credit card is securely fastened underneath your hotdog fingers while you cry yourself to sleep upon realizing that you have made the biggest mistake of your life.

By the same person. And yea. Its a good game. But for real nexon/creator of Maplestory your support needs to be improved... And thats it guys.. Great game but there is no support if you get hacked. And you can indeed get banned for no reason. but over all great game. ""Took me like 8 years to get out of it..""			"

												I have played this game for years (since before big bang) so i have been through the ups and downs. The game isnt pay 2 win it is pay 2 save time. Proof below: You can get basic equips through events etc (basic can be even lvl 120 stuff that normal mobs drop or the zakum equips from easy zakum). Then you can do the gollux boss and commerci quest line to sell gollux shop equips by getting coins from easy mode, and cubic blades from commerci. A shop you can aquire from the maple rewards shop by killing bosses if you can, or doing star planet (easily attainable in a few hours from star planet). Sell your gollux shop equips and cubic blades that you acquiered over a month or so, you will be able to make a few hundred mil or so. Buy your chaos root abyss equips. Buy your reinforced gollux pendant / belt. Commerci will give you your already epic'd face and eye equip. Shoe and glove can be obtained by doing normal root abyss and opening the shoe / glove box with coins to achieve the 100% chance to go up tier per cube.  Badge attained through ghost ship questline, emblem through boss arena, rings through the gollux shop (should have sold 1 out of the 4) and the other ring that drops from bosses, earring through gollux shop, cape can be anything until you can afford tyrant cape. Once you attained all of your equips you can epic pot all of them through epic pot scrolls provided in every single event shop  which we have almost 24/7. Once you epic an item you can cube it from using cubes from bosses (since you can boss somewhat now), or cubes from the reward shop (get points from bossing or star planet). Also i forgot about scrolling which can be done through spell traces (20 crusader coins = 100 traces ~ crusader coins dropped from bosses), or event shop scrolls. Thats it, not pay 2 win, pay 2 save yourself from spending time on all of this.			"

												This game seems fun, but my last computer couldn't play it because I couldn't press play when the game started. On my new computer I tried to run it and I was banned without even getting into the game. Then I downloaded from the actual website and shortly after my computer had a virus that rewrote my computers code and I had to have my computer redone.			"

												Maplestory is a pretty fun game to play if you have friends to play with you. I have mixed feelings about post Big Bang Maplestory. While it made the game much easier and a bit of a grind fest, lots of content had been added that makes the grinding feel fun at times. Since I lasted played I've heard they added some features to encourage group play which is also good. Many people say Maplestory is pay to win and it certainly does help; however, you can still get just as far for free. Overall, I'd say Maplestory is a good game to play if you have friends and some spare time. TL;DR: Play with friends 7.5~8/10, Play without friends 6~6.5/10			"

												Maplestory is a game that i have played for more then three years. Some would call it a very childish MMO, I would say that in some asspects but yet its a very fun game that you can play for hours at a time. With new classes coming out every 3 months its a game that you cant get tired off because there is somthing new to always do. Nexon is a greet company and i think Maplestory is on of there best games.			"

												If you like rude kids, like to hack or cheat and scam people out of stuff possibly the best game for you now i myself don't take part in them things but the game does have really the best detailed character avatars i've seen in any game. You can customize your character with different hair styles and colors different skin colors cool appearance cloths for your character and stuff like that battle against monsters and bosses.The con's of this game is the company who run it they are lazy and cheap give people who exploit the game second chances and are rude to people who spend money on the game its really a shame the old company that run it was alot better then nexon.

												I started playing Maplestory years ago, and my god.. this is a fun game. When I first start playing I pick the old Dawn Warrior as my starter class and I ended up loving it. I put alot of work and money just to make it to 120 and.. I never did. Back then leveling up was much more challenging and I'd say it's alot of fun. Now after I recently played again and create a new Hero class called ""Shade""level up from 10 to 120, I said to myself""What the heck happen to the game?"" I thought I was a pro, but it turned out the game was now just too easy. I even got bored of training and nowadays, trainings is just a labor you want to do.Bosses are now too easy most only required 1 player doing a solo run,not even breaking a sweat.Now it's the amount of money i don't always likes, the poor amount of money after a lv.10 mob dropped is ranged from 8-20 mesos(in-game currency) while a piece of equipment lv.10 cost 1k and you might think thats easy but a lv.50 cost about 55k+.Still,it's not the money I'm complaining, it's the fun I had thats gone.I could have recommended this game but those days are over,the gameplay feels so hollow now.If you play this game anyway, you'll regret it.P.S I know it said I play zero hours,but trust me I play it on the official website.

												It's not worth it! It's most likely the most pay-to-win game you will ever play, and it has even degenerated into a hack-to-win game instead of less because of the decreasing value of even the most essential drops despite of their increasing rarity. Even in-game upgrade items not coming from anything related to its cash shop aren't worth it anymore.Back then, we didn't have a gambling-based upgrade feature called the ""Potential system"" plus it has always taken nothing but your own patience and a single pay-to-win item called the ""Regular Shop Permit"" in which you only had to spend $2 and it's always been taking you far. First of all, the value of most items has deflated whilst the hardest-to-obtain items were not only expensive but also obtainable only from the hardest boss battles (something that only people who spend thousands of dollars in this game will likely not going to achieve). Second of all, the values of most drops were slowly decreasing even further along with an increasing amount of funded players obtaining drops from the hardest bosses, making the $2 Shop Permit even less powerful. Now valuable drops are either rare in-game, or only obtainable from the Cash Shop.Not only the game itself has degenerated into pay-to-win/hack-to-win, but also the vibrant community itself has turned into a more hostile environment where it's no longer an athletic competition, but instead more a mix of a bodybuilding and weightlifting competition with a twist of gambling as its performance-enhancing element. In other words, skill doesn't matter as much as I usually found this game before. Also, even though the game's features were being adjusted to favor the more matured demographic, even 22-year-olds don't act like their age and are harassing in their most serious ways possible, such as starting drama and reporting each other. It's a complete nightmare come home!Also, it is important to note the game's also imbalanced in the aspect where ever since an update called ""Unleashed"", you cannot hit anywhere near maximum damage even if you spend $2500 in this game, and this is more pronounced if you opt for high hits-per-second classes such as Kaiser and Dawn Warrior, or you cannot solo the hardest bosses despite you've spent that much for it. It does do a disservice to even a funded player, unless once in a blue moon you win a jackpot on a casino or something. Just to know how imbalanced the classes are, I spend $700 to fund a Hero (which is a warrior) whilst I could get about the same results by spending nothing on MS but the $2 Permit with less endgame gears or potentials. To make things even worse, they promised fifth job once and they said they'll not going to open fifth job any time soon, and they never did.Now, the only two things that are saving MapleStory are its original 2D gameplay that not even Elsword or WonderKing Online can compete with the original thing, in addition to Nexon's over-the-top events and MapleStory's vibrant community that they always have had. I wonder if this is any longer going to be the case, because I doubt so. I doubt it even more because of the nerfs that happened during the updates named ""Unleashed"" and ""Shining Star"" which made it even harder to gather up merchandise for your Shop Permit without relying on random reward features such as ""Gachapon Tickets"", ""Marvel Machine"", or ""Premium Surprise Style Boxes"", because of the amount of nerfs and HP increases pertaining to Party Quests, training, and boss runs. If they continue to nerf the game even further, you can kiss goodbye to this pastime you've loved too much.As far as I know, this is about one of the few games I ever know where the community is as bad the the game itself. I'm not sure if this is even worth playing anymore. I've played several MMOs and I found even Mabinogi is in a better state. I'm so disappointed with MS that I'm even going to give it a a 1-star rating.			"

An expanded review:This community is cancerous as it gets; don't hang out near henesys at all. Unless of course you're like me and take pleasure from watching 12-14 year olds scream and use leet/tumblr speak constantly, spouting useless trash. Honestly there is sort of alot of content for beginners, but for somebody that has already played this in the past you will notice a huge difference in gameplay. Everything is much easier, to the point that you could probably level a character all the way to about 180 (or somewhere close to that, maybe even past that) without even coming close to dying, there is no strategy, and most classes are pretty much the same besides one or two quirks and some slightly-different looking abilities. Maplestory is simply the type of game that literally takes a step back every update, In 2006 it was a classic 2d sidescrolling action platformer with a bright and quirky style, now it's pretty much a high-maintenence dolled up doppleganger of it's previous self, that being said, you can still find a decent amount of fun in this game, even if it's boring and repetitive.P.S. Some of the music in this game is incredible, particularly Ellinia's or Elluels music, I could listen to it for hours.			"

												Maplestory is a game that i have played for more then three years. Some would call it a very childish MMO, I would say that in some asspects but yet its a very fun game that you can play for hours at a time. With new classes coming out every 3 months its a game that you cant get tired off because there is somthing new to always do. Nexon is a greet company and i think Maplestory is on of there best games.			"

												Some long term players seem to object that this game is good; however, this game is good. I say this with an unbiased view simply because I don't have long term experience affecting what it is now and thus I'm not making that biased comparison. This means I'm giving this review based on the NOW -- reduces review bias/corrupting a review from a nonbiased standpoint.Now that I've said this lets get it started.I started as a Xenon and dove right into the Resistance in which the class begins to take on the persona of it's intended story line. After a few hours of play there seems to be a bigger change that kept making me quit the game in the past. This is the grind is much easier. Now I'm not sure if it's because of the current model or because the Xenon class is quite powerful for an all around class, but it is definitely much more easier to level in the game.If you like Anime and the storyline within Anime then you will quite possibly enjoy the game simply because it has some of that similar style within its dialog -- specifically the Episodes which is a short version of titles like Attack on Titan or Sword Art Online.The only down fall I'd say the game actually has is the navigation system. Now by this I do not mean movement of the character but instead the finding of NPCs for quests that need to be completed is quite hard sometimes. I had to do some google searching to find out where the NPCs for a quest is at so I can complete/begin them. In the end, if you can overlook the fact you level quicker in the game than years ago, and are able to tolerate the fact you may need to do some google searching on where the turn-in NPC is for a quest. Then you're going to enjoy the game so as long you don't dislike sidescroller games, and Anime. If you do dislike, then this game is probably not for you.The graphics are the same as they always were though so no real graphical improvements unless you want to talk effects... Anyways, try the game. If you wonder whether or not the cash shop is expensive or not then I'd like to say it isn't because your money does go pretty far if you spend it wisely. Now, if you don't do cash shop then that is fine because your not really missing anything other than maybe an auto-loot pet and the chance to win some in-game money to give you a good start at earlier levels.

												Maplestory is a pretty fun game to play if you have friends to play with you. I have mixed feelings about post Big Bang Maplestory. While it made the game much easier and a bit of a grind fest, lots of content had been added that makes the grinding feel fun at times. Since I lasted played I've heard they added some features to encourage group play which is also good. Many people say Maplestory is pay to win and it certainly does help; however, you can still get just as far for free. Overall, I'd say Maplestory is a good game to play if you have friends and some spare time. TL;DR: Play with friends 7.5~8/10, Play without friends 6~6.5/10			"

The GoodNice Art StyleNice music, very fittingLots of content. (35 classes, lots of PQ's and bosses)Game gets updated often. High level cap (250 level cap)The BadThe Community. There is a PQ that gives insane EXP and everyone just does that and nothing else.Game seems poorly optimized often freezing when a lot of players are on screen or you open the map or quest logQuests are what you'd expect. Kill X, Collect Y, bring back to Z.  Nothing new here.Combat can feel very grindy.A bit pay to win. (Although Nexon has been rectifying that lately).Recommend?You'd really have to try it out for yourself and see if you'd like it because it's not a game that everyone likes. I personally have been playing for years and love it. "

												I have played this game for years (since before big bang) so i have been through the ups and downs. The game isnt pay 2 win it is pay 2 save time. Proof below: You can get basic equips through events etc (basic can be even lvl 120 stuff that normal mobs drop or the zakum equips from easy zakum). Then you can do the gollux boss and commerci quest line to sell gollux shop equips by getting coins from easy mode, and cubic blades from commerci. A shop you can aquire from the maple rewards shop by killing bosses if you can, or doing star planet (easily attainable in a few hours from star planet). Sell your gollux shop equips and cubic blades that you acquiered over a month or so, you will be able to make a few hundred mil or so. Buy your chaos root abyss equips. Buy your reinforced gollux pendant / belt. Commerci will give you your already epic'd face and eye equip. Shoe and glove can be obtained by doing normal root abyss and opening the shoe / glove box with coins to achieve the 100% chance to go up tier per cube.  Badge attained through ghost ship questline, emblem through boss arena, rings through the gollux shop (should have sold 1 out of the 4) and the other ring that drops from bosses, earring through gollux shop, cape can be anything until you can afford tyrant cape. Once you attained all of your equips you can epic pot all of them through epic pot scrolls provided in every single event shop  which we have almost 24/7. Once you epic an item you can cube it from using cubes from bosses (since you can boss somewhat now), or cubes from the reward shop (get points from bossing or star planet). Also i forgot about scrolling which can be done through spell traces (20 crusader coins = 100 traces ~ crusader coins dropped from bosses), or event shop scrolls. Thats it, not pay 2 win, pay 2 save yourself from spending time on all of this.			"

												The servers lags so much and they dont do anything to fix it, so you lag and watch your character die, slowly. Not only that the servers crash alot causing you to restart the whole maplestory thing and its annoying not only restarting the game but sometimes it glitches so it says your on it but the game isnt actually there so you gotta shut down and log back in just to play this game. And to top everything off this game feels like a pay-to-win because when you actually go and find people to talk to, you see everyone with these amazing cool itmes,high levels, and sh!t like that so you feel like your left out and everything is just a pain. I only say play this game if you have friends to play it with.			"

												I used to play MapleStory; I started playing four years ago. I met my best friend there. It was fun being a Fire/Poison ArchMage in the game before all the revamp updates. The game now is just grind, grind grind, bots in most maps, most people are power hungry. The newer classes are over-powered and no one plays the old classes anymore.Don't waste your time in this game; your wallet and social life gets sucked into this game.			"

												Although tossing money at Nexon will help in this game, it's not necessarily a P2W game.  I see it as more of a Pay-to-solo game. I see it as this because if you have a group of friends who all will play it and have teamwork and stuff (and get free stuff durring events) you will do ok in progressing and leveling up by questing and grinding (which both get VERY boring) well, probably up untill somewhere in the lvl 160+ area, where most people who are there have payed tons of moneys, and you feel seriously under-powered.  You can either spend time or money, and still be constantly grinding.			"

												Keep in mind this is my opinion.  I understand that maplestory is a very different game, and A LOT of people do not enjoy it. I have been playing maplestory for years, I believe it is a very good game.I joined around the release of the pirate, the fifth job/class to the hero Maplestory is a different type of MMO, you don't really do quest all that much in this game, it's always been more of a grind.This can be good, and bad.Early game is encredibly easy in every way, monsters killable, leveling stable/quick, and money isn't a problem.Later on in the game it can be a giant pain, you need funds to buy potions, you need to have ""godlike eqps"" each bought for tons of IN GAME money.You can play this game without spending a dime, personally I have spent a good bit of money on this game, but I do not regret it.~Pro/ConsPros: cuteeasytime wastercons:end game leveling is roughyou may not like the style of gameplay (grinding)people can be elitest if you don't have specific gear.

												Despite being able to run StarCraft II and Eve Online, somehow I am having serious lag issues with this 2D game on my machine.But this review isn't to bash the *game.* This is here to warn users who want to play this game that Nexon's tech support is completely inaccessible.* They cannot be contacted directly.* They have a confusing two sets of forums dedicated to the game.* Signing up for an account does not grant you posting rights, so you cannot post or reply to topics in the forum.* All of their FAQ sections are heavily downvoted by multiple users, and their posts are generally unhelpful.Their support team is completely inaccessible. I cannot reach them in any way shape or form.While some users are experiencing fluid gameplay, others like myself are experiencing major slowdowns and lag that causes them to miss jumps, sustain unpreventable/unavoidable damage, freeze outright, etc. My lag issues are primarily caused by intense CPU and RAM spikes coupled with disk thrashing with minimal background services and programs, leading me to believe the 2D MMO is somehow unoptimized for above-average laptops like a Lenovo G50 with an A8 processor and 6GB of RAM.I've turned all of the graphical settings down, muted sounds, set the .exes to avoid advanced DPI scaling, ran the .exe in 8 bit color mode, tried numerous combinations of compatibility modes for Windows 7 and 8, and this machine is on a lean operation; all of its background services and running programs are cut down for efficiency and performance. My background is in IT. The game shouldn't be demanding half of my RAM on the lowest settings, it is 100% flawed optimization.Again, warning users, the customer support is inaccessible. Nexon is a brick wall with no entry points. If you encounter lag in the game, you are out of luck.			"

												I played this again out of nostalgia and was curious to see what changed. While the additions were interesting, it didn't take me too long to remember why I stopped playing this in the first place. The gameplay gets stale really quickly since all you're ever doing is hunting down monsters and collecting items. There's really not that much variety to the quests handed to you since it's always one of three things--kill a certain amount of monsters or collect a certain amount of items said monsters have dropped. This is probably why I stopped playing MMOs in general, but there were some that brought a little variety into things. It was a nice trip down memory lane, but I'm not surprised I lost my interest so quickly this time around.			"

Posted: December 3, 2014
												This game has been on Steam since 2012 I believe. Since then, Nexon has gone through countless updates, time and time again, breaking Steam MS. I was forced to play MS through the website most of the time. This was not the issue. I have been playing MS since a month out of Beta. It was the best thing to happen to me, to date. However, what really got me down was when my friends quit, or I got hacked, or if I was being ks'ed, etc. I remember when Victoria Island was the only continent and there were only 4 Adventurers and HPQ was the only pq. Everything changed after the BB patch. It became SO much easier to level up that anyone could get 120 levels within 24 hours, without 2x EXP. The game changed from being too hard to too easy, it was ridiculous. Now, though, Nexon has finally caught up to all of the demands of the Veterans and have made the game harder to level up from level 30-60 and 170-200, which are the prime levels. After many updates to nerf the OP grind fest and 24 hours max leveling, the veterans are now complaining that the game is too hard. Ha! Too easy now too hard? Pick a side and stick with it, I thought. I'm starting to agree with them though, the game has become harder than it was after the BB patch, but it's still easier than before. The major updates, like Chaos, Legends, and Jump were all very exciting, especially if you play with friends. This game is hugely based on friends. It is SO boring without friends to play with. The game actually rewards you for playing with your friends now, apparently. I used to have MS open 24 hours per day for 7 days a week, even though I wasn't there to play myself - I just wanted to have it open for when I got home. (That's kind of exaggerated; My longest time on MS was only 77 hours, after which I had dc'd).If you were to ask me what MS is about, I couldn't tell you. There is just so much to it, you have to experience it yourself. But let me warn you. The game doesn't like new players. It feeds on the old ones, like me, who have characters over level 150 (the max being 250). I really like it though. if I were to start all over, I'd only be willing to do it with friends (and if I had the time. I basically have no time for MS anymore because of school).Back to Steam MS though. This Steam version is weird. It sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't work. Many people experience trouble with the Steam version for a variety of issues: someone typed in the wrong email address, and so you can't change it; someone forgot their pin; the game doesn't load for some people; and the list goes on. My suggestion would to just play MS through the website if it doesn't work on Steam.Please disregard the amount of hours I have played MS on Steam. 80% hours are just from me afk'ing A LOT. The other 20% of those hours are me enjoying the game with my (now-dead) friends.Steam: JamilliaMS: ZeroJanaMain Class: ZeroLevel: 199World: BroaFavorite Channel: 17Longest friend: iForgettable (aka Joanne; she was just as old as me - in terms of how long she played - before she quit)Preferred Character: BishopAll of the classes I have ever created (in order to at least level 100):Bishop, I/L, Pirate, DB, BW, DW, Aran, Evan, NW, Bucc, Shadower, UA Sair, BaM, NL, CS, Merc, DS, TB, Jett, Phtm, UA DK, Mihile, Kaiser, Lumi, AnB, Hayato, Kanna,  Xenon, WA, BT, DA, Zero, EunwolHighest level character: 201 LuminousIf you have any questions about the game, go ahead and shoot me a question.

												So I know 15 minutes wtf man?Trust me when I say I have 100 of very enjoyable hours outside of the steam edition. So if I have over 100 hours and I enjoyed all those hours what is the issue.Simply the game has dropped in quallity faster then miley circus after dropping from Disney.Okay so lets go over Pros and Cons:Pros:- 2D Mmorpg (Very nice for those who like platformers)- A very nice feeling and still some community in late game.- First game I ever enjoyed grinding in.Cons: - Early game community is dead. Essentially a grind untill late game (Dramatically reducing the fun in low level grinding).- To many classes making even someone like me who essentially stopped playing 2012 and revisiting it now and again lost.- P4A (Pay for advantage) is accaptable but this game has a pay wall for late game.- But there is rebot! And tbh it seems decent but some factors are removed and once again we kinda fall on the lack of community thing.- One thing in rebot was no trade. Why? Because Nexon is not capable to stop hackers so inflation essentially took over maplestory for a while. And still have a huge impact on standard servers.Okay tbh the game is probably still decent but for any returning players just do not bother. This is no longer the game you love and is not even similar to it.  "

												This game is addicting, and that is all, it is not good, not even close, only addicting, you will spend a vast amount of time on it only to realise that you accomplished nothing and didnt really have fun doing it, this game was great back in the day when it had a better community and fewer classes and less imbalance, but they have crashed it into the ground.

												I started playing, tried the new reboot server that promised a better experience.  My auto-looting snail expired after five hours.  The game started expecting me to pick up items one by one at one third of the pace.  I stopped playing.If you expect me to play by spending five times more playtime looting than actually playing because you have to pay for 90 days of a modern expectations of a videogame then I just won't loot anything.  If I can't get anywhere without looting, then I just won't get anywhere.  If I can't get anywhere, there's no reason to play the game at all.People excuse it away with ""oh but it's just five dollars for a pet"".  The amount of money you have to pay for the feature is zero dollars.  It should come with the game.  Strongarming players into purchases is a rubbish business tactic that only results in cheaters and private servers like there are now and it's a known fact that Nexon themselves are throttling the rate at which players can loot items to try and sell pets.  There are plenty of other places I can take that ""just five dollars"" and more than likely they'll involve pressing more than just SHIFT and ALT for hours on end.			"

												I used to love this game a long time ago.  Recently saw it on steam and thought, SWEET!  Downloaded it, and jumpped back in.  First with a character i had made a long time ago.  Not a good idea.  Had no idea what was going on anymore.  Said whatever, ill make a new character.  After about and hour or 2 of gameplay i was level 30.  too easy.  then the annoying parts started.  I would be mid quest and accept or get another quest which would teleport me to a new world completely with no way to get back to the last things i was doing.  Really???  This happened 3-5 times and i quit.  I can't play when i can't even stay in one area without the game forcing me to move without even being able to complete quests.			"

Ive played the game myself for about 7 years and i do admit it has changed alot since beta (like all games do) but still lives up to the name and gives people hours of entertainment. If you want to compare the maplestory server now to what it was like back in the day, search up maplestory private servers and sign up for one that is V 0.64. Its free and will be just as fun as the nowadays maplestory. (WARNING, the game was a lot harder back in version 0.64)			"

												In Maplestory, you play as some anime hobbit roaming the world of Azeroth. It seems everyone worships mushroom people for some reason, a rip off of Mario. You can chose a class like the ones you would expect from some MMORPG, I chose mage. You have many powers, like shooting snail shells, I kid you not. The world is littered with fungi and giant snails, ripping off The Smurfs. Eventually you go to Antarctica, with many penguins staring deeply into your soul, ripping off Club Penguin. The problem with this game is that it tries to appeal to everybody, with anime, magic, pirates. Which happen to be ripping off Attack on titan, the Lord of the Rings, and Pirates of the Carribean. The whole game seems like some pitch for a Cartoon Network show, except that it throws you in a postapocalyptic world, with magic and monsters at every corner...Ripping off Adventure Time			"

												Heard about the new reboot server, decided to give maplestory a shot again, I can tell ya right now, I love this way more than classic maplestory, you get thrown right into the action(you can skip the first 10 levels of your class aka the tutorial levels) This game does a good job of making you feel like a badass, and that feeling only gets solidified the more you play.The reboot server allows you to play in an environment where you can purchase the main cash shop items that make the game ""p2w"" with mesos instead of rl$, in addition mesos drop rate is 5x, experience is higher, but mobs are harder, and there's no trading, in a way it's like diablo 3's 2.0 update but for maplestory, if you're getting back into maplestory I definitely recommend the reboot server to ease your way back in, it kinda almost feels like a private server within the game but well balanced... that said, if I was in the main server I would've had around 8b mesos on my first day in due to the event items I squandered, the drop rates have gotten a lot better and I definitely recommend this game if you're looking for an mmoarpg platformer.

												The game changes a lot. Personally it's like a switch where it is very good and then sometimes bad. Old players and stuff have seen this. In the end old fans typically come back to the game. Enjoyable, especially with friends. Can be a grindfest and mainly about mesos, but in the end fun, if you are into fantasy/rpgs. Also the monsters are very unique which I tend to like in many games. (Played since 2006, so my steam is only shows a short period)			"

												I started playing Maplestory years ago. There were three classes, with a fourth not entirely finished yet. Speed ahead, the number is probably 30 or more, and what has the game got to show for it? About 5GB's, apparently. Maplestory is a seemingly simple game when it comes to design, however, this is an understatement in magnitudes. The amount of detail put into the tiniest of things is fairly impressive, and the overall composition is balanced, visually at the least. To quantify it, I'd give it a 9 of 10, as it has a very certain style that it has kept to for many years, improving it with each update. The game, the game, you are probably criping about. The game is... Well, bland, if you let it be. The original Maplestory would take upward of hundreds of hours to gain only a few number of levels, often resulting in the player gaining access to OTHER ways of burning hundreds and hundreds of hours. My first account was around level 70 before it was lost to the stupidity of youth. It took some two years of leisure play, that as I now look back at, was sickening. The Maplestory today has enacted a story-line for the player to follow, one that of course, is entirely optional, but is largely beneficial to the player seeking to access everything in a timely manner. From the start to 70 again, it took roughly 12-24 hours in total play time. Some quests would level the player massively, and this made for a huge jump in playability. Yet... in doing this it crippled the need to explore a lot of the lower-level maps. You find yourself swamping back and forth in the same few areas that match your level range, seeing the same monsters over and over until the quest and level set is complete.Why play this, you ask?When you can get a set of people to join you, it's a genuinely remember-able experience. Bosses in this game are NOT easy to take alone, and you'll often need to coordinate in a huge number of ways. Thankfully, each class HAS A PLACE. The game has a balance between each class that makes it so when the individual is party-searching, they aren't met with any EXTREME class bias. Aside from the healer being chosen first. But say you are alone, what then is there to amuse you? WELL! Discovering all this constantly expanding world has to offer. The quests are endless, and if you don't fancy doing them, just kill things! Each monster (after a certain level) has a different set of attacks that you'll need to account for. You'll be hard-pressed to find a situation where you can just spam one attack infinitely (not to say there aren't opportunities). On this, each class has a moderate-to-diverse range of available moves that will require a balance to use in a successful manner. Hotkeys a plenty, the user will likely stick between 5-6 moves they prefer, and use them as the situation calls need. This game can be played ANY TIME, there is rarely a situation where you are FORCED to stay on or else feel some emotional, internal struggle, when you leave it behind. It's simple to pick up... sorta?In recent years, the game has been working on adding and building on the game... without much improving what is there? They've added personality traits that influence your ability, POTENTIAL for weapons that influence them in some way or another, and yet, it looks clunky and visually, confusing. When I joined, it was a simple set of 5-6 buttons and the buttons to operate these menus as appropriate. Now, you'll be bombarded with tabs on tabs of flashing icons that all HOPE to enhance your playing experience. Usually... it just leaves you confused. The game has made strides in playability, enjoyableness, and the content that is available to all without the need to throw money at the screen. Yet, it still has a while to go. To again, quantify it, I'd give it an 8 of 10, as what it has added has enriched the content, by being oblivious to mechanical things that desperately need improvement. I'd say, play the game, give it a few hours, and you'll probably end up playing it once or twice a week out of the sheer quantity within it you'll have to discover. "

												It's really the gameplay that I am beginning to become disappointed in. I first started playing this after the first year of it's release. I'm happy with the way the game is growing in classes and stories and places to explore. The game became a lot less challenging than it used to be. I went from level 1 to level 50 in the span of 3 hours. Which, back in the old days, would have taken at least a month if not two. With all the fancy new classes you can play as, the original four classes are pretty bland in comparison. But overall, it's a pretty good free mmo			"

												I have played this game for about 6 years now (with tons of breaks in between) I haven't ever gotten farther than 30 until very recently. Even though I had such a hard time leveling up, I have always loved this game. The people in this game are great, I have made some friends through it, and have even gotten my friends to join the game. I do very much dislike how they keep adding more and more classes to the game, and changing how it works a whole ton, but it is still maplestory either way. I don't think I will EVER stop loving this game. If you like MMORPG's this is a wonderful addition to your ""collection"".			"

												This game was a staple part of my childhood, and I could never dislike it, but be warned, the game is pay-to-win, but not as much as people like to make it seem. You could get to max level without spending a dime, but the temptation to spend money to continue forwards is strong. In short, it's worth your time as long as you're willing to give a lot of it.EDIT: I should also add that I don't play the Steam version of the game, so don't let my low playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours clocked with this game.EDIT 2: Since the addition of the Reboot world, I can say that this game is most definitely worth playing. The Reboot server eliminates everything that made Maplestory P2W, so there's no reason not to try it.			"

												MapleStory is a Korean 2D MMORPG with platform elements. Its unique style made me try it back in 2006, thus it became my first MMO game. Rich 2D graphics, relaxing music, anime-style cuteness in every detail. It came a long way from being a hacker-infested grind-fest to what it is today, a rather fun game with a lot of things to do in a huge world. There is still quite a lot of grinding involved, but the EXP curve is much more relaxed now with bosses taking less time to kill, which leaves players a chance to try out different characters. Level cap is set to 250, so level-chasing never stops. The hardest part of this game is becoming rich without investing real money into it, so don't expect getting yourself top equips easily.All in all, MapleStory is not without flaws, but despite its publisher's attempts to turn it into a pay-2-win kind of game it still managed to keep its charm thanks to its adorable design and unique platform-like mechanics.

												Heard about the new reboot server, decided to give maplestory a shot again, I can tell ya right now, I love this way more than classic maplestory, you get thrown right into the action(you can skip the first 10 levels of your class aka the tutorial levels) This game does a good job of making you feel like a badass, and that feeling only gets solidified the more you play.The reboot server allows you to play in an environment where you can purchase the main cash shop items that make the game ""p2w"" with mesos instead of rl$, in addition mesos drop rate is 5x, experience is higher, but mobs are harder, and there's no trading, in a way it's like diablo 3's 2.0 update but for maplestory, if you're getting back into maplestory I definitely recommend the reboot server to ease your way back in, it kinda almost feels like a private server within the game but well balanced... that said, if I was in the main server I would've had around 8b mesos on my first day in due to the event items I squandered, the drop rates have gotten a lot better and I definitely recommend this game if you're looking for an mmoarpg platformer.

												MapleStory is a Korean 2D MMORPG with platform elements. Its unique style made me try it back in 2006, thus it became my first MMO game. Rich 2D graphics, relaxing music, anime-style cuteness in every detail. It came a long way from being a hacker-infested grind-fest to what it is today, a rather fun game with a lot of things to do in a huge world. There is still quite a lot of grinding involved, but the EXP curve is much more relaxed now with bosses taking less time to kill, which leaves players a chance to try out different characters. Level cap is set to 250, so level-chasing never stops. The hardest part of this game is becoming rich without investing real money into it, so don't expect getting yourself top equips easily.All in all, MapleStory is not without flaws, but despite its publisher's attempts to turn it into a pay-2-win kind of game it still managed to keep its charm thanks to its adorable design and unique platform-like mechanics.

												I wish the game would come back. One of the best parts of the game, if not the best, isthe community this game has generated. I love the people that play this game and they make me laugh every day. It's almost impossible to become very strong without spending thousands of dollars on the game, but you don't need to be strong to have fun. There is so much story line to go through and so many people to do it with. Create a character at the same time with a friend and help each other with the quest line. It is so much more fun this way. The level cap is 250 and it is, and I quote, extremely difficult to reach it. If you do reach the level cap in the game you are god tier. This doesn't mean you are strong still but everybody will know who you are. Have fun with this game and explore every class. I have reached a very high level, still not 250 but Ihave been playing for years and I will love this game until the end. I would do almost anything to have a larger community so please do download the game and check out the giant world, thousands of quests and difficult bosses that this game, very close to my heart, has to offer. I have logged hundreds of hours and look forward to each and every update. Good luck and have fun, I hope the in-game economy treats you well. :)			"

Ok, so I'll contact Nexon technical support, they'll help me. No, it seems they won't, not without providing them with the registered e-mail address for the account (It's the one I'm using to contact you, duh!), my purchase history for the last 90 days (ermm, I can't purchase anything if I can't login to the account!) and also photo ID to prove I am who I say I am.

If your feeling down and just need a brush of self confidence just go ahead and download this bad boy and you'll suddenly realise that life is full of suprises and this is one of the many boxes of sheer greatness it has to offer. I would reccommend taking off your pants and grabbing a bag of cheetos and a 2 liter of your favourite beverage before starting the game. Once you've gathered that go ahead and turn on your favourite boy band. You would think at this point, ""This game can not possibly get any better"" But your wrong this is the most crucial part of the ritual and it is to pat yourself on the back. Now you are ready to play some maplestory. If you ever need someone to play with go ahead and add me in game, My IGN is ChiTownGangsta69			"

Nexon is the publisher of this game and if you experienced any of their other games they seem to only add Characters, Skills, and Gachas to the game over a long period of time... if you want to try out the game by all means experience it but be warned of Nexon's track record.

You're bored one day and reminisce about the good ol' grind with your friends staying up for days just for that one level, so you get the game again, now you're flabergasted. Mechanics have changed, there are so many classes, things look so fun now. Best part, you can be a psychic. 10/10 would quit, play, and do it all over again. Good times.			"

												I've got alot of history with this game. Even for the last six years playing the game. The game has a lot of classes, but the primary classes are warrior, magician, thief, bowman(archer), and pirate. The warrior is your standard damage dealer with high defenses. The mage has powerful magic attacks but bad defenses unless you have a buff that reduce damage. The theif does major damage up close(dagger) or from afar(claw) while using stealth. The bowman uses either a bow or a crossbow dealing critical damage. The pirate is like the theif minus the stealth and replacing daggers with knuckles and claws with guns. PVP used to be level 30 to enter but and update made it level 70. In the game the world or mapleworld and yes that is its world is called was ruled by a dark wizard or otherwise the black mage until five(six) sealed him away but the cost was that they were fronzen for hundreds of years. In its latest update ""Grand Atheneaum"" shows how the black mage came to be. Some of the community can imature but I usually ignore it. If you don't like the community the content is what might get you hooked on this game. There are some events where some classes will be availible; like the ZERO class where you start from level 100 until you hit 180 so you escape mirror world where s/he is seal. seriously zero's story can be REAL funny. At level 30, then to, 60 and finaly 100 and the rumored 5th job advancement. The community accuses other 2D RPG's of being a ripoff(bull). After playng for over 6 years I Proudly give this game 9.75/10			"

												People always make fun of this game because it is a grind and that it is repetitive and this than and the other, and while that can't be disputed, that is just what MMOs are.People like me who love to watch and calculate progress in a character over a period of time love to play games like this because it is so easy to look at your stats and see where you've gone and how much you have progressed sense you were just a level 1 newbie.I will admit, this game isn't for everyone, but it has this charming appeal to it. The cute characters, flashy skills, the plethora of classes you have to play at almost any given chance. You'll find something to do, you'll find some monsters to kill, you'll have some quests to do, all you have to do is be comitted to the game.While I wouldn't reccomend this to everyone, if you are looking for a different turn on the MMORPG, this is your game.I give it an 8/10.P.S: Play  on Scania.

												I love love love love MapleStory. It's a fun MMO that is easy to get into and provides a steady and satisfying climb. I feel like I've made if further in about a month of this game than I have in any other MMO, but that doesn't mean it's easy. Combining MMORPG elements with minor 2d platforming works well, and there's a reason MapleStory is still one of the world's most popular MMOs even after being around for over a decade. Still, if you dislike microtransactions, be warned: This is one of the greediest games of it's kind I've played. Most cash items only last for 90 days, but cost the same as permenant cosmetics in other games. Still, even without spending a dime, it's the kind of game that should provide enjoyment for the MMO or RPG enthusiast.			"

												I'm surprised it took so many bloody years for Steam to actually have this, maybe Nexon is losing some people, I dunno. It's happened with Combat Arms... anyway,Cute, cruel and creative Maplestory is one of the only games I've known to date in the Western market to be well loved by most as perhaps the only online MMORPG that is the purveyour of the faces known today such as o3o, 0///0 and =_=;.There are 18 classes split into 4 'job's fitting a specialisation with branching choices.Each with a very unique set of enjoyable and fun skills to play with it. It is FUN, usually...However, a caveat for newer players. This game involves A LOT of grinding, and I mean a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of grinding to be done. If you are a ranged class like I was, you can run out of ammo. Early game playing can very tedious and boring. However, the tradeoff is the middle to end game, at this point many classes will have most of their skills and specialised - and it feel incredibly powerful when you see your dmg.			"

												Who hasn't played Maplestory at least ONCE in their lives? Maplestory is a game 2d sidescrolling MMO, nothing really fancy about that since it provide everything an MMO should.  This game was pretty much meant to be directed for the younger gamers that would want something to waste their time with alone or with friends.  Maplestory is a really asthetic game, it has lots of different unique sceneries to it and the art work is just amazing to look at, very colorful and unique.  The gameplay plays like a hack & slash combat style that include a wide variety of skills and weapons to use.  though it is as well an RPG, so expect some grinding, a LOT of grinding which would what make this game become repetative at times.  Maplestory also has a big focus on social interaction, such as being able to become ""families"", having plazas primarily for social interaction, to even get married to other players!  I would say to give this game a go at least once if you haven't. Recommended!			"

												Hands down, best MMORPG I have EVER played! I have been playing on and off for 4 years now and I'm not even level 200 and the level cap has INCREASED! Maplestory is a game for all ages and ranges from the ghettos of Kerning city to the carnival of Malaysia, cold snow of El Nath, suffocating feeling of Aqua Road and the ever so magical feeling of being in the Temple of Time.Not only are the maps extensive but as are the classes. For 4 years I have been playing as a Thief, but now a Night Lord, and I have never been disappointed. Content is updated and classes are always being revamped. You might not be able to change classes like in Mabinogi, but you will not be disappointed if you choose the right class the first time.The monsters can be either really creepy or really cute. As in creepy I mean maybe some weird looking creatures but none will really leave you with nightmares except maybe Thantos or Pink Bean if you die a lot against it. Most of the monsters can be very adorable or just very well drawn. Many maps allow for good sniping which is vital for a class like mine or pirates with guns, etc. There's no end to the monsters because they just keep coming when there's new events and new places to visit. I could go on and on all day about how AMAZING Maplestory truly is. It keeps you playing and has great art and a wholesome storyline that is bent and twisted depending on your character. Don't pass this game up, especially cause it's ""Free to play"".			"

												One of my favorite games ever. I pick it up and put it down after a while when new classes come out. Recently the trend is more power and easier game play but still a fun time killer when you have friends who also enjoy it. As far as pay to play I have no idea what people are talking about. Ive played this game since day one, only time I put money in it was when I was younger and got special permanant items. This game is truly free and requires no money if you do not want to put any into it.			"

												Yes, it's pay-to-win. But it's also a subscription-free game. Do not play this game if you're looking for something balanced, or at all adult.That said, the game is fun. Really fun. That's why I play it. I'm fine spending money here-and-there for bonuses in the game, because in my mind it's simply the reasonable alternative to a subscription fee.Play maplestory for the pure fun of the game, but remember that it is not an MMO the likes of WoW where all things are balanced and reasonable.I recommend it, because it's fun. To hell with any other way of judging this game.			"

												Maplestory is a game I have been playing for quite a while (I think 7-8 years) and I still love it! Many people's complaints are that the game is ""too easy"" or ""easier"" than how it was previously, and it's true, it is easier, but the big problem I see with their complaint, is that the game will still take hours of your time to max a character. It was only recently that level 250s appeared, and that took them months to go from 200-250. I realize this game is a lot of grinding, but the same can be said for a lot of other MMORPGs on the internet. The music in this game is amazing and deserves a listen to, especially in places like Henesys. The gameplay, while being very grind heavy, is fun and fast paced! You've got a wide variety of characters each with their own set of skills (5 different sets: 1st Job, 2nd Job, 3rd Job, 4th Job, and Hyper Skills with the exception of Evan, Dual Blader, and any others that have more than 4 Job Advancements), and while some are overpowered, this game isn't a competition unless you make it a competition! Another complaint people have is that there are several ""Pay-to-Win"" concepts in the Cash Shop such as EXP boosts, Money Bags, and ways to make your equipment better, but once again, it's NOT a competition. There may be some PvP side areas, but if you don't want to go against somebody with overpowered equipment, just don't go to the Battle Square! All the things people complain about are easily fixed on our ends! If it annoys you that people decide to be all high and mighty about their high level characters, ignore them! It doesn't matter! This game isn't a competition, it's simply a game for messing about on your own or with friends. People argue that people rarely do Party Quests anymore, which is true, I can't argue against that, but Party Quests are not required by any means, they are just a fun way of getting EXP. My biggest complaint with the way Maplestory is, however, the fact that a higher level cannot train a lower level like we used to. If there is too big of a difference between your level and the person you are training/being trained by, or maybe between the lower level and monster's level (20-30 levels I believe) then you will not get ANY EXP from their kills, meaning if you want to play with your friend's higher level character, there won't be much point because they'll be the ones getting experience. My main point is that almost everything people complain about is how much more powerful certain classes are, or how powerful people can make equipment by paying, or how much money people can get by paying, but the fact of the matter is, this game is only a competition for those that want to make it a competition. This game isn't meant for you to challenge a random stranger to a hunt, but rather to challenge your friends to a hunt. Overall, Maplestory is a great game as long as you remember that it's not a competition, and if you're the type who can't stand people being better than you at a game, or can't stand it not being a competition, than I can't help you.

												For being a free to play MMORPG game, Maplestory is phenomenol having amazing classic MMORPG elements in it such as a crap-ton of quests, bosses, dungeons and 32 DIFFERENT classes at the moment with more on the way! Its artstlye is extemely charming as well. Maplestory is hands down the best free MMORPG game I have ever played, and is a lot better then some paid ones.Now to one of my angry rants about other reviews I've seen about this game....I have seen many downvotes saying that it is a pay to play game or a pay to win game and some even saying its IMPOSSIBLE to play without paying actual money. it is DEFINITELY NOT a pay to play/win game. 80% of items bought with actual money (NX cash in game) are purely cosmetic either giving you funky hair cuts, pets, different eyes, faces, mounts, changing the look of your weapon, emotes and other things like that. the other 20% of items bought with money are little helper items, like auto pickup items, auto heal items, 2x drop rate, 2x EXP etc etc. Yes those little items help, but I havent spent a dime on this game and i've gotten permanent mounts and pets, 2hour 2x coupons, 1h 2x drop rate couons just from playing the game and participating in events and the events arent a hassel, they are fun and accessable from anywhere in the world!Is Maplestory a pay to play/win game? NO!Is it awesome? YES!Looking for a good MMORPG to get into? GET IT!			"

												I've been playing maplestory for many many years now, I have literally full pages of characters on multiple accounts. Theres no such thing as quitting maple, just a prolonged hiatus. Constant updates and nostalgia keep me coming back. Its extremely addictive, and I would recommend this game to anyone whos bored of the same old MMO scene. Its simple and the player community is friendly for the most part. I love maplestory. I started playing maplestory when I was thirteen, I am nineteen now. And I can gurantee I'll keep playing for years to come!			"

												i have played this game since it left beta, and i must say it was better then. like typical MMO's, it originally had you tanks, DPS (ranged and cqc), mage, and healer. really simple and user friendly battle systems when in a party. not anymore. after many years the game has tried to appeal to a younger generation of players by adding in new classes and jobs, thus rendering all the old (and in my opinion, better) classes weak and underpowered unless you spend real money to buy enhancements for weapons and equips. naturally since its a free to play MMO, its going to be pay to win, there is no getting around that.the artwork is amazing, and same applies to the bgm, top notch job to the developers on that. gameplay is very hard to describe as i find my self hitting a plateau so to speak every handful of levels, at some higher levels, (140+) monsters are either too weak to effectively grind on, or are just too strong for most classes (i playan assassin, known for low hp) unless you for out the cash and most quests have minimal rewards. this game is solid, and has been from day one, give it a shot, try it out, if you get into it then i would reccomend getting some nx(in game currency bought with rl money) and make your self op as hell. BIGGEST TIP, research classes and jobs before you creat a new character,			"

												From the get-go I was excited about this game. I had heard so many good things about it, and I love me some RPGs. The tutorial was simple enough, killing some stuff and talking to people. However, the real tragedy came once the tutorial ended. I don't know if I accidentally skipped something, but I was assualted with a gigantic world map full of options of every kind. In my foolish instinct, I chose a random location and got wrecked as soon as I took a few steps.The game is great, but the world it's in isn't. I still recomend it.			"

												This game had an unbeatable community experience years ago despite the bigger number whoring.Pink lenses aside, you really have to question if ""This is my job"" and ""I'm just feeding my family"" are appropriate justification for spreading a culture and expectation of greed trumping all forms of morality.Ironically, if this kind of industry is meant as a way of siphoning money out of the NA market and fix global disparity even a little bit, all you've done is reinforce the values that you may have been trying to stop. If it wasn't, the sheer excess of number-grubbing is sure to cause ""materialism catharsis"" in more than a few people.In short, ""this game is ok.""			"

												Oh boy. Get ready for one hell of a review. First off, it took me three hours to download. Then it takes like 10 minutes to load. 90% of the time after its done loading, it doesn't show the servers. When it does show the servers, heres another 15 or so minutes waiting for it to show your characters. Then ( bless the ♥♥♥♥ing world ), I had to reset my PIC from god knows how long ago because I couldn't get on without it. So after I get it reset, the servers just won't ever come up. I've tried a few times and it seems MapleStory is just a waste of ♥♥♥♥ing time. I had fun the VERY first time I played it ( over a year and a half ago I believe ) but now the game has just gone to utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ Not surprised since it runs through Nexon though.

												I have searched everywhere on the internet and cannot resolve my multiple crashing issues with this game. It is very buggy, even when I launch it through GameLauncher.exe. It seems unnecessary to me for the game to freeze up every time it starts, for up to two minutes every time I am trying to start playing. Apparently these issues have been happening to game players for years, but Nexon may just not care at all. Until these issues are fixed, I will not recommend this game.			"

												Well I have been playing this game for nearly 4 minutes and I can allready tell that this is the game for me. If your feeling down and just need a brush of self confidence just go ahead and download this bad boy and you'll suddenly realise that life is full of suprises and this is one of the many boxes of sheer greatness it has to offer. I would reccommend taking off your pants and grabbing a bag of cheetos and a 2 liter of your favourite beverage before starting the game. Once you've gathered that go ahead and turn on your favourite boy band. You would think at this point, ""This game can not possibly get any better"" But your wrong this is the most crucial part of the ritual and it is to pat yourself on the back. Now you are ready to play some maplestory. If you ever need someone to play with go ahead and add me in game, My IGN is ChiTownGangsta69			"

												I would put this game somewhere between an mmo and a proper grind-fest like diablo. Like an mmo, It's all about leveling, questing, bossing, and socializing. The game also starts really slow and boring because you don't have any of the flashy attacks this game is known for. once you get your cool attacks at lvl 60 and 100, you feel like such a bad♥♥♥♥♥ seriously, you could be the worst player but still feel awesome.  The diablo aspect comes in when you start gearing. Some time since I played this game 6 years ago and now, Nexon added a really simple way to upgrade your gear. I won't go into /too/ much detail here but the jist of it is you can make all your gear really powerful for cheap. when I hit level 100 (normally about 8 hours into the game), I got a set of gear that I upgraded and is still viable at my curent level (150). all of my items have an affix like (+7, 8 stars) and they glow in fancy colors adding to the badass ""feel"" of the game.   as long as you don't compair your self to other player who have been playing longer, you'll feel like a maplestory god only 12 hours into the game.Over all, I reccomend this game but understand that a lot of people aren't into the whole grinding and upgrading gear thing. The game is great for people who are but can be almost impossible to have fun with for people who aren't. "

												So I played Maplestory years ago and thought I'd revisit it after spotting it here on steam. After a 10gb download (it was under 3gb last time I played!) I attempted to login with my old details, seems my password no longer works. No problem, I'll just make a new one. No, there's an error, ""this service is not available"". Ok, so I'll contact Nexon technical support, they'll help me. No, it seems they won't, not without providing them with the registered e-mail address for the account (It's the one I'm using to contact you, duh!), my purchase history for the last 90 days (ermm, I can't purchase anything if I can't login to the account!) and also photo ID to prove I am who I say I am. Given that they don't already have that information it will verify nothing.So to sum up: worst tech support ever, they don't want you to play their game, don't waste your time.			"

												Ok, this is pretty fun. What I'm concerned about is the movement controls. You can't change it to WASD, even if you select the ""WASD"" keyset. Also, if it had a specific ""Use skill"" button (NOT skill menu) that would be helpful. I can't get past this frickin quest because 1. the movement controls SUCK and 2. i don't know how to use a skill.			"

So basically every ♥♥♥♥ing time I log into steam, I can't even erase the email that's placed, and now I'm stuck downloading it the old fashion way, which is even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because the launcher's download button doesn't even appear.

												i have played this game since it left beta, and i must say it was better then. like typical MMO's, it originally had you tanks, DPS (ranged and cqc), mage, and healer. really simple and user friendly battle systems when in a party. not anymore. after many years the game has tried to appeal to a younger generation of players by adding in new classes and jobs, thus rendering all the old (and in my opinion, better) classes weak and underpowered unless you spend real money to buy enhancements for weapons and equips. naturally since its a free to play MMO, its going to be pay to win, there is no getting around that.the artwork is amazing, and same applies to the bgm, top notch job to the developers on that. gameplay is very hard to describe as i find my self hitting a plateau so to speak every handful of levels, at some higher levels, (140+) monsters are either too weak to effectively grind on, or are just too strong for most classes (i playan assassin, known for low hp) unless you for out the cash and most quests have minimal rewards. this game is solid, and has been from day one, give it a shot, try it out, if you get into it then i would reccomend getting some nx(in game currency bought with rl money) and make your self op as hell. BIGGEST TIP, research classes and jobs before you creat a new character,			"

												From the get-go I was excited about this game. I had heard so many good things about it, and I love me some RPGs. The tutorial was simple enough, killing some stuff and talking to people. However, the real tragedy came once the tutorial ended. I don't know if I accidentally skipped something, but I was assualted with a gigantic world map full of options of every kind. In my foolish instinct, I chose a random location and got wrecked as soon as I took a few steps.The game is great, but the world it's in isn't. I still recomend it.			"

												Maplestory is that game you played in 2005 with your friend, then quit because the grind was real. You come back 2-3 years later, things are really cool, updated. Then you quit again. You're bored one day and reminisce about the good ol' grind with your friends staying up for days just for that one level, so you get the game again, now you're flabergasted. Mechanics have changed, there are so many classes, things look so fun now. Best part, you can be a psychic. 10/10 would quit, play, and do it all over again. Good times.			"

												I would put this game somewhere between an mmo and a proper grind-fest like diablo. Like an mmo, It's all about leveling, questing, bossing, and socializing. The game also starts really slow and boring because you don't have any of the flashy attacks this game is known for. once you get your cool attacks at lvl 60 and 100, you feel like such a bad♥♥♥♥♥ seriously, you could be the worst player but still feel awesome.  The diablo aspect comes in when you start gearing. Some time since I played this game 6 years ago and now, Nexon added a really simple way to upgrade your gear. I won't go into /too/ much detail here but the jist of it is you can make all your gear really powerful for cheap. when I hit level 100 (normally about 8 hours into the game), I got a set of gear that I upgraded and is still viable at my curent level (150). all of my items have an affix like (+7, 8 stars) and they glow in fancy colors adding to the badass ""feel"" of the game.   as long as you don't compair your self to other player who have been playing longer, you'll feel like a maplestory god only 12 hours into the game.Over all, I reccomend this game but understand that a lot of people aren't into the whole grinding and upgrading gear thing. The game is great for people who are but can be almost impossible to have fun with for people who aren't. "

												Where to start.... the game is definitely not easy to learn to say the least. Most of that comes from the fact that it is very old so it doesnt conform to the normal key layouts or UI schemes, not to mention that its maximum resolution is 1366x768. It is very difficult to figure out where to go for quests and even when you get there it is difficult to figure out who to talk to. There are too many classes. And all of those classes have job advancements which are basically just linear sub classes. Leveling is just grinding monsters or doing quests which are much slower compared to monsters. The level cap for most classes is very high and you gain nothing from leveling except the chance to fight higher leveled monsters. As far as I've seen there is no health regeneration and very little mana regeneration which causes people to rely heavily on potions for sustain. This and the fact that higher skill advancements cost a lot of money means that towards end game, ""funding"" becomes very important. MS is definitely for the mostpart a P2W game. A game like this would surely have been popular ten years ago but by today's standards it is woefully antiquated.			"

Apparently these issues have been happening to game players for years, but Nexon may just not care at all. Until these issues are fixed, I will not recommend this game.			"

EXP and drop rate has been increased and Nexon seems to be putting plenty into it, but I have to see how far it will go in the late-game.I'll be honest, in some respect it's still good, but since I used to play this at around 2003-2009, a lot had changed for better or worse. It really feels wierd as a former player of the game. Try it out at your own discrection, and make sure you know what you're getting yourself into before you start putting any money into it.			"

It is extremely fun but can feel very static at times due to the quests. Most quests are kill X amount of these enemies and pick up X amount of items from them. It is very fun in the begining but when u hit level 130 or higher it is very very very very VERY slow. I would recommend this game and say play it because it is fun but once you hit like 115 just start over unless you really really want to get the hyper skill at level 170 but you will be playing for months to get from 130 to 170.

												I have searched everywhere on the internet and cannot resolve my multiple crashing issues with this game. It is very buggy, even when I launch it through GameLauncher.exe. It seems unnecessary to me for the game to freeze up every time it starts, for up to two minutes every time I am trying to start playing. Apparently these issues have been happening to game players for years, but Nexon may just not care at all. Until these issues are fixed, I will not recommend this game.			"

												This game has changed alot. I don't really like that. Honestly, Nexon has milked this game too much. And will try and tempt you to buy random crap. You used to level like, Once a day. That was all. Now, you can get to level 60 in 5 hours or less. Very disappointed. I've played this on Nexon's own site before now, so I have more experience than I seem. I found this game and started to download it because of nostalgia. It's still kind of fun, but I'm not impressed.			"

												I started playing Maplestory in June of 2005, just weeks after its was released to the North American region. Man, the memories I had wasting my time on this game. Even though I stopped around early 2007, I will never forget those two years where I wasted my life playing the game. The summers of 2005 and 2006 where I played non-stop with friends, those cold-winter days where I did quest runs with randoms, and those Saturday nights playing the game while watching the Boondocks on Adult Swim. Even though I had a lot of fond memories of Maplestory, it was not that good of a game. With the arrival of the NX-Shop in late 05/early 06, the game's model turned from Free MMO to Free to Pay. It might have been the first instance I have experienced F2P. At first, the Nexon Shop offered cosmetic upgrades and various useless as fuck trinkets; it was fine at first. Slowly but surely, the OP game-breaking weapons started pouring in. By the start of 2007, Maplestory was littered with alternate accounts/players boosting from low levels to ridiculously high levels in the matter of a few hours; all they had to do was shell out a couple of dollars. It was at this point, the Maplestory community turned toxic. If all the xXAzNnAbuGo1995Xx names didn't ruin it for you, the dick measuring contests and the constant fleecing might have.Naturally, I took a break from the game for a good year and a half. I came back in the summer of 2008, and what do you know? Still the same bullshit as last time. From that point, I completely gave up on Maplestory, uninstalled it from my computer, and tried blocking anything MS related from my head. Fast-forward to 2016. I was browsing the Free-Game section on Steam, saw it, and thought to myself ""why not? Let's see if it changed a single bit."" So I downloaded it, had to restore my Nexon account, and renew the credentials in order to play it. Got it up and running, and played it for a bit. Here are my thoughts.THE GOOD:+ My account somehow survived 8 years of inactivity. Though my character names got fucked in the process. (see THE BAD for more details)+ My friend's list remained intact, even though most of my friends had their names messed up too.+ All of my items, equips, weapons, and quests - including completed, finished, and in progress - were retained too!+ It's really easy to level up. Some long-time players think this is a bad thing, but not me. It used to take so long to level up back in the early days. To give you some perspective: it would take 2 hours to get from level 41 to level 42 (no matter your character's profession) in 2005/2006, now it takes 4 hours to get from level 40 to level 50. + Dat music doe. It hits me right in the nostalgia, and it's pretty rockin too.THE BAD:- Character names on inactive accounts were changed into a long-string of numbers. If you had not logged in since 2013, your characters will have fucked numbers for names because Nexon purged some useless data from their servers.- There's only 3 screen resolutions in the game: 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, and 1368 x 768. Trying to modify the screen resolution will result in a ban from Nexon, so don't even think about it. It's 2016, and Nexon can't even be pressed to provide support for 1920 x 1080. What the fuck.- The game still runs in 16bit color mode. I understand the sprites were created as early as 2001 or even 2000, but it's just inexcusable to see those color dots all over the screen. - Main function keys are still not rebindable. I'm sorry Wizet/Nexon, I do not like moving my character with my right hand. Can you at least allow us to rebind it to WASD?- The world map is still a bitch to navigate. - Game still has spotty netcode. Those iconic hiccups were you might teleport from one side of the map to the other is still here.- NX Shop has an even stronger presence than before.- The community is effectively dead; no one is playing anymore. It's really weird to see the Scania server have open slots in their 20 channels. THE MIXED:~ Controller support. There is finally support for game pads, and unfortunately it's very spotty (my PS3 controller's d-pad was not recognizable). However, your standard console pads do not have enough buttons to accomodate various functions, especially when you get into the higher levels and need a lot of hotkeys.~ Cut-scenes. I don't think there were cut-scenes in MS when I started playing, so it's a nice addition. However, most of these cut-scenes are unskippable and a pain in the ass to watch.Overall, I cannot recommend this game for newcomers, but I do recommend it for old-timers who want to get back in and play it for old-time's sake. However, the game is on its deathbed. Nexon is contemplating on retiring the service by the end of this decade. Before that happens, Maplestory 2 will have more than likely be localized to the states. For those who are wondering, yes there is a Maplestory 2, and yes it is garbage. It has Maplestory aesthetics, combined with isometric ARPG gameplay with Minecraft's voxel influence mixed in.rating as of this moment: 5/10.			"

												With all the changes throughout the years and the recent addition of the Reboot server there's never been a better time to join MapleStory if you haven't tried it out already! At current count, there are somewhere around 40+ playable job classes in the game although they aren't always open for creation all the time. The level cap has also been increased to 250 for all job classes as of the most recent updates (although I believe this was actually from a while ago).In case you are wondering, the Reboot server levels the playing field between paying and f2p players of the game by eliminating a  lot of the items from the in-game cash shop. Now everyone has the same opportunity to gather items and increase the damage of their characters in the same ways--by working for them of course! Lots of items that were limited to only the cash shop are now in an npc shop for players to purchase via the in-game currency (mesos). There are still some convenience/travel and appearance items in the Reboot cash shop for those players interested in purchasing them.I hope to see you in-game and Happy Mapling! :-)[ Please note: my Steam time on this game isn't an adequate reflection of my actual play-time of this game, I've been playing since the introduction of the Cannoneer job class ~2011]			"

												With all the changes throughout the years and the recent addition of the Reboot server there's never been a better time to join MapleStory if you haven't tried it out already! At current count, there are somewhere around 40+ playable job classes in the game although they aren't always open for creation all the time. The level cap has also been increased to 250 for all job classes as of the most recent updates (although I believe this was actually from a while ago).In case you are wondering, the Reboot server levels the playing field between paying and f2p players of the game by eliminating a  lot of the items from the in-game cash shop. Now everyone has the same opportunity to gather items and increase the damage of their characters in the same ways--by working for them of course! Lots of items that were limited to only the cash shop are now in an npc shop for players to purchase via the in-game currency (mesos). There are still some convenience/travel and appearance items in the Reboot cash shop for those players interested in purchasing them.I hope to see you in-game and Happy Mapling! :-)[ Please note: my Steam time on this game isn't an adequate reflection of my actual play-time of this game, I've been playing since the introduction of the Cannoneer job class ~2011]			"

So no Nexton FAILED again ruining another great idea for a game due to horrible UI and confusing as hell controls.			"

												This game has changed alot. I don't really like that. Honestly, Nexon has milked this game too much. And will try and tempt you to buy random crap. You used to level like, Once a day. That was all. Now, you can get to level 60 in 5 hours or less. Very disappointed. I've played this on Nexon's own site before now, so I have more experience than I seem. I found this game and started to download it because of nostalgia. It's still kind of fun, but I'm not impressed.			"

This alone makes me want to return. I do wish the game would add a bit more into it as fighting all the time can get boring. I long for exploring and finding things. This is one reason I keep taking breaks, not enough things to do for me. But I am a gamer who loves the exploration above all else. Fighting can wait. Also there are so many classes now that it is kind of overwhelming. Then again, with so many classes it is very easy to find where you fit in.

												Nexon abuses date locked classes and grinding to the max.While this may have worked in 2007, MOBAS are taking the gaming world by storm due to people having less and less time in the modern world. This game is now an old shell of a time long past.No one wants to grind 6 hours of unfun gameplay compared to fun 45min MOBA games that are FUN and ENJOYABLE to play.Also the balance is pretty bad. The rule is still moar hits per second=winprotip: play duel blade if you have money to blow. Any class with low hp sucks♥♥♥♥♥with no spending. If you still want to play this game as a free 2 play player, play dark knight(warrior explorer class) or demon avenger.40% of the high level players (level 210+) cheat and no one cares. I can't blame them, this game is so boring to play and i understand why they do it.			"

That was the case with me, and I spent 90% of my older teenage years dumping HOURS into MS. That being said, as someone who has been gone since a year after Big Bang was released, it feels like the same old MS I pumped hundreds of dollars into before I left, and probably until I die I'll continue to play MS.If someone who has played 3k hours in Windia before this was released on Steam can say that if you like it, you'll love it, then I would recommend giving MS a shot.F3Do it, or the Slime gets it.

												Great game! Adorible and fun to play! The world has gotten smaller so new stuff could be added and i miss exploring play the game with friends or make friends within this magical adventure... its a wonderful game.if your character or account randomly disapears or gets hacked... don't ask for help. Zero customer service which is a standard feature of any Nexon title even thier flagship Maplestory. if you encounter issues with the game talk to steam support as they will try and solve your issue if its within thier ability.Maplestory is adorible and fun and you can easily spend hours and hundreds of $Dollars$ in this adictive title... however anything you purchase will expire if you go away for a short bit which is always a shock and that sinking feeling in your heart when your pet dies... never gets any easier. Nexon tried implementing limited edition non expiring items and pets... but i guess it was too good of a thing and they removed it. im scared to play knowing my characters will revert to drab and borring  once i login... either way, play this game exclusively or dont bother with fashionista cosmettics, pets, mounts, extended character slots or game purchases general.By far the best Nexon Title availible Internationally.

												I've been play MapleStory for many years so I have bias towards it but regardless I'll try to be honest about it.MapleStory is unlike many MMOs by the fact that it is a 2D sidescroller. Apart from maybe GunBound, therearen't many 2DMMORPGs around and Nexon has done an incredible job over the years developing this game.Although it's quite different now from when I first played it, I still find myself being drawn back in by the seasonalevents they put on annually. I've never truly stopped playing MapleStory for this reason. I can go months and evenyears without play it but still find myself logging in to see what's been changed and updated.CLASSES!so MapleStory has an insane amount of classes. Although there are the 6 base classes (or jobs as they call it) of Thief, Magician, Warrrior, Archer, Pirate and Beginner (yes, some people play the game as the starting character and don't choose a job). There are seperate job groups that change the standard formula. This means there are a totalof 28 unique classes (not including the different Beginner or starter classes). And they are constantly balancing andadding more each year.F2PThe game is free to play with mirco transactions, however it's not pay to win. You can buy EXP boosts but only up to a certain level meaning high level characters have attained it without forking out money to boost there. There is plethoraof cosmetic item and more are constantly added.DownsidesNow like most MMORPGs you will eventually find yourself stuck doing fetchquests and grinding for hours. It's for this reason I often stop playing during the main chunk of the year. My advice is to play during holidays such as Christmas, Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving and New Years. That's where the most fun is.			"

												While I've been playing it on a non-Steam mode, it's the game I've played the most on the past few weeks. I've been playing Maple Story on and off for about 7 years, through the years it's been good, got me bored, got good again.What I like about it is the fact that it's 2D sidescrolling, so I can't get lost on the maps... :BIt's nice for casual playing, but gets kinda tiring if you play too much and over stress with all the events they have all the time to keep players from quitting.I think it'd be nicer if they just added those event equips to some special shop to be bought with mesos or something you get from party quests rather than make you log in every weekend to get them from a box... or to make you log in every day on a week to kill 300 monsters a day to get something nice looking with not such awesome stats.

Sure, nexon has had its extreme issues over the years XD, but still their best game. Ive been playing this a lot more, the only reason you see 48 hours is because i have to play off their website since i put the wrong email into the nexon lock XD. yet this game is definitly fun. lots of grinding though but its quite fun with the art style.

												I played this game before the big bang. Before it was easy to level up and right after the trade shop where you could buy items with real money closed down. Now, a lot of people say its a pay to win game or it's hard to get some mesos and some good loot. Now, I recently joined. And I followed the story line. Which i usually don't do. BUT if you do, i promise you, this game has literally gotten so easy. You don't have to spend a dollar to get some good loot. Simply because you can craft it yourself. Like literally, maplestory has made it as simple as it could be. If you need any help, I won't give you mesos or equipment, but i'll show you how you can easily upgrade it, to make it look like you are funded. Hope ya have a good time, and follow the quests. You'll see why.			"

												I remember back then when this game first came out, it was hard to level up just past 30 as all the grinding in the world came to a slow sudden halt. But now it's much easier with my experience, although it's not the best game out there, it's a good MMO for players who want something a bit more simplified and easier on the eyes. It's not as flashy as say FFXIV, WoW, or even Guild Wars, but it's a nice entry point for a player looking for a taste of the MMO genre while not getting too overwhelmed in an instant.			"

												I'm normally not into MMOs, but this game is quite a gem! Rather than list the fun parts of the game, since there are so many, I'll just list the few issues:- Veterans, or people who are later in the game are usually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Sometimes they throw large wads of cash on the streets to watch the pesant noobs fight to the death over it (basically the definition of a rich scumbag), and sometimes they spawn high level enemies in early parts of the game.- Paid items are extremely restricted. When you pay for an in game item, you should expect to be able to keep it. As it turns out, you usually can't in this game. The limitations are often for months or something, but there shouldn't be a time limit at all! Buying anything, even the teleportation rocks, is basically a scam.			"

One of the best MMORPG's I have ever played a core factor I love about this game is that you don't need to pay money to be strong, paying for this game would only give you items that make you look better, not fight better. 9/10Cons: Killstealers who pick killstealing jobs, such as Demon slayer and they steal your kills for fun.

												Been playing since the release of the pirate class Pre-Big Bang patch. Have played on and off since then and coming back I've always found something to enjoy. There are many things that can be fixed or changed for the better, but the game hs overall been a great experience.  Giveit a shot and good luck grinding! Broa:Dudemanjtm			"

												played this game for 6 or 7 years now, its changed for better or worse. its a good game if u can make friends, guilds and parties. once u can have friends who can dump hundreds of hours in this game it will be worth the time. its too much fun with friends. play this by yourself and you will be bored out of your mind. try and make friends or have your friends play with you. i would also reccomend the guides here on steam or else where to know how to build characters correct and level up fast. this game is fun, believe me ive been playing it for 6 to 7 years now and its still fun. and dont spend money on the cash shop until they update with perm items such as clothes equips and pets.

												Maple isn't too bad of a MMO, if you can deal with fetch quests requiring 20+ of two or more items, massive level grinding after lvl 60, and the occasional hacker here or there. The game has multiple classes for players to chose from, each with their own unique play styles, and each one, having played the majority of classes myself, having various pros and cons to playing. The over-arching story, while barely touched upon in-game until MUCH higher levels, is fairly interesting and compelling, and with a large amount of quests to choose from, you'll almost never find yourself with nothing to do. The style is fairly childish, and the events may get a bit gimmicky now and then, but all-in-all Maplestory is a pretty okay game to play, especially if you're just starting out in the MMO genre.

												Its a good game back in 2008 when it first started i think thats when it came out anyway it was simple fun and over all past lvl 30 you might as well give up because you will spend the next 1000 hours on grinding till you see numbers shown in gameplay videos to get you in. even then you have to make a new charcter in about a year after it came out and every year after that because the new chararters are so op at lvl 30 they beat your lvl 200 from when the game came out characters and it makes  you feel like you wasted your entire life. anyway i recomend it as a good game if you have god like internet speed and the endless amouts of time on your hands so you might as well spend all your money till you sell your house before you get any where also i will contine to come back to this game every year to see how its changed after all it was one of my 1st pc games i hope it finaly makes it so the quests make sense and i can actualy get on with the story after the sudden curve of difficulty after lvl 30 the entire quest line for every character is so messed up that you will be under lvled for a bit then reach lvl 30 then goodbye lvling up and goodbye story line because you need to be lvl 100 before you can get anywhere after that. also i hope steam finaly fixes itself so i can play on steam. ALSO BEWARE OF HACKERS! AND RIGHT DOWN ALL YOUR CODES FOR YOU CHARCTERS AND MUCH MORE!!!!!!!!!!!! YOUVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												With over 100 million accounts created, Maplestory is probably the most played free-to-play MMORPG of all time.  Maplestory is a 2D side-scrolling, fantasy MMORPG with a massive amount of features and things to do.  Although the game is now over nine years old, the game continues on strong with regular updates and patches, and has significantly upgraded the game engine and graphics since its early days. If you can handle MapleStory’s child-like, cartoony graphics, this game has a ton to offer. MapleStory now has 30 classes and counting as of 2014			"

I recommend this game.			"

												I'm 27 years old. This is the only game other than WoW that has really held my attention since I started playing both in 2006. Yeah its got a wonky soul sucking cash shop. Yeah they add new classes and throw shiny♥♥♥♥♥♥in your face to get you playing again. One thing they are good at though, is IMPROVING! They mimicked Cataclysm and had a ""Big Bang"" update a few years back that DRASTICALLY reduced the xp needed to level(it was a crazy grind), streamlined the world, made things alot more convenient. I truly believe they love their fans, as much as they grab for cash. The anime shorts in the game and the story of each class gets better and better. The only thing that tends to suck is the localization/translation. The more recent classes such as Kaiser/Angelic Buster/Cygnus Revamp, have just been utterly fantastic. I for one love the artsy charm of the Cygnus Knights.It may not be a game that transcends the boundaries of an MMO, but its been in business for years for a reason. Intelligentmarketing, well timed releases and promotions and TRULY awesome 2D Smash em/RPG flavor. I log probably 20-30 hours every 2-6 months or so and I usually end up dropping $10-20 along with it just to see whats new and I consider it money and time well spent. Not my every day game, but man don't we all have that one thing like Coke or Apple Pie we just CRAVE every now and then? We have a tall glass, then we move on with life. Try it, it just might end up being your gaming ""comfort food"" :)			"

												Hello everyone, my name is GoldenGuru, or GLDGuru, and today i'll be doing a review on Maplestory.This game holds a place in my heart, as this game was the first ever RPG game i have ever played.Ok, first we start off, make a account, create your char, yada yada. But, there are different kinds of classes, and if you are confused, here is what each class is/a very simple description of each class. (40 total)But since it would take me hours on hours describing each skill, you can check em out yourself on the maplestory wiki/website, link provided here: http://maplestory.nexon.net/game/classes-jobsAfter you get that, you are introduced to each group introduction. (Resistance for example, you are brought in after you reach level ten (does not apply for other resistance-type classes)After that, you go ahead and start you adventure by grinding mobs..? Grinding isnt as painful as some games, but when you use a class (Dual Blade) and get higher up, you're gonna be spending loads of money since EXP gain is hard. Bossing gets more of a issue also, since you might not do enough damage to take the boss down in time.Ok, i'll be honest, my highest level is 107, and I still dont have a Hyper Skill.""What's a hyper skill?"" - any newbieA hyper skill is basicly your fifth job advancement. Thats all I can say for now.What I do like mostly about maplestory is how much people are serious for grinding. Nobody will take in a Pirate sadly,  since people think that pirates are terrible for bossing, but I think they are good. (wink wink Mihile is bad wink wink)Another thing that I like about the game is the Classes, since they all are different, and as I said eairlier, !!40!! classes/jobs!. Same with bosses, with a ton of them (check them out yourself).The ONLY thing I dislike about maplestory is that you have to spend money alot, depending what class you are playing. Most classes will require funding because of the grinding once you get to 140+.Overall, I'd say maplestory is a 9/10, -1 because of funding and painful grinding, but +9 since I love the game.(This is my first guide, so please dont bash on me too much! :>)			"

												I've played this for a few years, back and forth and have plenty notes on this.This game is if you don't know a side scrolling, immersive RPG. Character creation and such, like a 32 bit side scrolling Skyrim for lack of a better description. And it does it well. Very well! The combat is smooth and it never feels unfair. Gold is plentiful and nothing is too expensive in the in-game market. Classes are fun and characters have quite wonderful story personalities. Though there is the bad. My friend had great trouble mapping buttons to a controller. And the servers always seem to be busy, even with the sub servers leading up to thirty a piece.I can give it an 8/10. 9/10 if the servers were not so full so bloody often.			"

												This game is like drugs for kids. I played this game for three years and still can't stopWhat really kept me playing this game is me ignoring all the haters saying that the old maplestory is betterblah blah blah. For all the new maplers reading this. Please, Ignore those types of people, they aretrying to make you feel like you are playing a junk game even though that's totally the oppisote.I first got this game when my neighbour told me about it, I played it for a bit. I couldn't stop. The thing thatmakes you want to keep playing is that deep down your soul, you have this strong thirst of getting to lvl 250and be on the top list. That was me. I could keep going about how awesome this game is but I will end it off with sayingthat this game. Is. A. Drug. I spent so much money on this and I don't regret it. Please. All new players. Play thisGive it a try, I am sure you will love it. :D			"

If you've never played this game before, then i dont recommend it unless you're willing to try it and be fond.

												TL;DR: If you're a serious MMO gamer who wants to get more than 6 months worth of content out of their MMO, you should pick Maplestory. With multiple engaging storylines that vary in tone from hilarious to serious, events that are actually fun and useful, and some of the best character progression of any game, Maplestory truly delivers and doesn't stop.Many negative reviews say that this game is ""pay to win"" so that they can kill end game bosses... in Maplestory end game Chaos bosses aren't able to be done until level 180 to 200. During that time you can EASILY SOLO (by yourself) the Easy and Normal bosses to obtain armor. And seriously, the whole concept of Maplestory is not to be ""get to level 200 and raid"" like nearly EVERY OTHER MMO on the market that follows the whole World of Warcraft mentality... Maplestory's primary concept is in its name... A STORY. Maplestory has some of the BEST story telling of all time in any MMO that I have played. (WoW's story died passed Wrath... don't even talk to me about Blizzard being good story tellers anymore, cuz they're trash.) Each character you create in Maplestory tells a piece of the puzzle, adding more to the depth, lore, and reasoning as to why you exist in Maple world. And Nexon is ALWAYS making new quest lines to keep you actively engaged.Each character plays into one another's story and the more you play more characters the more you'll uncover about the game. Unlike in other MMOs where you follow the same quest line everytime you play the game, Maplestory has a VAST ARRAY of leveling areas and choices for you to play through when you make new characters. The game will not get boring quickly when you say ""oh I've been here before"" and even if you do follow the same path everytime you won't feel as though you're bogged down by slow experience. In truth, every character can hit level 100 within a week WITHOUT 2x experience.You'll be able to quickly create new characters, test their style, experience their story, and decide which one is right for you. Once you do find the character you want to play, you'll love the amount of character progress necessary to make your character one of a kind. Many of the negative reviewers feel that Maplestory is for some reason ""get the best possible armor you can in the shortest amount of time so that you can do the same bosses over and over again..."" No... that's WoW logic and that's weak... An MMO is supposed to be an engaging story that follows your character and your friends. Maplestory will deliver to you more than 6 months worth of content. Let's put it another way, even if you got to level 200 in a month (semi possible), you'd then have to get your first boss set (seeing that you won't be strong enough to kill any Chaos bosses). You'd then have to go back to do Normal and Easy mode bosses for money and their sets. (Poisonic weapons are level 110 weapons that give you 10% additional boss damage and you can start trying to get one at level 90.) The next is Necro at level 120, as well as Von Leon. Then once you are able, you start Root Abyss to get your level 130 set, or you can skip that set and move straight to the level 150 Tyrant armor. There is not one set path for you to take... this isn't WoW's dumb style of ""do this tier first"". It's what you make of it.  "

												I've played the game since I was 8 years old. Not neccessarily on steam, but between school and my studies i still manage to spend around 200 hours building up 10 different characters of different factions and classes to my liking. The game is incredibly diverse and large and there is always something to do. It handles as no other mmo does and maintains an almost lackidasical feel as tf2 and garrys mod withold. Though I found myself frustrated at times as attacking slimes of two different colors were the difference between life and death and leveling and story were not concrete in opportunites but the many guides and youtubers available today make the game so much more accessible than back in 2008-09. Its a good game and at the very least I highly recommend it be given a try.			"

												So confusing. No one plays it anymore. Way to many NPC's in town. It makes it just that much harder to find out just what they all do or offer. The map system doesn't make sense for a side scrolling game. You don't really know which way you're going until after you've picked a direction. Thank god for the signs they have set up but they are still pretty vague. Unless you're 10 I don't see why you'd play this game.			"

												Game does not even open.Edit: Hours of troubleshooting later, it started crying hacks...""Themida: A monitor program has been found running in your system. Please, unload it from memory and restart your...""Duck off! I only use basic IT tools like Process Monitor. Not hacks. And only to debug your stupid, error-riddled game that doesn't even show a proper error message (until now, that is). It just crashes to black screen over and over.And apparently the only way to unload my kernel hooks is a system reboot. (BSOD risk otherwise.) I'm not restarting my computer for this... I haven't rebooted in a month. Stupid anti-cheating false positives trying to kill my system uptime.Also, you should tell me WHICH of my dozen monitors and system tools scare you. None of them are hacks. So how am I supposed to know what exactly to disable? A good error message does not hide information. LIST all the supposed ""monitor programs"" you object to. By executable name, by the handles of the dll modules loaded in memory, by registry keys, or whatever you can do. Just help the poor user track down the culprit. What a stupid error message...Edit 2: A day later I got in. (Compatibility mode, manually downloading dll files, hex editing others, clean reboot, avoid using ""monitors""; you really hate supporting the latest and greatest, don't you? Up to date Windows 10 here...)Only to find out that all my old characters are gone. Automatically deleted years ago.How dare you prune accounts like that!? Now I don't even have a reason to return to the game.			"

												So I got this game while I was looking for a new MMO to play. Big mistake. This is literally the worst MMORPG I have ever played in my life. If you're looking for a game to play, literally pick any other game and you'll have a more immersive experience. The gameplay is literally the most unimmersive thing ever. The monsters in this game literally just walk around, and when you touch them, you take damage. Sure, a few of them might have an attack or something, but they're generic, or undodgable, or both. They are generic and  have no counterplay and are just not fun to fight. As for your ability combos, they don't exist. You literally just spam the same thing over and over again, except for a few different characters, but even they just cast the same abilities in a loop over and over again. You also need to apply an excessive amount of buffs before you actually go and do stuff, and then you'd need to reapply them in a few minutes again, which I don't get the point of. The bossfights consist of undodgable attacks that will apply status effects for a few minutes at a time, usually a silence which would prevent you from using any skill at all, so you're just stuck there doing nothing, or you could be forced to move in a certain direction without warning. And because monsters deal touch damage in this game, it could make you ram into the boss and die. Teamwork is also not a part of the game at all, as the only healing class in the game has low demand, and small player base. Players will literally queue and then leave the party to fight solo. You are not reliant on healers, rather you gotta spend money to buy potions and chug them as you get hit by attacks you can't dodge. Heck, some bosses have a life counter because they know you're going to die from the lack of counterplay.The game will try to draw you in by giving you abilities that will unlock at higher levels, forcing you to grind mindlessly for long periods of time at the unimmersive mobs. Quests in this game all suck, they just involve picking stuff up or killing things and don't have a high enough reward to be worth doing.Once you get to higher levels, the game will try to appeal to you with excessive amounts of effects and 10 lines of damage numbers even though your attack only hits the enemy once. Then it becomes pay2win after that. You literally need to spend thousands of irl dollars in order to progress from that point on, or you won't be able to fight 90% of the bosses in the game. In addition, you also need to level several characters to a very high level in order to boost your main's stats, and that will take a long time PER CHARACTER. The gear progression is very linear, and everyone just wears the same stuff because it is the best. There aren't any items that are different from each other, so you can't experiment and do different kinds of builds.There are also no interesting places to explore, because it's a 2-D platformer game with no interesting scenery or terrain.Overall, this is a terrible game and literally play anything else other than this if you're looking for a new game to play. This game is just a massive, unimmersive grind just to see larger damage numbers.Oh, and the female characters are not heavily fanserviced. Literally unplayable.On a sidenote, I technically don't have this many hours in the game, because steam would think this game was open even though it was completely closed			"

												At its current state, this game has a variety of core problems that likely aren't going to go away. Chief among them is weak servers, which causes lag to be a persistent problem throughout the duration of play - this alone makes the game hard to enjoy regardless of other mechanics. However, the pacing and world design are also a mess.My friends and I made it to level fifty in a single evening of playing, and in that time I don't believe any of us stopped to shop for equipment more than once. The sense of progression is hectic and explosive, and before we had time to get comfortable with our first job choices we were being asked to determine how we'd like to specialize into the next tier of job level. It seemed that among the basic ""explorer"" classes, ""warrior"" was objectively the best because it had the most HP and did approximately the same thing as all the other classes.But a bigger problem we discovered was trying to keep the group together. Maple Story doesn't seem to want you to explore its world or develop a lay of the land, because we were constantly being snagged by the collar and being teleported to the next quest location. This led to two of our players dropping out when quests flung them to far away places and they had no idea how to get back to us. One of them wound up in a high school, then had to abandon the party to ""parachute over the beaches of Normandy"" as he described it. We never saw him again.The main group eventually hit a dead end when all the local quests began to read as ""low-level quests"" because we'd been blowing up three levels at a time. At no point in the night had we properly explored anything, so when monsters began to fall behind us, we had no clue where to go to find monsters that weren't ten levels below us. We WERE able to find monsters twenty levels ahead of us, which we could kill, but there wasn't any worthwhile reward for the effort.Everything is cluttered and crammed in, from items on the ground, to the monsters, to the map, and Maple Story doesn't appear to have much respect for its artists. In a spastic mess of monsters dying by the thousands, occasionally the game will summon a larger version of a pre-existing game sprite, but it's clearly something nobody in the art department intended to let happen because the scaled up sprite is at too low a resolution. The big monsters are visibibly pixelated because of this obvious, clunk-headed, hilarious decision.It seems that at some point, Maple Story might have had a story, or the feel of one. There are numerous weapons and armors intended for low-level players that you'll never touch or even look at because you're moving too fast. The few quests there are wind up being too many because you pass them right away. In the end I don't know who these people are or why I should care about them because the entire Maple Story world feels two screens tall and four screens wide.At the end of the night, there was a unanimous consensus that Maple Story would be an ""uninstall, never play again"" type of game for our group. Whatever nostalgia people may have for what this game was ten years ago, there is not much meaningful content here to recommend to anyone now. At least not in the first fifty levels we cleared in a few hours! If it gets better, I can only wonder how much of the game is filler before it improves.			"

												Was unable to even log into the game and at this point i dont even care to.i thought id try this game again for nostalgias sake, after booting it up i was greeted by a tiny resolution and extremely loud dubstep music. After trying to slect a realm/channel i was repetedly asked if ""i was ready to exit the game"" with the option to select yes or no, slecting no didnt do anything so i could only press yes, what was the point in aksign then?Tried booting it up again, selected the North american server instead, picked a realm and a channel. I made a new character  (which was a hasstle in itself as for a long while the ""Create Caracter"" button was unavailable) and went to log in. The game then wanted to know if i wanted to change my security code, to skip ahead regardless if i answered yes or no, it said my security code was wrong and quite honestly iv been messed about enough at this point to even bother.Tl;DR because its less of a review and more of me rambling. The game is not worth the time, Ive not played for a long time but years ago i played for 2 years and looking back it wasnt worth the hours of grinding.			"

												The combat is flashy, fluid, and repetitive  as all hell. The plot, quests, and characters are all uniquely generic. You are consistently asked to: ""Kill 100 of x monster"" then when you turn that quest in you will often be asked: ""Now go collect 100 of x from the same monster"". But to get to the point... this review is indeed a positive one... and that is because despite everything above, and all it's other quirks... the game is still sufficiently fun and addictive, and once you get into it and find the class or ""hero"" you like can be a considerable time dump. Generic, Repetitive, Total waste of time, Highly addictive - 8.25/10.			"

												One of the best begging simulators out on the market. You have no need for much money in this game but it doesn't stop you from asking for large amounts of it from strangers. You have a wide range of emotes such as crying and angry face to aid you in your money or meso requests. Is that guy ignoring you? Start crying. If he says no? Initiate angry face. Do you like being followed and constantly asked if you are single? Play a female character. It will increase your begging abilities ten fold as players will often simple walk up to and drop free items in order to impress you. As money serves no real purpose in this game for low levels, you can use your begging donations to create riots as you drop the money in extremely small quantities on the ground in crowded areas. Don't you worry, they will swarm on that money like flies on feces regardless of the amount of money.			"

												HackStoryI played this game for about 10 years quit about 3 years ago due to Parts of my favourite questing zone (Ludas Lake) being ""closed""Got back in the game about a week ago, made a new character (NOT a burning)I absolutely love questing, after reaching around 125 questing became depressing - majority of Mu Lung and some maps at Fantasy Theme World are just full of hackers on every single channel. I can only imagine what higher level is going to be like if I can't complete a quest thanks to hackers at a much lower level.The hacking situation is much worse than it was 3 years ago when I played before.So if you love quests like me and plan to quest your way up then just warning you now that you're going to be so miserable once you get to the 125+ Areas and I wish you much luck trying to find an empy channel for the mobs you would like to kill.

												I originally started playing MapleStory back in 2005 when there were only four classes. This MMO is heavily grind style oriented at it's core so if you're into party questing and a leveling addict then this game is one you should play. As a SSMMORPG the 2D aspect is a change from the normally 3D environment of most MMOs.I honestly don't know how I feel about the implementation of all the new icons that clutter the left side of the screen notifying you about a RIDICULOUS amount of things that never used to exist 'back in the day'. Also, it used to be a badge of honor to be lvl70+ (with the level cap being at 120 the last time I had played all those years ago). Now, coming back, all I had to do was grind within the span of 3 days and boom; lvl100. I'm honestly playing for the nostalgia kick.			"

												I was never a fan of this game from day 1. My brother and 1 of my friends absolutely loved it, so that shows it's a hit or miss and is based solely on opinion. But that being said, this is my review for the game.I like the idea of a side scrolling RPG like this and I tend to play with friends on ANY and EVERY game that I can. So to start off it was fun and the idea of being our own things seems like hella fun. However, it doesn't get far with this concept as this game takes stupid amounts of grinding and hours from you. As if that's not bad enough from the start, add in the players farming the best exp areas to death taking from the ones who actually need it. Okay, so find a lesser people infested area. Easier said than done. If you do find an area with less players it's most likely because of the number of hackers in that area clearing mass mobs instantly. By the time you find yourself some exp to gain you only grind for a few hours before losing interest and logging. And of course there's only so many times you can do this before you quit all together. The graphics are a nice anime looking touch and it's pretty easy to find your friends. But unless you have 0 to do in your life and the #(*%#* tons of spare time needed to achieve anything don't bother.			"

												It's an alright-like game, but not good.Of course, consider this review moot; however, I must leave a response via personal experience. This is.... well, just not a good game, personally. There's a few problems as of why. For one, there are a few problems with connecting account data from the original game itself to steam; data is seperate, there are possible ways around this and various people have explained the solution vs the problem, but I must mention that case as it is one thing which may throw the unwitty beginner off-course. For another, the player base.... they're actually a very unfriendly lot. Pull up a chair for me to explain the details? No? fair enough as that's a story which will not fit into this helpless viewpoint of a review but the players have destroyed any hope for socializing in this game for the life of me. Let's save that for another subject elsewhere. A third? Some computers may not exactly wish to take the game's standard resolution, of course however there are also various ways to counter this excuse of some constant ""exe"" failures but it must be noted.Side silly little pointless nitpicks: -medicore graphics, other games are better such as Elsword and so-on but others object, -good luck if you wander into the wrong place at the wrong time, little confused apprentace!  (in fact, this is the first game which taught me ""Don't wander everywhere you please or you will die!"" as a very hard and painful lesson which is yet to be forgotten),-some quests can become quite annoying, -again I emphasize: fans and players of this game, HOSTILE, HOSTILE, HOSTILE AS HELL (can be due to roleplaying as their character/s? and/or just downright bad people)-can get repetitive and stale very quickly, There are other games much better out there than this, and I'm aware that it has however been improving technically over the many years since my last visit of it by now; regardless, I'm strongly against it and do not quite recommend this for anyone to play, if not in fact considering it one of the top-10 worst games to be know (not the absolute worst though). You can go for it if you like, but this is my review as all. In the end result: your choice. Good luck if you do decide to go for this game.			"

												9.4/10Maplestory is an old MMORPG game and it was one of the best 2-D games there was back then! Don't let my few my hours distract you as I played the game originally on it's launcher itself. Since it came on Steam, I hope to see memories. The game may be old and pretty useless today to many people, but it my pride, it is a good game. I played it back in 2006 and it was a very awesome game. Up to today, I wish to make this game once again popular like it was before. The present day is pretty boring now since there are more hackers coming in and it's very easy to level, but atleast they still update an old game. Though there is Cash Shop, this game is not a ""Pay to Win"" game at all. You choose to buy stuff there for pets and good looking clothes, but now they added more items that may seem like ""Pay to Win,"" but it's not. This game is still worth playing, but there isn't much a friendly community like it was back then, but I don't care. I look forward into there games like I always do and they always get me addicted for many hours. The game has changed alot since Maplestory Big Bang earlier years before, but the game will never die with its' old nice music to listen to. It's great to keep on playing and have the memories back where you were at the first time you played this game. This game has never loss my respect over the years, because they still have the originals, and I like it. The game isn't what it was before that interested alot of people, but I'd recommend it.			"

												As a game I've been playing on and off for almost 10 years now. This game gives me an intense sense of nostalgia, seeing the game transform from a grindfest based on who had to no life, to a grindfest to see who has the most real money items really makes me miss the times where being level 30 was a big deal. Maplestory is still a good game, just be prepared for an elitist and toxic community on par with League of Legends and Dota2.			"

												Game's okay 2/10Realistically, I really do love this game. I've played since closed beta and I always find myself coming back to it. There is one major problem though, Nexon America does a terrible job at maintaining the game. Maintenance hours will usually get extended. That is understandable. But what is inexcusable is how terrible the servers are. I have not had a day in the past month where I didn't disconnect fewer than eight times in a day. It is almost impossible to stay connected to the game. If there are days where I do stay connected, the game is extremely laggy and unresponsive. I find this unacceptable considering Nexon is a large company and the game has been around for over 10 years. Having stable servers should be a priority when hosting an online game. Until connectivity issues are fixed I cannot recommend this game to anyone. If I had to give this game a score on a scale of 1-10 it would be an 8 or a 9 but because I can't even stay connected long enough to play, I give it a 3-10			"

												As of this game i really enjoyed it when i was younger it was challenging and fun but now it felt really a grind heavy game only to make money not much of friends. The Soundtrack is probably 80% of this game now in my opinion it had a great shine when it was a smaller game now it's just dead. The game is slowly dying i recommend not to join this game.			"

												The game in general is not too bad. i played this game from the beginning with only the explorers, then stopped mid way. after going back to this game, the only bad thing i have to say is that its too easy. the classes are diverse and differnt, the animations look very impressive with each character skills, the sound/music is also not to bad either. The enviorment in the world of maplestory looks cool with alot of diverse monsters. speaking of monsters, the bosses and expedition bosses are hard, yet memorizing. yes, there has been alot of changes making this mmo easy and not as hard to lvl as before, but with a couple of friends, this isnt too bad. the controls and skill management is differnt then other mmos. for example some mmos uses the numbers, while in maplestory any button on your key can be used as an attack, potion, or other mangement. to me thats cool so its not so stiff and make it comforting to me. also the story is actual pretty in depth with every character they have and are introducing later on.still, the main quests are cool, but the quest around the world are pretty dull. most players grind in it, or do some party quests that are worth doing.also, dont judge this game becasue its 2D, because it really is a game full of experience and adventure. in the end, the pros are that the animations are cool, music and sound is cool, classes are pretty diverse and intresting, the enviroment looks fine for it being 2D, and the bosses are pretty impressive. cons are that its pretty easy, nobady really does the party quest, and the quests around the game is pretty boring. overall though, i would recommond this game.

												An extremely socially-geared game with a playerbase that consists mostly of children that use their parents money to buy in-game boosts and cosmetics. It's really in no way different from any other ""free to play"" korean MMO that have been excreted into the world by terrible companies like Nexon for well over a decade now, and it's not any better than when it first released in 2005.If you like socializing with bratty children, buying them presents to win their affection, and indulging in some light textual flirting: Play the game, you filthy pedophile.If you're looking for a genuinely enjoyable game that's worth your time: Leave and never look back.

												After reading other reviews and trying the game for a few hours i found the sad hard truth the this once great game truely was destroyed by yet another cash hungry company that think like little kids and can't help but be jerks with all the power going to their heads.Leveling is insanely easy, i reached level 35 in a mere few minutes but am now currently stuck in an island after being teleported ""For no apparent reason"" about some quests whice i skipped through cause quite frankly, no one gives a ♥♥♥♥!, im only here to the serious main quest line not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t side pieces of random mixed and matched jury rigged side ♥♥♥♥♥.With no explination to how to do anything remotely useful or generally not clear enough to understand i think i will continue hosting D&D games and use some of the content from this game and make proper use of it since i like the idea and want to use it.I feel like i truely missed something golden and have been left with the remains and i can't help but think of the happy memories many older maplers must of had, i wish i had been able to feel that for myself but it seems i came to late, the golden age is over.Most of the enemys are just reskins of each other and the worlds are so small its should have been an iphone game, picking up items is boring and takes forever, in whice enemys will respawn you will kill them and BOOM, more items, whice leads to an endless massive loot fix you will be sad to see as you are forced to eventully give up and leave most of it behind.I play Luminous, apparently a hero class whice i couldn't care less about since i ALWAYS play a sorcerer in any game i play, and i find most of the classes lacking or all feeling the same now.REGENS, oh ♥♥♥♥ don't get me started, you get 10 hp for standing still for 10 seconds, at level 20 you already have 2000 health, mana has a regen of 3 at 10 seconds, and my mana pool is already 7000, so im looking at 3 hours of standing still doing nothing for a near full regeneration. and iv heard mages mana pools go up to 30.000 to 50.000 near high levels, but regens don't increase to conpensate for this, there all fixed numbers instead of percentages, a very poor and lazy mechanic that any dev should be ashamed of.And on the final note a word to Wizet, you should have fought harder for your truely great game, my disapointment in you will never die or fade away, your a weak company and you should have been stronger, hurry up and get stronger and take your game back.

												I used to play this game years ago and when I found out it was still going with a strong player base, I wanted to try it out again. The latest update also sounded amazing.Unfortunately, I cannot play it. It won't load up. After uninstalling and reinstalling it, I was finally able to create an account to play with. However, the uninstall and reinstall didn't help with actually starting the game. It won't load up.All I get is the screen saying the game is starting. I get the security logo, then it disappears and soon after the loading screen disappears and I'm back in the steam page saying it's ""ready to play"".I've added it to my security exceptions, to my firewall, to my antivirus. Still won't run.I have no issues with any of my other games on steam, only MapleStory. Maybe this is a bug with the latest update. But there isn't any news about it anywhere I can find, especially here on steam. So, I thought I'd save other people the trouble and write this so other people don't waste 3-5 hours of their time trying to get it to run.			"

												It's ♥♥♥♥♥est game i've ever played. the worst update I have ever played in once a whileEven though it's trying to bring back the game, but unforantely it's got tons of free-to-play and in-game money in which I ♥♥♥♥ing hate. I would defentily play it again if they removed these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pay to win content. And yet, you really need to start making actual games rather than churing out billions of flappy bird play-to-win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and yet it's getting depressing that you guys are still doing it.The combat is pretty bad with all these unesscary numbers and stuff along with ♥♥♥♥ as huge FX which it hinders the view of the game, thus making it diffcult to see.Besides that, the game is so ♥♥♥♥ing outdated to the point where it does not need to be revied. Is this the same as bring back your dead pet that has died without any problems, bringing it back will make it worse and suffer. "

												I have played this game when I was younger, but one ""feature"" of it that I had forgotten about is rollback.After staying up until the wee hours of the morning playing, I, rather than logging out, had exited the game by closing the window. Bad choice.Maplesotry will /not/ save data locally - it will save it to their servers. Furthermore, this means that there is no autosave feature, you must manually preform a transaction within the game in order to trigger a save.Yes, I am salty and my review of the game will be effected by that, but Maplestory, from the very start, feels like what it is. Archaic. Big numbers for damage, lengthy grinds, enemies that are way too weak or way too strong.There will be another broken class, there will be a king of every scoreboard, and to even dream of hitting even close to the ranking or even just the position they are at in the game is unfathomable without obscene amounts of playtime.This game's appeal lies firmly in nonstalgia. If you've played this game in the past, then by all means, indulge. It's cute, it's fun in the moment, it's something to kill time with. They even have a class that immediatley starts you out as the equivalent of a dragon-winged sailor moon. But with the excruciating number of classes and areas and (in my thick-skulled opinion) VERY convoluted menues and maps - It might be better to go somewhere else for an MMORPG.I'll end with a quote from my skype group chat:""This game looks like trashRunescape looks betterI'm gonna go play Runescape""(Beware of games beaten out by Runescape.)

												controls are not as good as I try to get them, using the arrow keys makes it diffeclt to get used to and does not help with your wrist. joypad control options do not work and this game could have been a lot better if the movement keys were ""WASD"" and the skills/items were on the numbers. it could be better but i'm not staying to find out			"
