												Being a huge fan of the original Lone Wolf books, this was an instant purchase for me. I expected maybe 45 minutes to an hours worth of gameplay at most. Forge Replay haven't just created an interactive book with a few fancy pictures. They've crammed in an unbelievable amount of content: An in-depth character creation system. A superbly written story. Turn based, quick-time combat. Countless unlockables. A whopping 79 achievements, and so much more! I really hope to see more from these guys.For those of you who enjoyed the soundtrack, it's available here (official link) - https://soundcloud.com/93-steps/sets/joe-devers-lone-wolf-original "

												Outstandingly realised conversion of an interactive gamebook. It does away with the old cumbersome ""turn to page <whatever> to go left and <whatever> to go right"" (unlike the inferior conversions of the Games Workshop titles) with nice use of a direction selecting map. The combat is difficult at first but satisfying as you progress and become used to the many variations on its time-based system. You actually feel as if you are becoming physically and mentally more skillful the more you play. Every stage of the game works on choices and consequences but you never feel as if you are bogged down or distracted by the medium itself. All the dice rolls etc. are handled and masked by the software in such a way that you realise what is going on but the sytem never intrudes on your immersion. It's difficult to imagine how a game of this nature could have been accomplished in a way to make it any better than it actually is. Equipment can be improved through crafting and is customisable in such a way that the new benefits are clearly understood and actively felt. I want more like this and as long as you can keep in mind that it IS a conversion of a set system you should love it. Get it. 97%			"

												You play out certain actions as you read along the book about Lone Wolf character. Game has a good story, similar to Witcher series, you hunt monsters and protect lesser races.Combat is semi turn based, you attack within a time limit in which you can execute certain actions. If you abuse your rations the game will become harder, items have durability, what you do in game has consequences and will affect your progress. Camping / meditation will rejuv. your health\energy\kai - energy and also can draw enemies to attack you while sleep.You can upgrade gear, repair, collect money, use traders, use different weapons. Base stats affect combat and abilities. Each time you level, game recalls your actions, and uses them as a reference to increase your statistics at the end of a chapter or major events.Play time was about 35 hours from start to finish. "

												TLDR: Lone Wolf game ported from mobile to PC. Probably not going to satisfy those unfamiliar with Lone Wolf, and liking Lone Wolf isn't a guarantee you'll like it either. What should you pay for this if you were to get it? ~$5 to ~$7.It's been a real struggle, as a fan of Lone Wolf since grade school, whether to thumbs up or thumbs down this one. Ultimately I give it a thumbs down, based on price, and whether or not I think people would enjoy it. Despite several parts of the game that work, some don't, including the story which is a real problem for a game like this.  In the end, it's a mobile game with mobile limitations and a need to make Lone Wolf ""gamier."" My breakdown~OVERALL: The game presents well. The UI and Storybook look nice and flavorful, although the UI animations get obnoxious. The graphics and combat animations are nice while not being stellar. The music is good although there's very little of it so you'll be listening to the same tracks for the whole game. The sound effects are easily the weakest part of the game. Little variety to them and they all have little impact. Striking wounds in combat sounds like someone tearing a piece of paper quickly. The brief narration at chapter breaks is awkward as well.GAME BOOK ADAPATION: It doesn't stay very faithful to the game books in terms of mechanics. While this isn't all bad and they manage to add to game play rather than purely subtract from it, Lone Wolf loses a part of its identity when designed like most modern video games. You define your character at the game start according to whether they're bashy, sneaky or thinky. So right out of the gate you're greeted by what you see in a lot of other games: a strict list of choices guiding gameplay rather than staying open-ended. You pick 4 powers from the usual Kai Powers list, have Vitality, Endurance and Kai Power pools for taking hits, using melee attacks and using Kai Powers and the Sommerswerd. You level up based on the story decisions you make (again, Fighty, Sneaky or Thinky are the usual choices you get.) Sometimes your Kai powers offer you other story choices, and these are grouped under one of the three main attributes for experience purposes. You can master 3 different weapons which provides tweaks to their attacks. You do the same for the Sommerswerd. But those are just kinda tacked on. All in all, mechanically, the game was enough to get me to finish but it'll be years before I replay it, if ever.Secondly the game is very linear, even for a Lone Wolf game, but you can retread a lot of paths you chose not to take initially too. So there it also loses something in translation, where story paths in Lone Wolf are restrictive, and you're always moving forward. The choices you can't go back on in this game don't feel like they carry much weight. I don't feel much compulsion to go back and play as a Strength character, for example, or to find what that one room which mysteriously stopped being a choice was about. There are only a couple places in the game you can't go back to. All this retreading also becomes a problem for resources, because you can farm random encounters for the loot drops, just like most traditional video games. So where in the game books scarcity is a big part of your decision making, LW HD Remastered is your standard potion guzzling, resource hoarding affair. On normal you have to be screwing up pretty badly not be drowning in health potions, extra ammo and money. Making LW mechanically like other games robbed it of some urgency and danger.COMBAT - Being that this is a mobile game, combat comes down to three things: decision making on what ability to use or attack to launch, luck and Quick Time Events. This wouldn't be so bad, as combat early on is actually pretty challenging and the wrong choice at the wrong time will screw you, so these choices feel important. But there's two problems: 1) somewhere midgame, you start getting very overpowered and combat loses its teeth and 2) there is way, way too much combat. Playing through you can sense where combat is thrown in as filler often, as the text regularly goes into ""And then a bunch of Giaks and Drakkarim burst on the scene."" Where there might be interesting choices to make, puzzles to challenge your mind or just variety, combat is the substitue for all those things in LW HD. Dever had some great brain buster puzzles in the game books, but here the puzzles are a 3d cube you mess with to fit into a lock, and boss fights. A final gripe is that there are very few enemy types (for a PC game), so you'll be fighting the same couple of monsters with some reskinning and difficulty tweaks for most of the game. I wouldn't be so hard on combat if they'd used it more sparingly, but as it is the bulk of my 16 hours in game was spent doing that. STORY - As a long time Lone Wolf fan this is hard to say, but this is easily the weakest Lone Wolf story Dever has written.  It's kind of a drastic change from the usual LW story. Set sometime after Book 2 but before Book 10, LW is dealing with local problems in Sommerlund instead of fighting the war against the Darklords, since this is an interlude in the Magnakai quest. So compared to the usual LW story you:-Fight your way through almost all problems.-Don't really go anywhere other than your own backyard.-Aren't being constantly hunted, despite the text trying to make you feel you are.-Aren't being betrayed, despite the text raising the question often.-Aren't adventuring in a land filled with scumbags and traitors and spies.-Get motivations from the story to make you feel the pressure and the direness of the situation, except none of them work.-Get the least likeable character Lone Wolf has ever traveled with, who is annoying, the primary driver of the plot and is a bit of a Mary Sue. Do you enjoy reading about someone who disrespects your character, ignores all your advice, rarely thanks you for your constant sacrifices, disobeys all your strictures and basically without who the story almost wouldn't have a point? Well, saddle up! The narration is almost painfully selfaware of all this.I want to like the story, but it's just too weak and lacks the interesting and quality adventuring that made the Lone Wolf game books so good.  A lot of space is given over to people in the story, fleshing out characters whereas the LW books were all about YOU DOING STUFF. The game is recognizable as LW because of the setting, names and game book art (which tries to faithfully emulate Gary Chalk's work), not because of how it handles itself. Even the story choices you get to make seem uninspired for Dever, which are less about how you as a Kai get♥♥♥♥♥♥done, and more about how whatever you do inevtiably ends up in combat. Wrong choices feel even more hard coded, since QTEs replaced the game books dice rolls and are hard to fail. You're left with the choices that end up making combat easier or harder in some way. Combined with the linearity, and the story itself and how it's executed is probably one of the game's biggest disappointments. DURATION: I managed to get nearly 16 hours of it by milking the experience as long as I could. So probably 8 to 10  hours for most players. I got my money's worth there.So for Lone Wolf fans, maybe this is worth a look. It's undeniably Dever but it's just not that interesting of a story. I ended up liking the visuals and restylization of Lone Wolf (although those side burns look ridiculous) but after 10 hours it too became repetitive.Get this if you want to show your support for Dever and Lone Wolf, or because you really crave a new Lone Wolf experience. Just don't expect the same kind of rose-tinted enjoyment because it may not deliver.To everyone else....it's a mobile game ported to the PC that will probably underwhelm you and in my opinion, isn't representative of the quality that made the Lone Wolf books something people would make a game of.

												It may surprise some people to learn that, before playing Joe Dever’s Lone Wolf HD Remastered, I hadn’t heard of the series or the author. A quick Google revealed that Joe began writing the Lone Wolf books back in the late 80s’, and the character has also made appearances in videogames and gamebooks – the novels alone have sold over 9 million copies!  Lone Wolf HD casts you as the titular character,  the mysterious Liege Lord of Sommerlund. A ruler of his people, who has sworn to protect them from any threat, no matter how big. But don’t be fooled by this description or the screenshots floating around the internet, Lone Wolf HD is a text-heavy gamebook first and foremost, and a turn-based RPG second.You start off by customising the Lone Wolf to your liking, choosing his skills and traits which you’ll be able to use during the game to overcome difficult situations. The game quickly launches into its lore, telling of a snowy, mountainous land reminiscent of games like Skyrim.The village of Rockstarn has been set ablaze, her people murdered and their belongings stolen. You soon discover that a foul horde of Giaks is responsible for this heinous crime. With your sword in hand you set about thinning out their numbers, whilst looking for survivors and clues as to why this has happened. These sequences take two forms: turn based combat, and choice-driven story. As you progress through the game, you will be presented with meaningful choices, and how you approach them can benefit you or come back to haunt you later in your quest. Every dilemma gives you a number of choices, each relevant to a particular skill you may or may not have mastered. While some situations call for a more direct approach, others may require tact on your part, to achieve the desired results.The Lone Wolf’s story is of epic proportions, and you’ll travel across Sommerlund to take the fight to Giak hordes and their masters. Your map is marked with various locations and merchants where you can stock up on provisions. Exploring each location furthers the story and takes you deeper into your quest to find out why the people of Rockstarn have been murdered. The land is overrun with enemies though, and you’ll have to lay waste to them to protect your people.Combat is turn-based and you must complete your attacks within a time limit, after which the enemy will begin their assault. You’ll go up against a variety of different beasts during your quest, ranging from bog-standard Giaks to their superiors, the formidable Drakkarim, and the terrifying Red Fang. Lone Wolf has a number of powerful attacks in his arsenal to overcome his foe, as well as various arms and side arms. You’ll also be able to call upon your Kai power, a kind of mental ability that only few have a mastery of, to launch debilitating psychological attacks. The options available to you are also linked directly to the skills you chose during the game’s opening, so it is worth keeping that in mind when choosing your skills. Combat is quick, fluid and fun, but it’s a shame that some special moves require quick cursor rotations or directional flicks. Undoubtedly, this would have been responsive and intuitive in the iOS version of the game, but on PC it feels a little bit clunky and un-optimised. That’s not to say it spoils the combat, but the thought that your cursor movements might not have been accurate enough is always there. While the combat is engaging it serves merely to break up long sections of the book and, ultimately, you’ll be anxious to get back to reading it.And what a book it is. Mr Dever’s mastery of his craft is immediately apparent, as he weaves a complex but approachable tale filled with interesting characters and locations. His masterful descriptions created images so rich in my minds-eye that I could almost feel the heat, and smell the acrid smoke, of Rockstarn as it burned to the ground. You will spend most of your time reading, so be aware that the only GPU getting a workout won’t be inside your computer, it’s inside your head. It’s at this point that I should disclose that I am not much of a reader, but found Joe Dever’s Lone Wolf HD Remastered to be an addictive and gripping tale. I’d encourage anyone with even a passing interest in fantasy books to give The Lone Wolf some of their time.As an iOS port, I wasn’t expecting much from the game graphically, and, truth be told, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. While the menus, book and illustrations are all rendered nicely, the 3D combat sections do suffer from some graphical disparity. The Lone Wolf and his enemies all feature detailed animations and textures, but the surroundings they’ll be fighting in are low-resolution and low-poly. Luckily, these jarring differences are offset by how brief combat tends to be. The game’s score can’t be faulted though, and while there’s only a handful of unique tracks they run from rousing to melancholic, and are played at suitable intervals – it’s also included in your download for your listening pleasure!Whilst it does have its drawbacks, Joe Dever’s Lone Wolf HD Remastered is a stunning example of the gamebook genre, brought to life on PC. Featuring an engrossing mix of story and turn-based combat, it’s sure to appeal to people with an appreciation of a deep lore. Completionists will also get bang for their buck, with the choice-driven narrative lending itself well to replayability. For the Sommerlund and the Kai, you must buy this game!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Review code provided by publisher.

												As a kid, I loved the Lone Wolf book series.  These books were my first introduction real RPGs.  So when I tripped over this during the Thanksgiving Sale, you can imagine my excitement.Friends and fans of the old-fashioned adventure books, it does not dissapoint.The game basically plays like an alternate version/continuation of the Lone Wolf adventure book series.  While a newcomer to the series might feel a touch lost, the opening sums things up beautifully and character creation is a breeze.  Everything is so clear and concise.  Most importantly though, *your choices actually matter*!Much like the original books, every decision you make reverberates through your adventure.  I'm only starting the second chapter, but I am thouroughly hooked, weighing each choice carefully before I make it.  Especially when said choices can impact the combat encounters.Oh yes, the combat.  If you're a fan of Paper Mario or South Park: Stick of Truth, this should feel rather familiar.  Select target, choose an attack, maybe do a quick-time event for more damage.  All turn-based, pretty standard stuff (though the graphics are absolutely GORGEOUS!).  But the biggest draw to combat is how it ties to your choices leading up to it!You spot a group of enemies.  Do you sneak up on them?  Charge in and try to catch them off-guard?  Spend some of your limited supernatural power to try and sneak past them?  Whatever choice you makes carries into the combat, rendering enemies weaker or even avoiding combat all together if you choose well, or possibly giving them a chance to strike first if you fail at your attempt.  And just like in the books, while combat can be exciting, you feel the limit of your health and items.  The game feels very rewarding when the right choice leads to an easier fight.I cannot stress this enough:  If you ever liked the Lone Wolf books, get this game.  If you're a fan of RPGs in general and you've never heard of the Lone Wolf books, go read about them on TVTropes or something and then *GET THIS GAME.*  You're not just buying an immersive game, you're paying homage to a piece of Roleplaying history.

												I've played this game all the way from the time when it was still being released by episodic on iOS. The gameplay certainly is different from what one may be used to if one has played the original gamebooks. I was surprised at first, but eventually find that this is quite a refreshing way to explore the world of Lone Wolf.Artwork is absolutely gorgeous! Loved seeing Lone Wolf actually portrayed in his full glory for the first time ever, albeit still in his early years as a Kai Lord. The transition from paper to 3D and back is a great touch. Battle backgrounds are varied according the player's location when attacked.The soundtrack is pretty good as well, well suited for the environment and events. They add to the mystique, danger, sorrow of whichever fortunate, or unfortunate event that occurred in the game world.Battles require players to understand the mechanism and adapt to something completely different from the gamebooks. It also may seem repetitive, but personally, I feel that it's unavoidable for a game of this caliber. The freedom of movement and random battles aim to help the player to get used to fighting a certain enemy, gain items and gold, as well as provide the player with the ability to have some control over moving in an area. It allows the player to break free from the typical gamebook linearity where they must perform certain XYZ actions at a specific time, and no other (i.e. purchase from merchants. or training skills).A lot of balancing changes have been made to the battle system since it was first released. I find it quite well balanced compared to initial release. Some battle elements appear to be random, unfair and hard, but if one played the original gamebooks properly (i.e. without cheating), one may find themselves on the verge of death or dying quite often as well.Not a fan of QTEs, but I feel that this game has it done right for the general user. They are doable as long as the player remembers what QTE action is required for which combat skill. The QTEs are fixed for almost every battle action, and events (as long as you can memorize the QTEs every event in the game). The controls are intuitive for the mouse, and does not impose strict directional movements on the player (i.e. the swipe does not have to be a definite 45 degree semi-circular movement to be executed).Statistics can rise depending on the actions the player decides to take during an event. Repeated usage of weapon skills will eventually lead to an additional bonus for that particular skill. Crafting to improve weapons, armours and certain items are a welcome surprise. (I only miss my Sommersack from the iOS). There are some puzzles in the game to give variety, but not that much that it takes too much from the gameplay.This is certainly an interesting way to breath life into a gamebook, what with many other companies already creating digital gamebooks that adhere more or less to the standards of a paperback (i.e. dice-rolling, turn to page ###).Sure, it's not perfect (seriously, what is?), but a truly excellent work from both the original creator of Lone Wolf, and the developer of this game.

			Launch trailer for PC/Mac version of Joe Dever's Lone Wolf. Lone Wolf is back, as a video game series with a brand-new story, a new combat system, stunning graphics and much more!		

Ok so lets get to it then,in this visual novel/choose your own adventure game (which this game is at heart-but there is lots more to it-WHICH I'LL GET TO LATER) your going to be doing a lot of reading and if that's one thing you dont like then to be honest i wouldent really bother with this game.Why??,it deal's with its narative through the written word and if your not paying attention then at time's you will miss out on important plot detail's and written conversation's that lead you to choose different choices based on what you just read.(OK STILL WITH ME LETS CARRY ON THEN) If that sound's ok and you like this sort of game then your in for a treat as this is one of the best this genre has to offer.So what does the game play like apart from the reading then and why is is different to others of its ilk???,well you do read and make choice's but you will also be picking lock's,upgrading equipment,solving puzzle's using the Shianti Cube (which is something you come across on your journey) and (which is the best part of the game) FIGHTING the Darkland's horde.Now all the gameplay you will come across has been implemented really well and even though the fight's do rely on QTE's a lot they really are the stand out moment's of the game and you will (on many occasion's-on any difficulty other than easy) find yourself outnumbered with only your quick action's to save your skin.When you start to fight will you use the Sommerswerd to gain an early advantage??,will you use a physchic mind blast to stun the enemy??,will you communicate with the wolf's and get them to attack??,will you take a defensive stance??,will you enhance your weapon?? ECT-ECT (i think you get what i mean).Any desicion you make will effect the outcome and either bolster your chance's or help to see you meeting an untimely end,and this element not only effect's combat but is also pivotal to the story as well because when you do make a decision you have to live with it as the game auto save's so make sure you choose to do the right thing (IS THERE A RIGHT THING IN THIS GAME????????)The following is a gameplay video which shows the sort of things you will be doing in game -Joe Dever's Lone Wolf HD Remastered Gameplay(PC ...

			Joe Dever's Lone Wolf HD Remastered Gameplay PC.This Joe Devers Lone Wolf HD Remastered Gameplay include:review,pc gameplay,first quest,cutscenes and combat.		

The graphic's in game range from the static variety when your reading (which serve as a background whilst you are reading) to some really good graphic's when your fighting and solving puzzle's with the Shianti cube or picking lock's.And it's whilst fighting the horde that the graphic's shine as you really want to see that final killing blow on that Vordak Undertaker that's been causing you problem's for the last hour AARRGGHHHHHHHH.Every encounter will play out different'ly and the animation for the horde is different enough that they all have their own animation's for attack pattern's and also (which is the best point) their own death scene's (at your hand's) as they all die in various way's.Some animation's do repeat themselves but to be honest none of them outstay their welcome and each and every victory is as satisfying as the last (especially when you take down that Gourgaz thats been beating you senseless for the last hour ""GO AWAY YOU BIG LIZARD"").The soundtrack that accompanies the game can only be desribed as epic and really does help make the game feel like the adventure that it is and should be,and even whilst reading it never annoy's to the point where you want to switch it of.Actually i for one found the soundtrack to be a welcome addition and it wouldent feel out of place in any RPG game or Fantasy movie,and as is mostly the case in a game like this it just wouldent be the same without it.The story really does do justice to the source material and fit's into the cannon perfectly,and if like me your a fan then you will appriciate it no end and you will both an once enjoy the familiar in the story and also the new that's been added as well.Will you need to have previous experience with this style of game and even know the story to enjoy it ????????Well having played the game and reached its conclusion and being that i am such a fan i would say yes and no to that statement.Now i would say no as the story is written so well that it just pull's you in and at no point's does it loose anyone who is'nt familiar with its background or the character's,and it both introduces them and the history of Lone Wolf's world with a confident flair and ease that is there for all to see.And i would say yes as at the same time if you've come to the game with knowledge of what's going on before the game takes place,then you will get even more out of your time with it than if you hadent,and if your like me you will love to see the Sommerswerd raised and used to crush the Darkland horde's (especially the Vordaks-you undead pains in the AR__,NOW-NOW calm down its just a game)Now this is not the first game to have been based on the Lone Wolf series of book's and there have been other's but i remember one that i really did want to play but sadly it never did get a release date and actually it ended up being canned.Here is a trailer for the game that sadly never was.Gameplay from a cancelled lone wolf game -Lone Wolf:Flight from the Dark Game Developers SF 2008 ...

Okay now all's said and done would you like to play this game reading and making choices and fighting the Darkland horde's,and will you get anything out of it ??????Well read and answer the following three question's and decide for yourself -1 - Am i the sort of person who like's a fantasy tale full of foul creature's and dark magic?????2 - Do i like playing and reading through a visual novel style game (even with all it's enhancement's over other's of its type)?????3 - Am i the sort of person who really (and i mean REALLY) like's to put the effort into reading so i can gain from such a well written and fullfilling journey into Lone Wolf's world?????If you can answer yes to the above question's and want to stop the foul Darkland horde's and crush GUNZAR (which is no easy feat-""OH MY GOD HERE WE GO AGAIN""),and just like me you are really a fan of Lone Wolf and his world then ""BY KAI"" what are you waiting for??But if this doesnt sound like you and no matter how many enhancement's and extra's they throw at the visual novel format you just arent going to get anything from this type of game,then to be honest you would be better of buying another fantasy game such as ""THE WITCHER 2"" (great game by the way)			"

												First of all, this is not a ""common"" videogame. Joe Dever's Lone Wolf is a ""digital"" gamebook. If you don't know what a gamebook is, google it, search a gameplay on youtube or you could be disappointed.Don't expect something like Dark souls, Witcher or Assassin's creed. Is Joe Dever's Lone Wolf enjoyable ? Yes, if you accept the genre it's nice and quite addictive Pros:Nice story Nice writing style Combat system is nice, really deepNice minigames, the lock-picking is better than the skyrim's minigame :V  Tons of choices Puzzles are amazingPage turning physics, I'm not joking it's adorable. Cons: Can't skip intro\animations\cut-sceneI wish they added more animationsCombat system is a bit repetitive Looks like the game is designed for tablet, rarely controls are a bit awkward, but it's perfectly playable with a mouseGraphics is a bit outdated Only a few kinds of enemies  TL;DR It's not a game for everyone, if you like gamebooks, you'll probably like this game, if you have no idea what a gamebook is, then it's kinda hard to say, wait for a sale and give it a try,if you are looking for an action don't even consider this game, press ctrl+f4 and search for something else.

												I have been a loooong time follower of Joe Dever and the Lone Wolf series of gamebooks (including Grey Star, Freeway Warrior series and more). When I first saw the android release of this game I jumped on it to add it to my collection and found it didn't play up to its potential on my android tablet. Then all of a sudden, I see this... beautiful gem released on the PC. It's slick, smooth, beautiful, atmospheric and worth every bit I paid for it. Combat can be hectic, but you get used to it after awhile. Music is haunting. The storytelling is superb. The illustrations and 3d art are impressive. Awesomeness rolled up into a nice neat package.This game did a wonderful job of revitalizing my love for this series and hope you can get a glimpse into this fascinating world. Outside of the game, you can continue the journeys of Lone Wolf by visiting: http://www.projectaon.org/  and downloading the gamebooks in various forms, extra material, etc. (for FREE, thanks to the generosity of Joe Dever and the hard work of the wonderful folks on the AON Project). For Sommerlund! For the Kai!

												This is a recommendation that borders right on the 50ish out of 100 score, making it a toss-up between 'buy this' or 'don't buy this'.  Keeping in mind that I have yet to pass five or so hours in game yet and this is based only on the first chapter, my biggest problem is this.There is so.  Much.  RNG.  Restating, there is nothing wrong with Random Number Generator-based anything.  Every game relies on RNG.  Sometimes your attack goes through, sometimes it's blocked, sometimes it's parried, sometimes you get lucky, sometimes not.  The problem with Lone Wolf is how shatteringly screwed you can be by the RNG, and there is not a single thing you can do about it.  The fighting consists of two phases for you; an attack phase and a rest phase.  During your attack phase, a timer ticks down how long you have to make your attacks, drink your potions, etc.  You can do multiple things per turn, until you eat up all your END (physical actions), MANA (magic actions) or run out of time.  Your END recovers very slowly during your attack phase and very quickly during your rest phase, with your MANA barely recovering at all until you kill an enemy.  However, while YOU cannot attack in your rest phase, enemies can attack ALL THE TIME, operating on their own (hidden) attack and rest phases.  You can and will be interupted while you go to select an attack by an enemy launching his attack first, preventing you from acting on a strategy or idea.RNG as I already stated is beyond intolerable at times.  The very first attack launched against you, you might dodge.  Or  it can stun you, you lose your turn, and are unable to act while enemies deal 1500 damage to you (very realistic damage, considering even within the first 3-4 battles they start throwing 3 enemies at a time at you).  Or you might dodge all these attacks and then launch your own POWERFUL attack on an enemy.  He might take the hit and lose 50% of his health, or he might counter it, take 10% damage, and you have just wasted 50% of your END, better luck next time.The point of this is that it boils down to the right set of circumstances happening to let you succeed.  Being stunned in turn 1 can sometimes be an instant game-over, as you lose your turn and are reduced to nearly no HP and struggling to recover.  5 minutes into the fight, you might be selecting your sword to kill an enemy when he swigs back a potion (Even basic enemies have potions, by the way, hope you don't mind your fodder healing themselves), and he now has more HP than you can dish out, preventing you from killing him, preventing you from replenishing your mana, preventing you from healing the next round, meaning you died.And this is all topped off with the fact that you can restart every battle from the beginning.  So what happens?You restart.  A lot.Not even from dying, either.  Enemy dealt a shattering crit on their first move?  Restart, this time you parry it.  Enemy stunned you at the wrong time?  Restart, hope that doesn't happen this time.  I have had cases where I have restarted certain fights upwards of 15-20 times until the RNG simply decided it was a good time to let me win, and the enemies didn't pull any shenanigans and my attacks went off without a hitch.Bottom line of all this: The game is pretty and sounds nice, fantastic.  But the gameplay itself suffers horrendously not because of actual mechanics, but because all the behind-the-scenes calculations rely entirely on a very erratic RNG system that can leave you decimating your enemies easily or getting royally screwed over on your very first turn.  If you buy this game, be prepared to accept that a great deal of your time will involve slamming that ESC key, restarting the battle, and just praying that RNGesus is kind to you this time.			"

												As a fan of this saga i had to buy this game...at first i was a little doubtful, cause it was a mobile game but, once played, i found a great turn based rpg. The books saga was strongly focused on survival choice, the game instead is more oriented on combat (so, expect a little farm time...and it's great for a game born as an application for smartphone!!!). On hard, the game require +-20 hours, including farming for equip/secondary missions, and it's kinda challanging (good to know still be proving on easy too)Pro:It's Lone Wolf and conserve a part of the saga's spiritWell designed interface and good looking graphicWell structured strategic combat system Combat style is CustomizableLevel Up based on your choiceCon:Not so many paths like the booksSixth Sense can easy resolve the amazing puzzlesSorry for my english, i'm not native.

												I've been a fan of Joe Dever's Lone Wolf books since they came out 31 years ago, and this game is an awesome continuation of the character and the franchise. It is mostly a choose-your-own adventure, with many skirmishes / combats sprinkled throughout the story. The combat system is a cute variation on standard ARPG: after choosing your action, movements of the mouse determine success/failure (pay attention when monsters attack you for your chance to dodge / block!).If you know the character, this is a great new story with Lone Wolf. If you don't know the character, it's still a fun gamebook in computer form, with _many_ hours of play and branching paths to explore. Either way, it's a win-win!!			"

												I am enjoying Lone Wolf having never played an interactive novel. Playing on hard level is challenging. But you can replay from the beginning of battle or restart from last camp check point. Then re-think load out (potions) and choice of action leading to next battle. The use of keybinding and mouse clicks seem to make battles more fluid then just mousing around body parts and clicking to execute action. I think it's worth a play. I picked up Lone Wolf during sale and feel money was well spent.			"

												Generic fantasy mobile port with 'tap the screen' action prompts.  It seems clear this game was made for tablets and no work was done to make it PC friendly.  Even if you switch the options to use keyboard commands it shows mouse gestures instead of whatever the keyboard option was supposed to be.  Music consists of out of combat song and in combat song.  You'll be sick of those in less than an hour like I was.  Unfortunately, I bought this in a bundle or I would refund it.			"

												The game is average, but it has its own uniqueness. Its like an interactive book with multiple tools to get the job done with slight variation to how the game unfolds.The narative is stylish and done close to how the upcoming 'Hand of Fate' is done, but is somewhat different. Its fancy, rich in details and vivid, making it really easy to picture the events unfolding. Seriously its like an ok fantasy book.Now the problems with the game are shallow crafting and loot systems, repetitive combat, customisation and soundtrack. The combat is semi turn based and is somewhat confusing for the 1st 3-6 minutes, then after a few hours of slaying monsters it gets rather repetitve and boring also easy *if you have chosen the perks right* or are willing to use potions. Crafting system exists but other then the 'inventory increase' the changes the crafted gear brings are minimal. The 'various weapons' are not so various at all its the same 3 weapons with slightly different stats and sometimes a different model. Now the animations are done well *even the comical faces of enemies during the mana restoration finishers* and the gameplay is on the point fluid, but with little variation to it it eventually will get dull no matter what. Too many battles with too little variation. Soundtrack was distracting and filled with disturbing background noises of a muted phone under a pillow a few meters away. Overall its a solid game, definite few hours of fun, unless  you are impartial to the storytelling narrative, which this game does great. Overall easy 6-7/10. Worth a puchase when its on sale.			"

												I'd never heard of Lone Wolf 24 hours ago. I paid $7.49 for this game, and it was beyond worth it. I've played just under thirty minutes. This game feels great. You get to create a customized character in minutes, those choices immediately affect the story you are reading and the combat you will face. The story events are between old school text based adventures and quick time events. It blends your decisions with your actions beautifully. The turn based combat doesn't let you walk away. You have limited time and resources to take actions, so you need to make snap decisions. To be effective you need to stay calm and focused. This makes the combat thrilling, and did I mention this game looks pretty too. The way they blend art from the book into the combat sequences is stunning. The graphics aren't what you would see on a next gen console, but they look good. As far as animation is concerned, I have to say they nailed it. From throwing knives to having your chest slashed open, the models move fluidly. I definitely recommend picking Lone Wolf up if you have $10 to spare.Edit: Now that I have almost ten hours under my belt, I would like to expand this review a little bit. I started another character because I didn't see how it was possible to survive without certain skills. Turns out I was wrong. You can definitely take whatever starting skills you are interested in trying. Sometimes enemies will wreck your day. When it happens, you may not even get to defend yourself because it is absolutely possible to become stun locked. It isn't likely, and because the game uses a random element, it is also completely possible for you to dodge every attack in a fight. You will probably die a couple of times during a fight that you are prepared for due to bad luck. It makes it far more rewarding when you try again and slaughter your enemies. If you really get stuck, the game even has the option to drop the difficulty a step when you retry. I should also talk about replay value after making a second character. It's okay. If you choose different skills at the beginning of the game, and you try taking another path through each of the obstacles in the game, then it isn't too repetitive. Many of the fights will be the same or nearly the same unless you had the option to avoid one completely. When you know what you are doing, you can definitely work through the fights faster, and it feels like you are accomplishing something rather than grinding because the story actually moves as you cut down your enemies. I can't say how long a run through this campaign should take. I just set the game on hard, turned off hints, and charged into the fray.			"

(Some people may love this, but I'm personally not a big fan of reading books)			"

												If you liked the Lone Wolf series back in the 80's, this is probably a childhood fantasy come to life.  Be aware, this is an interactive book with more reading than anything else, but it is as well written as ever when it comes to Joe Dever's style.  Reading is separated by quick-time events - whether it's the combat system itself (there is a slight bit more to it than quick-time like picking what type of attack etc.) or an action event where you have to quickly react after you've made a questionable decision.  As for everything else, you start off by choosing your gimmicks (animal kinship, camoflouge, mindblast, etc.) just like the good ole' days and it takes off from there.  The page artwork is fantastic (black & white pencil sketches like the books, but brought to life), and the combat uses 3D with pretty good quality models and environments.  Music is dynamic and quite well done (title screen reminded me of Loreena McKennitt).  All in all, I give it two thumbs up (graciously donated by the the Giak I just killed).			"

												I really disliked the first half of the game, as it is fairly combat heavy and it took a while for combat to click (both subjectively, in that I didn't quite get the mechanics and QTE flow, and objectively, as you don't have a lot of options and kinda suck when the game starts)It's been a while since my opinion of the game turned around quite so much, from a slog I had to endure to an addictive romp I had to tear myself away from. Recommended, if you don't mind the slow start.More detailed impressions here[xander77.livejournal.com].			"

												Overall I like the game a lot. I loved the books, so that's not too surprising. It's heavily story based, but it's a very interesting story.  I like the artwork a lot, and the combat is unique and interesting.I wish the menu animations could be sped up or turned off.It gives you a choice during character creation of ""you prefer a straightforward approach, though it is often reckless"", ""you carefully assess the details before overcoming any obstacle"", or ""you rely on your dexterity and intuition""Well, I picked carefully assess the details. Now when I level up I tend to get a bunch of intelligence and not much str/dex. Coincidence?I guess that makes my somerswerd powers better and my psi-attack, but I probably use my sword skills much more often. I just wanted to be a fighter who was smarter than ""THAG SMASH RRRARRGGGH""			"

												This is pretty good, provided you know what you're getting into.Lone Wolf was a series of fantasy gamebooks written by Joe Dever in the 80s. Since then the books have been reprinted a few times in various languages, and have even been made available for free with the author's consent on https://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Books . If this is not immediately made apparent further down this apologetic review, I loved these books and I'm quite pleased to see their universe transition into video game form. Rather than being an adaptation of one of the books, this game is an original story taking place somewhere between books 3 and 4.Originally a mobile game, this PC port is still mostly a gamebook with QTE-based combats thrown in, meaning there's more reading than action in there - so if you're waiting for a full-fledged RPG you're going to be seriously disappointed. However, as an expanded gamebook, it works pretty well, and that's coming from someone who usually despises QTEs.The writing is on par with the original books (which is to be expected, since Dever wrote the game's script as well), and the gameplay has a lot of similarities as well. You get to make choices along the way which alter the events of the story, though the instant game overs from the books are far less common here. One of the interesting features the books had were the skills you could select at the beginning (among an assortment of classic ranger stuff like tracking, hiding, talking to animals, and the famous ranger core-skills, telekinesis and psionic blasts), with corresponding skillchecks throughout the story. The books provided a random number table to pinpoint in case the reader didn't have a D10 to resolve the skillchecks (combat worked more or less the same way). The exact same skills are back in this game, but here you have to resolve them with QTEs, which when you think about it is not very different from trying to frantically pin numbers from some table with a pen.Combat is mostly real-time with pause and QTEs as well (except in Hard, where it's real-time with nope enemies can still attack you when you think), but you'll also have to manage the character's stamina, attacks cooldowns, and debuffs. Classic post-2010 RPG stuff, the devs probably liked their Dark Souls and Witchers, but the combats flow nicely and it's all that counts. These combats are numerous, though enemy variety is extremely low (5 different enemies with a couple variants, including bosses, throughout the game), but I had no problems with it since it mimics the books pretty well - in the first couple books you fought plenty of Giaks, Drakkarim and Vordaks (the same enemies you find in this game). Some encounters can be quite hard, I had a few run-ins with Gourgaz where they basically one-shot me in the first 5 seconds, but here again, bonus points for book fidelity, where Gourgaz were one-shotting [illegitimate offspring - thanks wordfilter] as well.The adventure is quite long for a gamebook, definitely longer than the later books of the series anyway (which, as far as gamebooks go, were already huge bricks), it took me a dozen hours to finish it and I'll probably play it again to try alternate paths and builds, so there is quite a bit of playtime-to-be here. My only major complaints are the artsyle, which really screams 2010s (once again, Dark Souls and Witcher got there before, but it's not really a major complaint anyway), while Gary Chalk's original illustrations had a distinctly British and somewhat goofy flair that is not present there. But it's somewhat close to the Mongoose reprints' covers (barring Lone Wolf's ridiculous sideburns and edgy victory poses, but they provided well-needed hilarity moments in an overall grim story), so at least it doesn't come out of nowhere. Oh, there's also the economy, which makes absolutely no sense and is really as far from the books as you can get (this one actually is a major complaint). Gone are the days of the 5 GP for a sword, 3 for a healing potion, here you'll be shelling dozens of coins to sharpen the edge of a blade. Now this did break the spell of the good old days, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the game anyway.So, to sum it up.+ Great fidelity to the source material+ Good length, with added replayability+ Nice extras (in-game menus, PDF artbook, OST)- Low enemy variety- Repetitive gameplay (which I didn't mind)- Mediocre economy and crafting mechanics- Lots of farming needed in harder difficulties7/10 if you're a fan of the series (I'd even say 8, but I have a tendency to overrate things, especially anything Lone Wolf-related), 5/10 otherwise - you won't find much here unless you're willing to go out of your way to learn about this series.

Posted: December 7, 2014
												After having played Lone Wolf for 10 hours, I have decided to write a review for the first time since I joined steam. My intent in doing so is to share my view, with my fellow gamers, that this game deserves to be played and enjoyed.When I saw Lone Wolf on the main page I immediately had a flashback of the books that I used to read/play when I was a kid. This being said, I was prudent before buying because the last thing I wanted was to experience a disapointment that would taint my memory of such a great experience I had playing these books. I was especially worried about the Quick Time Events (QTEs), as I really hate those in a game (QTEs usually means a shortcut to me, one that the developper took instead of developping a combat system for example) This being said, I didnt want this game to be a hack/slash either. So I took a chance after having read the positive reviews.The game is essentially split in two parts: Reading the story and making choices, based on your stats and character's specifics, and combat/action events. The story itself is true to the Lone Wolf books. Well written, engaging, and detailled enough so that you can perceive or visualize the envrionement in which you evolve. There are also pretty cool pictures once in a while. The choices you make in the story determines where you go, who joins or assist you, what loot you may get, and how you engage in fights.The combat and action events takes you out of the story format and brings you into a live event where you see yourself fighting enemies. The combat is similar to a turn based like Final Fantasy (time bar until it is your turn). When it is your turn, you have a certain time to execute as many actions as you want/can based on your endurance and energy points. It is here that you need to be smart to efficiently determine when and how you will play certain moves and how you will combine them to maximize their efficiency. The enemies are hard but not unfair. If you die, it is because you should probably have spent that endurance on a defensive move rather than that other move. Some people say QTEs are unfair in combat, because, yes, sometime if you miss one, it results in the enemy landing a more heavy hit. I personally see this as a test of your reflex (which evidently you would have to show in combat or any combat game) The QTEs becomes rather easy after a while anyway. I currently play on normal and find the difficulty just right.The character developments is also more complex than I originally thought. It seems your stats raises based on what choices you make during certain acts. For example, if you make a choice that would result on a action based on your dexterity, it will result in a better chance for you to increase your dexterity at the end of the act. Also, the more you use certain skills, the more these will level up, granting you more bonuses in those skills. You can also collect items to forge and level up your equipment. It is not a deep item crafting system, but it keeps you on your toes to manage your item and money. The bonuses to upgrading your equipment are essential. Overall, great engaging story, good enough fighting system for a game based on books, great music (really). I will replay many times to try out different skills combination.  "

												Being a fan of the Lone Wolf books since the 80's so I may be biased with my quick review.For me it reads like a great Joe Dever RPG that he is so well known for. The fighting aspects of the game are very well done and involving. The quests within the story are very well put together.Being Lone Wolf in the world of Magnamund is a must for any fan of his work and the studio that have worked so hard to get it right have done a terrific job. Well done to all involved.Even if you are not familiar with Lone Wolf and the world of Magnamund you will not be disappointed. Give it a try and be one with the Kai.			"

Posted: December 3, 2014
												Have you ever heard of the books that this game is based on?  If not I highly recommend you engage in one of the best Choose your Own Adventure series of all time.  This game is based on one of my favorite fantasy worlds of all time.  And I say that without attempting to establish a bias.  Without lying, I am a total fan of the books and have wanted the IOS copy of this game for some time.  I just never had a phone that could run it.  That being said, I jumped on this as soon as it was available.  So was it worth it?Thus far, the issues that people may have with this game, is the fact that you are essentially, reading a modernized version of one of the choose your own adventure books.  There is no real vocal nararation outside of the introduction to each chapter.  Beyond that, you the player will be reading the book, and interacting with all the choices and game mechanics in a sort of quick time event laden skill test.  Now let me start by saying I hate quick time events.  I hate them.  But in this case, given the IOS port nature of the game, they are a tolerable evil, that still works with the game.I have not played the game to date on any difficulty below the hardest... and in doing so, I have found that I literally have to budget a strategy in fights down the the precise second of battle where I need to drink a potion.  Unfortunately, I have had a couple of moments where the games RNG has decided that I would not even get to take a turn as soon as battle starts before the enemy slaughters me with no quarter.  There is a heavy element of RNG, so I am not entirely keen on the idea of that being the only real difficulty.  There is a lack of music variety, but what you get is good quality stuff.  The sound effects are also not ear sores.  The game also seems to come into a length of around two and a half to three hours per Act, with four Acts to complete the whole game.  That is a base estimate, it can easily be done faster, and again, I am on the hardest difficulty, so I am certain the game can be cleared much faster on the easier stuff.All and all this is a completely solid IOS port, fully playable with virtually no gameplay related issues, except for how the touch spots work.  The example is during combat, you can turn the combat, and the ""touch spots"" where you have to clic k to bring up your menus move with the joints they are attached too.  So lone wolf's sword has a touch spot half way on the blade.  As the sword moves, so does the touch spot, and if you rotate the camera to certain angles, the touch spot can end up overlapping other touch spots.  Not the best system, but it is at least functional, and tolerable without any really devistating moments where it screwed me out of a victory.I like this game, I find it worth the price of admission considering as a choose your own adventure, there are multiple possible routes through the game that can give alternating storylines.  Its interesting, but admitantly, might not be for everyone since you are literally reading a choose your own adventure novel.  Check it out, and if you are curious about where it comes from, check this link out: http://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Books  This is the site where you can play the entire book series leading up to the events of the game. Sub note, you don't need to have read the books to enjoy the game.  It just helps :D			"

												You might have heard about Lone Wolf a long time ago, back when books were only on paper. It was also part of the pretty interesting genre of Choose Your Own Adventure that made you play a game while reading, perfect to get kids interested. I was pretty surprised to see a Lone Wolf video game, almost 25 years after I enjoyed some of those books.The game itself is a mobile port but it's actually pretty solid, it would not look like a mobile game if you removed those touchscreen controls. Everything is using the mouse like if it was your finger but it's really responsive and forgiving. Not once did I felt like I was playing a mobile game.The game is pretty unique, at its core it is an rpg with stats, abilities and inventory but it comes in two parts. The book is like a Visual Novel, a lot of text, some choices and very rare quick time events with some of those choices. Then there is the battle portion of the game where you use motions and clicks to battles some enemies. There are also two quick minigames, lockpicking and a puzzle cube. The book visuals are pretty sharp and stylished then the battle graphics are colorful and pretty detailed for a 15$ mobile port.The book portion is pretty linear, sometimes you have two or three paths but in the end they will all lead to the same end. There are multiple choices that affect the text but often also the battles, you might be able to skip a battle, start one with enemies on fire or with less enemies for example. Some of those choices are also limited by the abilities you picked at the character creation so it add a good amount of replayability while the story will still mostly be the same but with some different events.The battles are hit or miss. Depending on your character build you can have pretty close fights or you can have very unfair fight where you die in 5 seconds without having time to do any action or where you annihilate the enemies before they can act. It is very random but, to be fair, the books where also pretty random with battles using a random number table. I won't go into too much detail about the battle mechanic since the game gives tutorial prompts but it's pretty much all quick time event except some abilities without any prompt. You have a decent amount of time to do those prompt so it does not require lightning fast reflexes but messing up one prompt can mean losing a battle. There are no penalties to losing battles except the time lost because you can simply replay the battle as many time as you want, and you might need to do for some bosses or if you play on Hard.As for the story itself, it is separated in 4 acts, all with pretty different areas and at least one new enemy type each. Lone Wolf was inspired by Dungeon and Dragon so it will feel familiar if you are used to this type of fantasy. Most of the story is about getting from point A to point B evading or killing monsters, looting stuff and with two or three npc to interact with per act. It is a dark story, you can't save everyone and some of those choices can be pretty mean. Lone Wolf is an already developped character so you can't be evil and act any way you want but, while he is a hero, he is not totally good and actually pretty grey. I guess you could compare it to the Paragon and Renegade system in Mass Effect.Overall, if you can get past the pretty random filled battle system, it is a great game that is a very well though interpretation of the gamebooks genre. Sadly, Joe Dever passed away recently so it might be the last for Lone Wolf but they could use this system for other stories.			"

												Amazing game, reliving my epic childhood Lone Wolf game book on a Computer game is definitely a dream come true! The game has an amazing interface, very interactive game book feel, stunning graphics, pretty cool fight scene...... despite having all these great features, unfortunately the game was designed for tablets and smart phones which are specifically meant for touch screen application. Therefore the fight mode seems odd and not very intuitive with the mouse.All in all, this a great game which provides lots of satisfaction and a great deal of entertainment!Thank you Mr. Joe Dever for finally making this into a computer game!

												+ Awesome Story+ Awesome Art+ Awesome Music+ Awesome Extras (Soundtrack AND Artbook)+ Great ""Classic"" book feel+ Great Graphics+ Great In game puzzles+ Good Character Creation+ Good Varied in game choices+ O.k. Replayability- Excessive Battle quantity to story ratio- Leveling requires grinding a little- Very Poor Battle formulaGreat game, I was a bit scared of buying this title after reading a few negative reviews, but this game is awesome, I love it.  It's much better than the classic Lone Wolf books I used to read 20 years ago, way more engaging and depth.  My only negligible issue is that there is too many combats compared to the novels, yes it's enjoyable, but I find there are too many of them, it break the flow of the story a little, maybe less random combat while just traveling would resolved this issue, the story combats are more than enough on their own, no need of ""random extra encounters"" on top of it.Overall, except for excessive combat every minute or so, great game.Over all 8.5/10Great game for me, just short of perfect.

												I really love that this wonderful book series has been adapted for the video game medium. Full disclosure, as a hardcore fan of the original series of books this game is based on and an enthusiast about narrative in games, this game was a must-purchase. The only thing I would warn players about is that the combat can be kind of unforgiving at first. It takes a little while to get the hang of how it works, but after that, it is more on the ""challenging"" side of things as opposed to the ""straight up frustrating"" end of the spectrum.This game isn't for everyone. But, if you like story-centric games and a good fantasy rpg, I would recommend this game.			"

I lost time playing and just hacking dudes with my sword and Sommerswerd, using them all the time so I'll get extra buffs. And choosing different outcomes in the story so your character build later on will be different. This game is awesome!			"

												I enjoyed this game on a tablet once I got one that would run it. Good story and decent gameplay.I do not recommend this game for PC! It was designed for a mobile device and the pc port is almost unplayable unless you have a touchscreen (and only a little better if you do). No work was done to optimize the port for PC. Buy this game, but buy it for mobile.			"

												Be warned that this game is an interactive novel with quicktime event combat encounters, so if you don't like reading books while playing game, avoid this. But you should give it a chance because imo it's a great game! Almost everything is customizable: the weapon class, Kai disciplines (special skills), even the story according to your playstyle and the Kai skills that you chose. The story is very well-written and the game is gorgeous and has good fantasy/war soundtrack. The combat system is difficult to grasp at first, hence might make the game challenging but get used to it and you'd probably enjoy it (i.e. become a God and kill all enemies in 1 turn). Highly recommended!			"

												Do you like QTEs designed for a different platform, no instructions, indescipherable lockpicking minigames and repetitive combat? Yes? Then you'll love this game. If not, I can't recommend it to you. As a long time Lone Wolf fan, I was eager to see what was on offer. Here's the good, bad and really bad.1) The Good: The artwork. It's a really lovely looking game ... and that's it. There's not really much of a story so far. The experience is much like reading a graphic novel in an uncomfortable chair that has a bit of wire sticking out and poking your back.2) The Bad: (i) Not really any instructions. Sometimes, the first time you do something, it will pop-up a tip advising you of a few details but I can't seem to find a way to get those tips back. And there's no instruction manual.  (ii) Not really a story so far (to be fair - the books didn't either, usually just along the lines of ""go to the capitol and warn the king"").  (iii) Every section is a fight, some sections more than one. You must take the Kai discipline of Healing. Every single action in the game is simple a progression to the next fight. It gets dull, fast.3) (a) It's all QTEs - and I have no idea what the contact point for half the QTEs are. Some of them seem really easy and almost impossible to fail, while there is another that I have never succeeded in hitting despite being absolutely certain that I did. (b) Sadly most people probably won't read this far but THE LOCKPICKING. It makes me weep. It's really that bad. There is no contact point to tell you when you have hit the sweet spot. The picks break instantly. When they break, your pick is set back to the original position, meaning you have to start from scratch. I had 12 lockpicks. I broke all 12 - on one lock! If you are presented with any other option than using a lockpick, please, for the sake of your sanity, take it!Thank you for reading.			"

												Epic narration. Superb artwork. Amazing ""living"" illustrations. One of the best and longest adventures of Lone Wolf saga I have ever read.Usually I could finish a normal old Lone Wolf game-book in 3 hours, but this new 4-acts adventure took me about 34 hours! (about the same time I needed to read the first old 10 gamebooks!)So.. ten times of fun for about the same price!!Awesome!!!! Also, I like so much Joe Dever's voice between chapters. It' s cool. It creates a great epic atmosphere and It gives me the sensation to be in a real role playing game party session with a very (very!) good gamemaster.For this reason I'd love to hear his readings in EACH page of the book! (Maybe a premium gourmet fun edition? :)I hope next episodes will come soon!!! "

												No, just no. This is absurd level of RNG nonsense. Battles are repetitive, boring and so prone to random outcomes, that your skill does not factor at all. Oh, look a giant boss. You device a tactic against it, attack it, do damage over time, criple it, weaken it. And after that you defend yourself. His turn comes up. A couple of outcomes  - 1) either he attacks with his powerful attack kills you. 2) he attacks with his less powerful attack and he stuns you/cripples you, you miss your turn and he kills you. 3) he attacks with his weak attack and you get a second chance to attack again and kill him. If he goes for the first two - sorry no matter what you do you lose...Read the books, this has nothing to do with them other than the main character and some locations/enemies. Until the 3rd act there are - 4 enemy types + 2-3 buffed up versions. Oh and UNSKIPPABLE RANDOM ENCOUNTER FIGHTS. WECOME TO 1992...One of the small handful of games I played and I honestly hated in the end. Good job			"

												I will start with this; A diamond in the rough. I recently saw this game on sale and figured, ""Why not give this game a try"" and the decision I made to purchase this game will not be one I regret anytime soon. From the start of the game, the immersive experience attached itself to me in a way that made me feel as if I was about to fulfill some form of destiny. The decisions you mkae in this game trully effect the outcome of your path. I trully feel as if the character is one with a portion of myself that may have been lost in a past life. The options that are presented during the times int he game where you must take action, are relevant and properly introduced. For example, in the first chapter you come face to face with your first obstacle which is an avalanche. The options for dealing with this obstacle pertained to my character and I was immediately able to put my character attributes/skills to use. In my case, my character has the ability to communicate with animals, so my first instinct was to call upon nature to help me deal with this situation. I won't spoil the event with details but I must say, that the story preceding my choice was well thought out and very descriptive. Later on in the game, my new found animal companions made yet another appearance in a way that seemed like I had a symbiotic relationship with these digital creatures.The story is so compelling that it drives the player to move forward with playing just to get that next pinch of combat, intel or just to read one more page before having to call it a day.I will be playing this game on every lunchbreak I get during work this holiday season. I might even lose some weight from not eating all that fast food. This relationship could turn out to be a major gamechanger for how I view/critic future games.Overall, here are the ratings I came up with thus far:Graphics(during combat): 9/10Soundtrack: 10/10Combat: 9/10Visuals(in book): 10/10Story: 10/10Customization: 10/10Ai Challenge: 9/10Replayability: 10/10Buy it, play it, enjoy it, play it again. The story is NEVER the same.			"

												Lone Wolf is a well balanced, decently challenging RPG where the combat seems to take a semi-tactical aspect in how you approach it. The game plays mostly like the books it is based on, exept the adaptation allows better tracking of stats and the various choices you make during gameplay. The game carry a good atmosphere and story, given that the main visual outside of combat is text based, we feels everything the character goes through. While the way the story is portrayed may not speak to everyone, the combat aspect is engaging, there are numerous contextual QTE to most action, sometimes while using skills outside of combat, and reall keeps the user invested in the fight. Combat is turn based, but your turn only last as long as one of your stats allow, and enemies attack as soon they can which may also be while 'your turn' plays out. On this side the combat require a bit more finesse and quick thinking than average for an RPG. I seriously cannot really speak of a bad aspect of this game, none come to mind. Every skills are balanced and mostly as useful outside of combat or in combat, some may be redundant at times while in the next instance you're glad to have the only skill which can help you. For the price which is not very demanding considering what we've seen in the past, this game is well worth the money and time.Have fun and play hard!P.S. The main character remind me of a Witcher from the witcher serie, hehe.			"

Not a game for everyone for sure: those who're expecting some Witcher carbon copy will be easily disappointed, as those who somehow assumed this is going to be a regular RPG. Lone Wolf is more of an interesting mix between a visual novel and a classic RPG adventure for the kind of folks who don't mind reading and could use some fantasy - literally. Growing up or being familiar with 'gamebooks' surely helps.PROS:+polished and pleasant graphic presentation, which pays great attention to details+plenty of choice&consequence moments+great overall atmosphere and sense of immersion+lockpicking is a real thing+the good ol' rewarding feeling of accomplishment+it's a Joe Dever's Lone Wolf story.. yo, so 80s!On a side note: personally I was quite pleased to find out this has been developed by an italian team. Wouldn't mama be proud? <3CONS:-the massive amount of QTEs; not only they're at the core of the combat mechanics, but they're also basically everywhere else-repetitiveness: you're going to face tons of Giak trolls in the beginning before you meet your first 'different' enemy, and even then nothing really improves on the diversity front-redundancy: some actions will trigger almost always the same response: yet another troll fight..-Cube puzzles: totally unnecessary, as they add nothing to the story or to your personal enjoyment, but further annoyance-not a great deal of originality: if I weren't nostalgic of the genre I would have probably dismissed the whole thing as a trite re-hash of something already read/seen times and times again, but this wouldn't really be a con for 'new' players I guess-clichés: as stated above, we all heard the story of the lonesome hero with a superpowerful sword who also happens to be lord of something - while the female character, when it's not a cold-blooded badass ♥♥♥♥♥, ends up weeping on your shoulder or moping around in a cellar door waiting to be rescued-difficulty spikes: some early fights are quite hard to beat unless you resort to 'easy mode', or if you're prepared to try them again for 2-3 times - which is not that funny considering how repetitive they areOverall, I'd recommend the game only to the true patient ones out there: it's not a bad game, it's actually entertaining for the most part, but it requires to be dealt with.7/10 "

												The game definitly got the right feeling I remember from playing through the books. That's great! But it's way too unbalanced though - I mean youre not supposed to be forced to quit in act 2 just because game gets too hard even on easy setting. I meet Redfang with full stats and a well prepared belt. He stomps three times wich takes my health down to 25% and leaves me stunned. He finishes me off with a last blow - same thing every reload. Game over.And I still recommend the game? Yes if you got the money and want to get back that Lone Wolf feeling - otherwise it's reading an interactive novel with lots of fighting & some inventory management.That will do for now - back to the game to try another build of my hero..Well I tried a few more reloads, and alas, there Redfang finally didnt take me out in the first round and the rest was as easy as it should on easy. Great game with a diffrent approach and a must for Lone Wolf lovers of all ages			"

												Ah Lone Wolf, an old friend from my childhood. I missed him, or rather I missed immersing myself in the fantastical, gritty yet believeable world of Magnamund. I had doubts about purchasing the game but old loyalties won out. The fact that Joe Dever was involved sold it to me. I have not been completely disapointed. The game - mostly - plays as a choose your own adventure book that cleverly utilises it is running on a pc and does away with the ""turn to page X"" stuff. You manually turn the pages and this was fun for the first 30 minutes but soon got a bit old. The RPG element is solid and fully in keeping with the books, for example you choose your starting Kai skills, which help to give you different play throughs as new choices open up if you have the relevant discipline. The only real downside for me is the Quick Time Events. I am not the fastest gamer - preferring stategy/rpg games and I like a pause button if I play anything faster. I do find the battles hard as you have to make certain mouse actions/click on circles etc in order to make attacks and it is - to me - very fast paced and this takes something away from the game for me. All in all it is nice to spend time with my old pal Lone Wolf, the game does capture the atmosphere of the books, but I dont like the QTE.			"

												I have only played a few moments of this game, and I can honestly say I adore every moment of it thus far. I love fantasy novels, and I often write my own to pass the time. The story written is thrilling, well written, and captivating. This is the ""choose your own adventure"" type of novel, where, based on your choices, the story moves on with those choices. The combat was difficult to grasp at first, but once you learn the mechanics and which skills are good for the situation, it becomes much easier. This isn't a combat heavy game as I thought it would be, but that's not a negative thing. It is very story driven, you will be esssentially reading a short novel and picking what the hero does.It's well worth the price in my opinion, especially for those writers, or fantasy lovers out there. I will be looking forward to moving on in the storyline.			"

With the way how story is writen and how it all adds with sound, events etc. I can say that it is like a phantasy book with interactive elements, sequences and stunning arts.What is bad about it then? Well game is lacking complexity especially with gameplay. It's repetitive and give us no freedom within the world. With almost same enemies getting into our way over and over again, like in railway shooter. If they could improve combat make it less QTE more unexpected, and add progression with some new skills etc. through the game, then we would have ended up with more interesting title. Everyone would complete it with satisfaction then.The reality is tough game was designed for touchscreen devices. I am usually very picky with RPG's especialy new and almost none of them stand up to test of time. How is it with Lone Wolf? You can have a very good first impression from Joe Dever's game. Bah maybe you will even find that art book adventure exotic and refreshing, nonetheless charms dont last long and with them gone consumer walks away.			"

												Surprisingly engaging, faithfully reintroducing the Lone Wolf style of choose your own adventure. This is the best mix of touch/tap mobile games and deep RPG. Choices are not always clear and I find myself remembering a time where I was holding fngers on the previous pages of choices where I could go back to If I died.This game is refreshingly simple and at the same time deep with action game play and fantasy RPG inventories, stats, and skill leveling. Great game, wish I found it sooner!			"

It's pretty much a choose your own adventure book but with some great animated artwork, and all of the ""game"" aspects such as combat or lockpicking are well... an actual game.

												The game itself is rather fun, however it seems to me to just give the pretence of ""game defining choices"" and nothing you actually do changes the game in any noticible way. The game tries to stretch itself into too many things, and fails to make any one part good, nothing in this game stands out to make it a note worthy game. I know it has a following already due to the books, but if this game was developed without the previous backing of the books it would not have been recieved nearly as well as it has. The graphics are sloppy, the turn based combat isnt bloody turn based as the enemys can attack you while its your turn, the puzzles arent really puzzles as the chance of you completing them in the miniscule time it gives you is next to impossible, and the fact that during a combat sequence you can think you're down to your last enemy, you beat the hard ""boss"" and have nearly killed his last minion, when suddenly out of no where another big bad boss walks onto the scene, with 4000 health and calls his buddies along while you have no stamina no health and no kai, leaving the winning of the combat down to trial and error mixed with sheer luck on being able to dodge an attack. I enjoyed the game at some parts, but my overall time spent playing this game left me dissapointed			"

												This game is really unintuitive to play and very bad at telling you what you're doing wrong. There's a lot of complexity right off the bat and it's very difficult to get a handle on what you're supposed to do. I feel like the combat system is this weird mix of turn-based and quick-reflexes, which is incredibly awkward and often leaves you feeling harassed and irritated. I didn't get very far into it, so I can't really comment on the plot or anything about later gameplay, but that's kind of the problem, it's just a difficult game to get into.			"

												===== My Review refers to the Hard Difficulty =====I loved back in past Joe Dever's Lone Wolf Game Books a lot, but i think they were much better than this game.I had great expectations from this game but my fears were confirmed when i tried the fighting sections...About the lore and the story nothing to say, it's like the old Lone Wolf i remember, but the real pain happens when you meet an enemy.First thing, in the old books, when you was facing an enemy it was most often a 1 vs 1, while here, in the videogame, almost always is you vs 3 enemies together in a sort of Turn Based like (it's not 100% turn based but is very similar) fight, almost always ends up with you dead forced to restart the fight again and again till some luck not goes to your side, yes because the fights are totally random with the chances you get smashed hard at beginning or you can dodge the first attack, giving you more opportunities to survive.I  resisted for some chapters but more you go deep with the story more the difficulty increases and i did not find any special items that helped me to become much stronger than what i was at the beginning, so the combat system and toughness and number of the enemies make this game , at high levels, very very frustrating and nearly impossible to progress in some point.So my final vote is positive cause i was used to love Lone wolf when i was young and the fashion of the character still works also in this game, but sadly the combat system and the not balanced difficulty at Hard ruined the real fun for this game that could have been much better.Recommended to the old fans of the books only, most of them would probably be forced to play this game at lower difficulty.My Final Score is 75 /100  "

												I like to play games not read them. 20 minutes of reading story to 15 minutes of the same battle over and over because  your character isn't strong enough as its the very start of the game. The combat is slow and almost impossible to win. I understand turned based combat but the enemy can attack during your turn with no way to stop them. And you start fighting two enemies, almost win and then another enemy, stronger than the first two turns up and kills you in one hit. Not enough health potions which are a must if your can't block enemy attacks.Basically don't bother.			"

												TLTR: I just don't like it.The game seems good at what it attempts to do. It brings combat scenarios filled with trash-mobs dominated by quick-time events. Secondly it provides a narrative for the combat scenarios.I was hopeful for the game because of the narrative and picked a character with a bunch of utility-abilities. Traits like survival, stealth, speaking with animals does provide options in the narrative, but at the end of the day our cowboy ends up walking down the middle of the same street he would have if he didn't spend time gathering intel and being stealthy, attracting the same combats.I don't like QTE and I don't like meaningless choices. I don't like this game.			"

												I lasted all of 20 minutes in this one, a good half of it setting up the initial character with choices I had no real idea what the game outcome would be. Then I find it's mainly a storybook, and once in a while you get dropped into an active screen dominated by quick-time events. I despise quick time, and it boggles my mind that anyone would combine ti with a storybook format. Take mediocre to *poor* writing, then couple it with tedious, reaction-based gameplay? The Steam description did not prepare me for this - it looks like your typical world-based RPG with some pictures of the interface screens, but heck, most of the game *is* the interface screens. Glad I got it on sale, but sorry I even spent that much.			"

												So I have this game on both Android and PC. The PC version is a terrible port compared to the awesomeness of the mobile game. I actually bought it on mobile after buying the PC version because it looked so great, but on PC it isnt very fun. So I wanted to give it a second chance, and boy I'm glad I did. Its a *great* mobile game, one of my absolute favorite mobile games next to Tales of Illyria. PC, not so much (actually not at all)At least for me, the touchscreen events were almost impossible using a mouse, where on Android they are awesome. It seems that when ported, the devs did nothing to make the quicktime events more mouse friendly. Even on mobile you mess up on occasion, as there isnt much time to do the events. But what becomes fun on a touchscreen is just annoying on a mouse. They expect you to be able to do the same quick tap-drag-circle etc events with the exact same speed and accuracy  with a mouse on PC as with your finger or stylus on a tablet. In short, its frustratingly difficult and ruins the game. Yes, I recommend it on mobile, but a big NO for the PC. Oh, and did I mention its $12.99 on google play instead of $14.99? Get it there, don't waste your time with this terrible PC port.			"

												The story is great - in the great tradition of classic game book romantic fantasy hokum, but you know what you're getting! The interface itself is beautiful, really nice and brilliant (although obviously a translation from a touch-screen/mobile device... don't be lazy, make it be PC specific!). The simple artwork animations do an amazing job of helping to invigorate the text and add to it. I cannot fault any of this - however amongst all this greatness there an utter and complete let down within the awful fighting mechanism.1) It feels like a JRPG - I know this is marmite, and I'm on the hate side of this. Does anyone actually like this rubbish mechanism? Anyone? You do? Why? Maybe you can expla... oh nostalgia... ok, so is there anything ACTUALLY good about it? No? Didn't think so... shall we all get over this nonsense and finally move on?2) They happen an awful lot and Lone Wolf seems completely ill-prepared and completely out-matched, it's a miracle he makes it through any battle. Also, so much randomness... again a fail-over over from JRPGs... at some point people will look back and go ""You know those Final Fantasy games came out at the same time as Planescape: Torment and Baldurs Gate and were immensely lame in comparison... why are we still copying them?"" Well... I don't know why anyone wanted to copy them instead of PT and BG in the first place, but who knows... maybe the dumbed down/random infuriating and thus dull reloading/restarting is for some people in the world that have nothing better to do. I however, want a game that has play-tested, balanced, and isn't JRPG. I'm sure even the patience of a Saint would be tried and have him throwing a controller around in frustration.3) All icons have cooldown on them... er... I have a cooldown on basic Attack/Defend? WHAT THE DICKINS?!?Who thought that was a good idea? Find them and give them a good slapping with a large wet fish.4) I have next to no endurance, and i'm completely useless without any of it... and it takes endurance to drink an edurance potion... er... ok... we'll chalk this one up on ""Dumb Ideas"".5) And the worse part of combat is the idiot waves his arm around often obscuring the ranged combat icon making it inaccessible. And when you can't always use basic icons over and over (cooldown - on the defend icon... duh) This kind of flaw is even more unforgivable.So, there's a great game here, that I would love to play, it would need the awful fighting mechanics to be ripped out and replaced with something less utterly appalling.

												Your opinion of Joe Dever's Lone Wolf will really depend on how tolerant you're willing to be of its flaws. This is a game with a good story, after all. It's not a great story, but it's told well enough that it's worth experiencing. I only wish that the developers had realised that too, and given it centre stage, rather than constantly harassing the player with combat sequences and leaving the soundtrack half-finished.While fans of fantasy adventure will enjoy the beautiful telling of Lone Wolf's journey, it's hamstrung by an over-emphasis on unappealing combat and a reluctance to let the narrative do its job.Read my full review here: http://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/joe_devers_lone_wolf_hd_remastered/review/article-1382.html "

												I was indifferent to this game from the outset.  I had first seen this game as an iOS/mobile game, so I was more (morbidly?) curious with how they would handle the port than the game itself.My Let's Play - 


YouTube™ Video: Phawx Plays Joe Dever's Lone Wolf HD - Gamebooks are fun! Let's Play 

			Views: 1,183		

			Steam store link: http://store.steampowered.com/app/279440/		

Spoiler: While the port itself is excellent in presentation, there are still lots of gesture-commands to handle input.  This isn't a terrible thing as all of the combat scenes are nothing more than a series of QTE++ sequences, but still.  I wish there were additional input methods available.That small complaint aside, I can start to see the attraction to VNs.  Lone Wolf started as a series of Gamebooks (choose your own adventure) and as far as I can see it's literally the interactive version of that.  Complete with battle sequences, lock-picking and attempting different situations via one of four special powers that you picked when you created your character.  An example would be the animal kinship trait that helps you past a situation by communing with wildlife for secret intel.It's not fast paced but I found myself interested in the story and my part in it.  Mission accomplished as far as I'm concerned. "

												a long time ago, i LOVED the gamebooks. reading it now is both wonderful AND frustrating. the decision to bundle chance events, skill use, combat and many other ""interractive"" segments into what are Quick Time Events is... aggravating. repeatedly clicking a mouse-button to fill up a lighted circle shouldn't be called gameplay, entertaining or challenging. it is?? annoying. in this case it is an impediment to enjoying what is a good story. the fact that much of my playtime here has now fallen into a rhythm of my reading and enjoying the book while at the same time dreading the next QTE that will make me wish for an .ini edit or timed macro is not a positive thing.

												In this game you are able to type your own story, you can choose between multiple choices and to change your ""adventure's future"" by them.The combat on here is an old school combat, you have to choose an attack and then after your player attacks the enemy attacks back, you have to click / drag your mouse in the right time to get the full damage out of your attack.Honestly I didn't really like the game, im not a fan of this style of a game but i do think many people can love it and play it for hours.So i recommend it.

												This game was a surprise, havent heard of it before (traded another game for this one) and I though it was awesome.This game is a perfect mix of a book and game. While the narrative sets the mood and lets you use you imagination the gameplay illustrates the story better and adds an interactive part with actual skill and planning involvedHonestly, this is how gaming visual novels should be done, not just the lazy ""make one choice now"" that almost all anime visual novels do (there are few exceptions that actually do have an RPG or strategy element), or the tell tale style (they are awesome at story telling, but its more of an interactive movie than a game really).But it does have some weaknesses, story does not change too much from your choises, so you will likely do only one gameplay unless you are a completionist. At some points it can feel a bit grindy if you are trying to max your skills or items. There is certain unfairness when you start the game with no previous experience, as it makes you choose the skils to use during the full game, without you knowing how effective they are and selecting your stongest stat (int, vit or dex) without knowing which fits you best, this could lead to you having a very unbalanced char without noticing and being forced to restart the game or lowering the difficulty since you keep losing the same battle over and over again without being able to go back to the map to be a bit more prepared for it.Also, keep in mind that the ""Lone Wolf"" series is a gaming fantasy novel with focus on teenage males, with the main idea being that the reader puts himself in the role of the main character.  And as expected the main character is this overpowered, chick magnet, super smart, knows how to do everything, angsty, cant do no wrong, legendary race hero so... yeah some reading parts are a bit cringey as you can imagine, specially the ones where he interacts with the female lead.Still, great game, would love to see more games of the same style or a sequel to this.

												I love the Lone Wolf books.  I saw them for the first time when I was really young, and I was enthralled by the amazing world Joe Dever created.  With just one book, 'Flight from the Dark', I was hooked on the adventures of Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Lords, as he fought the Darklords of Helgedad and the forces of the god of darkness, Naar.Joe Dever does not disappoint with this game.  The writing, world building and feel of the story is a perfect match to the old CYOA books.  From the first moments of the game, you feel like you really are Lone Wolf, the last hope for Sommerlund.It's an absolute travesty that this fantastic writing is ruined by positively garbage game design.  All of the problems in this game revolve around combat which, incidentally, was one of the biggest stumbling points in the original book series.  In the book series, it was because Dever had to write around the player potentially having the Infinity +1 Sword (The Sommerswerd).  In this game, it is because the designers couldn't be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to make a fighting system that relied on something other than RNG and confusion.The game has four chapters.  The first two, it is worth noting, are fantastic.  The combat is simple and to the point.  Enemies can hit decently hard, but you are well equipped to handle them and supplies are plentiful.  It isn't that the games design is better at this point, it is that the flaws are easier to overlook.  Combat will rarely be fatal, even if it takes a turn for the worse, and this keeps the player moving through the story, which is the real meat of the game.The final boss of the second chapter is where things start to get really rough.  The enemy will go first, deals massive damage, and has a chance to stun you.  If you are stunned in this opening salvo, you WILL die before getting a chance to act at all.  The chance of this happening isn't too high, but it is still there, and most players will see it at least once, if not more.From then on, the game pulls no punches, in the worst ways possible.  Random encounters are BOSS level mobs, which make it easier to just reload an old save then to deal with the pointless slugfest.  Enemy monsters are filled with 'Rapid Clicking QTEs', which seem to be used for almost everything in the game.  Early on, you'd take some damage or screw an attack up if you failed.  Now?  Dead if you mess it up.I got sick and tired of it and just installed an auto clicker.  And even with that, it only makes the combat slightly LESS unfair.  You WILL die, many times, to swarms of foes before you can possibly react.  100% to dead before you can do anything, even if you were defending.  Adding onto everything else, the enemy is not held to the same mechanical rules that the player is.Lone Wolf can act during his own 'phase'.  When his timer runs out, he cannot act for a bit, and then the cycle repeats.  The enemy has no such difficulty.  They can attack whenever they wish, your phase or not.  They can attack the millisecond your defenses drop (and often will) and hit with DoT effects that deal huge chunks of your health (similar DoTs are nearly scratch damage to them).The original books were about controlling conflict.  You weren't an army slaying warrior, so you were supposed to be clever about how you engaged in fights.  This game not only forgot that, but went the other way and puts you into bland, annoying and uninteresting combat CONSTANTLY.If you want a good story, I can recommend this game.  But I'd advise you to play Chapter 1 and 2 on Normal, then slam it down to Easy to just burn through the rest of the story without the BS.  There's no reason to give yourself a migrane over ""Difficulty by Frustration.""			"

												This is easily the worst game I've played on steam.  I wish steam would call out games that have been ported from other operating systems that don't run steam - had I known this was a mobile port I'd have stayed away.  I'm a big fan of the Dever books - a point and click would be a perfect implementation for the lone wolf world.  Here, they decided to slap on a terribly executed ""battle mode"" that might make sense on a phone.  The ""deep combat system"" is the option to strong hit or quick hit.  Not much more to it than that.  If there was a way to remove that part of the game and just point & click the Dever story I'd say this is worth maybe $5 on sale, and possibly fun.			"

												Why is this game described as having ""turn-based battles""?  If I need to make a decision as to what to do and then do it before a yellow bar runs out, and I cannot pause, then it's not turn-based.  Is that what they mean by ""dynamic""?  Meanwhile, the rest of the game captures all the dynamism of reading one of the gamebooks from the eighties.  I was quite disappointed.			"

												I... I don't know why I bought this.  It LOOKS good, but I can't stand it.  Any of it.  I'm not sure if I'll be playing even another minute of it because... well, I just can't do it.  It's too slow.  The graphics are okay, but this is not at all what I thought it would be.  The ""combat"" is pathetic.  The story is just too slow.  I don't mind reading, but everything is too slow.  The interface is clunky at best.  I don't want 25% of my playing time to be waiting for the screens to slowly change, as much as it looks nice after the second or third time I just want the next inventory or character screen to be available right away.I'm sure some people love this game and really enjoy it for what it is but I just can't.  Research this game very carefully before you spend even a cent on it.			"

												if you think of buying this dont be deceived by store page pictures- this is nothing like Witcher to say things already said before-first off its storybook mode. meaning you are going to read a lot which in fact is nice and refreshingbut the store page just dont show that. if anything the store implies something in the lines of witcher this is nothing close.controls... now ok i might be some sort of butterfinger kid that cant hold his mouse right but the QTE's, namely the arrows you have to click and follow are simply not designed for mouse. touchscreen maybe so shield tablets and stuff might be good with thisbut mouse? no thanks. top that up with rather unforgiving combat and little to no tutorial of what you are expected to do and you face a problem of do or quit. two battles in game the game throws layercake battle at my character. cool beans, wish i had a touchscreen to do those QTE's "

												I really wanted to like this game, but ended up rather disappointed. I would also liked to have played more of it before forming an opinion, but that's just not in the cards. The combat system is acceptable. It's a bit weird to use, and the time mechanic is annoying rather than enriching, but it's workable. What isn't is that the controls bug out every 10 minuites or so. 4 times in less than 20 minutes, the game would suddenly stop interpreting my input as valid commands.Mouse stopped function, and keyboard stopped working even to access the main menu. This game is deffective; if I didn't know better, I would guess it was a poorly done console port. As it stands, I am very disappointed.			"

The mechanics include things like fast-clicking (which is slightly tedious), swiping an arrow or timing clicks.  It sounds like it was developed for touchscreen devices and it may have been, but it plays well with the mouse.  There are options for using the keyboard with some of the events.So far the story is wonderful and character customization is decent.  I haven't gotten far into it but I feel like your choices will definitely have an impact on the outcome of the game.  We'll see.			"

												Having finished the game in about 18 hours I have to say that it was very satisfying, even if unusual to me, experience. It being my first contact with ""make you own story"" books, I found it at first a bit confusing (being used to save-load systems being commited to a choice was for a while stressful), but it quickly passed.What can I say about the game itself? The story is pretty basic, but the branching emergent stories make a difference, your skills actually matter for the story in big ways, unlike most RPGs, so it can be fun replaying it once or twice, just to see what happens.When the game gives us a bit more active role, it's clearly a smart-device port, its QTE events are a clear proof of that, and so are the visuals, which while nice considering the game's origin, fall squarely into early 2000s from a PC gamer's perspective. The combat can get repetitive, and on later levels quite easy, usually (especially when you pick Healing and Weaponskill as some of your specialties), it's quite fast and requires a slight tactical approach in planning the order of attacks performed and cooldown management. In general, I recommend this game to all who don't mind reading their games, don't mind subpar graphics, and like straightforward, heroic adventures with a lot of room for different outcomes.			"

												Just completed the game and I would say I thoroughly enjoyed it. (maybe I've been playing too many JRPGs, but was hoping for some post-game material or something like a new game + haha XD) I usually don't play games every waking moment unless they really engage me, but this managed to do that. I've been a huge fan of the Lone Wolf gamebook series that I started reading in primary school.To be objective though, it only started to feel fun after enduring insane frustration at the start with the QTE, combat style etc. After I got past that, it was just pure bliss and Lone Wolf just felt, well, Lone Wolf (i.e. like a boss). Btw, I want to stress that being a fan who has all the books does not automatically make me biased in the game's favor. I've got to admit that when I saw this game I was like ""awesome!"", but then again, when I tried playing this on my phone when it first came out and couldn't get the hang of it I was like ""heck this!"" and I gave up on it. Well, basically, my point is, the fact that I'm a huge fan of the series also means that I can be excessively unforgiving.Just a note if anyone's interested to know:I played through this game on normal and paid no attentions to builds (meaning I made decisions based on my own personality). Disciplines were sixth sense, mind over matter, weaponskill, healing, and my preferred style is sword dual- wielding (life started getting a lot easier after I switched to this style).			"

												Wow, Just wow. This game is fantastic. I am not going to lie. If you like to read and make your own choices then you will like this RPG. Fantastic writing and story so far(I am 2 hours in as I am reviewing this). This is must buy.Con: It is a port from a tablet game for sure.			"

												Fabulous representation of Dever's written work with a nice hybridization of multiple different mechanics. I purchased this expecting a digital version of classic LW (which would have been perfectly fine) and got something quite different, but equally pleasing! I've been a fan of this series of books for 30 years now and this game scratched an itch that's been building since the last volume was published in the late-90's.			"

												I read the Lone Wolf Books when I checked them out from the grade school library, and I started a minor trend that got some of my friends into them as well.  The library didn't have the first book, so we had to start with one of the later books.  This game works the same way, it's like a direct line to my childhood.  It picks up three years after the first sequences of events in the series, with Lone Wolf already having reclaimed the Summerswerd and avenged his fallen brethren. I was pretty nervous when I saw this game existed.  I mean it's honestly bananas that someone else read these and liked them enough to spend money developing a game version.  But I didn't need to worry.  It's everything I hoped it would be.  I thought from the screenshots that they had made it into some slick action game but that's not the case.  It's an old school adventure book with a combat system that's more involved than closing your eyes and jabbing your pencil onto a number grid.  (Although I would kind of love to see an updated version of that.)  The music and sound effects fit perfectly. and the meat of the game is reading.  I love it.			"

												This is a thumbs up with some caveats. If you're a Joe Dever / Lone Wolf fan then yes this is a definitely blast from the past, but it also shows how that era's fantasy fails to hold up today.  The strongest suit of the game is the *beautiful* visual presentation of the book and the game.Combat does get repetitive and tiresome and the game can be too difficult at the beginning on normal difficulty till you've run into a vendor/stockpiled enough stuff to cover your♥♥♥♥♥on normalIts relatively simple/easy to just plow through the game on easy setting if you just want to beat it / enjoy the story.  Overall, its tougher to recommend if you're not already a Lone Wolf fan but you just might like it if you like other similar game book type games i.e. Assassin in Orlandes			"

												If you recognize ""Lone Wolf"" or Joe Dever, you'll have a good idea of what to expect. For the uninitiated, Lone Wolf is based on a series of choose-your-own adventure gamebooks of the same name. The game's story is told primarily through text, with the occasional animated illustration and cutscene. Battle takes place in 3D space, featuring varied settings. RPG features allow you to customize your character's skills, growth, and loadout as you see fit.This game is not a ""standard"" RPG, having more in common with a visual novel (or gamebook). Combat is based on quick-time events. The higher difficulties can be surprisingly brutal. It's a port from mobile, and it's not exactly cheap. In short, it's not for everyone.However, if you like what you see, it's a fun adventure. If you can, try getting it on mobile (or on sale), but the port is enjoyable.P.S. Last I checked, the mobile version lets you play part 1 for free, so try that out to get a feel of the game.			"

												First, let me say this: I have played this game on Android. So, while my Steam account shows not that much time I have beaten the game on Android. So yes I do know what I'm talking about.I so highly recommend this to everyone. More so to those who are fans of the books. I've read up to book 12 in the Lone Wolf book series.. The game takes place, I'd say, between book 4 and 5. I say that because it mentions that your the Fryearl or something like that (governor of the land). It sticks really close to how the books are and how it was done, even down to what's going on in the books. There's even mention of the Shainti wizard tribe from the Grey Star book series.As a huge fan of the book series when I was a kid to teen years I really enjoyed this game. It is Lone Wolf turned into a book/video game all the way.There are 4 books. Each book contains 4 Chapters if I remember right.Choices matter and your choices do effect what happens in later books. Some people show up in later books.Collect items. Items are the same as in the books. Potion of Laumspur and such. They even put in Potion of Ether which I thought was a nice touch. The special items never can be traded or sold (at least not that I came across anyway). Named items like rings and necklaces doesn't come into play either but is nice because it reminds you who gave it to you. For example: You meet Banadon in the Lone Wolf book 1. He gives you the Crystal Star Pendent. Later in Book 5 it ask if you have said item on hand. You do, you know who Banadon. You don't, the book acts as if you never met him even though you did. This doesn't matter in the game. You either know the person or you don't.Armor and weapons take damage over the course of combat. You do find people to repair said items. Armor and weapons can also be upgraded as well. Sommerswerd is there with 3 special attacks. Instint kills are done with the Sommerswerd.Combat is done in real time turns. By this I mean you have a timer bar that ticks down while you attack. Your attacks take up so much of your attack bar (endurance). When you run out of endurance you wait for you timer to tick down. Blocking an attack ends your turn right away no matter what. As your timer fills up your endurance fills up as well. Attacks with knives, crossbow, and Abilities does not use endurance.Choice of 3 weapons, axe, sword, and mace. Each weapon has 3 attacks. Dual weapon or weapon and shield. When dual weapon welding your off hand weapon is used to block, stun, or bleed damage the enemy.Off hand weapon does weapon damage. Dual weapon use in the books never happened but in the Lone Wolf magizine club, I think, Joe Dever did mention that you can use in the books with a negitive to hit. Or it may have been  brought up on the Project Aeon site. I can't remember. It's on the site mentioned though. Shield is used to block, stun, or bleed damage though when hitting an enemy isn't high you get a bonus to block attacks. Side weapons are throwing daggers (3 attacks) or crossbow (3 different attacks) which can be done all in 1 attack.You get to choose 4 abilities out of 8. Mind blast and mindshielf are combined as 1 skill. Mindblast damages and stuns target. Mindshield is an auto ability. There is Healing, Tracking and Hunting are combined into 1 skill which is used to heal in combat. Weapon skill gives bonus to hit, damage, and something else I think. Animal Kinship calls a wolf during combat to help. MInd Over Matter gives the choice throw an object in the background at enemies. Sixth Sense gives you a chance to dodge enemeies attacks and counterstrike. Camouflage makes it so that they can't attack you and something else. Can't remember. Abilities do come into play while reading. All abilities can be used in combat, obviously.The stats are Strength, Dexterity, and Kia power. These come into play while reading and in combat. Kai power is to use you abilities in combat. Strength is used for damage and health. Dexterity is used to dodge and block. Said stats are color coded and those stats used while reading increase that stat at the end of the chapter. Abilities used increase Kai power.Enemies are also taken straight from the books as well. Each are just as powerful or weak just like in the book. Sadly, as with books 1-4 there's not a lot of variation of enemies though each book has 1 or 2 new ones.The pictures are done really well and have a cool loop animation to them. There's not too many but the ones that are there are really cool.Theres an extra section for background info on lands, characters, enemies, etc, as well as a gallery for looking at the enemies in poses and even the locations of combat. You can spin the camera around the combat locations. The gallery was not part of android so this was a really cool addition to the game.			"

												This game definitely won't be for everyone, but I've been totally hooked since I bought it.  Be warned straight away, that the game is half book, half RPG combat/inventory management, and I mean that literally (you spend much of your time turning pages in a virtual book and reading).  It's based on the Lone Wolf CYOA books, and stays true to that formula for the most part.   Half of the game is simply reading the progressing story and making decisions on how to handle situations.  I will say that it's not nearly as difficult or high stakes as the original Lone Wolf books were, as most encounters can be handled whichever way you decide to go.  The other half of the game is a turn based / real-time hybrid RPG combat system (kind of like Final Fantasy 6/7 or Chrono Trigger, except with multiple actions available in one turn), which is surprisingly fun.  The difficulty seems to be balanced perfectly on normal difficulty (at least for myself), which keeps it engaging, though the combat can be a bit repetitive with a lack of variety of different enemies and only one party member.If the idea of combining a CYOA book with a well balanced, fun, but slightly repetitive RPG combat system sounds interesting to you, check it out.  The writing isn't amazing, but it isn't terrible.  The art is cool, but limited.  The music is similarly nice, but very limited...in the end though, the real fun of the game for me is in making your own decisions as you roleplay your character, and the tough but fair combat.			"

												I remember playing the books many, many years ago; and they were enjoyable, like the Fighting Fantasy books.Graphics are quite good. The quick time is not to my liking, turn based would be better.Be careful with your rations, potions, etc; don't abuse them. It seems you're 'guided' to certain directions. There's no free roaming (go where you like, do what you like, etc).I'm not sure I'd recommend it at full price. As it's on sale at the moment, it's worth getting.			"

												If you like the book, you will find the same feel.Overall its a good game, but it could use more play test.Some combat at just too hard because the ennemies use all their strongest attack in a row. So you restart and restart until you can make it to your first turn.The cube puzzle, didn't need the timer. I understand that they want to give you a way to fail it, but without 6 sense, I'm not sure I will be able to go througth them without rage quit. The mouvement of the cube are hard to do, and when you are racing against time its hard to concentrate to find the solution.Its was one of the first game I played that make me use consumable, for that, good job !.  It took me a while to find the right way to play the game.It was mostly 10h of fun and I will buy the next one.			"

I have to say, I'am enjoying playing this game more than Dragonage Inquistion. Be warned it is a lot reading, only the fighting, and various tasks ie picking locks, and the cube keys, are animated, but still a good game.Highly recommended.			"

												I recommend this, but I am biased as I've been a fan of the Lone Wolf gamebooks for the last 30 years.The game plays much like the game books.  Actually, you are basically reading the game.  It is presented as in a very old book, with pictures that move (similar to the pictures in the Harry Potter movies).  You will make decisions every few pages and it affects how your story is written.  At times, the game leaves the book and goes into more of a 3rd person view.  There is combat that is sort of turn based but not entirely - you have a limited amount of time and energy to do things on your ""turn"", but your opponents won't just be standing there the entire time.  When it's not your ""turn"" you are either defending or just standing there exhausted if you didn't save any energy after doing your attacks.  (Sorry if I've done a poor job explaining this - you may have to see it to understand.)  Outside of combat, there are other actions that require you to quickly follow arrows on the screen with your mouse to be successful.  You will improve your skills and acquire items that will help you in your mission.So for those of you familiar with the gamebooks, this is like one of those, with mini-games replacing the ""select a random number"" element.If you're looking for the next Skyrim, this may not be for you.  If you're a life-long Joe Dever fan then you should buy this immediately without any further thought whatsoever.  For all others I suggest watching a few minutes of game play on youtube to decide if this is something that you would like.			"

												Best summarized as a choose your own adventure book, with quick time event combat.The game plays like reading a book, quite literally. You turn pages and read. Choices can be made, and those choices are determined by what skills you have. Picked agility? You can climb to the hole in the roof and peek inside. Got brute strength? Smash the door down and charge in. That kind of choice.The combat is kind of turn based, where you have a bar that expires slowly, and you can do more than one thing per turn at the cost of the bar going down. You select what enemy to attack, you select what weapon you will use, then select what attack to do with that weapon. After selecting what you want, you will perform that action, with mouse based quick-time-events, via dragging or clicking in time with the prompts.Thoughout the story, depending on choices made you have to solve puzzles or pick locks.Once you read a page, you can open your inventory, check stats, skills, map etc.I recommend this game, but with caution. Like, they advertise lock picking in the game description, as if it's some fancy feature, when it's basically just skyrims way of doing it. To me that was a warning sign, but don't let things like that deter you from buying the game.It's entertaining and i'm enjoying it, although i didn't expect it to be 90% reading when I bought the game.Also an annoying con, transitions take too much time. I click on something and gotta wait way to long for something to happen. I want to go to the inventory? Gotta wait for all that fading and animations to finish.			"

												A cross between a QTE-driven adventure game and a visual novel, this game has a fun story that holds true to the source material, a nice mix of narrative and action, and a great sense of empowerment as your character develops. The soundtrack is wonderful and the level of complexity is greater than your average visual novel or adventure game but not so detailed as to bog down play. It certainly has a high replay value in my mind given the branching paths and flexibility allowing you to solve problems by a variety of means depending on how you have built your character.

												Having finished the game in about 18 hours I have to say that it was very satisfying, even if unusual to me, experience. It being my first contact with ""make you own story"" books, I found it at first a bit confusing (being used to save-load systems being commited to a choice was for a while stressful), but it quickly passed.What can I say about the game itself? The story is pretty basic, but the branching emergent stories make a difference, your skills actually matter for the story in big ways, unlike most RPGs, so it can be fun replaying it once or twice, just to see what happens.When the game gives us a bit more active role, it's clearly a smart-device port, its QTE events are a clear proof of that, and so are the visuals, which while nice considering the game's origin, fall squarely into early 2000s from a PC gamer's perspective. The combat can get repetitive, and on later levels quite easy, usually (especially when you pick Healing and Weaponskill as some of your specialties), it's quite fast and requires a slight tactical approach in planning the order of attacks performed and cooldown management. In general, I recommend this game to all who don't mind reading their games, don't mind subpar graphics, and like straightforward, heroic adventures with a lot of room for different outcomes.			"

												I do recommend this game for what it is. I love the book approach to the rpg genre. I love the way the story is written in most cases. As a gamer that is also an avid reader, I can appreciate this game on two fronts and that makes a huge difference. However, not all is great in this review. What could have been a solid 9 out of 10, has to be demoted to a 7 out of 10 score from me. The culprit that's dragging this amazing game down with it? QUICK TIME EVENTS! The entire combat system is heavily dependant on them, and there's really NO NEED for such lazy mechanics that are more suited to a game that's to be played on your cell phone than on your computer. With a proper turn based combat system, this game would have been a 9 out 10 for me. As it sits, it's still worth playing, but the developers really need to rethink the quick time events moving forward in my opinion, as it detracts from the gameplay and the rpg mechanics that are otherwise spectacular.

(maybe I've been playing too many JRPGs, but was hoping for some post-game material or something like a new game + haha XD) I usually don't play games every waking moment unless they really engage me, but this managed to do that. I've been a huge fan of the Lone Wolf gamebook series that I started reading in primary school.To be objective though, it only started to feel fun after enduring insane frustration at the start with the QTE, combat style etc. After I got past that, it was just pure bliss and Lone Wolf just felt, well, Lone Wolf (i.e. like a boss). Btw, I want to stress that being a fan who has all the books does not automatically make me biased in the game's favor. I've got to admit that when I saw this game I was like ""awesome!"", but then again, when I tried playing this on my phone when it first came out and couldn't get the hang of it I was like ""heck this!"" and I gave up on it. Well, basically, my point is, the fact that I'm a huge fan of the series also means that I can be excessively unforgiving.Just a note if anyone's interested to know:I played through this game on normal and paid no attentions to builds (meaning I made decisions based on my own personality). Disciplines were sixth sense, mind over matter, weaponskill, healing, and my preferred style is sword dual- wielding (life started getting a lot easier after I switched to this style).			"

												Take a ""choose your own adventure"" book, add self-writing pages and dynamic fights and here we are! It's still a little slow, and fights are full of QTEs, which is a little illogical, considering you're supposed to read and depend on your choices and luck... But it's still a good little game!			"

												I read the Lone Wolf Books when I checked them out from the grade school library, and I started a minor trend that got some of my friends into them as well.  The library didn't have the first book, so we had to start with one of the later books.  This game works the same way, it's like a direct line to my childhood.  It picks up three years after the first sequences of events in the series, with Lone Wolf already having reclaimed the Summerswerd and avenged his fallen brethren. I was pretty nervous when I saw this game existed.  I mean it's honestly bananas that someone else read these and liked them enough to spend money developing a game version.  But I didn't need to worry.  It's everything I hoped it would be.  I thought from the screenshots that they had made it into some slick action game but that's not the case.  It's an old school adventure book with a combat system that's more involved than closing your eyes and jabbing your pencil onto a number grid.  (Although I would kind of love to see an updated version of that.)  The music and sound effects fit perfectly. and the meat of the game is reading.  I love it.			"

												If you recognize ""Lone Wolf"" or Joe Dever, you'll have a good idea of what to expect. For the uninitiated, Lone Wolf is based on a series of choose-your-own adventure gamebooks of the same name. The game's story is told primarily through text, with the occasional animated illustration and cutscene. Battle takes place in 3D space, featuring varied settings. RPG features allow you to customize your character's skills, growth, and loadout as you see fit.This game is not a ""standard"" RPG, having more in common with a visual novel (or gamebook). Combat is based on quick-time events. The higher difficulties can be surprisingly brutal. It's a port from mobile, and it's not exactly cheap. In short, it's not for everyone.However, if you like what you see, it's a fun adventure. If you can, try getting it on mobile (or on sale), but the port is enjoyable.P.S. Last I checked, the mobile version lets you play part 1 for free, so try that out to get a feel of the game.			"

												First, let me say this: I have played this game on Android. So, while my Steam account shows not that much time I have beaten the game on Android. So yes I do know what I'm talking about.I so highly recommend this to everyone. More so to those who are fans of the books. I've read up to book 12 in the Lone Wolf book series.. The game takes place, I'd say, between book 4 and 5. I say that because it mentions that your the Fryearl or something like that (governor of the land). It sticks really close to how the books are and how it was done, even down to what's going on in the books. There's even mention of the Shainti wizard tribe from the Grey Star book series.As a huge fan of the book series when I was a kid to teen years I really enjoyed this game. It is Lone Wolf turned into a book/video game all the way.There are 4 books. Each book contains 4 Chapters if I remember right.Choices matter and your choices do effect what happens in later books. Some people show up in later books.Collect items. Items are the same as in the books. Potion of Laumspur and such. They even put in Potion of Ether which I thought was a nice touch. The special items never can be traded or sold (at least not that I came across anyway). Named items like rings and necklaces doesn't come into play either but is nice because it reminds you who gave it to you. For example: You meet Banadon in the Lone Wolf book 1. He gives you the Crystal Star Pendent. Later in Book 5 it ask if you have said item on hand. You do, you know who Banadon. You don't, the book acts as if you never met him even though you did. This doesn't matter in the game. You either know the person or you don't.Armor and weapons take damage over the course of combat. You do find people to repair said items. Armor and weapons can also be upgraded as well. Sommerswerd is there with 3 special attacks. Instint kills are done with the Sommerswerd.Combat is done in real time turns. By this I mean you have a timer bar that ticks down while you attack. Your attacks take up so much of your attack bar (endurance). When you run out of endurance you wait for you timer to tick down. Blocking an attack ends your turn right away no matter what. As your timer fills up your endurance fills up as well. Attacks with knives, crossbow, and Abilities does not use endurance.Choice of 3 weapons, axe, sword, and mace. Each weapon has 3 attacks. Dual weapon or weapon and shield. When dual weapon welding your off hand weapon is used to block, stun, or bleed damage the enemy.Off hand weapon does weapon damage. Dual weapon use in the books never happened but in the Lone Wolf magizine club, I think, Joe Dever did mention that you can use in the books with a negitive to hit. Or it may have been  brought up on the Project Aeon site. I can't remember. It's on the site mentioned though. Shield is used to block, stun, or bleed damage though when hitting an enemy isn't high you get a bonus to block attacks. Side weapons are throwing daggers (3 attacks) or crossbow (3 different attacks) which can be done all in 1 attack.You get to choose 4 abilities out of 8. Mind blast and mindshielf are combined as 1 skill. Mindblast damages and stuns target. Mindshield is an auto ability. There is Healing, Tracking and Hunting are combined into 1 skill which is used to heal in combat. Weapon skill gives bonus to hit, damage, and something else I think. Animal Kinship calls a wolf during combat to help. MInd Over Matter gives the choice throw an object in the background at enemies. Sixth Sense gives you a chance to dodge enemeies attacks and counterstrike. Camouflage makes it so that they can't attack you and something else. Can't remember. Abilities do come into play while reading. All abilities can be used in combat, obviously.The stats are Strength, Dexterity, and Kia power. These come into play while reading and in combat. Kai power is to use you abilities in combat. Strength is used for damage and health. Dexterity is used to dodge and block. Said stats are color coded and those stats used while reading increase that stat at the end of the chapter. Abilities used increase Kai power.Enemies are also taken straight from the books as well. Each are just as powerful or weak just like in the book. Sadly, as with books 1-4 there's not a lot of variation of enemies though each book has 1 or 2 new ones.The pictures are done really well and have a cool loop animation to them. There's not too many but the ones that are there are really cool.Theres an extra section for background info on lands, characters, enemies, etc, as well as a gallery for looking at the enemies in poses and even the locations of combat. You can spin the camera around the combat locations. The gallery was not part of android so this was a really cool addition to the game.			"

												I purchased a few of the Lone Wolf books from a second hand bookstore, when I was in my teens. I loved the idea of a Choose Your Own Adventure style book with RPG elements. I played through the few books I had many times. They have always held a special place in my memory and I tried to turn my own child onto the books, when he was of an age to be interested. So yeah, this game played on my nostalgic memories and had won my favor before I even started a game.The game gave me no technical issues whatsoever. It looks great, has a great soundtrack and of course, a great story line. It was very easy to get into. It uses so few resources that I was able to play it on my rapidly aging laptop and still looks great! My only complaint would be with the combat system. While you can plan a strategy for combat, there is an element of luck, as there was with the book series. However, when you enter combat and haven't been able to make a single move before the enemy dispatches you, I can't begin to tell you how frustrating that is. I had to repeat a fight with some middle level enemies four times, before they made a move that allowed me to make a move in my own favor. So, this game is addicting, solid and fun. It can be incredibly frustrating at times, but the only reason it is frustrating is because I am so hooked and really want to progress in it. I love progressing in the game and I hope they will make more.			"

												There are not many games these days that you can play at a leisurely pace while you drink your cup of java or tea with the other hand. Lone Wolf sets that exact pace, but maintains the right to shove its foot up your rear if you decide to venture in on a higher difficulty. Lone Wolf is entirely about your styles and choices that you make as you play, and it gives you the feeling that your decision do matter and do alter your path through the adventure from the very beginning, up to and including when you are selecting your skills and starting weaponry. The decisions impact the scenarios you experience just the same as those old ""choose your own adventure"" style game-books that have been all but forgotten.The main brunt of gameplay is spent reading the book and turning the pages, or if you're like me, taking time to look at and appreciate the beautiful art designs that are spread throughout the entirety of the game. In between reading (and putting your rusty imagination to proper and good use) you'll find yourself with a lockpicking situation similar to that of The Elder Scrolls series, and my personal favorite, the Shianti Cube puzzles. Neither of these are particularly difficult, but they do an excellent job of keeping with the theme that this game has from the start: making you use your brain instead of mindlessly clicking or mashing buttons.Combat scenes are a transition from the pages and into 3D graphics, and with them comes the addition of a light strategic turn-based system with QTE sequences spotted throughout each attack; there are just enough little circles and arrows to keep you from becoming a mindless drone as you click through attacks, like in more traditional turn based RPGs.Lone Wolf is an older game, of course, but not old enough to lose what charm it had to offer since the beginning. If you can bring yourself to not whine or complain about harmless QTEs and you are willing to spend time reading and appreciating artwork as well as an enchanting choose-your-own-path style story, this game will not  let you down in capturing the original spirit of the series it is based on.Perhaps you'll go buy one of the books afterwards.

												So i bought this game on a whim thinking that it would be a game that i would play and forget about in a short amount of time, oh how wrong i was. I had never heard of the Lone Wolf adventure stiry before so this game opened up my mind to a whole new world. Having just beaten the game, i will  list what i beleve are the pros and cons of the game for me.Some replayability.Pros:Great Story where your choices do matter.Great Turn-based combat system where your choices right befoer combat can either be advantageous or disadvantageous to you.Creative writing that draws you into the character.Variety of enemies that are unique in their own aspect.QTE's add a bit of a challenge to the game.There are physics for turning the pages, awesome touch to the game that adds character to the game.Intro and outro cutscenes to battle go from story book to animated and vice versa which is just awesome and is exactly how i would imagine characters from a book coming to life.If you are having trouble with the shianti puzles, you can take the health damage and just continue on with your day.Now for the Cons:While the enemies are unique, combat gets boring after awhile if you have to grind (which you do on hard)The Shianti puzzles are an interesting aspect, but are extremely difficult to solve. Also wish there was some more consequences to failing the puzzles other than just health loss, i felt like i was cheating just taking the hp damage at times with no other repercusions.The inventory and crafting system are a little awkward at times.I felt like while upgrading armor and weapons helped a little bit, i would have liked for a more noticable difference between leather Kai armour and Kai plate armour.Overall, i give this game a 9/10 and it has easily made it's way onto my top 10. I for one am going to go look into the rest of the Lone Wolf stories after this.For the Sommerlund and the Kai!			"

												I must first declare that the Lone Wolf game books were my one of my fondest childhood pastime.   For this modern remake, the narrative by Joe Dever is much darker compared to the original books but still good storytelling. The illustration and art is impressive too but for me Gary Chalk's work will always define how I see Magnamund. Being a port from a handheld game, the combat mechanics is simple and the fights and enemy variety gets repetitive. The plot is pretty linear and progress is mostly combat rather than plot driven. Nostalgia certainly have biased my review but I am giving it a thumbs up and hoping for sequels. (I sure hope someone would take up the mantle of the late Mr Dever and continue his legacy). Those who are unfamiliar with Lone Wolf may not agree.			"

												Its rare to find a game where it feels like your choices actually matter, be they immediate or at some point along the line. Lone Wolf is one of those games. Even after playing through the first chapter on my phone, I chose one thing differently on the PC version and that made a difference in the gameplay and story. However, the overall game relies heavily on the replay value to keep the player interested, it IS the same few pathways only adjusted to suit whichever character powers the player has chosen. In spite of that its very definitely worth playing through at least twice by choosing different pathways.			"

												I liked the old Lonewolf gamebook a lot so when i saw this game it was a must buy but i realy dislike the combat system, still i finished 1 playthrough but i dont intend to do another one.Fair warning for everyone, excluding the combat it feel more like an interactive story that is change based on your skill selection from the beginning than a game and that is what i expected from something based on Lonewolf.If you dont dislike the combat as much as i do you should be able to get more than 1 playthrough from this ""game"".
