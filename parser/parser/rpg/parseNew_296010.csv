Early Access Review
								There have been quite a few attempts at recreating the 6DoF formula as of late, and none of them really do it for me with their attempts to over-complicate the core elements and make things ""modern"". NeonXSZ is the first game of its kind in a long time to really hook me in with its potpourri of elements that we know are fun and addictive, and have withstood the test of time. It combines the freedom of movement and perspective of Descent and the edge-of-your-seat twitch action of Quake or Unreal Tournament with the addictive leveling and persistent loot of increasing rarity of an ARPG like Diablo, all combining for what is absolutely the most addictive and replayable shooter of any kind in years.The game places you into a vast and complex computer mainframe with a very open and free-form approach to exploration. There's a great in-depth tutorial to read at your own pace getting you into the motions, but you are more-or-less thrown into this world blind with no hand-holding involved and a great deal of content to discover on your own accord. While there is no hand-holding the game does not ever feel tedious or hard to get into even for the newest of players, as you are always being guided the right way thanks to the Appropriate Hostile function which will highlight on your map the best spot to hit next for your newest dose of weapons and upgrades. This makes exploration of the almost overwhelmingly large Station quick and accessible, as you are still lost but pointed in the right direction.The objective of NeonXSZ is discovery and total domination, as you vie for control and power over the various hubs spread throughout the world in all-out territorial war. Despite the open-ended form of gameplay, NeonXSZ is ridiculously easy to get into for players of any skill level thanks to an approachable and flexible learning curve. This is gained through giving the player full control over which enemies and hubs they tackle on, giving the ability to scan hostiles for their level before deciding to engage or flee. As you fight higher leveled enemies you start to feel more confident, you'll return to bases with your hard-earned loot and become even stronger leading to newer and more challenging areas. The amount of content you have to explore is massive and already offers a minimum of 30 hours of feature complete gameplay with more to come.I had already drifted around the computerized world for a few good hours exploring, taking on low leveled hostiles, and playing around with early equipment before I discovered the challenge arenas at the center of the Station in a massive sphere. This is where♥♥♥♥♥♥gets serious. Instead of analyzing and picking off single similarly leveled foes like in the main world, I was suddenly thrust into a large and complex series of challenging areas being bombarded by difficult but manageable enemies. Each lovingly detailed room was blocked off by a shield and every one of these persistent opposing ships had to be exterminated diligently in an intense and explosive battle in order to advance. The loot you get is of game-changing quality (depending on the level of the arena) and in high quantities, and defeating an arena allows you to claim territory on that Station for an allied side of your choosing.Leveling up your tech level isn't as simple as gaining experience points or grinding mobs of same-y enemies like in other games, in NeonXSZ leveling up is determined by the quality of parts you're discovering and equipping. In order to grow strong enough to take on tougher foes, you'll need to outfit your ship with a select choice of higher leveled upgrades all dependent on the players' own playstyle. The range of different parts and the effect they have on how the game feels and plays is insane, and allows you to be anything from a slow, hulking tank with tons of shields and firepower to an agile and lightning-quick smaller ship that avoids all damage with ninja-like reflexes in the hands of the sharp-witted.Weapons are another integral part of NeonXSZ and just like upgrades add a huge layer of player customization and personal technique to how combat is approached. You start with the standard pea-shooter in classic shootemup fashion, but are quickly presented with plenty of choices in how you take on your combatants. For the nimble and stealthy pilots who like to sneak up and get in close there's the Lightning Gun which packs a serious punch but drains your energy like crazy, and a Flak Cannon which spreads out for a wide shot but shreds anything in its direct path. For the sniper-minded you have the Railgun which requires the the most accuracy but disintegrates enemy ships almost instantaneously. There's Inferno Guns for taking your foes down in a firey blaze and Laser Cannons that deliver a shocking blast of energy from afar, all weapons I've discovered only in my first 25 hours of gametime and with more to be found. The arsenal in NeonXSZ is remarkable, and will keep the most seasoned action veteran captivated for hours.The heavy mechanical beats and ambient dronings of the background music do an excellent job of keeping you engaged in the atmosphere of the cybernetic and neon-tinted highways around you. In general the sound design to me is very engrossing with its muffled sound effects and outside explosions giving you the feeling of truly being inside the cockpit. Some people might not be huge fans of the ships speaking A.I. system dubbed 'Betty', but personally I feel it adds to the retrofuture aesthetics of the setting and the authenticity of the interactive and immersive cockpit you become all too familiar with. Perhaps with just a bit more variation in speech, Betty would be welcomed by more players. If you're looking for lightning-quick combat, huge series of interconnected arenas, and ludicrous amounts of customization then look no further, NeonXSZ is your next addiction. It's an already feature complete game with many hours of solid content, loads of replayability, and an amazing amount of polish. The games' state in Early Access is merely a sign of the tremendous amount of additional potential for an already mind-blowing shooter experience.			"

								I've been playing and testing this game for over a year, since April 2013. I was the first pre-alpha tester and I've submitted the most bug reports. I know the game. When I started it was great, and it has just been improved a lot in every area since then. I have played for hundreds of hours if you qount all the non-steam dev builds and while I have tried a lot of different ship loadouts there are still many ships and loadouts that I want to try but haven't because new things to try is added all the time :) And this is true even after I've played past the levels where new qontent is unlocked for every progression!Many gadgets and abilities can have a playstyle centered on their use or their combination with other abilities. You can be a missile ship that shoots long range missiles around your energy wall. You can use a fast glass cannon build that does most of it's damage by bumping into your enemies and survives by dodging enemy fire and short invulnerability that lasts just long  enough for you to get the kill because you have spent all your resources on damage instead of defense. You can make a turret ship that just flies through the enemy base while placing a bunch of turrets and survives with a gyro shield that protects your back. When you turrets are placed you hide in tunnels and behind debris and kill everything without even shooting them yourself. You can build something that takes advantage of several abilities without relying on a single one of them or spend all your upgrades on boosting your speed, attack and defense and takes down any type of enemy with perfect aim at long or short range with circle strafing in 3 dimensions. All this and much more is possible for you and your enemies to use! Then there are all the weapons and ship hulls that also each require it's own tricks, loadouts and playstyles. You don't need to qommit to one style throughout the game, instead you can switch at any time! You carry all your weapons at once and can switch out your whole loadout as often as you want even while on a hunt for loot deep in enemy territory, just dock in a garage!If you don't feel like hunting down enemies in the open world and setting your own goals then you can now fly to the world hub/fighting center sphere (figurativly and literally) where there are prescripted challenge arenas with moving parts and level design handcrafted for the enemy waves and the loadout you meet in there.  Each level is a very unique experience and might require you to learn new tactics. The reward for completing the arenas is good enough that you can progress through the game mostly by these linear levels if you want to, or you can just ignore them whenever you feel like flying through the open world. Though the challange arenas are a part of the open world and you can fly from them to any other place without any loading screens at all. Whenever you want to do something you fly to the appropriate place and just do it, you never have to select what to do from a level select screen.NeonXSZ feels great, looks great, is fun and addictive. Every enemy you enqounter is using the same upgrades, hulls and gadgets that you can unlock and you can unlock it by qollecting the pieces of their wreck. Battles in NeonXSZ are never a repetitive grind, instead the AI is made to fight lika a human player which fits great in a first person shooter! They aim, move, utilize tactics and gadgets based on their personality and they design different loadouts. Since they are playing by the same rules as you it's possible to even learn from them and pick up tactics that they use.If you like 6DOF FPS games that requires some skill (though there's at least 4 ways to adjust the difficulty to suit anyone) and want to avoid boring grind then this is The Game! Fun from the start!If you want to hear about what the dev is doing with the game today you can follow his devlog (on the game forums at NeonXSZ.com) that is updated daily.So yes, I do recommend this game :]			"

												So far the only thing I would add to the reviews on this is that the game feels like a mix of descent and tron with a wonderful level up system that makes the game pace fast, but comfortable. admittedly piloting using hotas is tricky at first but once the settings are tweaked the game is amazing fun with hotas or mouse. I normally dont get into games that dont have much storyline and are more or less team deathmatch vs. the computer, however this games pace mixed with a rather competitive AI makes it a very enjoyable experience.  The game difficulty can be adjusted to fit prefered play style and i must admit being a fan of tron the visuals in the game are very appealing.			"

								Imagine that commercial where one fellow runs into another and they inadvertently mix their peanut butter and chocolate. Now imagine that commercial except it's mixing Descent and Diablo. And the two guys are kvetching and I come along in my tech 22 ship and kill them both and loot bubbles pop out of them. Now, the game isn't perfect (no game is)--I wish there were a campaign, but it's very solidly a sandbox style experience. That said, the actual gameplay is phenomenal. The ""shipfeel"" is spot on; it's genuinely a ton of fun to kill dudes and take their loot bubbles. I've dropped twenty hours into it since a friend picked it up for me as a Christmas gift, and all twenty hours have been a blast.Descent gameplay plus diablo sensibilities equals you should buy this.

								NeonXSZ has captured my attention in a way that games rarely seem to manage these days.  It is absolutely packed with gameplay and player choice, is highly polished and very configurable, both in terms of game settings and aesthetics (how many games do you have that let you change the theme of the game world?).It's a mouse driven 6DOF shooter (yes, mouse and keyboard is by far the best control method) in an open world cyberspace environment, so even though you have an ultimate goal you also have a high degree of flexibility in how you achieve it.  New ship components and even new ships are introduced at the perfect rate and make you feel always like you're making steady progress.  Two (well, four) warring factions make things even more exciting...rarely do you fly for more than a minute without encountering some firefight taking place that you can ignore or join as you wish.In short, NeonXSZ is a pure joy to play.  It's pretty, it's fun, it's packed with options...if you asked me what typical 6DOF shooters need I couldn't tell you any more than NeonXSZ already has.  It's a stunning example of the genre - a revolution, really - and an incredible achievement for the one-man dev team.			"

			Views: 722		

			NeonXSZ: Early Impressions NeonXSZ video created on version: 0.835 NeonXSZ is a cyber punk, free roam first person flight shooter, with a robust customization system, that'll have you go ""pew pew...		

NeonXSZ takes flight gameplay into an open cyber punk world, with tons of upgrades and customization. The game can be challenging, with a robust amount of upgrades for the player to experiment with for a long long time. With excellent flight controls, exciting dog fights, and lots to explore, NeonXSZ is a game with a ton of ""meat"" and depth. There is a small learning curve to get over, but once you get the hang of it, the game opens up. NeonXSZ is also incredibly impressive with buttons on your ship's hud actually functional, to the overall visual and sound effects. I felt as though I was in the ship piloting my enemies destruction.The Aesthetics and sound is well suited to the overall theme of the game. Though the textures are rather basic, the lighting, design, and style makes up for it. The sound of course is full of beeps and boops, and robot voices, as you would expect from a cyber punk game. It's done well, and works with the game's theme.To sum how the game plays out in a nut shell, you go around, exploring your environment, hunting down enemy ships, blow them up, and collect their valuable. Then you take those valuable and make new upgrades for your ship. Rinse, find new space stations, and repeat. The game is quite grindy, and I would even argue that it's designed around the grind. People like myself who don't mind the grind as long as it's well designed will welcome this, but those who are more sensitive to grindy games, it's worth your time to do a little more research before committing to a purchase.Overall NeonXSZ is an enjoyable exploratory flight RPG, with lots of customization. Even though it is pretty grindy in nature, the game is deep and versatile enough to hold my attention. I recommend NeonXSZPros:- Deep and varied amounts of customization- Challenging gameplay- Easy to understand flight controls- Very immersive- Has that ""addictive"" quality- Cyber punk your brains outCons:- Lack of graphical options- Lack of side features- People sensitive to grinds may be put off			"

								If Quake and Decent had a baby, this would be it. I've been playing this game since about mid-2013 and put hundreds of hours put in and can say it's quite the fun game. The art style is simple, yet it doesn't leave you feeling like there needs to be more. It's set up so you can just pick it up and start doing your own thing; you learn how to play by just playing and messing around with things. As you gradually level up your ship you start getting better too; your accuracy improves, your streaks get higher, opponents get tougher and so on. There's different ships that you can swap parts in and out of to get them just how you play. Like going in fast and taking them head on? There's a build for that. More of a heavy hitter who can rail small ships in a single shot? There's a build for that too! Then there's the challenge arenas, they're just that: a challenge. At first they're pretty difficult, but you want to beat it because there's no way you're going to let them do whatever it is that they do! So you go out and build your ship to your specifications and start earning uranium and nanotubes and you march right back in there and kick the living crap out of them! Your/their plans for system domination have been succeeded/foiled! Now what? Well, there seems to be a couple more arenas and they're all above your level. So you go back out, kick more♥♥♥♥♥ take more upgrades and push you and your ship right to the edge. That's pretty much how it all starts, so go kick some♥♥♥♥♥and build your story :)			"

								I haven't played much of Descent or its ilk, I find Sid Meier's Pirates kinda dull and repetitive, and loot-grindy shooters like Borderlands have never held much appeal for me.  Yet I STILL love this game, which is a testament to just how extremely well-executed it is.  A one-of-a-kind RPG-FPS mash-up that's refreshingly free of fluff and boring bits, due to an easily traversable game world and consistently exciting combat.  The developer is really on to something here, and I hope to see similar games released in the future-- but for now, there's nothing else like it in existence.  Absolutely check this gem out, you're getting a stupid amount of value for your money.			"

								Pure Joy! This is not a space shooter with hard target lock, there are no asteroids to mine, this is one of the rare breed of 6DOF twitch shooters done up in glorious fashion, a treat for modern gamers and old fans of Descent and Forsaken alike. The RPG and customization elements are crazy addictive, and the alien atmosphere and soundtrack are perfect. Amazingly polished for an Early Access title. All of the settings and HUD elements can seem overwhelming at first, so can the controls (fully remappable), but part of the joy of the game is discovering and experimenting with them. EVERYTHING can be tweaked to play exactly how you like, right down to the colors of the environment and even speed of the game. Pick this one up, you won't regret it.			"

												Immediately engrossing, NeonXSZ feels like playing a more arcadey interpretation of X3: Terran Conflict on fast forward.  You're plopped into the middle of a sandbox of dogfighting, and need to gradually master all six of your degrees of freedom if you want to get anywhere.  Customizable difficulty, lots of upgrades and weapons and ships to play with, and fun challenge arenas and procedurally-generated tasks make for a fast-paced, player-driven experience.  Nice bright high-contrast visuals pay homage to Tron and are highly customizable, and the low penalty for death (at first) encourages you to keep extending beyond what you think you're capable of, to never play things too safe.  What you'll discover as you get farther is that everything you're doing consumes your main currency, uranium.  Whenever you thrust needlessly, or fire weapons without thinking, you're consuming uranium, which is also used to respawn, to purchase upgrades, and to use teleporters.  You can gain it by doing tasks and killing enemies, but as you move up along the power curve, you're forced to learn more advanced, more elegant and efficient, techniques.  Failing to use your power responsibly, or trying to farm things that are way below your level for too long, could put you in danger of not having enough energy to respawn, should you die.  The way the game nudges you gradually toward both this realization and to increasing challenge and player skill is pretty brilliant.			"

								As an old Freelancer player feeling at home with endless waves of nasties to hunt down for loot in your own little spaceship, NeonXSZ is an amazing breath of fresh air, making me feel at home and yet bringing in the amenities and quality of life that we have come to expect from newer games. To compensate for the lack of a 'story' you get so much more here than in Freelancer in terms of loot and customization (those who love checking all the little stats have so much to do in the in-game upgrade shops, and the loot explosions after each kill feel like Christmas: loot comes inside spherical bubbles that go with the most satisfying pop as you collect them) . The game is all about killing the bad guys,  level up and get to try out the many new unlockable hulls while upgrading the dozen or more equipment parts that keep enhancing your killing machine. So even if you have the option of picking up standard kill or fedex missions at every shop, the point is to get into the action and, well, kill the bad guys.With every hour I played I came to appreciate more and more the incredible care and skill with which the (interactive) cockpit has been designed, conveying a huge amount of information without it ever feeling cluttered (I wish flight simulator cockpits were optimized like this!). The graphical quality of the environment and the effects is astounding and makes this EA game totally feel like an AAA title (let alone that I have never met with a single bug since I bought it). Adding to this, you can even customize the environment colors so that nothing will hurt your eyes as you hunt (including flipping the color of the enemies to a different high-contrast choice). There is no standard in-game tutorial but the learning curve is very gentle because the low level enemies are push-overs and, besides, you can customize the difficulty curve to just where you like it (even the travel speed can be lowered, so that you don't need to be worried about this being a twitch-game that shuts you off if you lack Korean-like reflexes. The many colorful, detailed in-game help pages have been added recently and provide all the information one needs, and the rest can always be learned from exploration and trial and error (it helps that the death penalty is very mild, inviting you to go back into the action with no regrets). So even if the ultra-detailed cockpit may at first overwhelm, don't worry, keep killing the bad guys because it will grow on you and one day you will be able to immediately find the info you need where you want it.Finally, speaking of levels and longevity, I have been taking in the sights and enjoying the leveling-up of my ships' components, so that after 16 hours I am still at level 12 or so, while I understand that one can work it up to 80! Seems like a huge amount of play value to me and so, summing it up, now that I recently passed the 500 game mark in my Steam collection I have never before seen a 'small' indie game done with such an incredible attention to detail and one that I could more sincerely recommend to all loot-addicted space flight fans in need of a high-quality fix. I know that we have been repeatedly disappointed by a number of Freelancer lookalikes in the past several years, so while we wait why not take this gift of a perhaps less ambitious, yet amazingly satisfying game? If anything in this review resonates with you, please do yourself a favor and give NeonXSZ a try - it won't cost you a dime, and it will probably suck you in.			"

								Great Game! If you like 6DOF-games, go and buy it.If you like shooters, a lot of loot and customization, electronic music and futuristic artwork, go, buy it.I'm about 7 hours in the game and did not encounter any bug. Controls are flawless and flying through the stations is smooth as butter in the sun.Getting into the game was a great experience, because of the huge amounts of things to do. But after understanding the basic gamemechanisms and getting into the controls of your ship, NeonXSZ gives me a lot of superb gaming-entertainment.There's still a lot to do in this game for me, but even at this point I can recommend it to you.Edit after 15 hours in the game: Battles and Physics are epic!!!

								Probably the most unique game I've played in a good while, where this game does take shoot em up elements of an FPS, it makes the 3d game engine live up to its potential, flying around in all directions at great speeds and being able to rotate at any angle makes not only navigating the game more challenging but ever so much more immersive.Figuring how to play this game isn't as difficult as it seems after figuring out the controls and learning  more about the game never ceases.I for one would not be surprised if this game takes off massively on the Steam market, and with that I hope that it does with my full support. This is such a fun game for so many different types of people like for casual players to hop in and out for a short amount of shooting or even with the hardcore gamers being able to play this for long periods with things to do.

								I don't normally play games by Rockstar, but I do know that they are about quality control. As this is being made by a former Rockstar employee, I am not surprised that when a new version is released, it will be rock solid stable.That being said, this is a bloody good game. Think ""Descent meets Tron meets Borderlands"", and that would sum up the experience I have with this game. Flying around ala Descent in a computer world ala Tron. Enemy ships will drop parts of its code for weapons, gadgets and other stuff for loot as well as much needed uranium (money and ship power) and carbon tubes (overclocking) like you het from the Borderlands franchise. Not to mention the vendors where you can buy and sell items. The challenge sphere is a nice addition and tests your mettle.The one man Intravenous Software has done a very good job here. I will likely be doing a preview of the game on my YouTube channel in short order (am currently learning OBS intracacies as I will likely start streaming on Twitch.tv as well). A very good game and highly recommended.			"

												Got the game on sale because it looked interesting. Played some other games beforeturning to this on a break. after about a 15 minute learning curve, I was hooked. I recommend playing with the controls to find something you're comfortable with. The default controls might work for someone, but not me. Don't get frustrated early on if you're not used to this type of game. Stick it out, it's worth it. The visuals are sweet, the music is good. Progress is in small increments that make it really feel like even if you're just messing around you're making progress. In short, a really good game, worth the risk.			"

								NeonXSZ is a really well made game. Even though it's still in development I just can recommend it to anyone who likes space-simulations and/or Rogue-like games. I first had to get a grip on the controls. Normally I don't play space-sims. I only played Free Space 2 back in the day.The concept that your equipment defines your level is not a whole new concept, but I really like it, so it just adds to the game itself, that this functions very well.The difficulty is pretty much adjustable to your liking. I actually play on the second easiest difficulty level cause I still have to learn and the learning curve is first pretty high. You have to learn, which enemies you can beat with what level. In addition you should know your weapons. Most time i play with the plasma cannon since i got it. Still have a long way to get the railgun I actually desire.Even if I only played 6 hourse when I wrote this, the still was awesome. Problem is, that I don't have much time for most of my games so I only play the most once a month or so. Still I got a really good impression from NeonXSZ.I just can recommend it to anyone who likes rogue-like and wants something like that in space.			"

								This is a fun little game executed really well. There is something about this game that grabs you and makes you want to master it. I really like the developers choice to make the game as easy or as hard as suites your mood at the time. The balance between difficulty and boring is really well done. Finally, the ability to reskin and change the look of the whole game is pretty cool and helpful in different lighting conditions. The developer says it's ""early access"", but it feels more like a complete game to me. No real show-stoppers bugs, nothing that doesn't feel ""complete"". In short, it's not the sort of ""early-access"" where you are a beta tester and have to go to the googles to figure out work arounds or where your save games will be deleted on a regular basis. I feel like this game is very appropriately priced and worth the money. I suppose the only critique I have for this game is that, as of now, it doesn't have much integration with steam. No achievements, cards or workshop support. Perhaps this is what the developer means by early access?  "

												This is a pretty simple game, but it's really addictive for some reason.  If you just need to shoot things or want a good RPG without a super confusing plot, this is the game for you.Edit:Half way through this turned into a 3d maze racing game.  Instead of shooting things, collecting loot and leveling up, I now have to shoot several finicky, akwardly placed switchs, race through an extremely disorienting maze in 3d space and run into a door that just slammed in my face.  I don't find this mechanic fun at all.  It is extremely frustrating and boaring.  I had to change my rating to not recommended.  I've been working on one of these stupid things for two hours now.  There might be as many as 20 more of them.  If I keep playing, I may reevaluate the game when I get  to the end, but it's not looking good.			"

								I've been playing this game since it came out on Alpha testing, and every new addition to the game since then has been for the better. New gadgets, New ships, and new ways to blast some other ships to hell and back.NeonXSZ is simplistic in it's design and ideology. If it's on their ship, you can get a piece of it. If some of it is still illusive, you can buy the rest if you find the right vendor. If not the right price, you better ""go **** some more **** up""!I've put in so many hours of play before it was available on steam, and it's time well spent. But i'm still not finished yet... There's still much to do.			"

												You have in this nice package a Descent-like 360 degrees freedom of movement, open world do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want kind of deal.  Fight the malware and virus oppositions (or join them against rebelling the operating system and anti-virus factions!), collect loot, create your own hulls or buy them from the dealers, craft weapons or even sell them.  The choices are all yours, really.  The challenge rooms will keep you on your toes if simply fighting enemy ships isn't enough for you.   I haven't made it to the end yet, but I'm sure something is probably waiting at the end, but to find out what, you'll have to find out on your own.   Very immersive.  really captures the essense of being trapped inside a computer system with all these cool♥♥♥♥♥ships floating around as each A.I. is never the same.   You could even choose to deliver data using the transporter, small and fast but with zero weapons on board or mod the hell out of your ship with many different weapons, parts, ect.  There's a whole lot to do in this game for a single player mode.    Just try not to get lost out there.  Think of fallout, but its all about making a name and story for yourself in the world of cyberspace warfare.Verdict: 9 out of 10 "

YouTube™ Video: Tim tries NeonXSZ - 1. All Aboard the USS Friendship ft. Pat Rodriguez 

			Views: 877		

			Gunships, endless loot, mayhem, and my good friend Pat! What more could you ask for from this six degrees of freedom shooter by Intravenous Software?!		

So, I have always been a big fan of flying and shooting. It's honestly what I dream about at night. Growing up playing games like Terminal Velocity and Raptor, I loved taking down enemies and having their guts spill out with that oh-so-delicious loot. Enter NeonXSZ:This 6DoF gunship-shooter is absolutely fantastic on almost every level. From a gameplay perspective: the combat feels tight, responsive, and impactful. The movement is crisp, clean, and fluid. The enemies are predictable when they should be and brutal when you get in over your head. It becomes very satisfying to, like a small fish in a huge pond, creep along to your appropriate feeding grounds and lay waste, only to escape before the bigger predators lumber along to peck you off like the easy picking you are. It then becomes even more satisfying to turn around on those same buttmunches who drilled you into the ground earlier and blow them out of the sky. And even the loot itself is well designed. Does the enemy ship have that thing on it? It'll drop that thing. Every time. Well... parts of it anyway. The UI is very daunting at first, but easily understood once you take the time to pause, by simply right-clicking I might add, and take a look around. You're a pilot, damnit! Not a surgeon! You have to orient yourself with the tools before you go off willy-nilly. This can be one of the pitfalls of the game. There is no real ""tutorial"" to speak of, other than just reading the manuals in the menu. Like any roguelike, you learn the hard way. By exploding. Over and over again. The various missions you take on will lead you across the entire map, leading you to sometimes choose between a quick ship, or a hearty ship.And the world... My gods, the world. First of all, I love the aestetic. You're inside of a computer. Of course it looks like that. And since you have the ability to customize the colors, to an extent, of both your ship and the world itself, you'd be hard pressed to find a style you DON'T like. And that's to say nothing of the expansiveness of it.Overall, I would say that NeonXSZ is a must-have for anyone who loves Diablo-style loot, tight flight mechanics, bright lights and fancy colors, or any combination of the three. And at a $20 price point, you'll be making a smart investment.

Early Access Review
								I've only played just under 3 hours or so and wanted to share my first impressions because I saw that the forums were a tad bit dead apperently.Too long didnt't read is basically: This is one of the very few if not the only Early access games I haven't eventually been disapointed with.So, keeping in mind I'm ""one of those damn young'uns"" being only 19, I had not ever heard of a 6DOF game before, and had no idea what it meant when I picked this up, because like the smart buyer I am I do ALL my research first /sarcasm. It turns out I really should have... Because I wish I'd known about this genre sooner! This game is one of the few, or really, possibly the ONLY Early access game I've played more than half an hour AND enjoyed thouroughly. sadly, any Early Access game I've played prior to this has fallen under one or the other but not both, be it because of lack of time, or lack of interest, or just genuinley bad games.  That being said, I can definitley see this not being everyones cup of tea, but It is a very interesting game to say the least. the controls take some getting used to and the gameplay is different than anything i've played before but it is lots of fun none the less. to me, it  kind of feels like what i'd expect you'd get if you mixed a space-sim like X with an arcade or action shooter like ye olde doom or wolfenstien. it's a great game for people who want to try something a bit different than most any game today, and it's worth a buy, even if you have to wait for a sale.

Early Access Review
								This game is an excellent, though fairly simple shooter. At least at first glance. Based on the omni-directional shooting mechanics of Descent, this game has you placed in a wheel-like, radial cyberspace map filled with allies and enemies. The story is also very uncomplicated, to the degree where I'm not too aware of what it is. It seems that you are battling malware entities in a cyberspace environment, but I could be very wrong. The keystone for this game is the combat, which is very good. There are a wide variety of weapons, ships, and special modules for said ships, making customization nicely nuanced for your speedy little fighter whizzing across the map. There is a strightforward progression system, where your engines, shields, and fuel expand continually through mods you gain from killing enemies. It's very old-school Diablo in its loot-based gameplay: Kill enemeis, get upgrades, kill bigger enemies. The combat ranges from flying through cyber-tunnels while blasting enemies with a lightning gun to engaging with intense dogfights with four or more foes in enclosed, contsantly shifting arenas. It feels excellent, and the game tracks your stats with every inevitable death, allowing you to track your skill as well. The ships UI is also really cool, letting you customize it to a very fine degree. Also, you can chnage your ships, and the environment's colours any time you want. That had to be mentioned. The flaws are few, and given this game's early-access status, still potentially resolvable. First, the lone map, though generates the locations of bases and ""cities"" with every load, can get repetitive rather quickly. More maps, or a larger map, would go a long way to making this game last much, much longer. Secondly, having more missions, goals, tasks and objectives in between the awsome combat could help elongate the experience too. Misisons do exist, yes, but they are few and far between, and I had trouble finding them. To recap:The game has an exccelent visual style, excellent combat and progressions, decent sound design and insane levels of customization. However, the lone map and few objectives make the game feel a tad empty, though both could be fixed over time with little problems. Overall, This game is awsome, and deserves way more attention than it's getting.EDIT: The map scenario isn't too bad when you consider the arena challenges, after playing some more.			"

												This game is AMAZING! it's basically like most RPGs. you choose your fighting style, you choose your ship, weapons, etc. You kill things. you get a prize. lots of prizes. Not a lot of grinding is really neccessary, but if you want to, it's really worth it. I can compare it with going on a RAMPAGE in GTA 5. JUST KILL EVERYTHING...but beware kiling factions. basically you take control of a ship that has 6 dimensions of travel. 6DOT. up down left right forward backwards. it's great. you can trust me. I have big hands.There is a SLIGHT learning curve, but once you get it, it's simple. after an hour i stopped bumping into things. You play a program in a computer. you can be good(anti-virus) or be bad(virus). Areas are separated by level, so if you want a challenge, fight higher levels, but BEWARE...some of these little shi7s will chase you...be aware. If you don't want a challenge, fight lower levels. Fighting at lower levels is like going into beast mode. The body count is HIGH!addicting. fun. time flies. you can get on here and lose track of time. It's one objective to the next. The objectives are finished quickly but can be complex. Honestly, I was thinking about this game at work today. It's really quite satisfying to play.it's DEFINITELY worth $15.I thought about whether I should for an entire week...and YES $15 is nothing for how good this game is.			"

												Initially bought the game for support, as I like all things indy/grassroots, but already just a few hours into it, I'm really liking NeonXSZ. To make the transition smoother to a 3D, zero-G, FPS environment, you can slow down the gameplay and increase ""autobraking"" so the vehicle is more manageable. Gameplay is straightforward, shoot the other guy. Plenty of map to explore, ton of upgrades as you keep killing the red guys. Graphics are nicely done, has a Tron-esque feel to it all, and at least running on Nvidia GTX 660 (Linux), getting steady 60FPS with smooth rendering, so should run on low-end boxes well enough. The dev is/was pretty active on Reddit, so nice to see hands-on development on an early release game. Well worth your $20.			"

								The best looking and most playable of the current generation of 6DOF games available.  There is not one aspect of this game I would fault.  Smooth, slick and very frantic in places, this is a game to invest many hours in for great enjoyment.This was one of the very first games to appear on the, then, fledgling Greenlight and since that initial time period this marvelous game has developed in leaps and bounds to become what I consider is the pinnacle of six degrees of freedom and a stunning product well worth the asking price considering it's tiny hard drive footprint.  This is a deep game with a steep learning curve and heaps of options but once you master everything, you will be playing this over and over again.And it is not even officially released yet.10/10 - 6DOF the way it's meant to be played.

												When I first loaded up NeonXSZ, I wasn't really sure what was going on. I could have read the help menu in the interface but decided to wing it. I picked my ship from a choice of 3 and off I went, flying around in a station and getting my butt kicked. To be honest, I found it fun... it gave me a feeling that I hadn't felt since the NES when I played games such as Metroid and Solar Jetman which I didn't have the manuals for: exploration. Not only of a level or map, but of the game itself. It didn't take me too long to figure out what the game was about.You are in some kind of computer system which is represented by a space station with corridors and rooms. In this space station there are 4 different factions. You have the good guys which are the operating system and anti-virus, and the bad guys which are virus and malware. Each factions files or programs are represented by ships. Some carry harmful malware around while others attack programs of the opposing factions. You are caught in the middle of this war but luckily are aligned with the OS/Antivirus to begin with.The idea of the game is simple: fly around in your ship and kill stuff, pick up their debris which will allow you to research and eventually use the modules and hulls that they are using. Acting on this idea, at least to begin with, is difficult, as you are going to get killed by ships which are higher level than you. A lot. I didn't mind this though... I quickly understood that attacking anything that was more than a level above me would end badly, so I searched for lower level enemies. After getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked for a little while, running away from higher level programs that were gunning for me, I found myself being able to fend for myself a bit more. After a while longer, I felt like I could at least give as good as I got, and a little while longer, I was king of that space station and any Virus or Malware stupid enough to cross my path was in deep trouble and I was ready to go to the next tier of space station. That's the thing: there is a massive snowball effect in this game with regards to levelling. After the initial teething problem at the beginning of any tier, you are going to be outgunned for a while, but once you begin to claw your way up, you will be dominating in no time. It's oh so addictive and a lot of fun, if a little repetitive: something which is not really too big a deal for me, I don't mind grinding.It's a great game but if I had any complaints, it would be that every station feels the same. It's the same central hub with the same corridors and same bases; it would be nice to see some variations in layout - it also seems to me that every time you log into the game, the bases will have switched positions randomly around the map. Not a huge problem but just a bit unnecessary. I'd also like the ability to assault enemy bases and defend my allies' bases. Sure you can take over the central hub but that doesn't really do anything apart from net you some rewards. It's quite obvious to me that this game is perfect for some kind of territorial conquest side to it, but no matter, maybe someday we will see a mod or dlc for that.In summary, if you like space simulator type games, grinding for new and shiny loot to help you find even newer shinier loot, you will love this game. I do expect that most people would get bored of the repetition before they reach the last space station though, but at least you'll get your money's worth first.			"

												I won't be able to say enough good things about this game. It's really perfect in every way. It's like Star Wars and Tron had a baby and made the perfect fighter shooting game. This game will have my attention for many hours to come.Pros:+The nice thing is that there is so much content and upgrades that it will take a long time to get to the best hull there is.+Strategy is definitely a key in this game. You can't just shoot every enemy you come across or you will get anhiliated. +Arena's that allow you to test your skill and you choose which arena will work for you based off of your current level.+Content, Content, Content. So much♥♥♥♥♥♥to do, you won't get bored.Cons:- Is it doesn't feature any multiplayer or Co-op, but honestly, it doesn't bother me. I can see how a game like this would really go down the shoot if it were overrun with junky kids just shooting everything that is in front of them.- Lack of big bosses it seems. It would have been good if they incorporated stage bosses, but not a deal breaker.Definitely worth the $19.99 price tag, but a bonus if you get it on sale.			"

												Overall, the game is fantastic. It really does build and put a twist on Descent's game mechanics with taking pieces of upgrades from destroyed ships and collecting them until you've got all the pieces, then equipping them at a docking station. Though, unlike Descent, there are enemies that you have no chance of killing on your own, which is where the reinforcements call comes in handy if you have allies close by that will help.The only problem this game has is the CPU side of things. When I turned up my MSAA to max, checked all the checkbox graphics options, increased the light slider from 4 to 5, and decreased the render distance from 4000 to 3500, my gtx670 seemed to not even need to run at it's stock clock speed, but that's because my 3770K CPU was technically maxed out. But to be fair, they did spend a lot of time to optimize the CPU side already and it still runs at a good frame rate with those setting changes.			"

Early Access Review
								Early access review: I've put about 20 hours into the Desura build of the game and fully intend to replay the game once the full release is out, but here are my early access impressions.To start things off, I'm a big fan of 6-DOF (Descent-like) games, and Neon XSZ is one of the more impressive ones to date. What sets this one off is the wide variety of customization available for your ship, from balancing speed vs power, differing frame types and weapon loadouts to more eclectic (and IMO, interesting) things like modules. The aesthetic is a very neat minimalist Tron-like presentation, the inerta makes ships rewarding to fly, and the loot pickups add some agency to combat. I'm also intrigued by (but haven't yet played) the challenge arenas, which provide more structure to the game. I've been following the dev blog for a while and eagerly await the full release to get the complete experience of the game, but what I've played thus far has been impressive. Recommended.			"

												Absolutely! This game is amazing. BUT..... The learning curve is like climbing a mountain, by jumping up it with your legs tied together. Possible but only if you hate yourself.I give it the full review here.

			Neon XSZ is a game in the fashion of classics like Descent or Forsaken and somewhat like Doom or Quake but replace the normal man on a mission with a Ship on a mission and there you have it.

												Hello everybody, Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) here to update our original preview for NeonXSZ that we wrote back in 2012 with our full review for the game. This is but a brief summary of the full review, for the full review you can find it here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/neonxsz-review-and-overview/NeonXSZ is a 6DOF game that takes place in a computer styled game that feels like Tron and Descent had a baby. The game is incredibly well designed and features over 900 total upgrades for you to discover and unlock. It's mechanics work incredibly well together and none of them feel underdeveloped or weak compared to others. It's a fine piece of craftsmanship that is well worth checking out, especially if you enjoy the 6DOF genre.I've also recorded an updated gameplay video for the game:

Early Access Review
								Once upon a time  I was colorblind, so I took #acid#, lying on my fluffy, flying carpet, a computer spoke to me about a masterprogram, the computer sucked me in, into its 01011 soul, suddenly the fluffy, flying carpet transformed into a snail...then a spaceship!I saw lights, finally! I saw colors! Neon, oh shining so bright, colors everywhere and music, the computer gave me the tools to ride the neonlight wave within the Masterprogram (and uranium too! )Uranium and tubes to upgrade my flying, fluffy carpet snail overclocked spaceship, it flies so fast! Up and down, left and right, back and forth so fast, I see colors! Finally so bright, so neon, so tasty... shooting lasers on malware and virus ( I think? therefore am I?) Fantastic I thought, I believed this Masterprogram was the most trippy revelation here on Steam. There are no Pro's no Con's . Only Neon. Makes sense? No... it shouldn't. But you should try it too. Not the #acid#. This Masterprogram. You really should! If you're nice maybe we'll get Co-Op. Then you will see it too! Maybe.Fasten your seatbelts and stroke the fluffy flying carpet. It's so soft. Oh I am not colorblind anymore. Becauseof NeonXSZ. Recommended!			"

												Large arenas and high acceleration makes for very awkward 6dof controls. I'm not sure 6Dof can really work on keyboards. I keep knocking against the walls. The game tells me not to worry about knocking against the walls but if it doesn't matter the game really shouldn't flash the entire screen red whenever it happens. Like the devs don't seem to know the language of the medium. Red screen flashes mean ""you are getting damaged"", not ""you are getting tickled"".I gave the game an hour of my time to reveal itself. This should be more than enough time, but the combat was too simple and provided little opportunity for strategic play. The upgrade system might have provided an opportunity to strategize outside of combat, but I really do not have time to wait multiple hours for the game to start being fun.I guess, bluntly, it's grindy. If you like filler missions rewarded with fake money, go ahead. If you just want to play a fun, interesting game right away, don't bother, you wont have the patience to wait for it.			"

												The core gameplay the combat, just isn't satisfying, lacks tightness or feedback and movement is a mess that can’t make up it’s mind. Maybe using a flight stick was causing this as it might not have been designed for it in mind. Having to deal with massive multi-ship fights didn’t help, allies or not.It isn't helped that you are dumped not knowing where you are and the sameness of everything is less than helpful. Bumping into walls causing a shield flash is most irritating.The loot grind mechanic just doesn't appeal to me in the slightest. The sheer number of statistics is just not newbie friendly. The lack of clear goals or objectives mean guiding the player is a non-starter. You are already going to go out to kill something, point me towards activities I can do and where they are instead. A skippable newbie friendly area where you get introduced to the elements of gameplay would have done wonders instead of pages and pages of text.I just don’t want to risk an additional 1.5 hours knowing I already don’t like what I am seeing. I would suggest playing Sub-level Zero instead even though it is a rouge-like as the combat is done much much better.What as Shame.			"

												Very bland. Almost all of the 'differentness' in this game is a difference of quantity or scale rather than a difference of quality. Progression is grindy, and it's about as 'on rails' as you can get in a sandbox.			"

												I'm going to be as honest as I can here, I like pretty much everything apart from the combat. Somehow the combat feels really dull. The weapons all sound too quiet and muffled, and there's just no excitement when you're shooting or being shot at. Real shame really.More info: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/neonxsz-glides-out-of-early-access-a-6-degrees-of-freedom-shooter-for-steamos-linux.6696 "

								If you have a 3D controller (6DOF) and think you'll be good here...Think again. This game was built in the Unity engine and while there is some crude settings for sticks/gamepad in game, the dev does not support the function AT ALL.  You'll manage to get a few of the axis's to work, then one or two will be FUBAR. http://www.neonxsz.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=228&p=1706The Dev says ""trying to play Neon with a Joystick is like trying to drive a car with a banana"". I say ""Trying to fly a 6DOF game with a mouse and keyboard is like trying to drive a car with your feet"".This game looked like a nice modern spin on Descent/Forsaken type games. Too bad it has such a lousy limitation on control devices.			"
