												Once upon a time, I was addicted to CrimeCraft. It used to be a game that while you could buy weapons and grear, you could do missions and earn materials to create weapons and gear as good as or even better than what was available in the store. Slowly, those items were no longer available to the crafter and were only available to the winners of tournaments, thus making it impossible for new players or existing players to gain any equal equipment as the veterns. A great idea that was distroyed by the greed of whoever was managing the game, as the original company had long sold its interest in the game.			"

												This was a amazing game once before the bleedout update and other updates, but the company has since changed and now the game is abandoned and HEAVY PAY 2 WIN. The game is even harder now for new people to get into liking it cause with the low population most of the time when u que for a match u will end up vs high levels with their bought(p2w) gear and u just wont stand a chance. I recommend just advoiding this game and let it die, so i can just remember the joy of what it used to be.			"

 Small review Enjoyable game on hands of ""Wannabe EA"": 3rd-party EULA, dumb installation, unbalanced weapons & P2W.Originally posted by MAYNGAMES talking about Crimecraft: Gangwars and his dead community: We have exactly what we deserve...  Complete Review ☺ It's free.☺ It can run on a toaster (♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer). Tested on a Lanix Neuron A.☹ When you have execute the game for the first time, it will force you to create an account at their webpage (non-steam). In the store page of the game they didn't announcement third-party terms and conditions.☹ When you are ready to play, the game will crash 5-10 times. After that, the launcher will show you a ""repair option"". It will include: the game and one punkbuster. Now, the game will work good.☺ The playability is good: TPS with not bad camara control (you will have at least 1 blind point), good aim system, FPS aim (press F), a lot ""game modes"" (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrimeCraft#Combat_Modes) & weird melee combat system.☺ TF2 Hat when you get level 6.☹ You will find people playing online this days: friday, saturday and sunday. The other days looks like a empty server simulator.☹ Unbalanced weapons: melee do more damage than headshots & gatling gun is overpowered.☹ Newbies, will have no chance because the player base is veteran.☹☹ Pay-To-Win (P2W), have you ever seen 4 players attacking 1 dude with rifle assaults, grenades and one rocket launcher 2 times until he dies?. Welcome to the P2W paradise where the free user are bloody idiots trying to kill dudes that comes running into you, and he just uses the melee to kill you.4 (☺) Happy Faces vs. 7 (☹) Sad Faces. The only reason people still playing this game is the TF2 hat.			"

												I was a beta tester back in the day back when you had the original vogster launcher. I paid for gold multiple times  and stayed with them on and off through their company changes. I cannot access my old account anymore due to myan games taking over and changing everything to their system.This game was fun before the last change of ownership, having to start completely over with a new charecter losing my 300 mill and gang fully upgraded I do not recomend this game anymore.

Free to Play - Pay to EnjoyThis review will be pretty brief. I wanted to like this game...but I won't be playing it again.The GoodWell...that was quick...The Bad- Bulky controls mixed with fast-paced combat make for a nice train wreck.- The PvP is an imbalanced mess. This is frustrating for everyone. The seasoned players get paired up with new players and the new players have little chance to keep pace unless they instantly invest some cash into the game. This is not likely considering they just started. Even more-so after force-feeding players advertisement after advertisement. We all got it the first time; you want us to buy stuff. If a player doesn't get the message beforehand, they will after they realize that they only have a chance against an opponent once they have spent as much as that opponent, weather the price be time or money.- The game is called CrimeCraft...where is the crafting? Oh, you mean that hand-full of item categories. Your character is locked into one category of crafting (A.K.A. the character's ""profession""). That would make sense if there where more than five tiers of items to make or that half of the items weren't null from the start.- The advertisements are more obnoxious than the majority of the player base. One of the first things you learn about psychology is that force equals resistance. Players are forced to see advertisements on every load screen. The players are forced to make purchases in order to have some of the most basic of game play mechanics available to them. Force is applied to just about everything in this game in an attempt to nickel and dime the player.- The missions are repetitive, generic, and grow dull quickly. The rewards in the end really aren't much of a motivation to play the missions.The Ugly- Starting off with character creation...awful. The actual appearance of the characters is awful. They all look like the trash you would see on Jerry Springer, Maury, or Cops (maybe that is the point). The clothing is awful. Not everyone wants to have a character that looks like some ****head thug or some other digital manifestation of concentrated♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I think that is the best way to sum up the character appearance; concentrated♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hey! There's a new name for the game!- The levels, maps, stages, whatever you want to call them. They aren't very well designed. Not as in how they look, they look decent enough. But the layouts themselves. I guess I should have said bulky controls plus fast paced combat in mediocre arenas make for a nice train wreck.Like I said, I really wanted to like this game. Its a really good concept that was butchered in production. There's a lot of untapped potential here, but I don't see that potential ever being recognized. Seems the developers are fine with mediocre as long as there's players that will pay cash for mediocrity. "

												I was sort of dissapointed with the one, because feeling like you're in a ""gang"" and doing missions seemed like a simple idea, if it's done well. But instead this is a dull, lifeless, mediocre game with outdated visuals, clunky controls, and a distictive lack of enjoyment. I'd reccomend only if you want the TF2 hat reward.			"

The game has a nice RPG element with a new First Person mode; although I still prefer the original 3rd person mode, you can switch between them anytime. The game has some decent crafting also and some pve/pvp elements. If you enjoy PVP oriented games then this one is worth checking out; although don't expect much from the community.			"

												I enjoyed this game several years ago; before it came to Steam. It was very exciting and the whole crafting and gang war element really made me addicted to it. After many years down the road, the management had a lawsuit filed against them and now it is being run by a different company that prioritizes money over player. That's the mistake they did and they even merged both EU and US server to try and keep the player pools up; however that didn't help this game survive the trial of time. It's dead and gone now. But the memories and friends I made will always be cherished.			"

They were all horrendously overpowered and when the folks who were previous MLG got their hands on them, virtually every game was one-sided. *Sees so-and-so on the other team, knows them to be good.

												A game somewhat similar to Team Fortress 2 being that there's a lot of character customization in the outfits department. The character models are unreal and glossy looking, cheap work really. I wish anyone luck to being able to play this game though simply because somehow the developers must have put out some kind of bot to update and produce sales based on a schedule. Sadly, just no one plays. At all, ever, in any country.I wish I could say anything else about the game, it's on a publisher oddly no kickstarter and with how long this game has been up since it's death says there's something going on. I'm starting to question Valve entirely especially with quality control.It looks like it would have been fun.....Was it ever alive?			"

												This used to be a good game.---------Update*I think is about time I update my review and tell you guys more about this game (Also my frustration and hope).  First, don't look at my play hours. It might seems to be only 200 hours in steam, but my playtime probably exceed more than thousand. I play this game back when bleedout was just started to be release.It is also the only game I ever spent over $100 USD, For some of you, $100 might seems small change. But for me, that was huge sum to pay for a game considering my country currency being low (At about 3:1 ratio to US dollar back then). I don't often spend more than $5 USD to purchase game, let alone spending $100 for a single game alone. This pretty much tell you how spectacular and fantastic this game was back then if you are willing to fork out such a huge amount of cash for it.On the good old day, you cannot spend cash to purchase overpowered stuff to wreck havoc upon your enemy. You need skill, teamwork and flexibility in order to win. The only reason you pay is to get some awesome skin for your clothes or weapon. Even if you pay for those gear, those gear are pretty much average and can be easily earn by free user as long as they grind for it (You don't need to grind too hard for it either).The developer and game master on the good old day would be willing to listen to player suggestion, have lot's of event and actively participate it. Even tournament in the good old time was very intense and fun. Hell, you might even call me crazy for waking up at 6am just to participate the tournament. You also meet a lot of player and the community was pretty nice to you, even if you are new player. This pretty much sum up how much fun I had in the old time.Then suddenly come the dark age where everything just go wrong. Developer start to sell overpowered gear at ridiculous amount of price just to milk the community, game master no longer active and worst of all, start to banned player from forum for criticize their policy. Hell, you can even get banned for giving solution to the problem faced by the community. You simply cannot say No, you must be Yes man or else you get banned from the forum.They even start to implement some ridiculous and stupid suggestion by paying user. What is it, you might be wondering?They want Gold Division Tournament to have an even higher level restriction, so player level 20 would not be able to participate it. You want to participate tournament with level 20 character? Sure you can, but only up to Silver or Bronze Division.At what pretext they want to barred level 20 character from participate? There is various reason which some I came into acceptance, but some of the most stupid reason that are accepted by the developer which came from the pay user is that good player with level 20 character would own the rest of the level 50 player with his op skill and gear. First thing that cross my mind is, are the developer demented?First of all, how can a level 20 gear (Particularly weapon and armor) much stronger and powerful than a level 50 gear? Even if you purchase level 20 gear with real cash, there is none of the gear even came close enough to compete with free high-end gear. Second, lot's of ability are inaccessible for low level character and level 20 boost have much weaker effect than level 50 boost. So, tell me. How is that possible for level 20 to be more OP than level 50? If a player could defeat you with level 20 character, what makes it impossible for him to beat you with level 50 character? Do tell. Let's not forgot it was tournament, which means everybody would be using their best gear. Would a level 50 player participate tournament while ill equip? Surely you jest.You might be wondering if I am the one who are being insane to begin with, since I am using a low level character for Gold division tournament. Well, I for one love challenge and there is nothing wrong to be playing handicap. If you play long enough and try everything, surely you want to push your boundary. See how far you can go with your skill. Another reason I go into Gold Division with low level character is to test the capability of low level character since lot's of low level player complain about their incapability to compete against high level player.From what I experience, yes it is possible for low level player to compete against high level player if their skill are on par. Unfortunately, this doesn't bode well with pay user. They would accuse you of hacking and give whatever reason they could find just to tarnish your reputation, in order to get rid of you forever. My level 20 character probably the only lowest level character that ever won and bearing the ""Gold Winner"" title (If you are in game, check for a character name Lisa Rogan with the title if you don't believe me). I am not trying to brag here, but it give me a sense of accomplishment that I could compete on equal ground against high level player (Which some of them even used Pay To Win Gear) and to prove the theory that low level player cannot win against high level player with better gear are just a myth.In case you are wondering if I purchase gear with cash, my answer is No. I only purchase those fancy skin just to make my character look fabulous. Overall, this pretty much just one case whereby the developer slowly turn insane and only listen to pay user. Infact, their lust and desire grew beyond redemption to the extend they introduce countless of Pay To Win gear and banned several prominent and well known player under the pretext of cheating while those real cheater are roaming free in the server.Those very same cheater that goes scott free are their very own pay user. You got the drift right? You pay me to get those OP gear to own noob while I banned those guy you cannot beat in fair match just so you could win the tournament. 1 for developer, 1 for pay user and 0 for good player.

												game died in the way most human beings die. Zero dignity and a pants full of poo. sadly. the devs killed the game when they merged the north american servers with the europe servers (my name was taken on that server and they forced my name to change. because the other one was better. wtf?). i have to say. it was SOOO MUCH FUN i put in so much money. would i accept a refund if they tried to backwards mug me and force 250 -350 bux into my wallet? NO WAY! worth every dollar, did it make my character god in comparison to non paying players? no. it helped me in other ways, pve ways. in the golden days you could make weapon skins, and seemingly premium weaponry, armor, attachments you name it on the Black market shop thing you once could make it. but the game became a poison when they changed all that, the market became a place of godly gifts for god sizes of money. the game is pretty empty. account, forgotten. don't press install. those recent events look tantalizing but.... the memories of times a fun have long since been transformed from skeleton to new earth.

												Not my cup of tea. Standard shooter. Feels somewhat Pay to Win. I sent a ticket to Steam support, and they cannot reset my stats so might as well say here that I only played to get that Bolt Action Blitzer for TF2. That took about 2-3 hours, and the rest of the 14-15 hours was patching the darn game. So no, I did not play this game for 17.6 hours, and I am not inclined to touch this game again. Ever.Honestly, there are many better shooters out there so I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one.			"

												Do Not bother to download this game if you are not good at first person shooters and like PVP.  Has terrible or No matchmaking.  You are Forced to play PVP matches to level up from the start.  Till level 3 - 5, Stuck at a lobby screen with only option is play practice with AI for no xp, or PVP against other players that are pros and higher level.  You cannot customize your avatar till level 3.  You cannot customize your game selection till level 3.  You don't see the RPG city part of the game till you reach level 5.  You don't get the TF2 hat till level 6.   Like most PVP games, the other side players always play to win.  There was people playing this game, maybe 20ish, in the us server.  Not sure if being on the losing side in a PVP match gives you xp.  Kept getting stomped and had to ragequit before the match ended. Game does load and work, had no problem login in. Graphics look ok, sound is ok.You have an assault rifle and a SMG.  Both guns fire full auto and has muzzle climb from recoil effects.  Assault rifle climbs straight up, so you have to start firing at torso.  SMG climbed diagonally up to the right.  Took a lot of bullet hits just to kill one man.  You do recover health by waiting while not being damaged.  You do respawn in a match.  Guess if you are good at COD, you would be good at this game.  Does load an anticheat program called XTrap and has report cheater button.Supposed to have a stupid TF2 hat when you reach an achievement point.I would think this game would be closed down by now. Given a choice between playing only this game or APB Reloaded, i would gladly choose and recommend APB Reloaded.			"

												CC is basically a predecessor of the likes of Destiny and The Division, being an MMO FPS with both a singleplayer and multiplayer component. Unfortunately, while I had tons of fun with it, it's basically dead and can't be recommended for various reasons.- The game relies on X-Trap which isn't compatible with Windows 10, thus blocking out lots of potential players.- The game had been sold to a different team a few years ago which has long stopped supporting CC. Don't expect any kind of new content or hotfixes or whatnot. You'll rarely see any GMs and all the team seems to be doing is rolling out the same old events and bonus rates.- The economy is heavily leaning towards those willing to spend money on CC. Most matches see at least one or two players with high-end gear impossible to get through normal means.- A certain singleplayer mission is bugged so an NPC you need to escort gets stuck in the same place. Contacting the support does nothing and I only managed to get past it by repeatedly starting the mission over and over again until I finally got lucky.- Another singleplayer mission has you play under the influence of some experimental drugs which has its effect grow stronger and stronger over the course of the mission. It tries so simulate dizziness and succeeds far too well at it. I had never been feeling sick when playing a game before (been gaming for more than 25 years now), but this mission had mee feeling sick for the rest of the day.On the plus side:+ The singleplayer campaign can't objectively be called good, but I enjoy these kinds of low-tech, cheesy FPS. It is fun blasting through various locations and the story actually is rather well-written with numerous factions fighting for power in a war-torn city.+ There are tons of side-quests and in-game achievements (most of these are not Steam achievemnts, though)+ There is also a great variety in game-modes and skill/weapon configurations+ The action simply feels right thanks to accurate weapon feedback, satisfying melee combat and a roll manouever that allows for more flexibility.All in all it once was a great game ahead of its time that shouldn't - or rather cannot be played properly anymore. If it ever gets fixed (probably would need to be sold to another team again) I'd happily dive back in,Also a note on Steam achievements: Some of these require HEAVY grinding like the one that asks you to spend 100 days in instances (so this means a whopping 2400 hours playing not counting the time you spend in the hub areas) and others don't even unlock properly like the ones relating to gang activities.

												There is nothing really special about this game. A lot of people played it back during the 2011 holiday coal rush, and it barely had any players back then. I distinctly remember someone saying ""thank God, now I never have to play this again"" when they got their achievement. I think it had something to do with throwing snowballs around. It was kind of fun, but was definitely more fun than the vanilla gameplay this game had to offer, which is really bad. Customization is there, but the quality of the models drops through the floor when you actually get in game. The gameplay does not consist of much more than running and gunning. The game just feels so empty. It starts off with a cool premise, and then forgets about it. Free to play could not save this title. Steam coal rush could not save this title. I will leave it up to you to decide what that says about the game.			"

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												CrimeCraft was launched in 2009 and depicts an apocalyptic near future where society has desintegrated into anarchy due to it's dependance on an obsolete fuel source. The war for oil has ultimately caused it's price to skyrocket, bringing the world's economy to its knees and making governments fall. Gangs rule the world now, and it's up to you to decide to be a victim or to fight back by building your own. I can see where Vogster Entertainment's writers and producers got their inspiration from since at the time the game was developed 1st world countries were facing the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression, and it wasn't unrealistic to expect this kind of near future to unfold in real life. Fortunately 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner US President Barack Obama had just been elected, and his administration did a good job turning things around over the following years.CrimeCraft was updated with two expansions (BleedOut and GangWars) that included new features, maps and game types, as well as extra content. BleedOut, the first expansion released in autumn 2010, was one of the game's highlights. In addition to the expansion pack, it gave the game its own graphic novel, with art done by illustrators in the comic book industry who presented it at that year's New York Comic Con. The BleedOut campaign was broken up into episodes that were released weekly for ten weeks. These episodes had a set of missions each.

			BLEEDOUT is the first major content expansion to the Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Shooter CrimeCraft. Check out our Episodic Trailer at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdAyNVojQs8		

Crimecraft is all about gang warfare. A large, night-time persistent city acts as the game’s lobby where players can form gangs, accept missions and buy new weapons. It appears to be fortified against the chaos and danger of the outside world, an ecological disaster and an overall financial collapse happened there but some areas are surprisingly functional, with colorful billboards announcing some of the developer's partners, and plently of social spaces with a pulse and a grungy/post-modernist art-style, giving the place somewhat of a dystopian cyberpunk feel.The game consists of twelve game modes, broken down into two major categories: PVP game modes where players compete against each other, and PVE game modes where players compete against computer controlled AI bots. An extra PVP/PVE hybrid mode is also featured. Other features include questing, achievements, crafting and gang hideouts.Players can craft items such as weapons, clothing and drugs. A large list of abilities, boosts and equipment is available, each with different pros and cons. These items can be used in the instanced battles. These battles are where the shooter aspect of CrimeCraft takes place, they usually consist of two teams of 5 or 8 vs each other. Players can join instanced battles from the lobbies and also sign up for daily tournaments that will put the winners personal/gang names on a leaderboard and award them a special loot crate.Gangs fight for territory everyday by assigning members to the gang wars matches, the result will determine who gets to run which part of Sunrise City. Just like most other MMORPG, CrimeCraft has its own breathing economy. The main hub for all transactions and pricing of items is created by the players in the Auction House. Players are able to sell any unwanted items they may have for in-game cash.Initially this Unreal Engine 3 third-person shooter featuring MMORPG elements was published as a boxed release and required an additional monthly subscription to play. Its business model was highly criticized since launch and also included virtual item microtransactions. With the launch of the first expansion Vogster Entertainment changed it to ""free to play"" and settled on premium subscriptions and microtransactions for monetization. While the premium subscription only offfers your character additional rewards from combat, microtransactions are sold in the form of ""Gold Bar"" stacks, which you can spend at the game item store, the ""Black Market"", on all sorts of premium weapons, attachments, ammunitions and drugs, with slightly better stats than any of the ones you can acquire with PVE/PVP mission rewards. Of course there's also purely cosmetic items you can purchase to pimp your character, but the ""pay to win"" factor is there, since the developers are offering you competitive advantages in exchange for real money. I suspect that for the right ammount they'll even offer you their mothers in exchange for gold bars.This game was released 7 years ago and has aged considerably. The company has long ago ceased development and the player population number has fallen to extreme lows. Nevertheless CyberChaosCrew would definitely recommend it if its current business model wasn't based on pay to win monetization and if the company was engaged on an Unreal Engine 4 upgrade with general game feature overhaul.

												Originally, the game had a thriving community with good trades and players willing to help. But now, under Mayn Games, it has been made a ghost town game, where rarely anyone is in the hub worlds and only play a gamemode, a Single gamemode out of the TDM, CTF, etc, for a currency that is utterly breaking and forcing the game to be unenjoyable. If you're reading this, do not download and stay clear. Mayn only took the game just to put it on the shelf and let it collect dust.			"

												Word of advice: don't treat this like a massively multiplayer online game.That basically sums it up, but if you actually bother to read on, be my guest.I could've rated this game long ago when I first started playing it outside of Steam. I didn't really think it was good back then, I still don't think it's really good now anyway. Don't take my words for it though, most of the reviews you read will tell you the same thing: it is mostly a dead game these days. You could find a few matches here and there, but even if you do, I can assure you they're mostly inhabited by players of the same clan/community, and you'll end up with either 1 out of 2 outcomes:1) You get kicked because they're having their lovely ""clan battles"".2) You get mowed down by an entire clan teaming up against you.Lucky for you, CrimeCraft isn't all about PvP. It has PvE matches (which actually incorporates the only cooperative play besides GvG matches) as well as an interesting story-driven campaign, IF (yes, if) you pay for the ""ticket to the movie"".So yeah, you probably already have the idea that CrimeCraft is, for the most part, a money-driven game. A lot, if not all, of the features in the game require you to cough up the dough you earn in your life and not in-game. Don't get me wrong though, despite that, CrimeCraft is far from a ""pay-to-win"" game. Buying good equipment does not make you invincible or give you insane damage; it's still about reflex and skills.If there are certain products that interest me (yes, I paid for CrimeCraft) it would be character customization options, but that's just me. The only reason I ever play CrimeCraft is the character customization and the PvE element.I would recommend this game, but as I said in my first sentence: only get it if you're not planning to treat it like a massively multiplayer online game, Get friends to play with you and treat it like a LAN game, but not a MMO.Hikumi gives this game, a 5 out of 10.

I saw in other commentaries stuff like that: ""Oh, this game copied everything from APB, it sucks, don't even try it guys, it's ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. Don't trust it, just check CCGW out!CrimeCraft is great dinamic fan shooter, with cool mods. Yes, nowadays it's crisis time for it, but you can check it game out and start playing, so it comes out of it.It has a few minuses: 1) Donation on high levels, it's not needed and lottery (donation stuff) isn't that cool, but many players are used to think it is. 2) Registration on mayngames.com may take you a huge time, but if you want to do it short, pls, add me to friendlist on steam, I finish your registration just for 2-3 minutes. Awesome benefits: 1) Daily and weekly tournaments. 2) Awesome char and weapon customization. 3) Territory Wars 4) Gang Wars. 5) 3 PvE gamemodes 6) Many pvp game modes 7) Classes 8) Custom profiles, you may do with your custom profiles everything you want!! And it's not all, just download it, and check out!			"

												Great game if you can handle annoying people complaining how lottery sets are ""overpowered"" and refuse to change their build to defeat them. Funny I don't see any difference from a level 20 against level 50 and a level 50 against another level 50 with lottery set. As far as I'm concerned I've had to deal with people using better gear my entire time playing.Also, Mayn are complete turds. Don't even think of saying anything bad about someone from their country. If you're from USA you'll get muted for severeal thousand minutes. If your not from USA then you'd get a few slaps on the wrist.They say they don't want you harrassing anyone because of their race, religion, country, etc...

												How can you take such a simple premise and♥♥♥♥♥♥it up so bad?  I mean, wow, seriously, it's just painful to play this.  It's a shame that there is a Christmas achievement here, cause it's not worth the pain in getting through enough games to reach level 8 in order to try for it.When you think free to play, these days it is an attempt to prop up a failure by making cheap gamers want to try it out, get them hooked on the gameplay, then encourage them to obtain the premium content.  Sadly, the gameplay is bad, I'd rather play Counter-strike Source.			"

												Crime Craft, the name says it all. Crafting drugs, modding weapons, killing enemies. Story, quests, cribs, clubs. Like any MMORPG, it can be costly. Crime Craft is nice and balanced so you can fight in tourneys, and still get great loot. Friendly gangs can also help. Custom clothes, designs, materials, paint jobs, it was my Payday years ago :) Hunting crates and playing in events, CC was always fun to do. Blood gushing gibs, drugs to inject, guns to enhance, this is a gang wars life.My rating:Graphics:10Audio:8Fun Factor:9My total rating: 8Side notes:Another Unreal production. When I say that, I mean the Unreal engine. NOT EPIC GAMES. The Unreal engine is getting big from PCs to consoles. It is used in many games from MMOs to RPGs to FPSs. The unreal engine was created in 1998 and was released with the UT GOTY in 1999. In 2000, the game won the award GOTY game of the year and has been known as GOTY since. The amount of customs you can create with the engine is virtualy unlimitted! ut2003 & ut2004 made the engine noticable to many companys such as sierra. (owners of f.e.a.r). Other games that use the UE=unreal engine:Gears of war 1 to 3, Far cry, SWAT 1 to 4, Unreal & UT games, Vanguard(MMORPG), Dino beatdown, Killing Floor, Alien Swarm, BorderLands2, the nightworld, etc.Warning! before buying a Unreal Engine game, do some research!!!! you may be buying a game that you can play for FREE(CMOD) with the Unreal games such as UTGOTY or newer!

												Another aweful attempt at merging the MMO with a shooter. I'm told that the end game is fun, but I am not willing to sit through the torturous start to get there. Besides I fail to see how the end game could be remotely enjoyable when the core gameplay is so bad. Avoid this game.			"

												This game used to be fun and great, but now the game's dead as ♥♥♥♥, it's not even slightly worth playing. All that's left for you to do in this is run through all the lame PvE missions alone to advance, and if you play PvP, all you get are the players that may or may not be hacking, because they're just that ridiculously good at no-lifing the dead game. If the game were more populated (The high point in population is probably around 100 people) it might actually be worth playing. tl;dr It's dying, it's not very fair.10/10 would get quickscoped in 3rd person again			"

												You can download it for the TF2 hat, but I warn you, it will take a good deal of time just to set up the game as you will need to create a CrimeCraft account (it has it's own website) and install more files through it's OWN client. Not to mention it took me nearly 20 minutes in matchmaking just to find a single game. (only 2 matches were enough to get me the hat thankfully); also new players will be at a severe disadvantage due to higher level players being able to kill faster and tank more bullets.P.S. Alt-tabbing will crash the game.			"

												It started out good. Intro played, was fairly well animated, seemed fun.After logging in i pressed the training button because the game told me to and i got the urge to vomit because of how ugly this game was. Then i noticed that my hand was slipping through my gun after switching to first person and immediately i knew this game is going to be bad.I mean i never expected this game would be great, but the intro gave me hope that it would be alright.Anyway i shot some dudes and died a lot, gameplay was generic and boring even for the time, moving on.After i finished the most clumsy tutorial i've seen i pressed buttons and entered the prologue, i then proceeded to skip most of the boring dialog that taught me boring things i already know to do from better games.I then talked to some guy who told me to get oil or something. I then magically teleported onto a cargo freighter and shot a bunch of security guards for some reason.After that i talked to some crack head on the street who gave me a quest and we gunned down some gangsters for a bit, nothing interesting happened.Then the crack head told me to visit my mailbox were i was greeted with more text and i almost feel asleep because of how much they failed at this tutorial.You wanna see a better tutorial you look at Warframe.Watch a cutscene introducing the main bady, pick some guns off a table and kill some dudes while looking at some pretty scenery.Then stuff like crafting gets introduced bit by bit and i was basically getting everything that was going on while being somewhat invested in the story, that said it wasn't a great tutorial and failed to introduce movement properly, but it did a way better job than CrimeCraft.tl;dr If you want a good shooter with MMO elements you play Warframe, if you wanna play a mediocre version of this play The Division , this is an early access game from 2009 and is not worth your time, unless you really want to play The Division.Yes i did play this game for the TF2 hat.

In 2011 it was ugly BleedOut, in 2012 idiotic lottery, but now they completed their work. 4th season of lottery clothes w/o any free analogues, ugly events (more ugly even than earlier) and only one cheap weak server.  Average number of players = 15-40. Sometimes 0, sometimes 42.			"

												The game was great back in the days I've started playing, I had a gang ""1Bullet"" which have been the start of many great fighter. Although the game is fun and there are lots you can do it seems the development has stopped since the playerbase declined over the years and never got back. I recomment this game to everyone who wants a nice fast paced third person shooter - FPS MMORPG game. Let's make Crimecraft great again! All the game needs are players nothing else. My playing hours confirm that.			"

And more telling is the fact that they haven't bothered to update the Steam version to point at the new servers. And that the transition was announced three months ago.

You get classed against people from level 1 that are so far above your rank you can unload 2 clips into them and never even scratch their health. Then they will just turn around shoot you once in the foot and run off while you die. Pathetic♥♥♥♥♥game I have never had this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of match making in my entire life!			"

When i tried to continue playing the game since it would force close itself if i said okay to the missing file notification the game had absolutely nobody else playing. Since nobody was playing i decided to try out practice mode for a bit. The gameplay is pretty fun, however half way through practice it proceeded to think i was a hacker, and kicked me out of a single player match against cpus (Probably because of the missing file thing, but i tried what i could to get the file back if it existed). If the community was still alive I would comment on it but since i cant even play the game much I suppose nothing can be done. It could be a great game if it was fixed up a bit.			"

When i began to play but the game crashes 7-10 times (you can check guides to solve this problem), after that, runs good  (played in a Lanix Neuron A) . In-Game, i was really surprise because the game is good, i join to the practice-mode 3 times to learn controls, then i try play online but no one was online :(By the way, I keep playing in practice-mode to get the level 6 (yes, you can level up in practice-mode) and i got the hat.

												As someone who chops and changes between games a lot and rarely finds a game that holds his attention for longer than an hour, CrimeCraft stood out and I've put 6 hours in over just 2 days!It's very addictive and compelling with a satisfying storyline and dystopian ambience to it.The PvE can feel a bit cheap but is good fun anyway for the most part, and the missions feel satisfying also.The town hubs are seriously nice - great to explore and with a good variety of buildings and scenery.I hear the PvP is pay-to-win and not very good, but I'm actually not big on PvP anyway (even though I know it's the heart of this game, or seems to be) so I can't speak for that.Considering it's free and I have gotten a solid 6 hours out of it so far, I have no hesitation in recommending this, at least if the premise of the game is appealing to you, as it is to me :)			"

												This game is beyond bad. I can't start counting how many annoying things have made me delete this game .Let's try to explain why the game is so utterly unplayable:01 - One of the most annoying , stupid and ridiculous thing that i hate in this game is level design on mission levels. Why why why, there must be invisible wall in middle of the level blocking your ways??????? I can't count how many times i died because of invisible walls in the middle of the map. Yes in the middle!!!!!!! Why is there is beyond me.02 - Stupid customization system exist only to make spend real money for items that have no value whatsoever.03 - Pre made class characters is not customizable. For example if find/buy decent weapon or item you can't use on your pre-made class character and can only be used with custom characters (which suck very badly) 04 - Lacking of any atmosphere in this game (like all multiplayer shooters). City maps is completely useless and only can waste your time and bring you big frustration. Why? I will explain. City feels like just a interactive menu . You need to go to different NPC to take mission/ or buy crafting or other useless items. This however can be done almost instantly via game menu. So , city is pretty much useless. If you want to play mission, just click and chose the map & type of the game and you are good to go. You don't need story, don't need NPC , you don't need to backtrack the boring and very dead atmospheric claustrophobic so called, OPEN WORLD CITY (nothing is open there) .05 - Lack of players . I feel like i was playing single player with very very bad design levels, no story line whatsoever and limited customization.There is tons of more frustration in this game . I barely managed to put 2-3 hours of effort to like this game. But hell no.I strongly suggest: if you like good games, buy decent single player game and just enjoy. This is not single nor multiplayer game. It's complete waste of time.   "

You don't need story, don't need NPC , you don't need to backtrack the boring and very dead atmospheric claustrophobic so called, OPEN WORLD CITY (nothing is open there) .05 - Lack of players . I feel like i was playing single player with very very bad design levels, no story line whatsoever and limited customization.There is tons of more frustration in this game . I barely managed to put 2-3 hours of effort to like this game. But hell no.I strongly suggest: if you like good games, buy decent single player game and just enjoy. This is not single nor multiplayer game. It's complete waste of time.   "

												I didn't play this but Steam says I did. So, uh, I mean... I don't really know what to put here. I saw a reviewer on another game who also didn't play said game so they just put recipes in their review. But that involves googling a recipe and I just... man, I just don't have the patience for that. Look, this game is OBVIOUSLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't play it unless you want to be treated like a child.Also, may I remind you that there's some REALLY good games on sale for under $5? Go play those instead. ^_^			"

												Frustrating as all hell. I don't do PvP so I can not speak to the quality of PvP content so if that is what you're into this review is not for you.As for PvE sometimes my bullets stop doing damage to the enemies until I get into melee range and I get stopped in my tracks by invisible walls very often which makes playing the game extremely frustrating. If you were going in for the PvE like I was turn around and try another game, this one has serious issues.Also in Statistics many PvE missions (Headhunt and Stockpiles) show up as lost battles even though I complete the missions successfully.Radar is completely blank during PvE missions even though the directions clearly state to reference it for important guidance in completing the mission which makes completing the missions near impossible.Stockpile missions need an indicator number of enemies killed/number of enemies to kill to win, I swear I run in circles revisiting the same spots clearing them out and they just respawn again as I circle the map and I never feel like I make any progress and then time runs out and I lose.

												With a custom profile this game is a role playing game, you can choose from tailoring, engineer, gunsmith and chemist, each profession will add to your game play in its own way, but you must choose one. I run it on all high settings and its beautiful, its atmospheric and has a kind of Blade runner feel to the city, with a touch of Arkham city, you can play in third person or first person. I usually drift between the two as I like both. I think the campaign is worth it alone, cool story, feels like a game you would buy. At first its a little hard and may be confusing, but like most role playing games you need to level up, learn the ropes, get better gear etc. I would recommend doing the prologue as it helps you learn, adds to the feel of progressing. I'm really enjoying it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys shooters, story, and roleplaying. You get a lot for free to play. I would use real money in this game just because I like it and would want to support it.			"

												Frustrating as all hell. I don't do PvP so I can not speak to the quality of PvP content so if that is what you're into this review is not for you.As for PvE sometimes my bullets stop doing damage to the enemies until I get into melee range and I get stopped in my tracks by invisible walls very often which makes playing the game extremely frustrating. If you were going in for the PvE like I was turn around and try another game, this one has serious issues.Also in Statistics many PvE missions (Headhunt and Stockpiles) show up as lost battles even though I complete the missions successfully.Radar is completely blank during PvE missions even though the directions clearly state to reference it for important guidance in completing the mission which makes completing the missions near impossible.Stockpile missions need an indicator number of enemies killed/number of enemies to kill to win, I swear I run in circles revisiting the same spots clearing them out and they just respawn again as I circle the map and I never feel like I make any progress and then time runs out and I lose.

												I've been playing CrimeCraft since Bleedout off and on again. You can use your own Custom profile (character you created when beginning the game) as well as character classes (presets). Some examples would be Soldier, Chaingunner etc. You can also craft various items from clothing to weapons. There are many things to keep you busy while you're out of battle. You can create a gang as well as create a Hangout (decorating and upgrading). You can also visit other gang hangouts and explore or simply join someone elses gang. There is PvP, PvE and tournaments (16 game modes I believe). I really enjoy this game you can go in solo or with a team.			"

												Not bad, not as good as it could be. Don't be decieved by it being ""free to play"". If you want to enjoy this game you'll have to shell out at least a little money, or do those surveys for credits. The campaign is paid for, but it's okay. Story isn't very good, but the missions are fairly unique and fun. Graphics are decent, there are a few unique elements. Basically the combat in this, is how APB should have been. And APB has the free roam that this should have had. The cash shop is pretty cheap, the community is small, PVP is pretty easy. The game severely lacks in tutorials however, it's very confusing whether your ability is meant to heal you or buff your health for example. And the class system was changed around when I stopped playing, so it might have improved or worsened at this point. It's a pretty okay game, it doesn't do anything amazingly, a few thing were very poorly executed. Crafting for example, was horrible. 6.8/10			"

												Exactly like the normal fast-paced fps(blacklight,AVA,CoD), except without the defining thing that makes it seperate. It is definitely worth playing through the prolouge though, for it's singleplayer and storyline that most fps's lack. There is a distinctive class system, but you can't customize any of them except the soldier at the character creation sreen. You can buy a custom class, but it will have mismatched gear and only one ability unless you are willing to pay money. Overall, a good game, VERY average with no distinctive qualities and class systems, but worth playing for it's singleplayer.			"

												This is a loaded question.  I believe the game is fun and full of potential.  However I would only play it if you have a computer that can competently handle it without lag, or else die frustratingly due to the lag that tends to plague even the solo play.  Summary:   YES if you have a good computer, NO if you don't.  Either way its still worth it even if its just for the free hat.			"

												This game has immense amounts of potential.  It has pve, story based modes, pve game modes, pvp modes with many maps and game types.  However, due to the lack of moderation on this game it is sadly engulfed with players that cheat.  These players get away with it, and brag about it in game chat, plus they sell the cheats from in game chat!!!  There is a report cheat function include with the game, but as no one appears to take any notice of this, sadly, the cheating players rule the game.  The tournaments are alway won by the ""pro"" (cheating) teams, and the Territory Wars, 3 times a week are also usually won by the gangs that cheat.I would love to rate this game highly, as it has a huge amount of content, but until it is run properly, it is just a place where people can showcase their latest cheat hacks.If more clean players would join this game (and not be put off by the idiots allowing their computers to do all the work for them) then this game would be fantastic.The only thing letting it down is the ""pay to play"" aspect and the majority of players using cheat codes to play for them.As a game, with its content and playability - I would recommend highly, as a game full of people using cheats and bypassing the terrible xtrap cheat detection (it kicks you for using fraps to capture cheaters but does not kick the people using cheats!!) I have to say, unless you are willing to be frustrated on a frequent basis, this game is one to be avoided.Gamewise, it is excellent.  Management-wise, it leaves a lot to be desired and it is very clear that the current developers of this game are only there to make money from the pay to play players.I am very surprised to see this game available via Steam as I am aware of the dim view that Steam take on cheats and hackers.  I am very annoyed that I found this game via Steam and have been subjected to the verbal abuse, rascial abuse and blatant cheating that is prominent in this game.If you want to change this - join the game, join a clean gang (to my knowledge, there is only one!) and keep sending report tickets about the cheating etc...I refuse to allow such a great game to be demolished by 12 year old children cheating and being abusive!!  Join me in my quest to get this game back on track!!			"

The game has a nice RPG element with a new First Person mode; although I still prefer the original 3rd person mode, you can switch between them anytime. The game has some decent crafting also and some pve/pvp elements. If you enjoy PVP oriented games then this one is worth checking out; although don't expect much from the community.			"

												This game is a poorly designed third person shooter,with snowballs that act as lethal grenades to symbolise that winter is a deadly season,and 4 player models to represent the number of developers involved.A third person shooter with crime in the name is just bad to start with, and with a poor design, it truly deserves the 0/10 that many reviews have given. Also, with the ever increasing number of players, almost reaching into double figures, this game is full of high action multiplayer and by high action i mean waiting 15 seconds to spawn, only to get killed just as you do.Same goes for allies. There's no way to play it with your friends, or anyone you met in the game. Even though the game is free2play, it coincides along with some other free2play games which are known as free2play, pay2win games. This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is what I like to call, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game.Tl;dr: CANCER			"

												This is one of the worst games I've ever played. There was no tutorial to teach you how to play properly, you are thrown into the fray with almost nothing to use. The only ones who win are those who spend actual money to buy upgrades, and that ruins the experience for everyone else. It's only redeeming quality is that if you go through hours of tedious and annoying gameplay, you recieve an unlockable hat to use in Team Fortress 2. Why this is so highly regarded I'll never know, but please, don't waste your time on this game.			"

I was hoping to be able to customize my own thug, fight in large open spaces with multiple weapons and more but no; you can't customize your character AT ALL without paying, you can toggle barely visible things like warpaint and choose between (if I remember correctly) 2 weapons depending on your class and pay for more. Nothing is possible as a free player and even if you do spend money on it, the gameplay is not worth it, it's not even fun. It's hyped as some post apocalyptic scene where gangs fight to gain control of certain places when in reality you're just capturing points or fighting other players on a very limited amount of maps.

												omg stupid as hell.  F1 is the fire key.  You have to take your fingers off the movement keys to fire snowballs.  You can't r-click fire snowballs like a weapon, even though it's your only weapon.  So, you move up to the enemy.  Locate him, and then sit there for 1 second while you find the fire key??? omg ultra mega stupid.  More turn based slow then FPS.			"

												i love this game. simple. it did take me about 30 minutes to try to login in and i though that would be it. another game i couldnt get to start. but, i did and im glad i put that effort in. heres a simple run down of my viewpoint:the graphics may be a bit old but, i never really cared about that.the gameplay is fun and fast-paced, it reminds me alot of Gotham City Imposters, but the gameplay, especially with the iron sights is a bit unfinished. im not a fan of the way it is but, its still fun.the prolouge takes forever, thats good and bad. bad for reasons i dont need to explain, but good because in the 2 hours or so it took me i leveled up to 13 and had 34000 in-game money and i've seen alot of other reviews with them hating it for it being pay-to-win. but it isnt if you put the effort and time in.also, i havent meet another player yet so im assuming they dont exist. but it would probably be a much better game with more people and friends.so is it worth playing? yes. is it worth paying for? no. i wouldnt spend money on it, but maybe the next lazy person who skips the prolouge will.

												When I first played the game, it seemed fun!  Of course it took a bit of time to get into matchmaking.  I liked the feel of the game in regards to personalization (character appearance options from the black market) and heavily got into it shortly after.  Played it for about year before giving up on it.  Below is what I listed as stuff i noticed both positive and negative...+ The feel of the game seems right.  Though the story and play of the game seems more like tactical squad fighting with all the armaments available to the toons, but when your actually in the game, it does have its feel of gang fighting to some extent (more than most other games).  However, it is hard to imagine that this is a gang instead of rogue militia....-  They push hard at players to pay.  This doesn't help bring in new clientelle (bad spelling I know).  As with most fps games, many say that it is a p2w kind of game.  In essence, this can be so.  But I believe a good player (and I wasn't one of them btw) can overcome that aspect.-  Focus is on selling better items w/ real money rather than earning them in game.  Instead they could have incorporated a ""relic"" kind of system where people can spend real life money on something that allows them to carry ""relics"" (ie:  those really nice items) and making them earn them in game.-  Never like a game that most of the population focuses or rather shows up for tournaments as that is where the more valuable items can be eventually achieved.  This system is flawed as the better players get better because of better equipment and the bad players get worse because of their inability to keep up!  This usually results in the same teams winning over and over and over.....+  although they could add a slew more appearance options to players, I did like what they had.  Having more options would help keep it unique for players.-  hit boxes were not the same between female and male characters.  females were skinnier and theirfore harder to hit because the hit boxes were also skinnier.-  the drug system seems flawed too.  with the way it was (before I left), there were no real penalties of the drugs during the ""off"" times.  Using the drugs should have a temporary boost when needed/wanted, but should have had a penalty when they wore off.  Anyway, I think they could have done a lot more with this aspect of the game.+  the game definitely has/had promise.  Lots of ideas that can be utilized, created, and so on.  However, they need to get on it and create more pve content as well as more maps and so on.  The need to keep coming up with new stuff and in that area they tend to create or change things most of the time.-  the money aspect of the game is difficult.  I am not really sure I like this or not.  Classes that you buy and upgrade eventually become expensive to maintain (so to speak).  From level one to level 7 of the classes (f2p players), players will make a lot from the lower levels to making zero when you reach around level 7.  If you upgrade the classes higher than level 7, you are now spending banked money in addition to your earnings from that match to play that level class.  Also, classes are not built by popular builds.  Rather they are built to make your life difficult for the most part.  So you have to adjust to the class.  Be better if you made your own build.  which leads to the next....below+/-/-/-  you can build your own toon using whatever skills, weapons, and clothing options.  However, the clothing (appearance) options suck and generally all look relatively the same.  But they boost skills and help with resistences and so on.  So, unless you are willing to spend real life money on appearance for the clothes, you will have to settle for the crappy looking ones that you can get.  And sadly, if you do spend real life money on those clothes, once the clothes lose their durability (which goes lower and lower every time you repair it), you lose the appearance as well.  This part I really didn't like.  In addition, buying stuff on the market (from other players) is highly expensive.  And since your clothes lose durability, you will be coming back to get more.  This in effect will make you struggle for money repeatedly unless you are one of the great/pro players of the game....-  Big minus here.  Unless you are a pro/great player, this game will be a struggle wether you are a subscriber or not.  You will often find that you have to ask for help.  And exploring different pathways or building multiple builds will be frustrating as hell due to expenses.  If you manage to get ahead in the later game equipment, it will be through those that are pro players or through pve players.-  and lastly, they basically have 4 forms of pve.  one is headhunt where you find the boss and kill him.  Another is stockpile where you find mats, ingredients, and so forth.  Another is protecting a crate or crates from oncoming hoards of enemies (which can be fun on the harder modes).  And lastly is the storymode of the game.  Which I am sure they still haven't added any new content on it.  Also, you either need to be a subscriber, or you must pay to get beyond the intro of the story....As you can tell, there is a lot of negatives that I metioned on the game.  When I first played it, it was really interesting.  However, after about a year of playing it, I realized a lot of the above.  In addition, the player base diminished as well as time went on (about as bad as 30 players at most on the US server...and I would be amazed if they still have that server up and going...).Overall, I would definitely not recommend this game.  There are better fps type of games out there that are also struggling.  Mostly think the genre is dying due to pro players outweighing the average players or even the poor players.  Making a fair game for fps is difficult when you try and incorporate material from outside the fighting..  And until something is figured out with that, don't think any fps f2p game will ever hit the big time....			"

												While the game was a ton of fun back in the day. It's mostly filled with wallet warriors now. As each player can purchase more and more gold bars as they make them cheaper and cheaper trying to suck the last few drops from this once loyal community. There used to be 4 servers, now it is down to 1 global server, resulting in high pings and poorer fight mechanics. A remake or sequal would be great but at this time there is less than 40 people who play this game on a day to day basis. It has  had a great PVP-MMO element that you will be hard pressed to find anywhere else.			"

												This game used to be good... I really liked it back then... but now there are rarely any players, and the only players that do play are pay2win/high leveled players... it had some really good potential but due to the lack of players... it's drawn back... I am sorry, I really like this game but it's population went downhill.and the title is a little misleading... ""Crimecraft"" yet there are only four proffessions, chemist, gunsmith and whatever the other two are... and if you actually wanna craft any of the good stuff you have to do a lot of continous crafting and buying♥♥♥♥♥♥off the auction to get the stuff you want... honestly, the only thing that's good for crafting is the proffession that makes bullets, with that you don't have to worry about losing ammo... if you plan to work on your custom character then the classes.The pay2win on this is so bad, this game tries to force you into paying, everywhere you go... it tries every attempt to nickel your money.Other then that... the gameplay is suprisingly good, but like I said... I am afraid the game is just drawn back because of the community.			"

												i love this game. simple. it did take me about 30 minutes to try to login in and i though that would be it. another game i couldnt get to start. but, i did and im glad i put that effort in. heres a simple run down of my viewpoint:the graphics may be a bit old but, i never really cared about that.the gameplay is fun and fast-paced, it reminds me alot of Gotham City Imposters, but the gameplay, especially with the iron sights is a bit unfinished. im not a fan of the way it is but, its still fun.the prolouge takes forever, thats good and bad. bad for reasons i dont need to explain, but good because in the 2 hours or so it took me i leveled up to 13 and had 34000 in-game money and i've seen alot of other reviews with them hating it for it being pay-to-win. but it isnt if you put the effort and time in.also, i havent meet another player yet so im assuming they dont exist. but it would probably be a much better game with more people and friends.so is it worth playing? yes. is it worth paying for? no. i wouldnt spend money on it, but maybe the next lazy person who skips the prolouge will.

												While this game seems fun at first the queuing for a game is iffyThe recoil movements of most guns are way too strong.The AI in matches is way to good at aiming making it hard for new palyers to get used to the game.The matchmaking puts new players against already well experienced ones.Not very good unless you like an insanely high learning curve.

												This game was glorious in it's earlier days, and still has the potential to be a great game. But the only way I can recommend this game now is if the following things happen:1) P2W store (aka ""Black Market"") is removed. They should at least remove all the combat related gear anyways. The game has a great crafting system, auction house, and tournament reward system... the P2W store takes from all the good these things bring.2) There should be active moderators / dev team to address forum questions, enhance current game content, etc., and for the seldom times someone is blatantly hacking.

												This is a loaded question.  I believe the game is fun and full of potential.  However I would only play it if you have a computer that can competently handle it without lag, or else die frustratingly due to the lag that tends to plague even the solo play.  Summary:   YES if you have a good computer, NO if you don't.  Either way its still worth it even if its just for the free hat.			"

												This game has immense amounts of potential.  It has pve, story based modes, pve game modes, pvp modes with many maps and game types.  However, due to the lack of moderation on this game it is sadly engulfed with players that cheat.  These players get away with it, and brag about it in game chat, plus they sell the cheats from in game chat!!!  There is a report cheat function include with the game, but as no one appears to take any notice of this, sadly, the cheating players rule the game.  The tournaments are alway won by the ""pro"" (cheating) teams, and the Territory Wars, 3 times a week are also usually won by the gangs that cheat.I would love to rate this game highly, as it has a huge amount of content, but until it is run properly, it is just a place where people can showcase their latest cheat hacks.If more clean players would join this game (and not be put off by the idiots allowing their computers to do all the work for them) then this game would be fantastic.The only thing letting it down is the ""pay to play"" aspect and the majority of players using cheat codes to play for them.As a game, with its content and playability - I would recommend highly, as a game full of people using cheats and bypassing the terrible xtrap cheat detection (it kicks you for using fraps to capture cheaters but does not kick the people using cheats!!) I have to say, unless you are willing to be frustrated on a frequent basis, this game is one to be avoided.Gamewise, it is excellent.  Management-wise, it leaves a lot to be desired and it is very clear that the current developers of this game are only there to make money from the pay to play players.I am very surprised to see this game available via Steam as I am aware of the dim view that Steam take on cheats and hackers.  I am very annoyed that I found this game via Steam and have been subjected to the verbal abuse, rascial abuse and blatant cheating that is prominent in this game.If you want to change this - join the game, join a clean gang (to my knowledge, there is only one!) and keep sending report tickets about the cheating etc...I refuse to allow such a great game to be demolished by 12 year old children cheating and being abusive!!  Join me in my quest to get this game back on track!!			"

												I tried going back to this game after installing it ages ago. I couldn't get it to start or connect to the servers. It didn't even appear to be on Steam any more. Now it's back. It was a below average game  then and it probably is now. Just as well it's free to play because spending money on it would be a total rip off. Don't bother with this piece of crap there are better free to play games around.			"

Spent way too much time trying to change graphics settings while getting 1FPS, had to restart game for settings to take effect. Relaunched game, it asks for a login. I create an account, relaunch game, and log in. And what I see is... Two servers, both full. I quit the game and haven't touched it since. Maybe it's a good game, maybe not, but I'm not gonna wait around for a free spot in the server to find out. At least it was free.			"

												Don't get your hopes up too much. This isn't a great game, but it does have it's moments. Worth trying.My first few hours were severly limited by bugs during their launch on Steam. I believe these have been fixed now. There was a serious problem with server capacity, but this problem seems to have been lessened lately and they have announced new servers coming.Even though a server realm shows up as ""full"" it's still hard to get a match/instance going. Meaning, disproporsion between game world and server capacity. It's really a shame.The game has pretty poor graphic at times, but the atmosphere is quite nice. Menu UI is kinda poor. 3rd person view takes a little time to get used to. Music is so-so.You can play versus AI or other players. The introductory missions are all versus AI, and it shows early how poor that AI is. They also spawn in the middle of your face like crazy. It's quite sad. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried PvP mode, however. It was quite challenging.			"

												This game has immense amounts of potential.  It has pve, story based modes, pve game modes, pvp modes with many maps and game types.  However, due to the lack of moderation on this game it is sadly engulfed with players that cheat.  These players get away with it, and brag about it in game chat, plus they sell the cheats from in game chat!!!  There is a report cheat function include with the game, but as no one appears to take any notice of this, sadly, the cheating players rule the game.  The tournaments are alway won by the ""pro"" (cheating) teams, and the Territory Wars, 3 times a week are also usually won by the gangs that cheat.I would love to rate this game highly, as it has a huge amount of content, but until it is run properly, it is just a place where people can showcase their latest cheat hacks.If more clean players would join this game (and not be put off by the idiots allowing their computers to do all the work for them) then this game would be fantastic.The only thing letting it down is the ""pay to play"" aspect and the majority of players using cheat codes to play for them.As a game, with its content and playability - I would recommend highly, as a game full of people using cheats and bypassing the terrible xtrap cheat detection (it kicks you for using fraps to capture cheaters but does not kick the people using cheats!!) I have to say, unless you are willing to be frustrated on a frequent basis, this game is one to be avoided.Gamewise, it is excellent.  Management-wise, it leaves a lot to be desired and it is very clear that the current developers of this game are only there to make money from the pay to play players.I am very surprised to see this game available via Steam as I am aware of the dim view that Steam take on cheats and hackers.  I am very annoyed that I found this game via Steam and have been subjected to the verbal abuse, rascial abuse and blatant cheating that is prominent in this game.If you want to change this - join the game, join a clean gang (to my knowledge, there is only one!) and keep sending report tickets about the cheating etc...I refuse to allow such a great game to be demolished by 12 year old children cheating and being abusive!!  Join me in my quest to get this game back on track!!			"

												Was a great game for the time I played a couple years ago. It had some pay-to-win issues and some other stupid things which made me stop playing. I wish I would have stayed with it, but at the same time there are better games out there now. I would love to get back into this if the playerbase ever increases.			"

												While this game seems fun at first the queuing for a game is iffyThe recoil movements of most guns are way too strong.The AI in matches is way to good at aiming making it hard for new palyers to get used to the game.The matchmaking puts new players against already well experienced ones.Not very good unless you like an insanely high learning curve.

												When I first played the game, it seemed fun!  Of course it took a bit of time to get into matchmaking.  I liked the feel of the game in regards to personalization (character appearance options from the black market) and heavily got into it shortly after.  Played it for about year before giving up on it.  Below is what I listed as stuff i noticed both positive and negative...+ The feel of the game seems right.  Though the story and play of the game seems more like tactical squad fighting with all the armaments available to the toons, but when your actually in the game, it does have its feel of gang fighting to some extent (more than most other games).  However, it is hard to imagine that this is a gang instead of rogue militia....-  They push hard at players to pay.  This doesn't help bring in new clientelle (bad spelling I know).  As with most fps games, many say that it is a p2w kind of game.  In essence, this can be so.  But I believe a good player (and I wasn't one of them btw) can overcome that aspect.-  Focus is on selling better items w/ real money rather than earning them in game.  Instead they could have incorporated a ""relic"" kind of system where people can spend real life money on something that allows them to carry ""relics"" (ie:  those really nice items) and making them earn them in game.-  Never like a game that most of the population focuses or rather shows up for tournaments as that is where the more valuable items can be eventually achieved.  This system is flawed as the better players get better because of better equipment and the bad players get worse because of their inability to keep up!  This usually results in the same teams winning over and over and over.....+  although they could add a slew more appearance options to players, I did like what they had.  Having more options would help keep it unique for players.-  hit boxes were not the same between female and male characters.  females were skinnier and theirfore harder to hit because the hit boxes were also skinnier.-  the drug system seems flawed too.  with the way it was (before I left), there were no real penalties of the drugs during the ""off"" times.  Using the drugs should have a temporary boost when needed/wanted, but should have had a penalty when they wore off.  Anyway, I think they could have done a lot more with this aspect of the game.+  the game definitely has/had promise.  Lots of ideas that can be utilized, created, and so on.  However, they need to get on it and create more pve content as well as more maps and so on.  The need to keep coming up with new stuff and in that area they tend to create or change things most of the time.-  the money aspect of the game is difficult.  I am not really sure I like this or not.  Classes that you buy and upgrade eventually become expensive to maintain (so to speak).  From level one to level 7 of the classes (f2p players), players will make a lot from the lower levels to making zero when you reach around level 7.  If you upgrade the classes higher than level 7, you are now spending banked money in addition to your earnings from that match to play that level class.  Also, classes are not built by popular builds.  Rather they are built to make your life difficult for the most part.  So you have to adjust to the class.  Be better if you made your own build.  which leads to the next....below+/-/-/-  you can build your own toon using whatever skills, weapons, and clothing options.  However, the clothing (appearance) options suck and generally all look relatively the same.  But they boost skills and help with resistences and so on.  So, unless you are willing to spend real life money on appearance for the clothes, you will have to settle for the crappy looking ones that you can get.  And sadly, if you do spend real life money on those clothes, once the clothes lose their durability (which goes lower and lower every time you repair it), you lose the appearance as well.  This part I really didn't like.  In addition, buying stuff on the market (from other players) is highly expensive.  And since your clothes lose durability, you will be coming back to get more.  This in effect will make you struggle for money repeatedly unless you are one of the great/pro players of the game....-  Big minus here.  Unless you are a pro/great player, this game will be a struggle wether you are a subscriber or not.  You will often find that you have to ask for help.  And exploring different pathways or building multiple builds will be frustrating as hell due to expenses.  If you manage to get ahead in the later game equipment, it will be through those that are pro players or through pve players.-  and lastly, they basically have 4 forms of pve.  one is headhunt where you find the boss and kill him.  Another is stockpile where you find mats, ingredients, and so forth.  Another is protecting a crate or crates from oncoming hoards of enemies (which can be fun on the harder modes).  And lastly is the storymode of the game.  Which I am sure they still haven't added any new content on it.  Also, you either need to be a subscriber, or you must pay to get beyond the intro of the story....As you can tell, there is a lot of negatives that I metioned on the game.  When I first played it, it was really interesting.  However, after about a year of playing it, I realized a lot of the above.  In addition, the player base diminished as well as time went on (about as bad as 30 players at most on the US server...and I would be amazed if they still have that server up and going...).Overall, I would definitely not recommend this game.  There are better fps type of games out there that are also struggling.  Mostly think the genre is dying due to pro players outweighing the average players or even the poor players.  Making a fair game for fps is difficult when you try and incorporate material from outside the fighting..  And until something is figured out with that, don't think any fps f2p game will ever hit the big time....			"

												Did enjoy this game once upon a time quite a bit. Later on they did some bad decisions with some rebalancing or streamlining stuff, made premium currency expire so whatever you bought had to be used or be lost anyway. In addition this game does not even run on Windows 10 due to X-trap. There are some third party fixes but some links you can find are dead links and some lead into sites that require registrations etc. Most likely the game can be rigged to run on Win 10 but since this known issue is not something the devs even plan to fix it is a strong indicator that you shouldn't bother either.

												Played Crim since the beginning of the output Bleedout if memory serves me correctly it was the year 2010 was 1 region with 4 servers and then shared on the US and EU due to high online ruskoyazychnyh community passed to EU cluster on each cluster was 2 server by using all were scored under the string, I remember those days when you had to wait in a line that would go to the server it was a golden time! Was cheap Donat who did not enter dizbalans the game in 2012 to replace Bleedout came update Gangwars with sets of tournament coins territory of gangs and stuff, after 1 month of games on a new update online began to gradually decline was seen in the compound 2 server by using on clusters well and it did not help to support the games, in 2015 released the epic sets and weapons because of what was a wild dizbalans between players is finally drove the game to the grave, extra online all fell and fell and the management of the game, it was decided to bridge the two US and EU cluster 1 cluster where the maximum online is 80-120 people. killed game			"

												Don't get your hopes up too much. This isn't a great game, but it does have it's moments. Worth trying.My first few hours were severly limited by bugs during their launch on Steam. I believe these have been fixed now. There was a serious problem with server capacity, but this problem seems to have been lessened lately and they have announced new servers coming.Even though a server realm shows up as ""full"" it's still hard to get a match/instance going. Meaning, disproporsion between game world and server capacity. It's really a shame.The game has pretty poor graphic at times, but the atmosphere is quite nice. Menu UI is kinda poor. 3rd person view takes a little time to get used to. Music is so-so.You can play versus AI or other players. The introductory missions are all versus AI, and it shows early how poor that AI is. They also spawn in the middle of your face like crazy. It's quite sad. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried PvP mode, however. It was quite challenging.			"

												The controls are bad and its not even an mmo. its literally just call of duty. the mouse speed is horrible, i can't even turn my character around in time to shoot at someone. if this game was a big high budget game, then you guys wasted a lot of money.			"

												Ok this game is not that bad the popularity is still good but not as good as it was before the gameplay is pretty good though but i have 2 problems with this game 1: When i'm just about to finish this pacific mission it always says "" lost connection to server "" or "" Lost connection to server Hack detected "" 2: The  A.I in missions spawn out of no where like i'm just walking and an enemy spawns right in front of me but apart from those two parblems its still a good game and i recomened it.

												The tags have it wrong this is not an rpg. Not a real RPG. This is closer to a MOBA, or something like DOTA 2 than an authentic RPG. No wonder I stopped playing before I really started. I was tricked.			"

												I love this game, so much so that i still play it time to time, people can talk about how bad the game is, but the game it self is amazing, good story, good game play, lots to do.There could be more updates but for this game to be amazing as i once was, it really really needs players to download and give it a go.

												Holy... This game.... I don't know how to begin.. it's just so.. aagh.. Dis gem mek mi hed hurt.You need to reach level 3 to be able to choose what kind of game you want to join... In case that didn't sound ridiculous enough: Believe it or not, you also need to be level 4 in order to access your friends list. You can't play with friends, until you've leveled until level 4 on your own. Also, after a buddy and I finally reached level 4 we added each other to our friends lists but couldn't find the requests anywhere. We've really tried, we looked everywhere we could think of... there's apparently no place that lets you accept your friend requests, or this game is just too smart for us. Also the bubbles telling you to buy new classes and spend all your hard earned cash on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you might end up never ever actually using are in front of half the rest of the menu, making it unclickable. You have to enter the last segment of the menu in order to be able to click any of the rest. That is great menu design! So you don't only have to unlock the friendslist and then figure out how to actually use it: You also have to figure out how to even click on it in the first place! Overall, the menu is so horrible, it's harder to understand than the game itself. It also told me to level up my classes without saying anything about what that is supposed to be good for... That starts out pretty cheap, but it gets very expensive very fast and I honestly haven't noticed any changes after leveling one class up a bit. To be fair, I did only level it up 2 times or so, it might get noticable at highter levels only, no clue. The gameplay actually wasn't too bad, but there's so many free to play shooters out there, most of them play pretty much exactly the same - usually better -, I really don't see why anyone would choose this out of all the options... Oh, you also can't jump. Spacebar is a dodge roll, which is actually a pretty neat feature, but really confusing if you're used to jumping. Changing weapons doesn't work with 1 and 2, but only with the mouse wheel and you throw a granade with F1, even though G, F, E, Q and all of the other buttons that would be so much more comfortable to press are unused. I really don't know what was going on in their minds when they layed out those controls..  I really don't know what was going on in their minds when they made any of this. Just.. why? But it gave me a free Team Fortress 2 hat, so best game 10/10, made me look fab and all my friends be jelly. 👍			"

												You'll love the mixture of a third-person shooter and RPG. This isn't just about shooting, but there's profession (class) to choose from (Gunsmith, Tailor, Engineer, Chemist). Each are then later separated into other two advanced profession.Another highlight is the ability to customise your weapons! You can give attachments, better magazines to your rifle and even give a camo-skin for it! There's lots of game modes and maps to choose from; the ACD (Assault, Capture, Defend), Deathmatch, CTF, Robbery, Riot, Stockpile and more. You will also be able to set three active skills every battle. Skills are the ones that can totally change the table in the match. So be careful to set them wisely before starting the match!The other great thing is being a Gang, mix with other players. So start building your gang, gain your reputation and create your own hideout. Have fun! :)			"

												Did enjoy this game once upon a time quite a bit. Later on they did some bad decisions with some rebalancing or streamlining stuff, made premium currency expire so whatever you bought had to be used or be lost anyway. In addition this game does not even run on Windows 10 due to X-trap. There are some third party fixes but some links you can find are dead links and some lead into sites that require registrations etc. Most likely the game can be rigged to run on Win 10 but since this known issue is not something the devs even plan to fix it is a strong indicator that you shouldn't bother either.
